00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is KOTORadio, episode 322, for August 13th, 2018.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,920
Hello everybody, and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

3
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,840
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

4
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,440
This episode is brought to you by our two great sponsors, Linux Academy and Digital

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
Ocean.

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,400
I'll tell you more about those great sponsors as this year's show goes on.

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Why me?

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Thanks for asking.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,240
My name is Chris, but more importantly is that podcasting ninja, that wizard of the

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,200
cute, that man in Florida, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,080
Hello Mike.

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Hello Chris.

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
What are we doing over there?

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,200
Are we opening one up at the start of the show?

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,240
We're opening one up.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,920
The drink of the show today is a Sweetwater Tropical Lover, Berliner Weissbier, out of

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
Florida.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,680
You know, I'm repping in my new home state.

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Yeah.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,440
It sounds like a nice summer beverage too, I gotta be honest with you.

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Good call on that.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,800
It's always summer in Florida, and in the summer you basically feel like you're in downtown

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Fallujah.

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
So, you know.

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Yeah, that's probably it.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,120
Well then, I guess there's even more reason to drink, Mr. Dominic.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,960
Now I have been looking forward to today's episode since we got off the air last week,

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,720
because we've been following along on your cute journey, and it's been generating quite

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,640
a bit of interest from the audience.

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,560
So we're gonna be doing an update today on that, as well as covering a bunch of feedback,

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,360
talk a little Google AMP, talk a little LGPL, and we've got a tool of the week.

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,920
It's like a fully rounded out diet, like, you know, like a fully recommended breakfast

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,940
when you're eating your cereal, you know, you have to have your orange juice too.

34
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,280
It's like a fully recommended podcast diet.

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,320
Hmm, someone's been listening to ATP.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Is that where I got that from?

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,560
Yeah, that's where you got that from.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
I was trying, I was thinking about that when I said that, where has somebody been talking

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
about cereal recently?

40
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
For 20 minutes.

41
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
What?

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,840
Okay, well, let's not do that, because I know that got on my mind, and then I started wanting

43
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,020
cereal, and I don't even know where it got in there from.

44
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,240
It's been the weirdest thing, so maybe that's why I got so sick.

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,480
Anyways, we won't get into that.

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
We don't want to talk about that.

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,960
Let's talk about some of the feedback we got.

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Go ahead.

49
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
Read it out.

50
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,720
Qt got people thinking, and this one came in from Johnny, and it's not for him.

51
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,360
He says, hey guys, he says, hey guys, he says, I'm not a fan of Qt at all.

52
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,680
It's a very complex system for simple UIs.

53
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,840
It just has never fit my needs, I guess.

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,720
Now if I was a C++ programmer, I may use it, but because of the licensing, I'd probably

55
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,080
shy away from it for anything that's commercial just because of that strange licensing.

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,880
I'd probably end up going towards WX widgets if I was forced to use C++.

57
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,160
However, I am a C programmer, so I used a library called IUP.

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
Check it out when you have a chance.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,480
It's simple and clean and allows you to describe windows in a simple file format that can then

60
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
be loaded.

61
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,080
There are even Lua bindings, which I also like.

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,560
In my humble opinion, for quick UIs, IUP, or up, IUP, whatever it is, has really been

63
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
good to me.

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,720
Now, I would like to say that Qt would be the way to go for teams of programmers that

65
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,940
are working on large projects.

66
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,100
Just my two cents.

67
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,320
Really been enjoying the topics.

68
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,440
Really been interested in me.

69
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,680
Keep up the good work, guys.

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,840
Now don't say anything, because we have more.

71
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,120
Because then Gary kind of comes in, not to interrupt, but I want you to hear this part

72
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
too.

73
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Gary comes in with the other side.

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,320
He says, I liked the discussion around Qt and Qt Creator.

75
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,520
I like Qt quite a bit, but I don't love Qt Creator itself.

76
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,520
I don't really work in GUI, so I have no visual artistic talent to begin with, and I'm terrible

77
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
at it.

78
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
My GUIs make the 80s look good.

79
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,600
But the keyboard shortcuts blow away Visual Studio.

80
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,520
I work on projects where there's three to four million lines of code, and I do it all

81
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
mainly on Linux.

82
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,560
And the way I make it work is ZLinux and Windows.

83
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,360
And I have to use Visual Studio.

84
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,120
I'll just use remote desktop.

85
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,680
I used to like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, but it seems like it's become clunkier

86
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,520
and larger since it launched.

87
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,120
So I like the Qt, but not so much the Qt Creator.

88
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Gary.

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
So there you go.

90
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,140
You got Johnny, who doesn't like Qt, and you got Gary, who does like Qt.

91
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,420
And I find that whole thing to be kind of funny.

92
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,400
Just like typical audience response, you have one group that really likes something, and

93
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,780
the other group that doesn't.

94
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,980
But there has been a general level of interest here that I think is pretty big.

95
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,000
And Eric, our last one, and then I'll let you jump in here.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Eric writes in, he says, I wanted to let you guys know that I came across a QML library

97
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,120
for.NET.

98
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,560
It's still in early development.

99
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,080
I don't have any experience with it, so I don't know if it's a good idea or not, but

100
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,480
I thought you might just find it useful.

101
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,560
And then he links us to the GitHub project, qml.net.

102
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,440
That does sound kind of interesting.

103
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,240
So there you go.

104
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,000
That is sort of my slam through of the general temperature of the Qt feedback.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,240
What do you think, Mr. Wizard, Mr. Florida Wizard?

106
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
I love it.

107
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,360
And I've summoned a storm just to show my enthusiasm.

108
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Is that what that is?

109
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Wow.

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,700
That gives a lot of rain.

111
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,920
So yeah, I mean, we got a lot of feedback on Qt.

112
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,600
A lot of people are interested in it.

113
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,120
Today's episode is going to be largely on Qt.

114
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,400
But I did not know, particularly Eric's feedback, how many different bindings there are for

115
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
QML.

116
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
Obviously, he found.NET.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
There's Python.

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,680
I even thought I found a Java binding.

119
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,360
There's just a lot of ways to, I guess, use Qt without actually having to use C++.

120
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,440
Yeah, the.NET one surprised me.

121
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
I mean, not that much.

122
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,600
None of these things surprised me that much, but it didn't come up in our conversation.

123
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
I hadn't gone looking for it.

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,520
So it was nice for Eric to send that in.

125
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm pretty excited by the potential.

126
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,360
I think there's a lot there to it.

127
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
I don't know.

128
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,520
Maybe you'll change my tune as we get into the show here.

129
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,240
But yeah, I had a story that was submitted into the show that I wanted to chat with you

130
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,320
just as a general hoopla before we really get into the rest of the show.

131
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,920
There is a post over on rockstarcoders.com, which already kind of triggers me.

132
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,040
I can't help it.

133
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
And the post goes something a little bit like this.

134
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,400
I've got egg on my face with no fewer than three articles and three YouTube videos bragging

135
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,400
about how great my design work has been lately to get a 500% improvement in our conversion

136
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
rate.

137
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,760
And now I've gone and lost a huge chunk of that improvement with some recent changes.

138
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,460
Let's talk about Google AMP.

139
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,800
AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages.

140
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,000
It's a technology Google originally introduced to get web developers to speed up their web

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,760
pages for mobile devices and mobile networks.

142
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,680
But in many ways, it seems like a great technology for any device or network who doesn't want

143
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,960
fast websites.

144
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,040
Everyone does.

145
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,960
There's nothing that's all that magical about it.

146
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,720
A big part of the performance boost is simply its standards.

147
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:58,160
No JavaScript, all inline CSS, and the CSS can only measure 500 kilobytes or less.

148
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,480
You're going to make any page load faster with those requirements.

149
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,260
But Google AMP also hosts the AMP pages from their own CDN.

150
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,920
So certain pages you bump in from organic search results will actually display from

151
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,640
Google's own servers.

152
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,220
And it's very fast.

153
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,000
In organic and recently paid placements on your page, there's even a nifty AMP lightning

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,560
bolt icon to let people know it's going to be super fast.

155
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,940
The thing is, as he jumps in on it, he puts his clients through there.

156
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,420
But now he's saying that it has been a dramatic reduction in the traffic to the website.

157
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,600
And he talks about how so there's been some challenges with some AMP pages being broken,

158
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,960
sometimes blank pages are served, sometimes multiple pages on your site are surfaced as

159
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,160
AMP pages.

160
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,680
But the core takeaway is they saw a 70% drop in their conversion rate when they started

161
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
to deploy AMP.

162
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,720
And he goes into a series of reasons about this.

163
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,680
But I wanted to just take a moment, since it's up in the hoopla, to discuss it with

164
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,200
you because I've had an opportunity to discuss it with Joe a little bit on Linux Action News.

165
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,880
And our core takeaway is that while it's great for end users to load pages faster, what would

166
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,040
be a lot better is if people just built better websites.

167
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Is that, am I just, am I so insulated as a geek, can I just not wrap my head around why

168
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,880
people can't build slightly better websites or why we can't just do this ourselves?

169
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,560
Why do we need Google to build AMP?

170
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
Why can't it be something that people do themselves?

171
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,960
And so when you see things like, well, it's hosted on their own domain, so they take away

172
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,960
our URL, so we lose some of the branding.

173
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
People don't know if it's us.

174
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,920
When people share the URLs, our own name isn't in the URL.

175
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,680
There's all these complaints that Google is working to address.

176
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,280
And Google is promising that any web page that matches the performance of an AMP page

177
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,080
will get the same exact treatment in the Google search rankings.

178
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,600
But that's, but come on, that's impossible.

179
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,600
If Google is serving up these web pages from their own CDN, there's no way you're going

180
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,600
to beat that unless you're probably hosting it on Google Cloud.

181
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,960
And it's just a no-win scenario.

182
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,400
And I feel like we are just slowly succumbing to this and we're going to lose independence.

183
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,440
And maybe being an independent publisher on the internet for more than a decade skews

184
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,560
my view of this, but I hate the idea of people sharing links to a Jupiter broadcasting episode

185
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,280
and it's an AMP URL and not a Jupiter broadcasting URL.

186
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,840
Just like I detest the fact that Stitcher re-hosts our content and re-encodes the MP3s

187
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,640
and makes them sound worse, it goes against fundamentally why I'm an independent content

188
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
creator.

189
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,880
I hate that aspect of it.

190
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,320
It's just anybody that has pride of their work, you don't even have to be independent.

191
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,640
You could be an employee that works for a newspaper and just have pride in journalism

192
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,080
and you wouldn't want that to happen.

193
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,480
So I've gone on here for a little bit, but I'd love to get your take on it because I

194
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,280
don't think I've ever gotten to pick your brain on this topic.

195
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,380
And if you think, if this is maybe just an issue that these folks over at Rockstar Coders

196
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,520
are blowing out of proportion, maybe my insulated geek bubble is causing me to see this with

197
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,600
rose-colored glasses, but to me, it seems like the solution is people should just build

198
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,120
better sites.

199
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,520
Easier thing is like, is AMP itself something people should be doing?

200
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Yeah.

201
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,120
I would argue no, because like instant apps and things like that, it's just another, you

202
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,760
know, Google takes a lot of these shots and developers implement stuff and then Google

203
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,440
decides they're done with something.

204
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,040
This feels a lot like that.

205
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,920
It also feels a little icky, for lack of a better word, that, oh, if you're as performant

206
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,060
as something hosted on our CDN, on our search engine, we will give you equal treatment.

207
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,280
So what they're saying is this is a way for like SEO people to really game.

208
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,040
That's what this sounds like to me.

209
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,200
Your question about can people build better websites, your old buddy Brian Lunduke has

210
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,560
actually endeavored to answer that question.

211
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,800
His answer is they can, they won't.

212
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,720
And I happen to agree with him.

213
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,140
It's an intentional thing?

214
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,140
People want bad websites?

215
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,140
It's an intentional thing.

216
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,140
They're intent.

217
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,320
Well, no, people want to track and monetize their users.

218
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,360
So what's happening is if you, let's go to like, what the hell, the carer switcher hates

219
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
me anyway.

220
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:13,920
Let's go to recode.net and open up a Chrome window and just look at all the crazy JavaScript

221
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,380
running and actually the Verge is worse, but the Verge is notoriously bad.

222
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,500
That's why I didn't pick on them, although they're the same company now.

223
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,980
It's not that like there's something magical.

224
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,520
Of course, image sizes have gotten bigger, videos, things like that.

225
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,720
But it's the ad tracking, it's the cookies, it's the all kinds of third-party integrations

226
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,120
such as Facebook and you know, frankly, customer analytics firms that most people have never

227
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,720
heard of that's slowing down your web experience.

228
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,400
I think it's definitely, I think that's definitely fair.

229
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
It's definitely that.

230
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,560
I don't think it's only that.

231
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Like you look at Jupiter Broadcasting.

232
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,200
Of course, it's not only that, yeah.

233
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,660
Our site doesn't really, I mean, there may still be Google Analytics on there, maybe,

234
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,320
but we don't track for ad purposes.

235
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,420
We don't have any ads on our website, but it's WordPress, you know, because we wanted

236
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,760
a push button publishing system and we just, and so if I had, if I had a dedicated web

237
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,840
developer who could develop a static website that was like updated from Markdown files

238
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,760
in the CDN, you know, however it would work to publish podcasts with a static site, that

239
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,400
would be ideal, wouldn't it?

240
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,520
Not have something that's dynamically generated and all of that.

241
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,280
We have plugins to do all that, but to make it static.

242
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,540
But you get my drift, like I think it's a function of you have to be in this marketplace,

243
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,240
you have to be a player on the web, you have to have a web presence, your app has to have

244
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,360
a website, you know, everything has to have a dot com, every vulnerability has to have

245
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,640
a brand name and it all has to be on, but that's not people's core competency.

246
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,100
So they're forced to use these systems that are super heavy.

247
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,760
It's not just Google Analytics though, right?

248
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,680
Like Google Analytics is less horrible than a lot of the things.

249
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,440
So what's happening is people are using Google Analytics and like five other ad tracking

250
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,940
platforms.

251
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,960
So it's the cumulative effect, particularly on mobile where basically Safari or onboard

252
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Chrome is choking itself to death.

253
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
That makes sense.

254
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
All right.

255
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,440
Well, I wanted to pick your brain on that just a little bit because if to me, every

256
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,600
time AMP stuff comes up, I guess I feel like it's one of those things that's just sort

257
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,560
of slowly happening and there hasn't been a lot of discussion about if we're okay with

258
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,920
that because it represents a ton of control for Google.

259
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,720
Well, you know, proprietorization of the web, right?

260
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Yes.

261
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Yes.

262
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Yeah.

263
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
And re-hosting.

264
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Yeah.

265
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
So I don't know.

266
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,080
I guess it just seems like whenever it's in the news, I feel like, well, why don't we

267
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
talk about it for a moment?

268
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,160
Let's remind ourselves what we're doing here.

269
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,480
Speaking of reminding ourselves, I'd like to remind you about Linux Academy.

270
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,840
This could be a great opportunity for your continuing education.

271
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,920
You know, the thing is the IT industry moves at a breakneck pace.

272
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,680
And I think we all kind of acknowledge that when we got into the IT industry, but how

273
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,260
do you actually do your due diligence and stay relevant in an industry that changes

274
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,260
that often?

275
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,240
How do you stay current because maybe what you learned 5, 10, 15 years ago isn't directly

276
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,220
applicable these days to deploying a Docker container or something like that.

277
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,000
That's where Linux Academy can come in.

278
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,160
Even if you've got what you need certification wise, you're in the career you want, if you

279
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,960
just want to stay current, it's worth investing in yourself.

280
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,240
So go to linuxacademy.com slash coders and sign up for a free seven day trial and try

281
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,500
out the platform.

282
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,600
They've got great tools if you are ready to go get those certifications and they have

283
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,720
a hands-on lab, so if you're more of a visual learner, if you learn by doing, they've got

284
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,960
great resources for you.

285
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,760
You can spin up to six lab servers on demand.

286
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,320
And something kind of neat they're doing just out there for the community, you don't even

287
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,880
have to be a subscriber, is a couple of new things that I think are worth your time, worth

288
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,760
checking out, including their new Google Cloud weekly show that's coming out on Wednesdays

289
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,200
on the Linux Academy YouTube channel.

290
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,000
So if Google Cloud is on your radar, it's something you're working on, they are posting

291
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,480
a weekly update now.

292
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,920
They're usually about five, I don't know, ten minutes, kind of depends on the topic.

293
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,900
Last week it was about GPU acceleration on Google Cloud.

294
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:10,080
There's also launch of a Docker study group, and that's going to be on YouTube as well.

295
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,880
So it's probably time to go check out their YouTube channel if you want to be part of

296
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,040
the Docker study group or if you want to get weekly updates on Google Cloud.

297
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,160
Now that's all just free content, but if you go to linuxacademy.com slash coders, you can

298
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,880
sign up for a free seven day trial and try out the entire platform, and they've just

299
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,800
recently launched almost, I don't know if the official number is 200, but it's got to

300
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:37,040
be near 200 types of hands-on training, content, things for Azure, AWS, Core Linux itself,

301
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,780
Red Hat certifications, and DevOps as well.

302
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,520
It's a ton of content they've just launched in the last few months.

303
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,200
They're always adding and updating the old content so your membership constantly gets

304
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
value.

305
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,240
So go get started at linuxacademy.com slash coders, and don't forget about that new Docker

306
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,480
study group and the new weekly Google Cloud show all over on the Linux Academy YouTube

307
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,240
channel, linuxacademy.com.

308
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
Just go to YouTube and search for Linux Academy.

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You'll find it.

310
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,320
Linuxacademy.com slash coders, and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Coder

311
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,520
Radio program, linuxacademy.com slash coders with an S.

312
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,920
Okay, so let's get into your adventures with Qt.

313
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,300
This has been pretty fun, and your last couple of episodes have covered some of the advantages

314
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,560
about the cross-platform nature of it.

315
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,280
QML, we talked a little bit about last week and why we both were pretty impressed by that.

316
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:32,320
And now, it sounds like you've had a little time to play with Qt on Windows, which I compliment

317
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
you.

318
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,120
You know, we should try to represent the Windows portion of the audience from time to time

319
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,680
because they're out there and they're a decent percentage.

320
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,680
So I'm really curious to know how the adventures have gone on Windows and all of that lot.

321
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,360
Yeah, uh-oh.

322
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:57,360
So Windows, what can I say about Windows that, yeah, nothing nice to say here.

323
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:05,160
So yeah, the code I was working with was my code and I was trying to add a dependency

324
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,800
to something called ZMQ.

325
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,720
Now, ZMQ is basically a way to transmit data over ports.

326
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,200
Very common, used a lot in aerospace and embedded systems, things like that.

327
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,720
So one of the requirements I have is this application must run on Windows.

328
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,280
In fact, as of today, the primary platform.

329
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,560
So I took my Qt project and I went to install ZMQ on Windows.

330
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,440
You can look at the post on dominicam.com.

331
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,800
It was a nightmare.

332
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,120
It was unbelievably bad.

333
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,880
So there's like a ZMQ MSI installer, which does not do what you think it does.

334
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,840
And I ended up, and that's why we have a tool of the week, I ended up spending like three

335
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,160
whole days trying to get this to work.

336
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,220
Not understanding, like it would see the library, I'd add the DLL to the project, it would crash

337
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,200
at launch with no output, which if you've ever done Windows devs, you know crash at

338
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,440
launch with no output probably means something wrong with your DLLs.

339
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,680
Then I ran a dependency, one of those dependency crawlers, and sure enough, it was a DLL and

340
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:26,680
it's on, yeah, the error I was getting is the CBD, so CD debugger process terminated.

341
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,880
It was hot garbage, the definition of dumpster fire.

342
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,120
Now, do you need to be able to develop on Windows to run it on Windows?

343
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Is that a requirement?

344
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Yeah, you do.

345
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,360
It doesn't allow cross compiling generally.

346
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:49,560
So after about three days, I ended up finding this tool called VC package.

347
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,200
It's a Microsoft tool, I linked to the GitHub in the show notes.

348
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,200
What it basically is is a PowerShell tool that allows you to, it's basically a package

349
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,640
manager, right?

350
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,040
It's a package manager for C++ libraries and dependencies.

351
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,880
You know, apt-get, right?

352
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,960
Because the answer to this problem on Linux was sudo apt installs emq, emq dev.

353
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,240
On Mac, brew brew installs emq.

354
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,320
It really was unbelievably hard to get this running on Windows.

355
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,320
And granted, I will give to our.NET and Windows developer listeners, I am not the super Windows

356
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
guy, obviously.

357
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,760
So maybe a more experienced.NET would have been like, of course I install VC package

358
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,480
on every computer.

359
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,000
The package manager should come with the computer.

360
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,560
It is worth noting how enabling a package manager is in terms of just sitting down at

361
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:47,200
a computer and getting to work, which is most advantageous when you're first setting up

362
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,900
and not as advantageous once everything is set up.

363
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,460
After everything is done, it's not really a big deal.

364
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,100
But that first initial setup period, it makes a huge difference and it makes Windows feel

365
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,120
like an ancient operating system.

366
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:07,840
Yeah, like DLLs, we could have a whole show about why they're bad, right?

367
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:15,160
I firmly believe today, after this whole experience, that POSIX-compliant systems are more correct.

368
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,780
Things make more sense.

369
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:23,840
It's just, I don't know, I mean, I know there's rumors about Microsoft making a Windows derivative

370
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,640
or rather operating system derivative of Linux.

371
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:35,120
Maybe that's probably only for Azure, but this is no way to live, right?

372
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,720
This is true suffering.

373
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,660
I haven't been this frustrated in probably six years during development.

374
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
This was unbelievably bad.

375
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,840
So you think this is one of those edge cases where Windows sort of falls down as a development

376
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,240
platform and not that it couldn't be solved?

377
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,720
Well, Qt could have also had its role for Windows.

378
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,940
I just want to say that.

379
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,280
The Windows support, like on Linux and Mac, it basically finds your dependencies for you.

380
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,080
Now you could say, well, that's because Linux and Mac are POSIX and they just look under

381
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,600
user include and user, whatever user bin, whatever it is.

382
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,240
On Windows, it's a little more magical.

383
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,400
For instance, you might link to a DLL and see program file 0mq, which was the right

384
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,800
answer, which is idiotic as far as I'm concerned.

385
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,880
I feel like I lost the thread.

386
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,320
I'm just mad at Windows for sucking.

387
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,000
How fortunate, before you go on, how fortunate is Apple that a community came together and

388
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,680
created brew for them?

389
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,600
That platform desperately needs it.

390
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,760
Yeah, because Porus is terrible.

391
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,800
I know when we did our Windows 10 experiment, what was it, more than a year ago?

392
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,000
When we did our Windows 10 experiment, I ended up getting a new terminal to replace CMD and

393
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
a package manager.

394
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I just had to.

395
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,600
It's funny, I'm on Windows 10 right now for reasons that will become clear at the end

396
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:58,360
of this show today, but it feels, in fact, I had a conversation before the show.

397
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,280
It feels old, but not on the way of 1950s Flash Gordon, black and white shows, the old

398
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,680
sci-fi show.

399
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,640
It feels old like a typewriter, but not a cool hipster typewriter.

400
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,920
No, what it is, I might be projecting, but what the sense is that I get is, it feels

401
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,720
like you're struggling with solved problems.

402
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,080
These are problems that are solved, why is this something, why is this the thing I'm

403
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
wasting my time on?

404
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,960
Why hasn't this platform made it easier for me to just get down and get to working?

405
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,120
The setup procedure for this project on Mac or Linux is you run a batch script that I

406
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:42,280
wrote called setup underscore Mac, setup underscore Linux, and lo and behold, you're done.

407
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,120
In that script, the script is about four lines long.

408
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,360
It's just a bunch of concatenated batch commands.

409
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,580
Because it's like, and you have to drag and drop this, and you have to go into program

410
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,800
files and your dependency might be there.

411
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,640
Did you give up or were you successful?

412
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,320
I succeeded at the end.

413
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Oh, good.

414
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,960
But I was not a happy camper.

415
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,280
Yeah, yeah, I saw some grousing on Twitter.

416
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
I saw some grousing.

417
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,360
Yeah, that's how I usually know something's going on.

418
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
Mike's got a struggle.

419
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,160
The struggle's real, and it's just like, you know what it is?

420
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,080
I don't like Windows very much, so I'm just getting progressively angrier.

421
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Yeah.

422
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,480
You go in with a bias towards, like, I get angrier faster with Windows.

423
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,900
Because I have, I don't know, I've spent so many years fixing it in the past that I feel

424
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,000
like my threshold for dealing with it is lower.

425
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,880
Well, and I've also made like a conscious decision in the past to avoid these kind of

426
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,080
problems by like not being a, you know, quote unquote, corporate Windows dev.

427
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:48,040
And the fact that I was sort of pushed into this, yeah, I'm not, I don't even know.

428
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
I don't even know what to tell you.

429
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,280
I mean, of course all platforms are good, but some platforms are more good.

430
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Right.

431
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Yeah, that is an interesting thing when you, like, oh man, boy, do I know that feeling.

432
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,840
When there's some work that you have to do that makes you use a tool that you wouldn't

433
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,800
normally want to use, gosh, oh man.

434
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,400
Yeah, it does make it much harder to deal with annoyances.

435
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,880
And you have to just sort of sit there and be like, this isn't a big deal.

436
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Don't freak out.

437
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
You'll get through this.

438
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,240
Well, it's, it's an interesting deal though, as Microsoft tries to appeal to developers

439
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,440
that like, you know, it doesn't take too many clicks or too many commands on the command

440
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,760
proper PowerShell to end up in a box from, you know, Windows 95, right?

441
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:37,040
It really, I don't, can we kind of just go for it?

442
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,320
It seems like this giant, rich commercial company is innovating less than, oh, I don't

443
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:48,240
know, Gnome or KDE or like Pop OS, right, Ubuntu.

444
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,040
Even like we bitch and moan about the Mac.

445
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
You know what?

446
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
Whatever.

447
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,140
The Mac is fine, right?

448
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:01,440
It's a little annoying that they keep adding iOS features to it, but touch bar is garbage.

449
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,400
But the Mac is not impeding getting work done in any way.

450
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Right.

451
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,920
Especially the type of window you're doing.

452
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Right.

453
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,840
So the question is like, is Windows more targeted at like the business, you know, I think that's

454
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
the answer, right?

455
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,760
It's, you know, computer information systems versus comp sci, but it makes me want to throw

456
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
up.

457
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
We can move on from here.

458
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,460
No, I, I understand what you're saying.

459
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,640
It's like, because I think the space you're interested in is the development space, the

460
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,600
space where you want to get tools, you want to get to work.

461
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,400
And there's a lot of niceties on the Mac side, like the app store where you can install good

462
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,160
editors and things like that pretty quickly, which is not that Windows 10 doesn't have

463
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
that.

464
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
It's just not as strong.

465
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,920
On Linux, of course, you have package managers, but on top of that, you have distributions

466
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,680
like Pop OS and others that are trying to make it even simpler to just one click install

467
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,360
an entire development environment.

468
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,920
Like Ubuntu Mate, for example, has that software boutique when you first install it.

469
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,680
It is, it's great.

470
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,380
It's basically every major app you'd ever want for the Linux desktop.

471
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,060
Some that are in the repo, some that are outside the repos, you know, and it just pulls them

472
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,860
down for you and gets them set up for you.

473
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,760
And it makes setting up on a Linux desktop, even for somebody who's been doing it since

474
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,800
the nineties, it makes it a super quick, no pain situation.

475
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,600
It's just really nice to get up and get working.

476
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,560
And there's a lot they could do in Microsoft in Windows that they could do to kind of make

477
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
that process easier.

478
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,360
I mean, hell really, they have the money.

479
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,960
Why not make an official Windows package manager that is something that's in the community?

480
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,640
I think there is something in the works for that, but there's so many little areas where

481
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,280
they could round, they could round off the rough edges, I guess.

482
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Yeah.

483
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
I don't even know.

484
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Right.

485
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,320
Cause it's more to how people package for them as well.

486
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,560
Part of it is how the projects package, how people package and the fact that you would

487
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,320
link to a DLL and C program files seems crazy, right?

488
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,760
The fact that there's like windows was not envisioned as a development environment, I

489
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,040
guess, where Unix obviously was right.

490
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,440
That was the point of using Unix to cover everything, right?

491
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,560
Mac, BSD, Linux.

492
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,200
That feels weirdly fragile, right?

493
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,000
The fact that, you know what it is, this is exactly what it is.

494
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,520
Once you do something on Mac or Linux, cause it's all Unix underneath, you can write a

495
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,600
script, you can have a switch to detect if you're a Mac or Linux, those are minor differences.

496
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,760
And then that spash script is gospel.

497
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,480
On Windows, they're getting there with PowerShell, but it's not as standard and you have all

498
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
kinds of crazy dependency problems.

499
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Yeah.

500
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,560
I don't know, the whole DLL thing seems like it's weird and this is where my Mac guide

501
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,280
bias might come in from the past.

502
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,480
Dynamic linking I think is super bad.

503
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,160
Like if you remember Chris from the olden days or not that olden days, Mac apps generally

504
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,400
don't dynamically link.

505
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Yeah, they bundle.

506
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Statically link.

507
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
They bundle.

508
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,880
Basically they static link everything.

509
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,400
And that saves the user and the developer, okay, well if you don't have this, I need

510
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:01,000
a catch to tell you to go install Visual Studio C++, you know, 2012 of, right?

511
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,120
And yeah, your binaries are a little fatter, but.

512
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,600
There's some security ramifications as well.

513
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
Because now you're after the developer.

514
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,400
Well, no, dynamic is worse.

515
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,760
Well, the developer, if you intentionally infect your statics, right?

516
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,680
If you intentionally infect your libraries.

517
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,760
Or if you just basically, you know, you ship an old open SSL and it has a vulnerability

518
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,240
and then your app's still using that and say it's not like checking the cert of an HTTPS

519
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
server.

520
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,520
There have been some capabilities in the past where applications are still shipping those

521
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,120
old libraries when the system libraries have been updated.

522
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,380
But that's a, you know, that's an argument since the 80s.

523
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,120
So I digress.

524
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,560
Dynamic linking has the issue of, and we'll get into this later with licensing, where

525
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,640
if somebody ships a fraudulent version of a library that you might depend on and the

526
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,840
user mistakenly installs it, your app thinks that's the correct version of the library.

527
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,000
And now maybe all your HTTP traffic is being sniffed or.

528
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Fair enough.

529
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah.

530
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah, that's true.

531
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,200
So speaking of dynamic linking, we're going to get to that later on, but to close your

532
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,840
thoughts out, I think actually to respond to your thoughts, I think you may have nailed

533
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
it.

534
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,600
Windows itself wasn't initially conceived as so much as a development platform as an

535
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,960
application delivery platform.

536
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,100
And I know that sounds funny because Microsoft's been pretty good at building developer tools

537
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,000
and developer relations over the years.

538
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,200
But I think when you look at Windows itself, it was meant to be an end user desktop experience

539
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
first.

540
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,600
I mean, what would be the right intention?

541
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,280
And that's also why I've never felt like it was a great note as a server.

542
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,240
Like it just seemed a little off tone to me retrofitting something to be something else

543
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,640
instead of using something that was built from the ground up to be that thing.

544
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,840
So I think that's maybe some of the friction you're coming up with, as well as you're dealing

545
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,900
with perhaps an open source project that while is probably the largest, has our largest install

546
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,400
based on Windows, may not necessarily be a Windows first organization.

547
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,560
And that's being reflected in how they care about their packaging, I think.

548
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,320
But anyways, I think we have more to get into.

549
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,760
So I'll take a moment right here and thank DigitalOcean for sponsoring the CoderRadio

550
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
program.

551
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,600
Go to do.co slash coder.

552
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:08,080
No S on that one, do.co slash coder and get a $100 credit for 60 days when you sign up

553
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
with a new account.

554
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:15,960
Now DigitalOcean is a simple, scalable compute platform with industry leading price to performance.

555
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,520
Everything has enterprise grade SSDs, predictable costs and billing, 40 gigabit connections

556
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,560
coming into the hypervisors, data centers all over the world.

557
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:29,760
And early in the year, DigitalOcean launched a new flexible droplet plan for $15 a month,

558
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,160
which I think this is such a great deal.

559
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,920
This is the best deal, I think, really.

560
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,840
You can mix and match resources the most appropriate for your application.

561
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,760
The one that I go to, my go to test server, three cents an hour, four gigs of RAM, two

562
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,840
CPUs, an 80 gigabyte SSD, three terabytes of transfer, all for three cents an hour.

563
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,240
Then DigitalOcean manages it all with an industry leading dashboard.

564
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,600
It's super easy to use, but very powerful.

565
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,200
A great API that's well documented, lots of lots and lots of applications built around

566
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
it.

567
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,280
99.99% uptime SLA, cloud firewalls that block traffic at the network level so they never

568
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:09,860
even touch your droplet, baked in monitoring, alerting, perfect DNS management, and one

569
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,440
of the best team tools I've ever used.

570
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,600
The thing I love about DigitalOcean is it makes it easy to get up and going quick.

571
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,880
You go from idea to actual production in minutes, which is sometimes the difference between

572
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,800
having an idea and executing and having an idea and never doing it.

573
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,680
It's made a huge difference for us.

574
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,280
Do.co slash coder.

575
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,760
Go there, try it out, no S, get a $100 credit, and kick the tires for 60 days.

576
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,560
You'll really, I mean, with $100 credit, you could really turn that thing up if you want.

577
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:43,680
They have some super powerful systems with hundreds of gigs of RAM.

578
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:52,120
I believe last time I checked, it was like, yeah, 196 gigs of RAM, 32 CPU cores, 3.8 terabytes

579
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
of disk.

580
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,400
So if you want to use that $100 credit, go for it, do something awesome, do.co slash

581
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
coder.

582
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,640
Big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Coder Radio program, do.co slash coder.

583
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,160
Mr. Dominic, this cute conversation has got me wondering about one of the big bits of

584
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:19,360
feedback we've seen, and that is the questions about Qt's legal terms around licensing.

585
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,600
Maybe that's the way to put it, because I'll tell you what, I thought this was a no brainer.

586
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,480
I thought this was a pretty simple, go get a subscription, good to go, you have no problem.

587
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,220
And then I started looking into it and I am way more confused than I thought I would be

588
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:40,320
after reading their own website, reading forums, reading Quora posts, I mean, Stagg Exchange,

589
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,480
their FAQ, I read their entire FAQ.

590
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,680
Have you run into this issue and is this a concern for you?

591
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:51,960
Yeah, so the answer to this is from Freddie Mercury, I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves

592
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
me.

593
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,720
Meaning you want to use Qt, you want a proprietary app, you might be able to statically link

594
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:06,280
if you never, ever, ever, ever do anything that would compromise you, but pony up some

595
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
money.

596
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,360
And by the way, that subscription is not a subscription.

597
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,920
You have to pay that within 30 days, the total for the year.

598
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,480
Oh, and it's good for one year and each developer has to have a license, right?

599
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,840
It's per developer, any developer that touches the project, if you don't, you're automatically

600
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,260
under the LGPL.

601
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:32,200
So I had a brief conversation, a couple conversations actually with reps from Qt and the situation

602
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,000
is interesting.

603
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So for our case, to have two developers on this project, it would be immediately over

604
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
$11,000.

605
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,520
No way.

606
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,800
Which is just not, that dog don't hunt.

607
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,520
And that's for the first year and then it renews at a much, much more forgiving rate.

608
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:02,200
But the basic idea is that you can use the LGPL version, the open source version.

609
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:10,480
You may not include Qt and you have to be very, very careful about what you do, including

610
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,400
you have to share the.0 outputs of your compiled code, which I, for my use case, I think is

611
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,440
not gonna be acceptable.

612
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:25,640
It feels bad, I mean, Q Richard Stallman, but this is just not an acceptable outcome

613
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
for, yeah.

614
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,980
Negative in the freedom dimension.

615
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,800
I mean, I get it, right?

616
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,980
And oh, the other thing, and I heard from a birdie, in the future, more of their components

617
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:43,760
are not going to even be LGPL, they're gonna be straight GPL unless you have a license.

618
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,440
So those licenses are pretty handsomely priced.

619
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,560
This is pretty disappointing.

620
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:57,440
So you can ship it if you don't have an annual license, if you dynamically link.

621
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,760
That is the first thing you need to do.

622
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,880
You also need to include, and this is for me the killer, you need to include the.0

623
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,640
output of your compiled code and you need to refer back to Q and you have to have all

624
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,300
the proper disclosures, the normal stuff that you would have to do for a BSD or an MIT license.

625
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,160
And how big of a compromise is that?

626
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,600
Not the dynamically linked part, like take that out, but how big of a compromise is the

627
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,720
rest for you?

628
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,800
The.0 thing is probably unacceptable because there's, you know, I'm working right now in

629
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
the aerospace space.

630
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,280
I know that's a terrible way to phrase that.

631
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,700
And decompilers are a thing that exist, right?

632
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,080
And I'm not gonna use any weird obfuscation tool or anything like that.

633
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:48,360
So while I definitely like it as a development platform, I'm probably going to talk about

634
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,600
it a little more in future episodes.

635
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:58,960
I can't imagine, you know, a JB or a Madbot or a size company being able to pay this.

636
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,120
I mean, without serious compromises.

637
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:10,400
Yeah, now to be fair, to be fair, they have a startup licensing plan, but your company

638
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:17,040
has to end revenue, not profit, but revenue has to make less than $100,000 a year.

639
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,800
And you have to document that.

640
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,560
So to me, that's just not, I mean, we make, you know, more than that.

641
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,600
And I think the hype train just got super derailed here.

642
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
I feel a little.

643
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Yeah, I was disappointed.

644
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,960
In fact, it's funny because I wrote these show notes and then I had the final meeting

645
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:42,320
and it was one of the briefest meetings I've ever had because I said, well, if that's,

646
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,760
you know, if that's just the way it is, if you can't work with me, then we can't afford

647
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
it.

648
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,600
I mean, unfortunately that's what it comes down to, right?

649
00:36:51,600 --> 00:37:00,520
We can't drop $11,000 on software licensing when we could use.NET for free.

650
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,000
Mm hmm.

651
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,800
Which is why I'm on a Windows 10 machine right now.

652
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Oh, okay.

653
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
There it is.

654
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Yeah.

655
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:15,640
So it's, it's really, I get why they're doing it and the answer is, well, you know, small

656
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,560
little shops like the Matabot are just not their target customer.

657
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,720
I think that's it.

658
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,520
They're looking at people that are building products for devices and you know, multi-platform

659
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,320
projects that are big projects, they probably figure a couple thousand dollars per dev is

660
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,200
no big deal and it wouldn't be for a large company.

661
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,880
It'd be, that'd be standard operating procedure.

662
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
Yeah.

663
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,200
Well, it's unfortunately for some, I mean, I'm very surprised they don't have like a

664
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,440
small business plan.

665
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,200
A lot of companies I've dealt with that do have these kinds of schemes, I mean, pricing

666
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,060
schemes, not in a negative connotation.

667
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:57,520
When you tell them, hey man, we're like a five person company, they say, oh, well, let

668
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,880
me call my manager, you know, they put you on hold, they fake it for two minutes and

669
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,960
then they come back and say, well, here's what we can do for, you know, somebody of

670
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,520
your size.

671
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,480
That was not the case.

672
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
Yeah.

673
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Yeah.

674
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
That would have been really bad.

675
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Sorry, buddy.

676
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
The price is the price.

677
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Yeah.

678
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
That would have been great.

679
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,080
You, you know, that's, that's kind of bad in a way because I'd like to see them be hungry.

680
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,040
I'd like to see them want to hustle a little bit because I'd really like to see this.

681
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,080
I'd really like to see everything they're working on take off in a big way.

682
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,840
It's also bad for your and I's dream of like Linux as a default development platform for

683
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,000
a lot of people.

684
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
For commercial applications.

685
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah.

686
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,720
For commercial applications that are a GUI based, right?

687
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
That aren't Electro.

688
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,800
Because, well, I mean, I have been painstakingly trying to find a development platform for

689
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
this project.

690
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Yeah, I know.

691
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,960
And Qt was perfect, but we just, we just can't do it.

692
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:58,240
So that means I have no option but to do it on, uh, on windows because that's the platform

693
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,720
you have to deliver for.

694
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,480
We were required, right?

695
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,180
Man, we're, we're, yeah, we're bound.

696
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,340
How often do you suppose some version of this, maybe it's not cute, but you know, some version

697
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,680
of this happens more often than not.

698
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,000
And that's what blocks cross-platform applications is something like this, the tool you need,

699
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,920
you can't use or, I mean, it's just so disappointing.

700
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,560
And I really would, I would love to just see this problem shift because I'm no longer a,

701
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,400
you know, I'm no longer this big advocate that I used to be.

702
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,320
I'm now just a, I used to have a term for it.

703
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,280
Like I used to be an evangelist and now I'm an advocate.

704
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
So that's the way I should put it.

705
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,120
I'm no longer a big evangelist for it, but I am still quite the advocate for the Linux

706
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,920
desktop because it's really, there is a piece to it.

707
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:46,280
When you switch to a stable platform that just works for you and is reliable and doesn't

708
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,800
have a bunch of weird commercial interests dragging it around by the nose, there is a

709
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
peacefulness that you have.

710
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,880
Like there's like this confidence in your tool set.

711
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,700
And I want to like spread the good word to people, be like, your entire computer can

712
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,700
be empowering.

713
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,760
You know, you don't have to feel like you're making compromises, but if the applications

714
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,040
aren't there, it's, you know, people are just going to laugh me off.

715
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,760
And you know, you have developers like yourself that are willing to invest time and money

716
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,920
and development efforts into targeting the Linux desktop.

717
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,560
And I'm a, I'm a long time Linux user who would have no qualms about paying for commercial

718
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,080
software, but people just, you know, different things keep coming up that prevent it from

719
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
ever happening.

720
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,960
And that's one of the things that locks in the applications on windows and Mac and you

721
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,160
know, predominantly windows because you've got such the install base there.

722
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Wow.

723
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
That's really too bad.

724
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
That's too.

725
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:43,480
What kind of project would you still consider using Qt for in the future?

726
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,360
I hate making future predictions cause I'm often wrong as the subreddit will be quick

727
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
to tell you.

728
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:56,680
Um, you know, honestly I hope that Qt company, which is actually their legal name, realizes

729
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:02,280
that there are a lot of small software development companies out there that could also be there.

730
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,320
Like I have no objection to paying a license fee.

731
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,600
I'm just, we're just not structured in a way that we can pay that much.

732
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
Right.

733
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,080
Let's say you were creating, you know, a Jupiter broadcasting soundboard app that was going

734
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,640
to be GPL anyways.

735
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,800
Oh sure.

736
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
If it was already, right.

737
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,120
If, if, if the model for a piece of software was that it was like open source, then yeah,

738
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
obviously I wouldn't care.

739
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,680
I would just GPL everything.

740
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,520
It's really when you want to go commercial, but you don't have enough funding to buy the

741
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
annual.

742
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
And that's every year too.

743
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,320
So if this app continues to produce, but you haven't significantly update, the subscription

744
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,480
update is less than the initial purchase.

745
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,280
But you know, even if you have the money, I mean, I don't, I don't know about you, Chris,

746
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,640
but an $11,000 check is a check.

747
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:55,120
I would think twice about writing or 20 times before I wrote it.

748
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,200
It seems, I don't know.

749
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Obviously they're doing it though.

750
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Right.

751
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
A bunch of the Tesla stuff is written in Q.

752
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,400
So I think it really is as simple as they're targeting bigger enterprises that just like

753
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
this is a bar tab.

754
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Yeah.

755
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,280
And it might be a way to weed out, uh, support costs, undo burden and support.

756
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,400
You know, if the riff raff can't afford us, then we don't have to waste our support time.

757
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,360
You know, you just, uh, make sure that you could do like a startup tier.

758
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
I've seen like this.

759
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
I completely agree.

760
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
Yeah.

761
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,160
Where, where it was a startup tier where, listen, I understand you don't have a lot

762
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
of cash.

763
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,920
You can pay us every quarter and you get like very, you get limited support.

764
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
You get two tickets a quarter or something.

765
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,920
Yeah.

766
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,880
I mean, not to go on about this, but that is why I'm a little disappointed is I would

767
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,880
love to see the cute company being competitive in that way.

768
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,520
Cause there is an obvious gap in the market right now, especially for something that's

769
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,920
independent right now.

770
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,600
Uh, and they could really be aggressive and they could go after that.

771
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,920
And it seems like an obvious choice they're making not to.

772
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,080
And that's why I'm a little, I'm a little, you know, who rum about it because it seems

773
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,320
like, oh damn, I was, I was kind of hoping they were going to be more competitive, but

774
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
I was loving it.

775
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,520
I mean, I have to say, I have not enjoyed programming as much as I have writing the

776
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,120
C plus plus for the, uh, for the little cute prototype I was doing in this project.

777
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,120
Really?

778
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,120
Yeah.

779
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
Yeah.

780
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,120
Yes.

781
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120
Crazy past Mike.

782
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,120
Yes.

783
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,120
No, I'm not.

784
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,120
I'm seriously, I have not like, you know what I visual studio windows.

785
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,760
I mean, I'm going to lose my lunch, right?

786
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,080
Like it's just in my lunch was sushi, so it's going to be bad.

787
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,080
I loved it.

788
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,940
I w I was so into it.

789
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,120
We were going to have cute episodes for months.

790
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:34,960
And then it was basically, well, you know, we're in the wrong tax bracket, right?

791
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
Like I don't know what to say.

792
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,360
Well, why don't we, uh, why don't we end on some positive news?

793
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,880
So, uh, Android nine came out this week.

794
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,640
There's a couple of new nice features in there.

795
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
That's nice and positive.

796
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,640
I said positive.

797
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,640
I know.

798
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
Okay.

799
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,640
All right.

800
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,640
I'm trying.

801
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
How many devices is it installed?

802
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,640
Oh, you bastard.

803
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,640
You always got to bring it down.

804
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
Okay.

805
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,640
How about this one?

806
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
Here's some positive news.

807
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,760
iOS 12 developer betas group FaceTime has been removed from iOS 12 and will ship later

808
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760
in the fall.

809
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
Ah, yes.

810
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
Apple.

811
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,760
Yeah.

812
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,920
That might be a good sign.

813
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
You know what?

814
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,960
Apple punting features and waiting for them to get developed could be a good sign that

815
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,920
I wouldn't necessarily say that's bad that I need.

816
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,380
They could do a little more of that.

817
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:22,080
You know, ship some max, bake your software a little more, stay competitive because nobody

818
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,160
else is doing it.

819
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,080
Nobody else is staying competitive like that.

820
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,520
So and Microsoft is, but obviously you've run into issues.

821
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,760
Well, Mr. Dominic, I tried.

822
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
I gave it a go.

823
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,760
You know.

824
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,760
You tried.

825
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,760
You gave it a shot.

826
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,760
You gave it an honest try.

827
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
Here's something kind of positive.

828
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
We have a little PSA.

829
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,120
We will be doing a double coder next Monday to compensate for travel.

830
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,400
And so if you would like to join us for a live stream, that'd be a good one.

831
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,800
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

832
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,080
We usually start around 12 PM Pacific.

833
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:58,520
I usually get the stream fired up around 1130 AM Pacific and get some music going at jbliv.tv

834
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,000
and you can come hang out for a couple of double coders.

835
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,560
They'll get released in the RSS feed around their regular time-ish, but we'll be recording

836
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,040
both of them next week.

837
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,040
There you go.

838
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,040
There's a positive plug.

839
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,040
You know, that feels good.

840
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,040
I've never been more turned on in my life.

841
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,040
I know.

842
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,200
It is exciting, right?

843
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,640
Every opportunity you and I get to link up and talk is always good.

844
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,680
And next week we're talking about my new favorite dev platform, VB6.

845
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,680
Yeah.

846
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,680
Hey, everybody.

847
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,800
Alright, why don't you tell people where they can get a little more Dominic M in their life,

848
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
you know?

849
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,800
Follow me at Dumanuco.

850
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,160
And if you're an attorney who's an LGPL expert, I would love to hear from you.

851
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,160
No kidding, right?

852
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,160
That's part of it is.

853
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,160
Yeah.

854
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,360
Maybe somebody could give you some good advice there.

855
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:38,160
If you've got thoughts on anything we've talked about today, you can leave us feedback coder.show

856
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:45,440
slash contact and links to some of the things we talked about are at coder.show slash 322.

857
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,520
I'm also on the Twitters.

858
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,360
I'm at Chris LAS.

859
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,960
The show is at coder.radio.show and the whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

860
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,960
Hey, look at me.

861
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,880
I can remember things that I've said a thousand times, everybody.

862
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,540
And like I mentioned already, we have the calendar page where you can find out about

863
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,040
our lifetimes and we've got the live stream, but I told you about all of that.

864
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,840
So really the only thing I have left to say is thanks so much for joining us on this week's

865
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:23,840
episode of the Coder Radio program and we will see you right back here next week.
