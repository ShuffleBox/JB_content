00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Koto Radio, episode 305, for April 16th, 2018.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
Hi everyone and welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
This episode is brought to you by our two fine sponsors, DigitalOcean and Linux Academy.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
I'll tell you more about those great sponsors as this here show goes on.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Me, my name is Chris, but what's more important is our host.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
He's perched, established, and ready to go.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Over in the bayous of Florida is Mr. Dominic.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Hello Mike!

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
I want Szechuan sauce, I want that Mulan 1990s Clinton-era Szechuan sauce.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Have you tried it? Have you tried it?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Yes, I have actually.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah, it's, you know, it's alright.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
Well, Mr. Dominic, we had a lot of follow-up to get into from last week, but we're going to kind of do something different with it.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Instead of just reading emails, we're going to have it inspire a couple of things in the show for the next couple of weeks.

01:19.000 --> 01:28.000
Including, we're going to do a little bit of historical deep dive into Big Blue this week, just to sort of set up another conversation we're going to have in a couple of weeks.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
And the early dominance that IBM had, and the fight they had in the 80s.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
And then we'll get into a more modern hoopla that involves your current workflow.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
But why don't we start out with some emails that came into the show.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Are you ready, good sir, for the feedback?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm ready like a dime store hooker.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Okay, alright, I can't ask for more than that.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
And somebody calls right on that dot.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
You know, the thing is, the thing is, I'd pay for you.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
I think you'd be money well spent, I gotta be honest.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
You'd be money well spent.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
That's the nicest thing anyone said to me.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
So we got an email that said, hey guys, keep an eye on Swift Playgrounds.

02:04.000 --> 02:15.000
Remember you said that the canary in the coal mine, or I said the canary in the coal mine for Apple switching to ARM processors would be when Xcode starts coming out for the iOS platform.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
And a couple of emails pointed this out, but I like this one.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
He says, you know, look, this is the way it's going to go.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Swift Playgrounds is going to grow up into an Xcode replacement.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
It also means that Apple would have to create a layer much like art to make sure that people don't brick their iPads.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
Then Mike can finally preach the iPad Pro Bible once again.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
What do you think?

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
iPad Pros with like a grown up version of Swift Playgrounds, sort of like Final Cut came out of iMovie?

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
I mean, that is like a certain version of Lovecrafting.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah, a couple of people write that in.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I don't know.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I don't think that's the case.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I could be wrong.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
I hope not.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I mean, Playgrounds should really stay focused.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Well, it's not even that Playgrounds should stay focused.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
It's, you know, the more dev I do, the more I realize I need all the toys, right?

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Like, this is not a minimal, minimalist paradise here.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
This is a bring me all the toys.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
What do you mean by toys?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Like, you know what?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Sometimes a Mac is the right tool.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Sometimes a Linux system is the right tool.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
And sometimes a Windows 10 machine is the right tool.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I can't.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
And all three of those are like actually powerful systems.

03:28.000 --> 03:36.000
I can't imagine coding on an iPad and doing my day to day workflow on that without like being filled with a rage that could consume a thousand cents.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah, well, don't think of today's tools.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Think of, you know, five, 10 years of iteration where you've got, you know, different smart boards now.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Like, OK, what is an iPad when I hook it to a mechanical keyboard?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Is it even still an iPad?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Maybe not.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
I mean, maybe not.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
So then we're now we're talking like a surface, right?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Which, yes, I think is a fine dev machine.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
So, OK, good.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
All right.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Well, we'll be there.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Yeah.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Esteban says go with your gut.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
He wrote him with a couple of emails, but I really like this point.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
He made he says forget about the nice songs and poems about following your heart.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Your heart can and will mislead you.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
But your gut, your gut always feels right.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
That's always right.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I agree.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Go.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
And here's your problem with the heart.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
My heart was with the language.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
You might be familiar with this, Chris.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I don't know if you know this.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
In 2014, something happened.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
There was this language called Objective C.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Here we go again.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Yes.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
And then my heart was carved out like I'm a deer on the side of the road rather swiftly,

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
one might say.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Oh, bitter.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
That was good.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
So I did it.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Next.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
That was pretty well done.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
Esteban, your feedback is the best only because you set me up for another hit at Swift.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
We got we also had a pretty good point on the subreddit.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Just really.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I don't know.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Maybe not.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Pretty good point might not be the way to put it.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
But we got a feedback.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Well, because it wasn't really a point.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
It was just an observation.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
We got a feedback on our episode last week.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
No bad guys, only survivors.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Code Radio 304.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
And Andy writes, it was a it was a really valuable lesson for him.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
He says he went back and re-listened to certain chapters a couple of times.

05:17.000 --> 05:24.000
And he really felt like it was a great reflection on how to how to sort of understand failure,

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
learn from failure, which he's also been able to use as a contractor.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
So he says, I also enjoyed your recent forays into being shocked that PowerShell is a thing.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
He's talking about me there.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
But like that, we went down to Microsoft and talked to them and got that story.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
So he's covering a couple of bits here.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
But he says, I really found it informative and useful specifically today because he has

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
had to deal with the other end of empty promises of enterprise software salespeople for years

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
now.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
And he says crossing the chasm is definitely on his reading list.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
So it was great to be able to serve somebody who is on the other side of the contract agreement

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
that we often like sort of proverbially talk about.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
It was super useful for him to hear insights into the other side of the argument.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
So I thought that was pretty cool.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
And a lot of a lot of people really like that episode, which just makes me feel bad for

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
all of you.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Really, you just have to burn things down from time to time and and replant a forest

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
and then you don't like my thank you.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
You beat me to it.

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
You know, you know, our cousins, Uncle Jay and of course, Bain is a very similar philosophy.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Oh, man.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
You know, you know, I've started watching this.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Have you heard of Alex Inc.?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
I have not.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
It's not that great.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
It's not that great.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
But it's an ABC sitcom starring What's His Face from Scrubs, the main guy from Scrubs.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
And he's a he's a he's a mid 30s father who quits his full time job to launch a podcast

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
network.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
And it's oh, does this hurt a little bit?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
It is awkward.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I'm watching it with my with my kid.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
And I'm like, that is kind of like what life is like.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
And it's funny to watch something that you do because I know developers see this is I'm

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
not even going to resonate with developers because this has been common with development

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
for a long time.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
But nobody in the mainstream has really talked about podcasting for four decades.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
For as long as it's been around a decade.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
And now all of a sudden there's a TV show about it.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Pandora is launching podcasting support.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
It's really something to be sort of just sitting here watching all of a sudden this industry

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
just I don't know, be awesome.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Really?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
Like enter the next level of consumer awareness, you know, like it's reached another section

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
of it's moved on from the early adopters.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
See, I never understood why podcasting and this has nothing to do with the topic of the

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
show, but let's just go into it because I'm bored.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Why podcasting isn't just treated as like an extension of AM radio, like I used to love

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
AM radio.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
I mean, before Imus was an asshole, I used to listen to Imus in the morning.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Right.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
You know, when I lived in New Jersey, when I was younger, there was a you know, you remember

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Chrissy.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
I mean, I'm sure they still exist.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
You have the local stations.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Right.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
You have like your, you know, Washington state weed smokers.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
One oh one dot AM.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
We had a one to one point five in New Jersey.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Right.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And you get like the local feel.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Oh, yeah.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
And you're right.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
So why do I I'm obsessed with you being a drug addict, by the way.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
All these drugs.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
All these drugs.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
All these years.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
But why don't people see it as an extension of like talk radio?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.340
Seriously, because in my mind, that's exactly what it is like.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.200
I'm wearing over the head headphones that are cushy and hot and my ears are literally

08:31.200 --> 08:36.020
on fire right now because I live in the goddamn jungle and I'm using a microphone that looks

08:36.020 --> 08:39.200
like a swollen penis.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.200
It's huge.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.200
Yeah.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.200
Yeah.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.200
That is a particularly phallic microphone you have.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.200
Yeah.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.480
So I mean, it's black.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.480
It's not good.

08:47.480 --> 08:48.480
It's not wrong.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.480
Wrong.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.480
My setup.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.960
But we've gone down a path anyway.

08:52.960 --> 08:56.680
Why do you think podcasting is not treated just like an extension of AM radio?

08:56.680 --> 09:02.240
Well, because it's sort of a no rules medium and it's such a varying degree of quality.

09:02.240 --> 09:06.860
It's a lot like software development that in that regard, you know, like there's some

09:06.860 --> 09:10.280
great software developers and there's some horrible software developers.

09:10.280 --> 09:14.240
And I think also just the sort of homebrew nature of it.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.240
It's it's it.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.240
That's changing, though.

09:16.240 --> 09:20.440
I think that is going to change as now you've got all of these major radio networks that

09:20.440 --> 09:23.800
are releasing podcasts and maybe it will start to be seen as that.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.080
Well, I have to say, like the Wall Street Journal just recently did theirs and they've

09:27.080 --> 09:28.080
upped their game.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.080
Yeah.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
Yeah.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.080
Yeah.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.080
Yeah.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.080
Yeah.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.080
And so is the New York Times.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.080
It sucks in a way, but then at the same time, it just got up our game.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.080
You know, always got to be up on our game.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.280
Well, listen, put on the video stream and I'll just take my shirt off.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.280
There we go.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
Boom.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.280
Boom.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.280
Yeah.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.280
Yeah.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.280
Yeah.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.280
We've got a lot of pop requests that come into the show.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.760
You know what I've seen some great beards and some plump Linux developers.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.160
I would love to see Linux developer.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.160
I don't know, man.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.000
All that mud in those beards, that just is the nightmare for me.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I just triggers me.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
All right.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.580
Well, we do have a topic today to get into and it's kind of an important one, so we shouldn't

10:01.580 --> 10:05.080
run people off because it's going to be setting up the next couple of weeks of shows.

10:05.080 --> 10:10.940
So before we dive in, let's do our first bit of duty and business and thank the fantastic

10:10.940 --> 10:17.580
folks over at DigitalOcean.do.co slash coder. Now let me go check here, getting out the

10:17.580 --> 10:23.340
prop piece of paper that I have. Yes, verified with the back office staff, there is no S

10:23.340 --> 10:28.660
on that do.co slash coder. You go there to sign up for DigitalOcean, simplicity at scale,

10:28.660 --> 10:34.980
and you'll get a $100 DigitalOcean credit. Did you hear that? $100 in DigitalOcean credit.

10:34.980 --> 10:38.340
It's a limited time offer, so I want you to take advantage of it while they're still giving

10:38.340 --> 10:45.940
it out. Do.co slash coder. DigitalOcean is incredibly fast infrastructure on demand.

10:45.940 --> 10:50.280
You can get spun up in less than 55 seconds. Every single DigitalOcean droplet, from the

10:50.280 --> 10:54.180
three cents an hour, which is my favorite or even cheaper than that, to the super expensive

10:54.180 --> 11:00.180
hundreds gigabytes of RAM, massive Xeon CPUs, everything in that entire lineup, SSDs, all

11:00.180 --> 11:06.740
of it. 40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors, all of it. Great, beautiful, easy to use dashboard

11:06.740 --> 11:12.060
on all of it, and a straightforward, well-documented, full-featured API that you can start programming

11:12.060 --> 11:15.940
against, take advantage of existing libraries, or open source code that's been completely

11:15.940 --> 11:20.700
designed and built for you. DigitalOcean has predictable pricing, entire application stacks

11:20.700 --> 11:25.460
that are ready to go, and you can also deploy a base system if you like. You combine all

11:25.460 --> 11:30.740
of that with fantastic documentation and their new flexible droplets. For $15 a month, you

11:30.740 --> 11:35.300
can mix and match resources the most appropriate for your application. Or, I mentioned it,

11:35.300 --> 11:39.660
they have those really high-end Xeon CPUs for CPU-optimized droplets. If you have a

11:39.660 --> 11:45.500
really compute-intensive workload, very, very useful for that. And then, on top of that,

11:45.500 --> 11:51.740
for storage, they have Spaces and Object Storage. Spaces is S3-compatible, and Object Storage

11:51.740 --> 11:57.180
just shows up as another device right on your rig. That's so sweet because it's great for

11:57.180 --> 12:01.580
backups, it's great for centralizing storage, it's great for adding just new disk if you

12:01.580 --> 12:05.980
have something that's growing on your existing droplet, and recently they've adjusted their

12:05.980 --> 12:09.260
prices. So, if you've been a DigitalOcean customer for a while, you can go upgrade your

12:09.260 --> 12:14.140
system for free. Pay exactly what you're paying now, and you just get more RAM, more disk,

12:14.140 --> 12:24.420
more CPU. dio.co slash coder. Go to DigitalOcean, try it out with a $100 credit. dio.co slash

12:24.420 --> 12:25.420
coder.

12:25.420 --> 12:31.940
All right, Mr. Dominic, you tweeted something that kind of stuck with me, because you did

12:31.940 --> 12:36.220
this towards the beginning of the month, still thinking about it. You said, I've read this

12:36.220 --> 12:41.260
twice now, and I'm absolutely convinced that Microsoft is becoming the platonic ideal of

12:41.260 --> 12:46.100
IBM that I mentioned a few weeks ago in Coder Radio. And then you include a link to the

12:46.100 --> 12:53.300
resignation of one of Microsoft's long-term engineers who, after 21 years, was leaving.

12:53.300 --> 12:59.320
And you said the platonic version of IBM. And when we were talking about Sun Microsystems

12:59.320 --> 13:04.780
on the show, we sort of got a new appreciation for how important some of this backstory of

13:04.780 --> 13:10.160
the tech industry is to really kind of understand where it's going. And we danced around IBM

13:10.160 --> 13:14.020
a lot when we were talking about Sun, and then we danced around IBM a lot when we started

13:14.020 --> 13:17.860
talking about Microsoft again. So I thought maybe this would be the week we hit the pause

13:17.860 --> 13:23.340
button and we just do kind of what I'm going to call a high-level deep dive, so the important

13:23.340 --> 13:28.140
bits about IBM that we need to know for the wider context of our future discussions, with

13:28.140 --> 13:34.340
a little background history. And maybe even take a moment and go to sort of IBM's real

13:34.340 --> 13:43.860
peak over the PC industry in the early to mid-80s. Are you a complicit co-host in my

13:43.860 --> 13:46.500
schemes here? Do you think this is something worth doing?

13:46.500 --> 13:50.500
Listen, let's put on our black suits with white shirts, and let's make sure we have

13:50.500 --> 13:52.940
high socks. Let's go to IBM.

13:52.940 --> 13:58.620
You know, just to kind of give you, we're going to talk about IBM's influence over tech,

13:58.620 --> 14:05.700
but IBM really kind of had big influence over the way employment works in the US. I don't

14:05.700 --> 14:10.260
know if it's true, but they definitely, IBM says it's true, that they pioneered the 40-hour

14:10.260 --> 14:17.620
work week and group health benefits in a company. That's a pretty big claim, if that's true.

14:17.620 --> 14:24.900
And IBM technically got started in 1911 when they leased unit record equipment and were

14:24.900 --> 14:29.440
famous for creating punch cards. In fact, they really became the Computing Tabulating

14:29.440 --> 14:37.100
Recording Company, CTR, until an individual named Thomas J. Watson took over in 1924 and

14:37.100 --> 14:41.300
renamed them to International Business Machines, or IBM.

14:41.300 --> 14:50.460
And so let's go back to sort of IBM's origins, sort of a quick overview. This is a clip that

14:50.460 --> 14:58.140
I grabbed from a 1985's broadcast of the Computer Chronicles. Now, to take you up to speed in

14:58.140 --> 15:06.080
1985, IBM had just recently wrapped up a potential monopoly lawsuit with the federal government.

15:06.080 --> 15:11.540
They were trying to push for a new expansion card format, and there's a lot of discussions

15:11.540 --> 15:15.760
about white label BIOS development. And so at this point in time, the Computer Chronicles

15:15.760 --> 15:19.260
goes back and looks at IBM's origins.

15:19.260 --> 15:23.660
In many respects, the history of IBM is the history of computing. The parent company's

15:23.660 --> 15:29.480
founder, Herman Hollerith, devised the first practical card punch calculator. It was used

15:29.480 --> 15:35.880
for the first time to tabulate the 1890 American census. The IBM card soon became the symbol

15:35.880 --> 15:42.340
of the early computer age. IBM's first mainframe, the Mark I, ushered in the post-war era of

15:42.340 --> 15:48.080
data processing, for the most part restricted to scientific applications. But IBM's choice

15:48.080 --> 15:54.120
market was always business, especially big business. As advances in memory and storage

15:54.120 --> 15:59.500
took place, they were applied and promoted for business use. In this manner, the company

15:59.500 --> 16:05.460
developed an almost exclusive hold on the data processing departments of major corporations.

16:05.460 --> 16:10.660
By the 1960s, IBM was the leader, both technically and commercially, with over two-thirds of

16:10.660 --> 16:16.360
the mainframe market. Its pervasive customer support and computer families gave it a major

16:16.360 --> 16:22.500
advantage in almost every aspect of business computing. By 1966, the company began to look

16:22.500 --> 16:29.660
at the small business market and expand it overseas. Today, suddenly cleared of its history-making

16:29.660 --> 16:35.420
antitrust suit, IBM continues to expand its share of the market. And it does so in the

16:35.420 --> 16:40.340
same way it has in the past, secretively, cautiously, and with ruthless efficiency.

16:40.340 --> 16:47.260
They didn't really have a clear picture of how IBM was ever going to be supplanted. They

16:47.260 --> 16:51.840
were so dominant that here was an interview that took place right after that clip plays

16:51.840 --> 16:56.460
in the Computer Chronicle, and listen to the resignation in their voices. It's just a foregone

16:56.460 --> 16:57.460
conclusion.

16:57.460 --> 17:00.980
Jim, IBM saw some opportunities here a few years ago and jumped right in and took the

17:00.980 --> 17:05.260
lion's share of the PC market. Do you see any effective competition now? Are we all

17:05.260 --> 17:08.900
going to be working toward being compatible with IBM?

17:08.900 --> 17:16.320
Well, Gary, in 1984, we saw IBM capture 26% of the worldwide PC market, and we at DataQuest

17:16.320 --> 17:20.140
expect that that market share will continue to increase through our forecast period, which

17:20.140 --> 17:25.180
ends in 1989. I would certainly expect they would command 40 to 50% of the market by that

17:25.180 --> 17:26.180
point in time.

17:26.180 --> 17:33.660
So, I mean, you really get an idea of how dominant IBM was in the PC market, which is

17:33.660 --> 17:38.940
a market they don't even play in anymore. They don't even bother anymore. I think it's

17:38.940 --> 17:43.460
kind of remarkable that that transition where they go from, how could anybody ever replace

17:43.460 --> 17:47.820
them? That was the IBM. They were so dominant, right? And now they're more thought of like

17:47.820 --> 17:55.700
cloud services and enterprise services and mainframe still, but it's in a lot of ways

17:55.700 --> 18:02.260
where Microsoft is in their world of the compute little kingdom. Amazon's in their world of

18:02.260 --> 18:05.620
the compute kingdom. They own all of that. Now we have lots of little IBMs, it feels

18:05.620 --> 18:12.700
like. Baby IBMs, mini-IBMs, where they don't have unilateral influence, but they sure have

18:12.700 --> 18:20.620
a lot of influence in the section of the galaxy they own. What do you think? Is that fair?

18:20.620 --> 18:27.340
I think it's fair, right? I mean, I think IBM really, it's interesting to think about

18:27.340 --> 18:32.180
how long they've been around, right? And how much has, can we say changed since they've

18:32.180 --> 18:33.180
been around?

18:33.180 --> 18:34.180
No, they're still around.

18:34.180 --> 18:37.500
Well, I mean, of course they're still around. They're a big player in AI.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.820
But since 1911, over a hundred years ago, things have changed.

18:40.820 --> 18:47.300
Right. I mean, I like to think of IBM in terms of the ThinkPad in the more recent history.

18:47.300 --> 18:51.020
And at some point, it became just not worth it for them to actually manufacture their

18:51.020 --> 18:55.820
own computers. Which is a little sad.

18:55.820 --> 19:01.060
It is, and it's really telling. So now though, even despite that, the company's taking in

19:01.060 --> 19:07.980
about a hundred billion a year and has around 450,000 employees still. So they didn't go

19:07.980 --> 19:12.820
away. And I think that's maybe a key lesson that when we start talking about where Microsoft

19:12.820 --> 19:17.820
is going, if you get to a certain dominance, I don't think you quite go away. Like Sun

19:17.820 --> 19:22.020
never reached that. They didn't, they never reached the level of influence that IBM or

19:22.020 --> 19:27.780
a Microsoft or a Google has. Whereas, you know, I think once you get to a certain scale,

19:27.780 --> 19:32.260
a certain size, unless you're acquired, you just never really go away. You still have

19:32.260 --> 19:37.780
a certain customer base you're going to serve for our lifetime, is what I suspect.

19:37.780 --> 19:42.100
So when you say the platonic version of IBM, do you mean like a less hostile version? Like

19:42.100 --> 19:46.860
a less like over overusing of their influence? Cause IBM was known for playing. Yeah. I mean

19:46.860 --> 19:53.260
like the, the, the purist, the best idea of what IBM should have been. Right. Although

19:53.260 --> 19:56.620
I will say it's interesting that you mentioned Lucent because Lucent like died amid accounting

19:56.620 --> 20:02.900
scandals, right? Like, yeah, that's true. Maybe not the same thing.

20:02.900 --> 20:07.820
I have a visual guide to the history of IBM linked in the show notes. If you go to coder.show

20:07.820 --> 20:13.100
slash three oh five, you will find that. And I also have the entire computer Chronicles

20:13.100 --> 20:17.420
1985 broadcast linked in there, which is, which the whole episode is a profile of big

20:17.420 --> 20:24.060
blue sort of a during its mead. It's a, it's a peak PC industry influence, which is a fascinating

20:24.060 --> 20:29.060
time to take a snapshot and then to look back at it now. Yeah. So that's all in there. And

20:29.060 --> 20:33.260
also a link to the New York times when IBM dropped, or when the US government dropped

20:33.260 --> 20:38.920
its antitrust suit against IBM, which the federal government said they no longer dominate

20:38.920 --> 20:42.420
the computer business, but the rest of the industry didn't necessarily agree. And there

20:42.420 --> 20:46.980
was quite a bit of controversy about it back then. And it's also interesting that, you

20:46.980 --> 20:51.580
know, we think of the Watson machine now, that big, huge, you know, chest destroying

20:51.580 --> 20:58.460
IBM mainframe. Well, it's not just Sherlock Holmes is a right-hand man. Thomas J. Watson

20:58.460 --> 21:05.020
ran the company when it was still called computing tableting record company to IBM. He ran it

21:05.020 --> 21:10.580
from 1874 to 1956, I think, or in, I'm not sure exactly his timeframe, but he ran it

21:10.580 --> 21:14.500
for, or yeah, anyways, he ran it for quite a while as his name was Watson. So I, some

21:14.500 --> 21:18.260
of these, the Watson project we hear about now may actually, I guess, be a reference

21:18.260 --> 21:21.980
to him and not a Sherlock Holmes reference that I always thought it was, which is kind

21:21.980 --> 21:25.340
of neat, just a little bit of history. And they've been around for so long. They've seen

21:25.340 --> 21:28.660
so much. And of course they don't necessarily have the best history either. They sort of

21:28.660 --> 21:33.740
have a famous dark aspect to their history when it came to those punch machines. But

21:33.740 --> 21:39.900
now they're in the cloud. Now they're a business technology company and a cloud company. And

21:39.900 --> 21:43.780
Lotus is still around. I don't know what to make of any of it, Mr. Dominic, but I do know

21:43.780 --> 21:47.420
what to make of Linux Academy. Let's go to Linux Academy and then we'll get to the hoopla

21:47.420 --> 21:51.700
of this week. There's a great promo going on. This was, well, it's a new release over

21:51.700 --> 21:57.580
at Linux Academy. Go to linuxacademy.com slash coders. They have 70 new courses, challenges,

21:57.580 --> 22:01.880

to it. They'll build learning goals and help you. Along the way you can try out their hands

22:19.500 --> 22:23.940
on labs that give you scenario based learning. They have video courses on every self-paced

22:23.940 --> 22:27.620
in-depth topic you might want to learn about. They have flashcards, which are forked by

22:27.620 --> 22:31.280
the community to help you study. They have learning paths, which are series of courses

22:31.280 --> 22:36.740
and content planned by instructors for specific career tracks. And if you want to get certifications,

22:36.740 --> 22:40.060
they've got courses created specifically to prepare you for those as well. They've got

22:40.060 --> 22:45.500
iOS and Android apps, study tools, lesson audio, study books that you can download and

22:45.500 --> 22:50.660
use offline, practice exams and quizzes, and those labs I mentioned that will spin them

22:50.660 --> 22:54.860
up on demand. If you ever get stuck, they've got a human being to help you along the way.

22:54.860 --> 22:59.540
With 70 new courses, challenges, and learning activities, it's never been a better time

22:59.540 --> 23:05.460
to try out Linux Academy with a seven day free trial. Linuxacademy.com slash coders.

23:05.460 --> 23:11.140
20 new courses, 50 new cloud assessments, hands on learning activities, and new challenges

23:11.140 --> 23:16.980
are all coming this month to Linux Academy. Linuxacademy.com slash coders. And a big thank

23:16.980 --> 23:23.540
you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Coder Radio program. Linuxacademy.com slash coders.

23:23.540 --> 23:28.400
So let's talk about our workflow. This is a topic that we keep revisiting every single

23:28.400 --> 23:34.580
time we think we're done. And then it keeps coming back. And it won't, it just is not

23:34.580 --> 23:40.300
getting fixed. And it's getting very frustrating for me, as you can probably tell. Since the

23:40.300 --> 23:43.420
last time we talked about this, the last time we really talked about this is when the rumors

23:43.420 --> 23:49.180
were going around that Apple might ship ARM processors in the Macs. Now we've gotten new

23:49.180 --> 23:57.420
news that the Mac Pro is going to be delayed until 2019. That they've hired a Pro workflow

23:57.420 --> 24:02.500
team to pretend to do work so that way Apple can analyze how they work. And they brought

24:02.500 --> 24:08.220
down TechCrunch's Panzerino to do a one on one interview to kind of just get an update

24:08.220 --> 24:12.880
on where things are at. And it looks like there's not much news for the Mac Pro other

24:12.880 --> 24:18.220
than it's going to be later and we're still at the drawing board. But this Pro team that

24:18.220 --> 24:26.420
they've hired, which is a group of producers and editors and content creators that are

24:26.420 --> 24:31.640
shooting real world projects at Apple and then trying to edit them on Apple Gear with

24:31.640 --> 24:35.060
developers sitting over their shoulders going, oh, what do you think about when that happens?

24:35.060 --> 24:38.480
How do you feel when that happens? How can we do this better? And trying to find frustration

24:38.480 --> 24:45.060
points to influence the design of the Mac Pro. In other words, Mike, your computer woes

24:45.060 --> 24:48.420
aren't solved. You're going to continue to have to wait and see. Oh, we did get news

24:48.420 --> 24:51.960
that they are absolutely definitely working on a new monitor. So that's going to be coming

24:51.960 --> 24:52.960
as well.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.520
I'm happy right now.

24:54.520 --> 24:59.180
And so this totally comes out right after the ARM news. And there's no way this thing's

24:59.180 --> 25:03.080
going to be Intel. It's supposed to ship in 2019. So I think we can just put the ARM discussion

25:03.080 --> 25:05.300
aside and just focus on this part.

25:05.300 --> 25:09.140
Yeah. So you know what this tells me, Chris? And it's interesting because I've listened

25:09.140 --> 25:12.420
to a lot of takes on this and my response was completely different.

25:12.420 --> 25:13.420
Okay.

25:13.420 --> 25:17.180
Mine was the Mac Pro is not for me.

25:17.180 --> 25:21.460
I would perhaps too boldly say this wasn't a machine for you with the price tag. If the

25:21.460 --> 25:28.660
iMac Pro starting at $5,000, this thing's probably starting at $7,000 or $8,000. Possibly.

25:28.660 --> 25:33.200
I think my take on it was also a little bit different than the other takes. My take on

25:33.200 --> 25:37.540
it was holy shit, Apple really doesn't know how to build a computer anymore. Like everybody's

25:37.540 --> 25:42.140
always talked about when Steve Jobs died, Apple lost their way. I think it's more like

25:42.140 --> 25:46.580
the recent talent drain they've had lower in the ranks that has gotten some coverage.

25:46.580 --> 25:52.940
There's been some well-known ones like Mr. Skeuomorphic when he left, Scott Forstall.

25:52.940 --> 25:57.100
That was I think one of their massive technical assets that truly understood the hardware

25:57.100 --> 26:00.780
and the operating system. He was gone and he was a power user. And I think over the

26:00.780 --> 26:06.380
years they've had power users leaving Apple. And I don't think, I mean, I just don't think

26:06.380 --> 26:10.860
there's a really super strong computer enthusiast in the company that's in a position to influence

26:10.860 --> 26:11.860
product design.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.860
Now, come on.

26:13.860 --> 26:21.860
You don't need to hire these million dollar a year editors and producers to find out that

26:21.860 --> 26:27.700
you just need to create another version of the Mac Pro Tower. I think they don't know.

26:27.700 --> 26:28.940
The fact that they didn't see-

26:28.940 --> 26:33.940
How could they not know though? There are people who are obviously tech enthusiasts.

26:33.940 --> 26:40.140
No, I think it's a group of out of touch old white men that are running it. Look at the

26:40.140 --> 26:41.140
people who come out on stuff.

26:41.140 --> 26:42.140
I don't know, dude.

26:42.140 --> 26:45.060
Phil Schiller, Tim Cook, they're all-

26:45.060 --> 26:50.540
Yeah, but if they're old white guys, if that's going to be the thing we use, they're us or

26:50.540 --> 26:55.260
older, right? I mean, you're slightly older than me, but like there are rough generation.

26:55.260 --> 26:59.540
So their idea of a computer should be very similar to what I mean.

26:59.540 --> 27:03.540
But they're so out of touch. They've been running Apple. They haven't probably gone

27:03.540 --> 27:07.980
to the Dell website and looked at how you configure a Dell or anything like that in

27:07.980 --> 27:13.940
years. I guess I'm not trying to say it's because they're old white guys. I'm saying

27:13.940 --> 27:17.720
it's because they are people that have just gotten out of touch over the years by being

27:17.720 --> 27:21.140
Apple executives, running the company and not looking at PCs.

27:21.140 --> 27:26.340
I don't think you're making like some weird social issue here. But first of all, if you're

27:26.340 --> 27:30.600
a business like Apple, the idea that you're not going to look at your main competitors

27:30.600 --> 27:35.380
seems crazy. Of course, they probably go very regularly to Dell.com and play with the configurator

27:35.380 --> 27:36.380
and see what Dell-

27:36.380 --> 27:41.580
Oh yeah. No, I think the issue with the leadership though doesn't understand why you might want

27:41.580 --> 27:46.820
more GPU power over CPU power. I don't think they grok the concepts. And that's how we

27:46.820 --> 27:48.000
got the trashcan.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.920
It's funny. I see it completely differently. I don't think they grok the concept of why

27:50.920 --> 28:00.020
upgrading RAM at the user level is important. Right. When do you suppose the last time Craig

28:00.020 --> 28:07.900
Federici or Tim Cook or Phil Schiller has upgraded the RAM in a laptop? Maybe never.

28:07.900 --> 28:09.840
Maybe 10 years.

28:09.840 --> 28:10.840
Probably never.

28:10.840 --> 28:15.340
See, they don't live that world. They don't understand it. I think they really for a long

28:15.340 --> 28:18.180
time thought the iPad was going to do it for a lot of people.

28:18.180 --> 28:19.180
And so-

28:19.180 --> 28:22.980
I think they did too. I mean, it's obvious when they had the original Mac Pro Summit

28:22.980 --> 28:28.940
that they were shocked that people didn't think the iMac Pro was the right answer. Which

28:28.940 --> 28:35.940
in reality it probably is for a lot of people, right? But I don't know, man. This whole thing

28:35.940 --> 28:41.280
of them being out of touch feels kind of like, there's nothing stopping them from making

28:41.280 --> 28:46.500
the device you and I want. Let's just have a little bit of self-awareness here. Are we

28:46.500 --> 28:48.500
just out of touch?

28:48.500 --> 28:49.500
Right.

28:49.500 --> 28:55.540
No, no. I mean, I think it's pretty clear in the product. The failure of the trashcan

28:55.540 --> 29:02.620
and the inability for them to recognize still the limitations of the iMac Pro. The iMac

29:02.620 --> 29:06.940
Pro is being lauded right now in this conversation as, it's great. It's going to be more than

29:06.940 --> 29:13.260
what most people need. But in reality, the iMac Pro still suffers from thermal limiting.

29:13.260 --> 29:18.260
There is not currently a Mac in production that does not suffer from thermal throttling

29:18.260 --> 29:23.940
when you push it. That is embarrassing. None of them, none of them are sufficiently cooled

29:23.940 --> 29:29.420
because of design compromises. And when I'm pushing my MacBook trying to encode a video

29:29.420 --> 29:35.140
and I know that the CPU is being downclocked so that way it doesn't reach thermal thresholds,

29:35.140 --> 29:39.240
it's like, what did I pay all this money for? That's embarrassing. And they just don't get

29:39.240 --> 29:45.180
these concepts. They don't understand why USB-C isn't enough. Why even though only some

29:45.180 --> 29:50.140
people have an SD card reader need that they should put it on every model. They just haven't

29:50.140 --> 29:55.220
lived that. And so they think the solution is to bring these pro people in and hire these

29:55.220 --> 29:57.520
yes men to tell them what they should be building.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.520
But that-

29:58.520 --> 30:02.120
Well, it is interesting the people they brought in, right? They haven't brought in people

30:02.120 --> 30:05.940
who are going to be critical, which I get it. You don't want to pay people to insult

30:05.940 --> 30:14.700
you. But hiring a Chris Fisher would have been an interesting look at it, right? Saying,

30:14.700 --> 30:22.820
you know what guys, I'm an IT admin and I'm a video podcast producer and I have a budget.

30:22.820 --> 30:26.140
So I would like a month, because I think you and I effectively want the same thing, but

30:26.140 --> 30:29.940
you would lean on GPU and I would like to buy the cheapest model, but be able to upgrade

30:29.940 --> 30:30.940
it for five years.

30:30.940 --> 30:39.260
Yeah. I think if I could have, if Tim and Johnny came to me and said, what do you want?

30:39.260 --> 30:46.780
I would say, take the Mac Pro cheese grater tower and sell it at a base of the cheapest

30:46.780 --> 30:53.660
you can sell, one CPU, 16 gigs of RAM, one SSD drive. And then let me-

30:53.660 --> 30:54.660
Add to it later.

30:54.660 --> 30:58.940
Yeah. Six months, I'll throw four drives in. And then in six months after that, I'll throw-

30:58.940 --> 31:01.060
Okay, but I have that on my desk here.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.220
Yeah. Well?

31:02.220 --> 31:11.000
It's a Dell Optiplex 7050, right? Is it possible that you, me and John Syracuse and everybody

31:11.000 --> 31:18.820
bitching about Apple's like, quote unquote, abandonment of Mac Pros is just wrong? Not

31:18.820 --> 31:21.220
wrong in like that we're wrong technically, but wrong in that-

31:21.220 --> 31:22.780
We should be using Windows.

31:22.780 --> 31:27.380
Right. Apple's not making a mistake. Apple's just choosing not to serve you.

31:27.380 --> 31:33.060
So that's my option. So there's just a couple of specifically Adobe applications. Ironically,

31:33.060 --> 31:38.020
Photoshop isn't really one of them, that I need a platform to run and they're the latest

31:38.020 --> 31:44.340
creative cloud versions. I'm not going to run like version seven of Photoshop, for example.

31:44.340 --> 31:48.680
And so if I have to run that, I prefer to run it on a Mac than run it on a, on Windows

31:48.680 --> 31:52.820
because my, you guys know my history. I'm just not a, I'm not a huge fan of using Windows

31:52.820 --> 31:57.100
as my work OS and daily driver. I have some Windows systems and it's fine for what I use

31:57.100 --> 32:00.380
it for. And I don't care if other people use it, but it's just not what I want to use.

32:00.380 --> 32:03.940
And so, and it's not what I want to have in production 24 seven in my studio either.

32:03.940 --> 32:06.820
Well, because it'll restart five times. Oh, jeez.

32:06.820 --> 32:11.100
So my options right now are Windows or Mac. And I just, it's the, it's the, it goes back

32:11.100 --> 32:15.020
to that tool thing. Like these are the tools of my trade and those are the, those are the

32:15.020 --> 32:20.080
two platforms they run on. I find that infuriating. So I'm constantly spending a lot of my time

32:20.080 --> 32:24.380
and energy trying to come up with alternatives on Linux constantly. I'm always searching

32:24.380 --> 32:27.900
for Linux alternatives. I'm always trying out different projects under Linux. And I

32:27.900 --> 32:32.700
mean, I probably burn four or five hours a week and it's just, I'm getting really worn

32:32.700 --> 32:36.500
out and I'm getting, I'm starting to lose the faith that I'm ever going to find a solution.

32:36.500 --> 32:41.140
So now I just need Apple to figure their shit out because I don't want to use Windows and

32:41.140 --> 32:44.600
I'm kind of getting to the end of my rope of trying to re re-engineer everything on

32:44.600 --> 32:48.660
Linux every, every week. So right. But that's insane. So you're, you're basically going

32:48.660 --> 32:53.940
to like spin your wheels and like just wait for Apple to solve this problem for you.

32:53.940 --> 32:58.420
What if they decide not to, right? I think it's pretty obvious. Well, I think even if

32:58.420 --> 33:01.380
they, even if they build a good Mac pro, I'm not going to be able to afford it. So I think

33:01.380 --> 33:06.980
I have to move on anyways. Right. Exactly. Like if the iMac pro starts a five grand,

33:06.980 --> 33:12.620
you know, the Mac pro is going to be starting at eight, like there. And also it's not going

33:12.620 --> 33:18.300
to be what you and I want. It is not going to be a black or gray or whatever color tower

33:18.300 --> 33:22.540
that you can slot in parts. It might be like several different takes on the Mac mini for

33:22.540 --> 33:26.460
all we know. You know, right. It could just be, I know I'm almost thinking that's what

33:26.460 --> 33:30.060
it is. It's just like a super beefed up. I can't remember the name, but what does that

33:30.060 --> 33:34.700
Nvidia machine that recently came out? You're not thinking of the, you're not thinking of

33:34.700 --> 33:38.300
the Intel NUC, are you? You're thinking of the Intel NUC, the one after it. Maybe it

33:38.300 --> 33:43.900
isn't, it's like, it's a new, like a skull, something NUC that is Intel latest Intel

33:43.900 --> 33:51.300
I seven with an AMD dedicated ish. Yes. GPU. Yep. Yep. That's that things that NUC is.

33:51.300 --> 33:55.700
It's funny you say that. That is exactly what my thought process is. If I could move my

33:55.700 --> 34:02.580
remaining workflow items over to Linux, um, then I, that would be my go to workstation.

34:02.580 --> 34:08.180
It's small, it's interchangeable. It's quiet. It's relatively low cost. It's expandable.

34:08.180 --> 34:11.780
It has Thunderbolt. Um, it's everything the Mac mini should be, but I would use it to

34:11.780 --> 34:16.860
run Linux. The issue is even on Linux to do my job that all the tools I need are still

34:16.860 --> 34:21.280
commercial. They're still proprietary. So I'm not fully, um, right. You're not a freedom

34:21.280 --> 34:25.260
beard. Well, I'm still not even getting, I'm still, I still can get drug around by the

34:25.260 --> 34:29.740
nose horn a little bit. You know what I'm saying? Like I can still kind of, so in part

34:29.740 --> 34:35.660
of me, part of me feels like maybe Apple has gotten the, um, the smell of fear that they're

34:35.660 --> 34:40.620
losing their pro market. And so they're maybe over the next few years, we're going to see

34:40.620 --> 34:45.260
some 2019, right? They said 2019. Yeah, but, but this pro team isn't just influencing the

34:45.260 --> 34:50.500
Mac pro it's going to go into the, how the Mac book pro works. And I think the pro moniker,

34:50.500 --> 34:55.380
I think that's, I think you're going to start seeing, I wouldn't be surprised if you see

34:55.380 --> 35:00.660
a mea culpa of some kind on the Mac book pro, like an SD card reader or a totally revamped

35:00.660 --> 35:04.260
keyboard or something like that, that they say is influenced by the pro team. Well, if

35:04.260 --> 35:08.460
there was a keyboard, that would be definitely something worth talking about. I think maybe

35:08.460 --> 35:12.220
the bigger meta issue here though, it to even take it away from Apple and say the meta issue

35:12.220 --> 35:18.440
is I have a tool that I depend on several tools and the vendor of that platform seems

35:18.440 --> 35:22.980
like they've completely stopped. They've lost how to serve me. They don't know how to do

35:22.980 --> 35:23.980
it.

35:23.980 --> 35:26.900
Right. So you went to a bar and the bartender doesn't care to serve you, right? They don't

35:26.900 --> 35:31.920
care. This is the problem, right? They just said, you know what, Mike or, you know, Chris,

35:31.920 --> 35:38.540
we only carry, you know, Peruvian amber ale. We don't carry what you want. I don't know.

35:38.540 --> 35:44.340
I made something up, but like the DOS Uber IPA, right? Like this is how I feel. And I've

35:44.340 --> 35:50.920
been a pretty, like I have bought many Apple machines, both for my businesses and for myself.

35:50.920 --> 35:57.240
And I don't know, every time I like deal with them, I feel like I'm not their target customer.

35:57.240 --> 36:04.120
They're happy to take my money cause they're a business, but they just don't meet. Like

36:04.120 --> 36:09.440
every machine I buy from them is, is very expensive and it's like deeply compromised.

36:09.440 --> 36:14.800
There is the Mac pros keyboard, which is in my opinion, basically unusable. Um, and by

36:14.800 --> 36:22.220
the way, another great bug I found in my $3,000 Mac book pro HDMI doesn't work very well.

36:22.220 --> 36:26.160
It's unreliable. Plug it in. You have to unplug it, replug it. No, no, no. Max, you're supposed

36:26.160 --> 36:28.880
to just work, dude. You're fine. You're fine. You're probably, it doesn't work. And then

36:28.880 --> 36:34.800
I looked it up and it's like, yeah, it's because of the interchange between USB-C I have the

36:34.800 --> 36:41.760
Apple official Belkin adapter that costs $70. And it's just like a bug in the, in the OS

36:41.760 --> 36:49.600
for, for HDMI, right? There was a bug with HDMI. Well, you mean on the flip side on Linux,

36:49.600 --> 36:53.580
you just have, nobody's even bothered to write that score yet. Nothing's up to resident looks

36:53.580 --> 36:56.760
like shit on my phone and on windows is just going to be fixed the next driver release.

36:56.760 --> 37:00.000
We swear we promise just update next. It'll be fixed. We swear. We promise it never gets

37:00.000 --> 37:03.640
fixed. I'm going to push back on it though. So running my Dell on windows 10, which I've

37:03.640 --> 37:10.840
been doing for a, I'm going to be doing quite a lot actually. Everything just works. I can't

37:10.840 --> 37:15.840
believe I'm saying that about windows, but what dude? No, it just works. Yeah, it does.

37:15.840 --> 37:20.640
I have had, I have more day to day problems now running my Macbook pro, which I am trying

37:20.640 --> 37:25.760
to do in clamshell motor of HDMI, which people say, Oh, well you should get a DP. Yeah. What

37:25.760 --> 37:30.880
is it? DPI DVI. You should get a mini DVI adapter to thunder pole and you should buy

37:30.880 --> 37:37.720
the special licensed one. And uh, but like I'm not buying 20 adapters. Like I paid $70

37:37.720 --> 37:44.680
for an HDMI adapter. I think it ought to work. Um, I'm sorry, but like, so this is the error

37:44.680 --> 37:50.680
case. If the laptop goes into suspension or falls asleep because I like got up to take

37:50.680 --> 37:57.560
a phone call and it, uh, resumes, you know, wakes up, it sometimes won't notice the HDMI

37:57.560 --> 38:03.460
adapter. Then you have to restart the machine, plug it in, unplug it to get it to pick up

38:03.460 --> 38:08.840
the HDMI. Sometimes it doesn't work. I have hit a bug on my editing Macbook where I'll

38:08.840 --> 38:14.480
be working on a project. I'll close the lid. I'll arrive at the studio. I plug in my single

38:14.480 --> 38:19.480
Thunderbolt three cable, which provides power, video networking, et cetera, USB. I plugged

38:19.480 --> 38:24.160
that in, opened the lid up and the screen, I have a mouse cursor, but both screens are

38:24.160 --> 38:28.300
red, like bright, bright, bright, bright red. And the only thing I can do is power off

38:28.300 --> 38:33.320
the Mac book and power back on. Well, and all these compromises are in the name of what

38:33.320 --> 38:38.840
thinness? Yeah. Right. Like, well, and you know, like the old West has stagnated in,

38:38.840 --> 38:41.480
in terms of stability with, you know, and supposedly, but again, they're turning around

38:41.480 --> 38:46.600
on all of that. It, it really, the thing is, it's like, I have weird ass issues on Linux

38:46.600 --> 38:52.980
sometimes too, you know, like my Gallego pro does strange semi military plane lifting off

38:52.980 --> 38:56.480
in my lap things all the time. So I would be willing to bet if you stuck her around

38:56.480 --> 38:59.720
on a windows 10 for six months, issues will start to crop up because in my experience

38:59.720 --> 39:03.200
in all of these systems, the first couple of weeks tend to be like the golden weeks.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.440
Like you just, right. You have not only is it something fresh and new, so that's kind

39:06.440 --> 39:10.380
of nice, but then you don't have like the cruft and all this crap that just eventually

39:10.380 --> 39:15.560
starts causing problems. I don't even know how to explain it. So, so can I take a swing

39:15.560 --> 39:20.280
here? Go for it. Would you agree with the statement that OS stability and quality has

39:20.280 --> 39:24.760
just gone down over the years? Yeah, I was just saying that yesterday. Actually, I was

39:24.760 --> 39:30.000
just having kind of an off the air conversation with Joe about how, uh, it's totally feels

39:30.000 --> 39:35.800
like it's gone downhill. Like, uh, I thought by now all of these little weird things would

39:35.800 --> 39:42.240
be worked out by now. Like we would have like fought the good fight and we would have figured

39:42.240 --> 39:47.440
this stuff out, but we still have video issues. So what do you think? Yeah.

39:47.440 --> 39:54.000
Uh, I mean, I think, you know, I, I think it's kind of a shit show to be honest. I think

39:54.000 --> 39:57.440
Apple doesn't know what they're doing. I think you might be right. They may do a maya culpa

39:57.440 --> 40:03.120
and change their mind. I think you're, they really wanted to converge Mac OS and an iOS

40:03.120 --> 40:07.960
and that's maybe becoming hard for them, right? Or they're about to do it. They're getting

40:07.960 --> 40:12.680
windows. Windows has the opposite problem where they're so obsessed with legacy that

40:12.680 --> 40:19.000
they can't like, you know, high DPI up some of the control panel stuff. Linux is doing

40:19.000 --> 40:24.760
too many things at once to really get anything done, right? Which is a problem. Well, it's

40:24.760 --> 40:28.960
got to, you got to figure it must have a super high churn rate compared to other longterm

40:28.960 --> 40:32.800
operating system projects because you've got people that are, you know, contributing while

40:32.800 --> 40:36.960
they work at Intel for a few years and then they go over to Samsung and then you have

40:36.960 --> 40:42.360
people whose passions burnout. I think you're right to summarize it. I would say Mac OS

40:42.360 --> 40:47.000
is suffering from a lack of attention and focus from Apple and proper prioritization.

40:47.000 --> 40:52.020
And so that platform has suffered. Windows suffers from a long legacy of technical debt

40:52.020 --> 40:57.880
and a super deep spaghetti code infrastructure. And honestly, you know, just team bureaucracy

40:57.880 --> 41:01.080
where different things get prioritized different ways and different things are broken out with

41:01.080 --> 41:05.000
different levels of funding. That's windows. And then on Linux, I think what you have is

41:05.000 --> 41:09.080
a bunch of shallow developers who don't go super deep on a lot of stuff. They, a lot

41:09.080 --> 41:13.960
of them want to work on that big, big core foundational problems, but those cause burnout

41:13.960 --> 41:18.200
and they don't solve the last 10% of user polish problems that we constantly run into.

41:18.200 --> 41:26.400
And so each platform has its own particular toxic eroding of its, what should be better

41:26.400 --> 41:30.840
stability, should be better performance, should be more reliable. But these toxic natures

41:30.840 --> 41:38.720
to all of them have, I think, sort of prevented that. And I do feel like long, long, long,

41:38.720 --> 41:44.960
long term, hopefully open source would be better because it can just slowly and slowly

41:44.960 --> 41:51.680
and slowly iterate with, with no need to ever generate revenue. So in theory that would

41:51.680 --> 41:57.560
be best longterm, but we so often reset and we have so much apparent development churn.

41:57.560 --> 42:03.800
I'm not sure if I just want to say like Wayland, right? Like that entire nightmare. Yeah, it's

42:03.800 --> 42:07.600
been basically in the works for 10 years and it's, you know, just now shipping is default

42:07.600 --> 42:17.160
on a couple of distros and Ubuntu is actually rolling it back for their 1804 release. So,

42:17.160 --> 42:23.080
you know, what really, what we really want at the end of the day is we want a nice system

42:23.080 --> 42:27.480
that is almost gotta be top of the line. You might have to pay premium and it just comes

42:27.480 --> 42:31.880
and it works. Like you've, you've tried to now order non max and other systems, even

42:31.880 --> 42:35.600
Dell systems, and they've completely blown up in your face. Like we're not there yet

42:35.600 --> 42:38.880
together. So the hardware side of this is a bit of a shit show too, because the whole

42:38.880 --> 42:44.480
hardware industry has been obsessed with mobile now for eight years, nine years. Well, the

42:44.480 --> 42:51.960
whole hardware side is nobody's making money. Yeah, that's just a problem. So yeah, I don't

42:51.960 --> 42:58.400
know. I mean, you would think that there was a space for a vendor to come in and say, we

42:58.400 --> 43:04.560
have good machines, high quality components and a stable operating system for you to just

43:04.560 --> 43:10.720
get your work done, right? It's just not the case though. Like you're right, windows after

43:10.720 --> 43:15.000
a long, after a couple of months generally becomes a fricking nightmare, right? Running

43:15.000 --> 43:22.280
windows after, you know, six months is really not fun. A bit rot tends to set in and things,

43:22.280 --> 43:26.120
you know, just right. And you, what you really started to notice with windows is like how

43:26.120 --> 43:29.520
many different installers are there? You know, there's so many different install wizards

43:29.520 --> 43:34.840
and some of them still want to install as a system tray app to like check for updates

43:34.840 --> 43:40.000
to the installer. Like that's still a thing on windows, this mishmash of installation

43:40.000 --> 43:46.440
methods and all of it. It's just, there's a real legacy there that it eventually does

43:46.440 --> 43:52.600
catch up to you. I just, I don't know. I, that's why I've been trying to make the plasma

43:52.600 --> 43:57.560
desktop work, to be honest with you, because being able to mix and match my OS, my desktop

43:57.560 --> 44:01.800
environment and my hardware seems to be the only long-term solution. But it, like I said,

44:01.800 --> 44:05.720
I spend a lot of time trying to make that work and it's still not successful, but that's

44:05.720 --> 44:11.240
why I keep spending time every week, at least taking a crack at a segment or a show. Like

44:11.240 --> 44:15.320
right now I'm trying to learn this editor called Reaper, which they don't even want

44:15.320 --> 44:19.360
to admit is available for Linux. They make it available for the Mac and for windows and

44:19.360 --> 44:23.400
they make a Linux build, but you got to go through like this double duck blind, this

44:23.400 --> 44:27.640
system to get a download link. So you can try out a beta version of their editor for

44:27.640 --> 44:31.320
Linux. And it's like, well, how long is this going to stick around? And can I even count

44:31.320 --> 44:36.760
on that? So I feel like in a lot of ways, 2018, we've talked a lot around this issue

44:36.760 --> 44:42.480
and about this issue, but it's, it's getting worse and it's been getting worse since about

44:42.480 --> 44:49.800
2015, I feel like 2014, it's just started getting shittier and shittier. And, and maybe

44:49.800 --> 44:54.040
with this pro work group and this 2019 Mac pro announcement, you're starting to see Apple

44:54.040 --> 44:57.880
turn it around because I'll give them this. I'd rather they delay it and get it right

44:57.880 --> 45:02.120
and then screw it up and do another trashcan. You know, so see, this is my problem though.

45:02.120 --> 45:05.420
I don't think the issue is like, they don't know how to do it. I think it's just like

45:05.420 --> 45:11.240
philosophically not something they want to do is anything they've done before. Basically,

45:11.240 --> 45:13.720
since they've done a tower, they'll never do it again because they've already done it.

45:13.720 --> 45:18.480
Well, it's more that like they see that as a commodity business, right? We're like, if

45:18.480 --> 45:22.380
you can slot in parts off the shelf that, you know, they're not a commodity, they're

45:22.380 --> 45:27.680
more of a luxury, they're more of a brand. And it's not a thing they want to compete.

45:27.680 --> 45:31.740
But like, I'm, I'm, I'm tired of waiting, right? Like, that's why I'm, you know, looking

45:31.740 --> 45:36.760
so closely at pop OS. I'm looking at windows 10 because I just seen an OS to like do its

45:36.760 --> 45:41.400
job, be able to be put on any hardware and get out of my way.

45:41.400 --> 45:47.840
Right? Yeah. I, I don't know. I, I think this particular problem is beginning to change.

45:47.840 --> 45:50.800
I think it's going to start getting a lot better on the Mac side. I really do. I don't

45:50.800 --> 45:54.520
know if it's going to be right for me because I, the hardware just will be out of my league.

45:54.520 --> 46:01.960
But you know, with Mac OS 10.13.4, they now have official eGPU support for external AMD

46:01.960 --> 46:08.500
GPU. So you can hook up a brand new AMD GPU to a MacBook pro. That's a huge deal for professionals.

46:08.500 --> 46:14.040
The fact that the iMac pro does at least address a lot of compute needs. I might not want to

46:14.040 --> 46:18.240
use it and I might be a little hurt that it has a, still has thermal throttling, but it's

46:18.240 --> 46:22.400
overall a very fast machine and it seems to be a good value for $5,000 when you include

46:22.400 --> 46:28.080
the 5k screen. And so that's a good sign. And so this Mac pro, you know, it's a ways

46:28.080 --> 46:32.060
off, but they may bite. They may be in the right direction now. I mean, eGPU pro work

46:32.060 --> 46:37.920
group team, even though I think that's a little weak sauce, iMac pro and now delaying the

46:37.920 --> 46:41.160
Mac pro until they can get it right. All kind of indicate that they're starting to take

46:41.160 --> 46:47.740
this seriously again. Just might be too little too late. Not to even be cliche or quaint

46:47.740 --> 46:52.960
about it, but I think it's just too little too late. And I think that's just the reality

46:52.960 --> 46:59.040
of it is there's going to be other categories of machines now that at different price points

46:59.040 --> 47:03.160
and maybe, you know what, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe in a few weeks, if you're still on Windows

47:03.160 --> 47:06.000
10, you'll think it's great. And then maybe this won't be an issue for you anymore, but

47:06.000 --> 47:10.320
I doubt it. We shall see. The Coder, it's like we're stuck in a Coder radio. Did you

47:10.320 --> 47:13.800
ever see that episode of TNG where they just kept getting in a loop over and over again

47:13.800 --> 47:18.640
because they were crashing into a Frazier's ship and then they just kept right. Yes, yes,

47:18.640 --> 47:22.920
yes, yes. Yeah, that's what's happening to us here. So really quickly, before we leave,

47:22.920 --> 47:26.520
I'm going to point you to an article that you'll find in the show notes at Coder dot

47:26.520 --> 47:31.840
show slash 305. And I think this is really kind of interesting compared to what we keeping

47:31.840 --> 47:36.160
in mind what we talked about last week. And it's an article that is kind of legitimate.

47:36.160 --> 47:40.680
It's the science of breaking out of your comfort zone. Now, I read through this whole thing

47:40.680 --> 47:44.160
and I found a few areas in here that I think are particularly good. And if you're stuck

47:44.160 --> 47:48.600
on an idea or a project right now, this might be exactly what you need. This is something

47:48.600 --> 47:52.840
I have found helps me a lot. And you know, if you if you're if you're really from a recent

47:52.840 --> 47:57.280
failure or a setback and you need to get new fresh perspective, I really encourage that

47:57.280 --> 48:01.720
you go read the science of breaking out of your comfort zone. You know, really, if you

48:01.720 --> 48:08.080
think about it, our brains are engineered to seek out comfort zones because it minimizes

48:08.080 --> 48:12.800
stress. There's patterns and routines that you can recognize. It's it gives you a state

48:12.800 --> 48:18.000
of mental security, but it also can kind of kill new ideas. It prevents you from seeing

48:18.000 --> 48:23.600
the big picture. So the idea of this article is to give you a few tools to potentially

48:23.600 --> 48:28.480
break out so you can maybe be more productive. You'll have potentially an easier time dealing

48:28.480 --> 48:32.360
with new and unexpected changes. I know it all sounds really hippie and fufui, but it

48:32.360 --> 48:36.880
works. And I thought it was sort of a nice sort of conclusion to what we talked about

48:36.880 --> 48:41.960
last week. And it is a lifehacker article. But I think you I think you would find it

48:41.960 --> 48:44.920
useful to take a look. We'll have that over at the show notes. Mr. Dominic, is there anything

48:44.920 --> 48:48.240
else we want to talk about this week before we get the snot out of here? Sounds good.

48:48.240 --> 48:52.120
Follow me at Dumanuco on Twitter. Boom at Dumanuco on Twitter. You can follow the whole

48:52.120 --> 48:57.140
dang network at Jupiter signal. You can follow me. I'm at Chris LAS. And like I said earlier,

48:57.140 --> 49:02.440
we have that new so show website, which means we also have a new show feed. So you can go

49:02.440 --> 49:08.240
to coder.show slash RSS to get that new feed coder.show slash RSS. Or if you just want

49:08.240 --> 49:13.680
easy links, coder.show slash subscribe. We also have the subreddit, you can always participate

49:13.680 --> 49:18.480
in that. And we'd love to get your emails coder.show slash contact. It's a lot of URLs

49:18.480 --> 49:23.400
I'm throwing at your face. But I believe in you. I have faith that you can remember them,

49:23.400 --> 49:26.580
or at least remember one of them. You can also join us live we tend to do this show

49:26.580 --> 49:32.240
on Mondays. And that URL is Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar for the time. Thank you

49:32.240 --> 49:35.160
so much for tuning this week's episode of the coder radio program. I hope you join us

49:35.160 --> 49:41.580
right back here. We do this show every single week. And you can count on at least more insightful

49:41.580 --> 49:56.600
and deep commentary from Jar Jar Binks.
