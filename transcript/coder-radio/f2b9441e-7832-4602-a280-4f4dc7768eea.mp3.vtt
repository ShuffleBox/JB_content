00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Kota Radio, Episode 389 for November 23rd, 2020.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Oh, hey there. Welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
Cloud Guru now has Cloud Playgrounds, Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Playground right all on their machines

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
with their credit card, not yours, on their infrastructure, not yours.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
My name is Chris, and I think perhaps planning to fry a turkey live on the show.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
It's our host, Mr. Michael Dominick. Hello, Mike.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Gobble, gobble.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Frying something on the show might be your credit card.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Oh!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Shots fired.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Yes, we're going to get to it, but it's an exciting perhaps live purchase.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
We'll find out. We're going to walk through it on the show here in a little bit.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Settle down, Chris. We can't give up, you know.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
No, I know. And, you know, we have our traditions.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Like the people used to have their holidays, we have our traditions.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
And one of those is we start with feedback here on the program.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And we have some good feedback.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
So I thought, you know, we'd read a batch of them.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
But then, you know, we do have perhaps something to get into in the second half of the show.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
So we're just going to do three emails this week, you know, just to keep it nice and tidy.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Plus, I got a turkey smoking at home, so I got to wrap this up, you know.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
I estimate I got seven hours, but made a big mistake, I think.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
And that is what some people recommend you do.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
And this is the problem with recipes.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
They have like this entire story that you have to skim to get any kind of information.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
Or if you go on YouTube, you have to sit through like their cold open and then their intro.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
And then, God forbid, like some sort of like call out to subscribe and hit the bell.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
And then you watch the video that they tell you how to smoke the turkey.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
And it's a process, Mike, let me tell you.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
It's a process.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah, see, if I had a smoker, I'm pretty sure I would smoke even more laptops.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Boom.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
You would find a way to sneak one in there.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
I was smoking some chicken over the weekend.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
And this is, it's a pellet fed smoker.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
And it's going right along.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
And I come inside.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
I'm getting other things ready.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
About an hour goes by.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
And I come outside and I realize that my daughter had unplugged it when she was trying to help me with something else.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
And just left the smoker.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
So this is a test run.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
So I got her at home smoking right now while I'm down here in the studio.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
So we'll see how things turn out.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
But I think the mistake I made is I tried to like heat blast it to crisp up the skin.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
And I think it just got things too hot.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
So, you know, because the goal with smoking is low and slow.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
So be careful on the YouTube videos you pick.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah, so you don't want to go too hot too fast.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
No, you got to take your time with it, you know.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
That bird is a lady.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Really warm it up.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Okay, let's just move on.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
All right.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
All right, Shad writes in.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
And he's stuck at a fork in the Indie Roads.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
He says, hello.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Hi there.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Hey, Shad.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm a software developer specializing in a platform that is small enough where over time I was able to establish a bit of a name for myself.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
At the same time, it's big enough where there is plenty of work if you're good.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Similar to Chris, I was independent.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
And then I went to go work full time.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
And well, now I'm back independent again.

03:45.000 --> 03:53.000
Eighty to ninety percent of my income comes from a mix of my own long term clients and subcontracting for larger shops.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
The rest comes from some product sales and shorter one off projects.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I think a lot of us are pretty familiar with that mix.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
He goes on to say what I need advice is regarding where to go from here.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
I have made some attempts to hire a part time help with the product promotion, maybe somebody with project dev work.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
But I really haven't had much luck.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
The town pool for developers in the platform I work on is small and I've had trouble finding people.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
The fact that it's small is probably why he's able to eke out some value in that market.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
But he goes on to say, I've worked with some offshore developers, but the time difference was too challenging and it was easy to just do the work myself.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
Additionally, much of my hourly work comes from subcontracting, which I cannot outsource.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm making really good money right now, but I'd like to reduce my dependency on hourly work in the long term.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I really enjoy development and coming up with solutions for small business problems.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
I don't mind doing some project management, but I don't think I'd enjoy it primarily.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
And I don't think I'd enjoy focusing on managing a team.

04:51.000 --> 05:00.000
The only two paths I can see are to keep doing what I am doing and increase my rates over time or hire some help with a good background.

05:00.000 --> 05:09.000
And then train them in the specific platform that I work on over time, knowing that it will cost me in the short term, but hopefully maybe pay off down the road.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
So he's wondering if we have any advice for him here.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
You know, he's find himself a good niche, but the problem is he's the only one that can do it.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
And he doesn't really say this, but I suspect he's burning out because he seems like he needs direction.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
He doesn't know where to go from here because like he's making good money.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
He says he's got a mix, 80 to 90 percent of his income comes from a mix of long term clients and subcontracting.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
So he's got some diversified income there.

05:32.000 --> 05:44.000
So he doesn't actually really say quite what the problem is, but I'm guessing it's single point of failure, burnout, trying to think of how to make money without having to do so much of the hands on work himself, that kind of longer term thinking.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Yeah, a couple of things definitely jump out to me.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
One, how careful he is not to tell us the platform.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I bet it's Android.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
It's not Android.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
So the subcontracting thing kind of is a flag to me.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
That is almost certainly his lowest paying work and tell us if it's not.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
So I would start trying to phase that out and do more direct contracting at slightly higher rates.

06:05.000 --> 06:16.000
In terms of finding other developers, that's a dog's breakfast, man, because anybody, if it's a rare platform, anybody who could do it is not going to want to do it for less.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Oh, great point.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
And you need margin.

06:19.000 --> 06:26.000
Like really, you need like a lot of margin for that to make sense because people, people get sick, people screw up.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Do you really want to manage developers?

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
The other thing he didn't mention was productizing his stuff.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Sometimes that can be super helpful.

06:33.000 --> 06:42.000
Like back in the bad iOS development days and potentially in the future, we had productized like app shells that we would sell.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
So you write the app shell once.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
It's like a drop in, you know, you're a business.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
This is an app for you to I think we need someone for like pizzerias or something weird.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
And we would like sell it, license it to you for like two thousand dollars.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Right.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Instead of charging you for custom development.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
And that was really more of a sales problem where you could get someone who's like a biz dev guy to just sell that.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
And, you know, if you've ever seen Glengarry Glen Ross, get that boiler room running.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Right.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
So I don't know, man.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I mean, it's going to depend on the platform.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
If it's something like old and esoteric that not a lot of people know, I don't know what your margins are like.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I don't know if you're charging a lot or charging a little.

07:18.000 --> 07:27.000
But if you're not making, I would say like 50 percent above what you're paying, you're probably going to end up really not making too much profit given all the other costs.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And keep in mind, if you actually employ someone, there's lots of taxes.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, it's very it's very complicated, very quick.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
People cost a lot more than what you offer them when you hire them.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Right. Then it will vary by your state, too.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
So. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Yeah, that's all really sound.

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
You wonder, like, is his goal long term just to have a lifestyle business that makes enough money for him to be happy?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Right. That's really what's the goal there?

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
And maybe it's a maybe it's more of a curation of clients.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
And like you said, winding down some of the subcontracting.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah, that is a tricky one.

07:56.000 --> 08:04.000
I think your point is really sound that in that particular niche, if somebody is capable of doing it, they may just already be out doing it and they don't really need you.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
So, Chad, that's a good one.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Let us know where you go with it. Yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
And congratulations on going independent again.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I bet you that's a story I'd like to hear.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
Listener Chris writes and he says, I've been enjoying the show, but I have to ask who uses a laptop for development?

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
They make sense in times when the market leaves and they maybe have a good power per dollar as a custom system.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
But nothing compared to what you can get with a PC tower.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
And who really needs 20 hours of battery life when developing?

08:33.000 --> 08:41.000
Why would you want anything less than three screens in a machine that can execute tools and compile it as fast as possible, which only a desktop can do?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
That actually sounds like an older version of me.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
It's funny enough. I used to really be big on the go super powerful desktop.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Then go light and portable on the mobile.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Because my answer to that is, can't you have both?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah, I would just say get both. That's where I'm kind of.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Yeah, I mean, it's what you do, right?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
It's not like this. You're not joking around here.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
You're not kidding yourself.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
It's like you're so you're you're really committed to this.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
This is what you're doing and you want to make it work for you.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
All form factors. Mobile's critical.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah, I would say, especially if you're independent, like, you know, the plague aside, I used to spend like roughly a third of my time traveling.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
Right. So having a decent laptop that can do development without, you know, chugging was important.

09:20.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah, but yeah, that's I think, although I would argue I think a lot of like places that have developers are just buying Dell XPS and.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
At the Apple MacBook Pro's. Wow. Wow.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
What are those called? That was bad. Yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:43.000
I mean, I think it's if you could only buy one, I think you could if you could only buy one and mobile work is not a priority.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I think listen to Chris probably has a good point.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
You do get more bang for your buck with a PC.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
You know, I have a several year old PC as my primary workstation.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
It's now losing to the review machines that I bring in the laptops.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
But it took a while, you know, it took it really held its own for three years.

10:01.000 --> 10:07.000
And I could still throw in more disk, more GPU, more RAM.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
So it's like not even maxed out. It's not at the end of its life.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
And it's it's perfectly capable now.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.000
So I do feel like you get longer, longer of a work class machine when you go with a desktop tower with proper cooling and all of that.

10:20.000 --> 10:28.000
But the M1 and all of that may be changing some of that paradigm. If you just look at the benchmarks we're seeing now, it made some of that may be shifting.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
But we'll get to that. Linux Danish wrote in says, Hi, Chris and Mike.

10:32.000 --> 10:42.000
I wanted to comment on your Dark Matter developer discussion and get some feedback on the new points in the Apple Silicon discussion to the Dark Matter point.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
What do you call himself? Linux Danish?

10:43.000 --> 10:52.000
Yeah. Linux Danish maintains a couple of specific legacy IT systems supporting system engineers in a highly controlled and regulated industry.

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
We have benefits, regular hours, decent pay, bureaucracy and no Windows the whole nine yards.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
I don't think he means the OS kind. I think he means like actually no Windows.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Oh, I thought he legit meant Windows. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
It's a weird dunk on Windows for no reason.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
I'm not in the department doing the development all of the time.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I'm now headlining new products, so maybe it's different there.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
But for my team, the tyranny of the defaults tend to reign when we are choosing our tools.

11:22.000 --> 11:31.000
We can just use about any technology as long as it's included in the offline Visual Studio installer on the Red Hat ISO or the Windows ISO.

11:31.000 --> 11:40.000
Technically, we can go through the bureaucracy to get new things, but it's so much effort that it isn't really viewed as worth it most of the time.

11:40.000 --> 11:50.000
The end result is that it's a major deal for me when things are built in, whether they be tools like Git and Visual Studio, Python 3 or just standard libraries and language features.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
So so like when the vendor starts to ship it, it really makes a difference, even if it's been available online.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
That's an interesting point.

11:57.000 --> 12:05.000
Now to hardware, says I wanted to echo the experience of the MacBook owner who realized that he has been using the same laptop for years perfectly fine.

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
Only mine is a Windows laptop. It's a Dell Precision from 2014, and it's still trucking along just fine.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
Honestly, it can be kind of annoying when you're looking to upgrade.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
Maybe I should just start drinking coffee the way Mike does.

12:19.000 --> 12:30.000
Yeah, every episode. Apple Silicon, there is a lot of hubbub right now about how Apple has just revolutionized the tech industry beyond Raspberry Pi's and the Pine Book Pro.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
I'm not that familiar with the state of arm for general computing these days.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
My understanding was that most other vendors haven't been able to really match Apple's performance in their phones.

12:38.000 --> 12:47.000
Do you guys think that the rest of the industry will be able to release competitive ARM products or will Apple just end up the performance unicorn among the rest of the field?

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
And he has a little bit of bacon to fry, too.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
He says, due to the rise of system on a chips, he has a little conspiracy.

12:55.000 --> 13:04.000
Is everything going back to the pre IBM PC clone days, back when everything was in-house designed and purpose built for that specific system?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Or is it different this time? And if it is, why?

13:06.000 --> 13:15.000
Now, this is an interesting question because we actually got a couple of versions of this that came into the show over the week that essentially assert that Apple building

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
the silicon, Apple building the casing, Apple building the operating system, Apple building the cloud services.

13:22.000 --> 13:30.000
All of it is one cohesive more like Sun Microsystems than we have seen since Sun Microsystems.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Let's pour one out real quick for Sun.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Yep, there we go.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Still hit you, Oracle. Still hit you.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
I wonder if they are going to be a performance unicorn for a little bit.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
You know, because these M1 Macs, they're not making threadripper machines with 64 gigs of RAM and quad GPUs cry.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Let's not get ridiculous here.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
But they are making just about every laptop owner out there kind of look at their machine going, why can't you do that?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And some Mac Pro owners.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Who have seen some disappointing benchmarks.

14:00.000 --> 14:08.000
And we've seen TensorFlow update for the M1 and TensorFlow is saying very positive things, which we were really wondering how that was going to look on the M1 series.

14:08.000 --> 14:16.000
You know, what it fundamentally comes down to with some of these applications and the performance we're seeing is, and I said this in our analysis of the live event,

14:16.000 --> 14:23.000
is what we are seeing is Apple has executed on just about every key point of this transition.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
And I got to give them credit for doing a good job.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
They got Mac OS switched over to 64 bit.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
They ate that sandwich a couple of years ago.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
They started building in the security stuff that they needed.

14:35.000 --> 14:43.000
They've created APIs like Metal and Grand Central Dispatch that goes all the way back to core elements of how the operating system handles things.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Oh, GCD. That's so classic.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I thought you'd like that.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:58.000
But they've been laying this groundwork now for many Mac OS releases so that if the application relies on any of these built in APIs, it's accelerated.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
It's using native ARM code paths and it's getting any kind of CPU acceleration the OS can offer it.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
And I think that's a fascinating bit of pre-work that they did.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
And now here we are and you're running applications.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
And if the UI calls to Metal to render part of the UI, well, that's accelerated.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
If it uses GPU rendering to do some of the computation, that's accelerated, even if the app is x86.

15:20.000 --> 15:27.000
And so it's like they nailed, they fricking nailed x86 application performance.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And I just didn't see that.

15:29.000 --> 15:36.000
You know, I just I thought that would be the area where this transition was going to be the little bit that they didn't talk about.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
It was going to be the quiet part that nobody wanted to talk about.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
And it was the failure of the M1 transition as x86 code ran like dog snot.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
But the reality is they nailed the Rosetta transition.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
They got everything on the Mac OS in line and ready to go.

15:51.000 --> 15:58.000
They began iterating on multi-core and different system on a chip designs for iPad Pro years ago, which is was obviously in preparation for this.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Like they got all of these things right.

16:00.000 --> 16:07.000
And, you know, I'm I'm I got to I got to call I got to call an impressive play when I see it, even if it wasn't for my team.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I think Apple really nailed it.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
So let me give you some more Mac OS trivia.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Do you know? And since I'm asking the question, it should be obvious.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Which release of Mac OS GCD was released in?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I think it was Snow Leopard.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Yeah, of course it was Snow Leopard. Come on.

16:22.000 --> 16:28.000
Because I remember the whole thing was like, well, there was two things about Snow Leopard was that it was the big fix.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
It was like the no thing's really going to change. Big fix release.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
Oh, but by the way, we're introducing this entirely new way to manage processes and cores.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Right. So as a user, it's like we didn't change anything.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Everything is the same as a developer. It's like here's 4000 new APIs.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Have fun.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

16:46.000 --> 16:55.000
Today's episode of Coder Radio is indeed sponsored by Datadog, which is the monitoring and analytics platform for cloud scale infrastructure and applications.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Do you know how your applications and services are performing right now?

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
What about the ones that are across different service providers or in containers?

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
You can see inside any stack, any app at any scale anywhere with Datadog.

17:06.000 --> 17:15.000
They've been around since 2010, and their founders set out to solve the problem of system administrators and developers not being able to communicate and having the same set of data to work from.

17:15.000 --> 17:24.000
And from that, they just created this beautiful dashboard system you can use with now machine learning based alerts, customizable dashboards, over 400 vendor integrations.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
It makes it really easy to bring in all these different sources of data.

17:28.000 --> 17:36.000
And then you can pivot and move between the metrics and events for fast troubleshooting when you need it for that or when you need to know how an application is performing for development.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
And it's all in one place.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
And Datadog also gives you observability into things like container performance.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
So if you have applications running inside your container, you can see how each individual container and application is doing inside there.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
It's definitely worth a try.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Try it for free for 14 days when you go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
And if you set up a dashboard or install the agent, you get a free t-shirt.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
But you got to go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
You can see it all in one place with Datadog.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
Datadog.com slash coderadio.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
So, Mr. Dominic, are you still on Big Sur?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
How did that go for you?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I know last week you just done the install.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
And did you rip it off there or are you?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Nope.

18:19.000 --> 18:19.000
I am.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
You know what?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I'm making a major life change.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I am saying yes to Big Sur.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
What?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Inappropriate.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Really?

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
You know, at this time of year, we often say what we're thankful for.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
In my case, that would not be self-control.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
OK.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
So, allow me to tab out over here.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
Allow us to go to the holiest of sites, store.apple.com.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Oh, boy.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Now, we go to Mac because I'm not you.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I'm not buying a HomePod.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
We're greeted by a MacBook Air and a MacBook Pro.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
All right.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
I'm going to go.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
I'm going to go see this.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Store.apple.com.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
All right.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Now, which one are you considering right now?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
So, originally, I was considering the Pro.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
OK.

19:05.000 --> 19:14.000
But in what I can only describe as a Urza-like feverish research tangent and lots and lots

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
of YouTube videos.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Familiar with this process myself?

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
It seems to be that the difference between the Pro and the Air is like a fan.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Right.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
And they can actually get roughly the same-ish performance.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
Now, we were just talking about with the listener who wrote in how we like beefy workstations

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
but then nice, small, thin laptops, right?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Yep.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
So, I think I'm going to Air with a hesitation.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
I heard one kind of sketch review site was saying that the Air screen is dimmer.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I think they typically are a little bit dimmer than the Pro screen.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Hmm.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
But do you ever run them at 100% brightness?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah, because I'm freaking blind.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Oh, OK.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
But, I mean, how bad?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah, you know what?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
It's probably fine.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
So, then we're in the Air.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Mm-hmm.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
Now, I notoriously don't keep my laptops for a very long time.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
True.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.000
They sometimes have unfortunate smelting accidents or smoking accidents or mixology accidents

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
and, more recently, green tea accidents.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I mean, we could just say accidents in general, right?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
I mean, you know.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
True.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
I like to make sure the audience knows that I vary my destructive patterns with Apple

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
laptops.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Fair, fair.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
So, you're greeted by, first of all, an embarrassing default configuration of 8 gigs of RAM and

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
6 SSD.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Yeah.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
I don't use a lot of storage because, you know, most of my stuff is just, like, code.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
But 8 gigs of RAM, ugh.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Can you really tolerate that?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
And you can never upgrade it.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And you can never, ever upgrade it, right?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Yeah.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
So, you know.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
So, I think what I'm going to do is take the base model, double that RAM.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
OK, I'm following along.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
So, base MacBook Air with 16 gigabytes of unified memory.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Yeah, I don't care about storage because I honestly never use a lot of storage.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So, you're going to leave it at 256?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
You're not even...

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I'm going to leave it at 256.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Wow, OK.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
Well, because if you look at it, if you up the storage, it's actually insane not to take

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
the other.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Oh, no, it isn't because they don't give you the RAM.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
They don't give you the RAM upgrade by default on the more expensive model.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
No.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
These cheap bastards.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Come on.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
It's 2020.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
Well, I think this is, you know, I mean, the Air traditionally has been the Facebook

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
machine.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
This is not the Facebook machine.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
It was, you know, the homework machine, but now it is, you know, now it's, well, things

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
have changed.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
It's the junk on the XPS machine.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Yeah, well.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Oh, I want this in silver.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Hmm.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
See, it's a tough call.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
You know what?

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
No, I'm going to go with the I'm going to go with the base, this 256.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I don't need it.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Yeah.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Yeah.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
All right.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
So, final cut.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Get that nonsense out of here.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Don't need that.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Nope.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Then we click add to bag.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
$1,200, which, you know, AppleCare.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
No.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Who would need that?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
That.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
What kind of monster?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
And then we.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
It thinks I'm in Canada.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Wait.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
Did I go to store.apple.ca like an idiot?

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
You know, you wanted it with that honorary maple syrup that they include with every.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I just wanted it to, like, be nice to me.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And it's coming on Christmas.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Really?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yeah.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
December 17th to 24th.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Well, happy, you know, happy Merry Christmas days to you.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
So you're going to go with the MacBook Air 16 gigs of RAM 256.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
That's a pretty decent build because you're not going crazy.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
You could go with something that's way more expensive, which would probably be probably

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
be too much with this generation because, you know, they're going to quickly get replaced

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
and probably with superior housings and touchscreens and whatnot.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
So probably a good call not to just max it out.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah, I don't think maxing it out would actually make sense only because I have.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh, my God.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
I can't do Apple Pay because I upgraded my iPhone and don't have the old phone.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Apple is Optimus Gray things.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
It's actually between the Canadian store and the Apple Pay checkout option.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
He thinks it's Apple just trying to slow your roll.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Apple's like, you know what?

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
This guy.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
We love our air.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
We're not.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
You can't have one.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Like you're.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
We know this guy.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
This guy's out of control.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
So I open my iPhone and OK, we're ordered.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Why did I have to do that on my phone?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Really?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
That's interesting.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
That was odd.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
So it's ordered just like that.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Just like that.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Boy, they make it easy to spend money.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Yes.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
And they don't test if you've been drinking either, which I'm sure is a feature for them.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
I'll tell you, I have also decided on a laptop myself.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
You tease.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I told you I was in that phase.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
You know, I was trying to figure it out.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
I used to have a ThinkPad T480, but had to send that back with, you know, going independent

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
again.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
I was trying to figure out what was the right machine for me.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
And I wanted to see what Apple had to offer with the ARM processors because I'm going

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
to spend my hard-earned money.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
I want to spend it once and I want to get the maximum value that I can.

23:57.000 --> 24:03.000
And I just recently had that Dell Precision 5570, I think it is, which is a monster multi,

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
you know, 64 gigs of RAM, big old GPU, monster Xeon CPU.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Right.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
17 inch high DPI screen.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Infinity edge to edge, just gorgeous.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
And I could really see myself enjoying a laptop like that.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
You know, if I'm going to go big, it's a big, it's the thinnest, it's the world's thinnest

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
big laptop.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
And I could really enjoy it.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
But I don't need a Quadro video card.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
No, really nobody does, right?

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
No, and that's what I've been trying to figure out is, so what I've been stuck on for a long

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
time is do I need a dedicated GPU or not?

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
I like the idea that if, you know, I was going to maybe play a game with the kid, I could

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
just crack open my laptop anywhere and GPU is good to go, can just start playing.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
But the reality is it happens, that is a rarity.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
It's more like we plan to do it and then we sit down and do it.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
And I have this eGPU enclosure, which I invested money in and I use it as a dock.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
So I'd have to come up with some other solution if I got a laptop with a video card.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
And I invested in a video card a couple of generations ago.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
I could just replace that video card and then my other systems that have Thunderbolt also

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
get a new video card.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
That's a nice feature.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
But of course, the new Macs don't support eGPUs.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Oh, boy.

25:16.000 --> 25:23.000
I looked really, really, really hard at the updated recently Galago Pro.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
But I ultimately, you know, was playing with combinations there and I just really can't,

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
I couldn't come to a configuration that I ultimately wanted to pull the trigger on.

25:32.000 --> 25:40.000
So I have narrowed down my list of laptops, but ultimately I think the one I'm going to

25:40.000 --> 25:47.000
pull the trigger on, I'm waiting until Black Friday, is the ThinkPad X1 Carbon preloaded

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
with Fedora.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
You're such a hipster.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Fedora.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
I know.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
I know.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
And I think that'll be the laptop.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I haven't decided for sure.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
I'm still kind of kicking around.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
I'm also considering, like if there was a brand new updated Meerkat, I think I would

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
consider going with that and then building it into a desk.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
But, you know, you're looking now, when you go to buy a laptop, it's really, it's not,

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
there's not anything that really quite hits my perfect spot for a machine because I'd

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
like something that is portable, that has good battery life.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
And if it's going to have Intel, I'd like the absolute latest Intel processors.

26:22.000 --> 26:28.000
And the majority of the market seems to have 10th gen processors and 11th are the latest.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
I think out of all of them, the only other one that I'd most seriously consider would

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
be the Galago Pro right now.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
But I'm not 100% convinced yet on which way to go.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
So I think I'm going with the X1, but I haven't decided yet.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
I may end up waiting.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
I don't know.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
We'll see.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
I mean, now that you've got this, I'd like to hear your experience with it.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
It is always fun.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
There's a collector aspect in me that's always thinks it'd be nice to have the first ARM

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
generation of something that seems kind of appealing, but it's not enough reason for

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
me to pull the trigger on that.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
So I'm just curious, like why Fedora?

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Like is Fedora, I guess, well, you could, you could wipe out any machine and put Fedora

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
on it anyway, I guess.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
Well, in part because that's what it's loaded with.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Okay.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
That's what I was asking.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Was it like a feature that it was preloaded with Fedora or?

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Yeah.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
And I sort of want, part of it is I kind of want to do an advocacy purchase a little bit.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
There's that component of it is to sort of register with Lenovo, Hey, this ThinkPad,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
you know, with Fedora loaded on it.

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
And it also, or you can choose Ubuntu also.

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
And I may keep Fedora on there very likely just to sort of run it as an experiment a

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
bit.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.880
It's sort of, there is that sort of, I don't know if journalism is the right, but there's

27:33.880 --> 27:36.000
that curiosity that wants to then talk about it.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Yeah.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Chris, we're journalists.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Oh yeah.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Oh yeah.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Buying laptops.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Oh yeah.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.180
But whatever you call, there's like that, I want to explore and then discuss it.

27:45.180 --> 27:48.000
And I want to, I want to have that experience because that's the product.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.960
And I like the idea of registering to vote with Lenovo and saying, yes, thank you for

27:51.960 --> 27:52.960
supporting Linux.

27:52.960 --> 27:56.200
But I'm not sure because the Dell XPS line is very tempting as well.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.840
Dude, I saw somebody with one.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.440
Those are so nice.

27:59.440 --> 28:06.720
The thing is, and this is where the Galago and the XPS have not quite got me, is on the

28:06.720 --> 28:09.900
X1 Carbon, I can get a 2K resolution screen.

28:09.900 --> 28:10.900
You have all the options.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.320
You can go to 1080p.

28:12.320 --> 28:13.320
You can do 4K.

28:13.320 --> 28:14.600
Oh, that's really cool.

28:14.600 --> 28:18.400
I've wanted a 2K laptop screen for years.

28:18.400 --> 28:22.240
For years and years, I've wanted it because I love it on my desktop, just absolutely love

28:22.240 --> 28:23.240
it on Linux.

28:23.240 --> 28:28.640
I just think it's the perfect resolution for desktop Linux on a 2K, on a 27 inch screen

28:28.640 --> 28:30.560
is bliss for me.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.520
And 2K on a laptop screen, I think would also be really great.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.680
It would be the same size, but I still think it'd be really great.

28:35.680 --> 28:39.200
And that's an area where the X1 is nudging ahead.

28:39.200 --> 28:44.280
Plus it has Thunderbolt so I could still take advantage of my eGPU, which the Galago Pro

28:44.280 --> 28:46.240
has Thunderbolt 4.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.760
So that's also very tempting.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.760
Yes, it does.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.520
And it does work.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.560
So yeah, there you go.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.760
So you're going to be getting the MacBook.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.480
I'll probably be getting, I'm going to either get, I'm either going to end up with one of

28:57.480 --> 29:02.160
those two laptops, but I think I'm leaning the X1 so that way I can kind of do an advocacy

29:02.160 --> 29:03.160
purchase.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
That does sound nice.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.800
The 2K, I didn't know what came with the 2K screen.

29:05.800 --> 29:06.800
That's...

29:06.800 --> 29:07.800
Yeah.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.400
The 2K, being able to register a vote for a Linux machine.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.760
And I've had a thing, I've just had a ThinkPad and it worked really well for me.

29:13.760 --> 29:14.760
So...

29:14.760 --> 29:15.760
Yeah.

29:15.760 --> 29:17.440
People keep suggesting I buy ThinkPads because they're sturdy.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.080
Let me assure you guys, I will find a way.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.080
Yeah.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.080
They're fine.

29:22.080 --> 29:23.080
Yeah.

29:23.080 --> 29:26.160
My takeaway review is I liked mine and I would do it again, but I would like a better screen

29:26.160 --> 29:30.160
and I would like it not to be so thick, but yeah.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.160
So there you go.

29:31.160 --> 29:35.560
Although I won't, I'll be, mine will be like another fugue state of research like you just

29:35.560 --> 29:42.640
went through and watching some videos, calling a few people and then I'll be making my purchase,

29:42.640 --> 29:47.560
but I'm probably going to wait, take the holiday and then check on Black Friday sales and try

29:47.560 --> 29:48.560
to pull the trigger.

29:48.560 --> 29:49.560
Damn.

29:49.560 --> 29:50.560
I don't know, man.

29:50.560 --> 29:51.560
Sorry.

29:51.560 --> 29:52.560
The 2K screen.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.560
That's kind of a thing.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.560
It's really nice.

29:54.560 --> 30:00.640
So moving on to things that will hopefully bring me roughly $1,200 that I just spent.

30:00.640 --> 30:03.760
Apple is reducing the app store cut to 15%.

30:03.760 --> 30:08.520
That will be great for the 98% of developers who make no money.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.520
Yeah.

30:09.520 --> 30:13.440
Yeah, because if you really look at it, it's just a few whales in the app store and then

30:13.440 --> 30:14.440
everybody else.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.760
This is like karate kid level jujitsu here, right?

30:17.760 --> 30:22.520
They get all these happy indie developers, myself included, and still get to say F you

30:22.520 --> 30:23.520
to Epic games.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.520
Yeah.

30:24.520 --> 30:28.760
And it's, I mean, it's nice because if you make less than a million dollars, you just

30:28.760 --> 30:32.000
got, you just got Apple's tax cut in half basically.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.440
So it's less than a million from the app store by the way.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.440
Right.

30:36.440 --> 30:40.000
And like, I don't know, be a consulting business, right?

30:40.000 --> 30:44.400
Though I don't make that much money because I'm sad, but they call it the new small business

30:44.400 --> 30:47.360
program and it will go into effect January 1st, 2021.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.360
Oh, really?

30:48.360 --> 30:53.640
I thought the way they sent the press release out was Tim Cook emailed Tim Sweeney, subject

30:53.640 --> 30:54.640
line F U.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.760
They just sent him a PDF.

30:57.760 --> 30:58.760
Yeah.

30:58.760 --> 31:03.400
Um, you know, I, you gotta wonder, you gotta wonder if they're not looking at going, so

31:03.400 --> 31:05.800
can we set up some LCs here or what?

31:05.800 --> 31:07.720
So I did say I had another surprise, right?

31:07.720 --> 31:09.200
I'm just going to go ahead and leak it.

31:09.200 --> 31:14.720
I am looking for a few good beta testers in the next 60 days for an iOS app.

31:14.720 --> 31:15.720
Oh, yes.

31:15.720 --> 31:16.720
Whoa.

31:16.720 --> 31:21.160
Um, and maybe I'll send you some vintage quarter radio coasters cause I found a box of them.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.160
Nice.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.000
The old, old logo at the green one actually.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.640
So I got one in the studio.

31:25.640 --> 31:30.560
I have my T on one right now actually, cause these guys have held up for like, I don't

31:30.560 --> 31:31.560
know.

31:31.560 --> 31:32.560
We bought them five years ago.

31:32.560 --> 31:36.760
I know this thing is actually taking some serious spills and it's here that's still

31:36.760 --> 31:37.760
strong.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.760
I'm sorry.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.720
You don't think mine have taken spills, right?

31:41.720 --> 31:42.720
Of course.

31:42.720 --> 31:47.520
So why can't Epic just be like, we're awesome games, LLC and like every year just open a

31:47.520 --> 31:49.360
new LLC and be like, ha ha.

31:49.360 --> 31:50.360
Yeah.

31:50.360 --> 31:51.360
I don't know.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.560
I think the only gotcha is if you made a million dollars from the app store at any point in

31:54.560 --> 31:58.240
the year prior, then you're disqualified for the following year.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.480
So you would still keep it.

31:59.480 --> 32:04.400
So like if in March you made a million and $1, it would be in January that you lose the

32:04.400 --> 32:05.400
break.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.600
I think so.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.000
Which seems nuts to me.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Yeah.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Yeah.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.480
But can you believe this though?

32:12.480 --> 32:13.480
Can you believe this has happened?

32:13.480 --> 32:14.480
A fifth?

32:14.480 --> 32:17.200
This has been the unmovable object since forever.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.620
Since we started this show, this is the 30% cut has been unmovable.

32:20.620 --> 32:25.320
It's gotta be the pressure from, from Congress and you know, the DOJ and all that kind of

32:25.320 --> 32:26.320
stuff, right?

32:26.320 --> 32:27.320
It's gotta be preemptive action.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.000
Kind of is a significant change.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.240
The economics of the platform because 15% is like still crazy if you like have your

32:34.240 --> 32:38.480
own credit card processing, but uh, you know, it's not that bad, right?

32:38.480 --> 32:42.000
You can, you can kind of make that work better than a third.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.480
Well, it's 15% for one of the most high value app stores literally in the world.

32:47.480 --> 32:51.760
They manage the CDN, they manage the storefront, they manage the payment processing.

32:51.760 --> 32:54.320
They do the marketing for better, for worse.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.040
Like they do all of that for that 15% now.

32:57.040 --> 33:02.800
I mean, when it was 30%, it was like, ah, that seems like a little too much, uh, 15%.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.860
Honestly that's, if you think about it in terms of what it would actually cost to feature

33:05.860 --> 33:09.280
an application in a brick and mortar store back in the nineties and eighties, welcome

33:09.280 --> 33:10.280
to Babbage's.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.400
It was more like 50%, right?

33:11.400 --> 33:12.400
It was much more.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.400
Yeah.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.400
Well, they're a best buy used to really screw developers.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.600
It was like you got 30, it was like the other way, right?

33:17.600 --> 33:18.600
They got 70.

33:18.600 --> 33:23.040
How about, remember the old, uh, well, I might be going inside baseball, but so before kids,

33:23.040 --> 33:27.960
before smartphones, there was a programming language called Java that was made by a wonderful

33:27.960 --> 33:31.560
company named Sun that we're all, again, pouring one out.

33:31.560 --> 33:32.560
Yep.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.560
I'm sorry.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.560
Damn it.

33:34.560 --> 33:38.440
Um, it just, you know, cuts me every time twice in one episode too.

33:38.440 --> 33:39.880
God damn it.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.360
What's wrong with you?

33:41.360 --> 33:46.160
Uh, there used to be these Java, was it Emmy micro edition?

33:46.160 --> 33:47.160
Am I right?

33:47.160 --> 33:48.160
Oh yes.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.160
Yes.

33:49.160 --> 33:54.640
And you know, I did some Java Emmy development way back when it was the transition from evil

33:54.640 --> 34:00.760
applets to iOS and the deal was the company would like make an app and the only way to

34:00.760 --> 34:06.080
get it was to deal with Verizon, which you can imagine how awesome that could be.

34:06.080 --> 34:11.720
And literally the company who make, made the quote unquote app got like 20% of the revenue.

34:11.720 --> 34:12.720
Yeah.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.520
It was the same thing for a Palm pilot, right?

34:14.520 --> 34:15.520
Like, yep.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.520
Yep.

34:16.520 --> 34:20.040
It was literally controlled by the carrier, which is just how things worked back then.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.040
Yeah.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.040
Oh, and it's Verizon.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.520
Just like you were too small or whatever.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.520
Sorry.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.520
Sorry.

34:25.520 --> 34:26.520
Yeah.

34:26.520 --> 34:27.520
Yeah.

34:27.520 --> 34:28.520
So, yeah.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.240
And then there was no mobile web to speak of.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.720
There was the baby web.

34:31.720 --> 34:32.720
Oh my God.

34:32.720 --> 34:35.960
The a text only browser on your little flip phone.

34:35.960 --> 34:36.960
Yeah.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.440
So you know who's not happy about this though?

34:38.440 --> 34:39.440
Huh?

34:39.440 --> 34:41.320
The creator of Ruby on rails, DHH.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.840
He's who spicy Twitter feed.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.780
About the cut in price.

34:45.780 --> 34:46.780
About the cut.

34:46.780 --> 34:47.780
Yeah.

34:47.780 --> 34:48.780
Yeah.

34:48.780 --> 34:49.780
What is the logic for that?

34:49.780 --> 34:55.580
His whole point is Apple's doing this to hopefully duck, you know, antitrust and because only

34:55.580 --> 34:57.700
big developers actually make the money.

34:57.700 --> 35:00.040
So they're getting a bunch of goodwill and not losing money.

35:00.040 --> 35:01.040
Well, how was that?

35:01.040 --> 35:02.040
How was that bad though?

35:02.040 --> 35:04.240
Well, he wants them to open up to other payment products, right?

35:04.240 --> 35:08.120
Like, Oh, so he wants, he wants them not to do this change.

35:08.120 --> 35:12.880
So that way they get in trouble by federal regulators and then they're forced to go,

35:12.880 --> 35:13.880
right?

35:13.880 --> 35:14.880
Right.

35:14.880 --> 35:18.360
And that's always how those things go is they always go best case scenario when regulators

35:18.360 --> 35:22.860
get involved versus a company who just proactively makes the change.

35:22.860 --> 35:27.760
They would most nominally be negotiated from some sort of federal investigation anyways,

35:27.760 --> 35:29.120
and does it ahead of time.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.880
Federal government never has to get involved.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.600
Company makes change and users win, but I mean, well, who, what do I know?

35:34.600 --> 35:35.600
Right?

35:35.600 --> 35:38.040
This is like Apple saw the writing on the wall and was like, all right, may a cold,

35:38.040 --> 35:40.240
but let's just do this right.

35:40.240 --> 35:43.720
And also there's the rumor, I don't know if you caught this one, that they're gonna in

35:43.720 --> 35:48.160
the iOS set up flow when you're starting, uh, starting, you know, like getting on your

35:48.160 --> 35:53.400
phone out of the box, they're apparently in the, this is, I heard through the grapevine

35:53.400 --> 35:58.440
going to start suggesting third party apps for defaults, actively suggesting them.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.920
So like they're basically saying, DOJ, please don't hurt me.

36:00.920 --> 36:01.920
Right?

36:01.920 --> 36:02.920
Browser banner.

36:02.920 --> 36:03.920
Oh dude.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.420
I didn't even crap.

36:06.420 --> 36:07.920
Everything comes back to IE six.

36:07.920 --> 36:08.920
Yeah.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.000
It's the preemptive browser banner before they're told to do it.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.200
Just like Google has the search auction in some EU markets.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.200
Yeah.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.200
So I don't know.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.200
I actually am excited about this.

36:17.200 --> 36:21.760
I think with the new arm unification with, I think if long time listeners of the show

36:21.760 --> 36:26.560
know, I pretty much think the iPad is probably the best computer for lots of nonenthusiast

36:26.560 --> 36:27.560
people.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.280
And I'm, I'm gonna try it again.

36:30.280 --> 36:34.560
I'm dipping my toes back into the iOS tool and you will pry my objective C from my cold

36:34.560 --> 36:35.560
dead.

36:35.560 --> 36:39.280
Now I'm doing swift and I'm really crying in the shower quite a bit.

36:39.280 --> 36:43.920
I'll tell you what would really be a game changer is if it turns out to be doable to

36:43.920 --> 36:45.580
get Linux on these things for me.

36:45.580 --> 36:49.040
And that would be great because Linus talked about it.

36:49.040 --> 36:53.160
He, he posted it earlier that, uh, he, uh, he thinks these Mac books would be great if

36:53.160 --> 36:54.160
you can get Linux on them.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.720
And so I thought, okay, that's kind of interesting idea.

36:56.720 --> 37:00.920
And then I saw this interview with a, your good buddy, your pal, Craig Federici there.

37:00.920 --> 37:01.920
Getting a little hot over here.

37:01.920 --> 37:02.920
Hang on.

37:02.920 --> 37:06.920
He said, and I quote, there's nothing technically preventing windows from running on the M1

37:06.920 --> 37:07.920
Macs.

37:07.920 --> 37:08.920
Yeah.

37:08.920 --> 37:12.520
Microsoft just, and you know how good Microsoft is at getting windows 10 on arm.

37:12.520 --> 37:13.520
Ooh.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.520
No, no, no.

37:14.520 --> 37:18.080
That means then if you can get windows running on it, then you can get Linux running on it.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.080
Yeah.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.080
Well, didn't you see the Linux iPad thing?

37:20.080 --> 37:21.080
No, no.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.080
Is this a thing?

37:22.080 --> 37:23.080
This is a thing.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.080
How did I not see this?

37:24.080 --> 37:26.320
Like, I don't know why it exists, but someone is trying to make that.

37:26.320 --> 37:27.320
Huh.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.320
I don't know about that, man.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.880
They showed Linux running on it.

37:29.880 --> 37:30.880
No, no.

37:30.880 --> 37:31.880
Yeah.

37:31.880 --> 37:32.880
That was in VM.

37:32.880 --> 37:33.880
Oh, it was in a VM.

37:33.880 --> 37:34.880
Okay.

37:34.880 --> 37:35.880
CFED's talking about running it natively.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.680
You just got to write the drivers, I guess.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.960
I mean, I don't know exactly how that would work.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.640
Listen, if you could, you know what?

37:42.640 --> 37:47.120
I believe in the Linux hippies.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.480
Linode.com slash coder.

37:48.480 --> 37:52.200
Go there to receive a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.680
Linode.com slash coder.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.680
Linode is my cloud provider.

37:56.680 --> 38:00.720
I discovered them a couple of years ago after I started working and I thought, you know

38:00.720 --> 38:01.720
what?

38:01.720 --> 38:05.800
I better, I better set up my own servers that aren't mixed in with the business stuff now

38:05.800 --> 38:07.600
that I'm an employee.

38:07.600 --> 38:11.060
I went over to try out Linode because I'd seen them at Linux Fest and just about every

38:11.060 --> 38:14.920
other event I have attended and I've known about them because they've been around forever.

38:14.920 --> 38:19.040
In fact, Linode was one of the very first cloud providers.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.040
One of the first.

38:20.040 --> 38:24.080
They beat AWS by three years, so they've been around for a little while and I was familiar

38:24.080 --> 38:26.120
with them and I thought, I'll go try them out.

38:26.120 --> 38:30.020
So I went over to Linode and I signed up for an account and I'll say my expectations were

38:30.020 --> 38:34.120
high because I was pretty familiar with what the other vendors offered for configuration

38:34.120 --> 38:37.400
and management and they exceeded my expectations.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.600
And I stuck with them for a couple of years and by the time Jupyter Broadcasting was going

38:40.600 --> 38:44.920
independent again, there was just no question where I was going to deploy the new work infrastructure,

38:44.920 --> 38:47.400
the new systems that we had to set up.

38:47.400 --> 38:50.460
Linode is my cloud hosting provider and I host all of the new infrastructure that we're

38:50.460 --> 38:52.760
building for Jupyter Broadcasting 3.0.

38:52.760 --> 38:57.480
It's got native SSD storage, 40 gigabit network connections, a revamped easy to use cloud

38:57.480 --> 38:58.480
manager.

38:58.480 --> 39:02.120
I love the cloud dashboard, but honestly, you know what I just kind of use super, super

39:02.120 --> 39:04.280
fast and quick all the time?

39:04.280 --> 39:06.580
Is Linode command line interface.

39:06.580 --> 39:11.500
You can get a command line interface really easy to set up and then you can set, like

39:11.500 --> 39:17.040
what I do is I set ACLs or upload object files all the time for the object storage.

39:17.040 --> 39:22.240
If I play a sound, that right there, that came from an object storage, how about that?

39:22.240 --> 39:26.200
Yeah, it's really cool and I use the command line to just take care of all that stuff,

39:26.200 --> 39:30.260
but you can spin machines up and down if you don't want to use the dashboard.

39:30.260 --> 39:33.040
And their costs are really impressive.

39:33.040 --> 39:37.600
They're 30 to 50% less than major cloud providers like AWS or Google.

39:37.600 --> 39:41.060
They have 11 data centers around the world, so you can pick something that's close to

39:41.060 --> 39:44.840
you or something that's close to a client, or maybe you want something spread out and

39:44.840 --> 39:49.360
do a little redundancy, but with machines starting at $5 a month, why not?

39:49.360 --> 39:54.360
They have machines that go up from there with dedicated GPUs and CPUs and lots of RAM.

39:54.360 --> 39:59.280
Over the weekend, I set up a new server just within a couple of clicks, eight gigs of RAM,

39:59.280 --> 40:02.460
dedicated CPU, and I set it up in Dallas, Texas because I kind of wanted it in a nice

40:02.460 --> 40:05.680
central point in the States.

40:31.340 --> 40:39.920
This week, Stadia announced that it will be playable on iOS in Safari via a progressive

40:39.920 --> 40:44.800
web app, which I totally suggested and I said, I don't know how it'd be possible in a coder

40:44.800 --> 40:49.800
radio not too long ago, because you just think about the size of data that they have to transfer

40:49.800 --> 40:53.960
and what Safari's limits are, but they're making it work.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.680
And they have a dedicated app now, but it's just like a little hub that lets you see your

40:57.680 --> 41:02.760
friends and your inventory, kind of basic.

41:02.760 --> 41:07.120
And so they're going to open up to public testing and you're going to be able to play

41:07.120 --> 41:10.320
your Stadia games that nobody uses in their browser.

41:10.320 --> 41:13.600
I think Amazon's Luna gaming service is also doing this.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.600
So I actually have Stadia.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.380
No, I know, I do too.

41:16.380 --> 41:17.380
You don't want it.

41:17.380 --> 41:21.740
It's kind of impressive that they got this working in iOS Safari, like the tech, I would

41:21.740 --> 41:24.540
love to hear more about the tech, but yeah, it's, you know.

41:24.540 --> 41:27.800
That's kind of how I felt about it is it is actually technically very impressive.

41:27.800 --> 41:31.200
Like I think over the years we've lamented Google killing products.

41:31.200 --> 41:41.140
You know what, if Stadia has got to go, yeah, yeah, I got it because I thought, you know,

41:41.140 --> 41:44.640
this could be the great equalizer that would equalize no more.

41:44.640 --> 41:49.040
This again, going back to this laptop thing where it's like, do I need a GPU or not?

41:49.040 --> 41:51.840
Well, no, not if Stadia can stream at all.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.140
Yeah, it's doable.

41:53.140 --> 41:55.160
The tech is doable.

41:55.160 --> 41:56.840
I bought Red Dead Redemption.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.600
It's not, it's playable.

41:58.600 --> 41:59.600
It's fine.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.720
I briefly had like the Super Pro and I got to play Metro, but it was crap.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.880
Like it really suffers from bandwidth fluctuations.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.160
Yes, it does.

42:07.160 --> 42:13.400
I have played it over mobile in the woods and yeah, I just thought I wanted to try to

42:13.400 --> 42:14.840
see if it was technically possible.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.280
It's camping Chris Fisher style.

42:16.280 --> 42:20.880
I'm just in the woods playing Red Dead Redemption.

42:20.880 --> 42:23.560
And when the game starts up, it's a heavy snow scene.

42:23.560 --> 42:28.860
So the compression just, yeah, and so, and it was, it was mixed results for sure.

42:28.860 --> 42:31.680
But I was impressed it was even technically possible.

42:31.680 --> 42:35.780
I even was on board with OnLive back in the day, which was a different streaming service

42:35.780 --> 42:37.720
that required a dedicated application.

42:37.720 --> 42:38.720
Also didn't work.

42:38.720 --> 42:39.720
Yeah.

42:39.720 --> 42:42.200
I mean, it worked okay, but it's like, it's better for some kinds of games and other kinds

42:42.200 --> 42:43.200
of games.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.200
And yeah.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.920
But you know, this is the way it's going.

42:45.920 --> 42:49.220
PlayStation has a streaming service, Microsoft has a streaming service.

42:49.220 --> 42:53.600
How can that be when we have duopolies or in a lot of cases, monopolies in the US for

42:53.600 --> 42:54.600
bandwidth?

42:54.600 --> 42:57.680
So can you explain how, um, hashtag 5g?

42:57.680 --> 42:58.680
I don't know.

42:58.680 --> 42:59.680
Okay.

42:59.680 --> 43:00.680
Yeah.

43:00.680 --> 43:06.520
I, it is, it is funny because it's like, um, for some people it's hard to even watch a

43:06.520 --> 43:12.360
streaming video, let alone a game that often requires more bandwidth and lower latency.

43:12.360 --> 43:14.400
And it's, it's bi-directional.

43:14.400 --> 43:19.280
I might be going to my data center just to like watch Netflix and 4k off the dedicated

43:19.280 --> 43:20.280
fiber.

43:20.280 --> 43:21.280
I know.

43:21.280 --> 43:22.280
Right.

43:22.280 --> 43:24.800
I, it is, it's a, it's a, it's a bad situation.

43:24.800 --> 43:27.860
And when we say all this and the listeners that listen outside the States, they always

43:27.860 --> 43:32.680
like to write in and jab us a little bit for like their, so it's like greetings from Israel

43:32.680 --> 43:36.080
or any other country with an internet policy that actually makes sense.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.080
Right.

43:37.080 --> 43:40.640
The reason why I threw Stadia out a while ago as maybe they should make a progressive

43:40.640 --> 43:46.380
web app is it sort of felt like a Hail Mary kind of, kind of solution to an apps for problem

43:46.380 --> 43:52.080
that just seems impossible because this 15% that Apple has done here doesn't solve the

43:52.080 --> 43:59.320
other problems that developers like Epic and Google and Microsoft have where, um, as an

43:59.320 --> 44:04.520
iOS user, I don't, I mean, I actually may use Stadia more if I could play it on my iPad.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.520
I really might.

44:05.520 --> 44:08.080
I mean, you must have much better bandwidth than I do.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.080
I mean, I'm on Comcast.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.720
I mean, it's all right.

44:10.720 --> 44:14.920
I mean, at home I'm on cellular, so I can't do it there, but here, right, right.

44:14.920 --> 44:15.920
Yeah.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.400
I mean, I mean, I don't know.

44:17.400 --> 44:20.600
I actually think I do have just based on our recording data.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.840
I think I do have it, but no, I think you actually do.

44:22.840 --> 44:23.840
Right.

44:23.840 --> 44:24.840
Like it's, but it's not great.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.320
It's not like the best of the best.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.320
Huh?

44:27.320 --> 44:31.200
Like right now, my average latency to Google servers, my, my, my, my ping milliseconds

44:31.200 --> 44:32.200
is 20.

44:32.200 --> 44:33.200
That's kind of high.

44:33.200 --> 44:37.120
Of course, I'm also live streaming and doing a video call with you at the same time.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.120
True.

44:38.120 --> 44:41.920
I am using the internet for other things, but transcoding shots of Federici on buttoning

44:41.920 --> 44:42.920
a shirt.

44:42.920 --> 44:43.920
Oh, geez.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.480
Just him opening up that Mac book over and over again on loop.

44:46.480 --> 44:47.480
That was weird.

44:47.480 --> 44:50.280
I, you know, every, you know, I think Apple was saying mean this, they're like, they're,

44:50.280 --> 44:52.160
they're trying to create the meme opportunities.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.160
Yeah.

44:53.160 --> 44:56.400
Well, there was a hashtag Federici for four days, so he got it.

44:56.400 --> 44:57.400
Yeah.

44:57.400 --> 44:58.400
Well, yeah.

44:58.400 --> 45:05.160
Hey, I guess it sells max actually, uh, snark aside, I should just be better about this.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.080
Like, he seems like the perfect guy to run that position.

45:07.080 --> 45:08.200
Like he really knows his stuff.

45:08.200 --> 45:09.200
He's got passion for it.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.200
Oh no.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.200
I used to doing a great job.

45:11.200 --> 45:12.200
Yeah.

45:12.200 --> 45:14.840
I've, I just liked that they, I liked that they leaned into the fact that he never buttons

45:14.840 --> 45:15.840
a shirt all the way.

45:15.840 --> 45:17.440
It just like went for it.

45:17.440 --> 45:18.440
Right?

45:18.440 --> 45:19.440
Yeah.

45:19.440 --> 45:20.440
Yeah.

45:20.440 --> 45:21.440
Very much so.

45:21.440 --> 45:22.440
Well, so yeah, there you go.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.240
I mean, we'll see, we'll see if, um, we'll see if other streaming providers follow suit.

45:24.240 --> 45:26.760
We'll see if more applications launched to Safari.

45:26.760 --> 45:30.160
This also is interesting because you're going to be able to potentially set different default

45:30.160 --> 45:31.160
browsers on iOS.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.160
Yes.

45:32.160 --> 45:34.760
But Chrome on iOS is still going to be Safari.

45:34.760 --> 45:35.760
So.

45:35.760 --> 45:36.760
Yeah, that's true.

45:36.760 --> 45:37.760
Yeah.

45:37.760 --> 45:39.600
Like it's weird where they're backing down.

45:39.600 --> 45:40.600
Right?

45:40.600 --> 45:43.120
Cause like we mentioned Stadia and whatever, what is it?

45:43.120 --> 45:44.120
X cloud?

45:44.120 --> 45:45.120
Is that the Microsoft one?

45:45.120 --> 45:46.120
Yeah.

45:46.120 --> 45:47.400
But those apps aren't even allowed in the store.

45:47.400 --> 45:48.920
Forget the percentages, right?

45:48.920 --> 45:51.560
Cause you have each individual game has to get reviewed still.

45:51.560 --> 45:52.560
Oh right.

45:52.560 --> 45:53.560
That's not going to happen.

45:53.560 --> 45:54.560
Right?

45:54.560 --> 45:57.280
There's a specific rule against streaming game services.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.280
That's just not going to happen.

45:58.280 --> 45:59.280
Right.

45:59.280 --> 46:03.400
So I don't know why that rule exists, but it does.

46:03.400 --> 46:04.400
Yeah.

46:04.400 --> 46:08.200
I do wonder if they like just gave up on app review, but then I don't know, then my relatives

46:08.200 --> 46:09.200
will download malware.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.040
This is why you should get a Librem 5.

46:11.040 --> 46:12.880
You know, they're shipping their production models now.

46:12.880 --> 46:13.880
Don't you know?

46:13.880 --> 46:16.240
I'm sure you must, you probably have a team of people developing apps for it.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.240
I'm sure.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.240
Oh, Oh God.

46:18.240 --> 46:19.240
Yeah.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.240
We have a whole room of, uh, I don't even remember what that is.

46:21.240 --> 46:23.080
What is the Librem 5?

46:23.080 --> 46:25.680
That's Purism's a Linux powered phone.

46:25.680 --> 46:26.680
You know what?

46:26.680 --> 46:27.680
Ubuntu Touch.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.680
All I'm going to say.

46:28.680 --> 46:29.680
It's still out there.

46:29.680 --> 46:30.680
It's Ubiports.

46:30.680 --> 46:31.680
Ubuntu TV.

46:31.680 --> 46:32.680
Okay.

46:32.680 --> 46:33.680
Well that's, that's not out there anymore.

46:33.680 --> 46:37.160
I'm going to do some technical projects if you want me to for like an hour and a half.

46:37.160 --> 46:38.160
Nope.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.160
Nope.

46:39.160 --> 46:40.160
I don't think so.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.320
Actually, uh, you know what I should mention before I forget is I'm going to do a Black

46:42.320 --> 46:43.880
Friday sale on the CoderQL.

46:43.880 --> 46:45.200
Take two bucks off.

46:45.200 --> 46:49.800

46:49.800 --> 46:53.840
one of our quality assurance members, you get the quarterly report, you get a limited

And for a limited time, special Black Friday sale, uh, use coupon code Black Friday at

47:02.600 --> 47:05.000
CoderQA.co.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
When does the quarter end?

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Is it like right during the holidays?

47:07.000 --> 47:08.680
When, how does that work for this next one?

47:08.680 --> 47:09.680
This quarter?

47:09.680 --> 47:12.080
It's, uh, it's the end of December.

47:12.080 --> 47:15.200
This is the, the saddest quarter where we have to pay taxes.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.200
Yeah.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.200
Hmm.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.720
We conveniently always buy a laptop around this time of year.

47:19.720 --> 47:20.720
Yeah.

47:20.720 --> 47:21.720
Isn't that funny how that works?

47:21.720 --> 47:22.720
Isn't that funny how that happens?

47:22.720 --> 47:23.720
Oh, so what happened?

47:23.720 --> 47:24.720
I needed a laptop.

47:24.720 --> 47:25.720
Oh yeah.

47:25.720 --> 47:28.360
It was a work machine.

47:28.360 --> 47:32.280
I would rather, I would, I mean, there's a part of me that, yeah, anyways.

47:32.280 --> 47:34.360
Maybe we'll save it for the quarterly report.

47:34.360 --> 47:36.000
I'll save my opinion there for that.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Yeah.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.120
Um, so if you want to get that and the previous one we've released, that's at CoderQA.co.

47:41.120 --> 47:45.040
And thank you everybody who, uh, supports the show directly.

47:45.040 --> 47:47.760
If you're not interested in that or you, it's not viable for you, we still just appreciate

47:47.760 --> 47:48.760
you listening.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.080
And if you have an opportunity to take advantage of our sponsors, we also really appreciate

47:51.080 --> 47:52.080

We're just, we're just glad and thankful that you guys are here.

47:54.440 --> 47:58.120
And you know, want to say, actually, let's just, I'll just thank you very much everybody.

47:58.120 --> 47:59.800
We've had our, it's been a really great return.

47:59.800 --> 48:03.840
Um, you know, the, the show has been back now for a little bit and I think, uh, some

48:03.840 --> 48:08.520
people are still finding it, but overall I think a lot of people stayed subscribed, hoping.

48:08.520 --> 48:10.960
And um, so it's been a really nice, it's been really nice.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.960
And so one of the things that, uh, both Mike and I, I'm going to speak for you now, uh,

48:13.960 --> 48:15.520
are thankful for is, uh, you guys.

48:15.520 --> 48:16.520
So.

48:16.520 --> 48:17.520
Yes, absolutely.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.520
Thank you everybody.

48:18.520 --> 48:21.400
Um, Mr. Dominic, is there anything you want to mention or plug before we get out of here?

48:21.400 --> 48:22.400
Uh, no.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.160
Uh, follow me at Dumunuku on Twitter, companies at Madder Botter Inc.

48:25.160 --> 48:30.080
If you need, um, any iOS or Python work done, let me know.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.080
There you go.

48:31.080 --> 48:32.080
Yeah.

48:32.080 --> 48:34.320
Fat cat says in the chat room that we need merge is right.

48:34.320 --> 48:35.320
We do.

48:35.320 --> 48:36.320
I just want to do it right when I do it.

48:36.320 --> 48:39.200
I don't want to just like, you'll see like a lot of places or YouTubers, they'll just

48:39.200 --> 48:43.300
throw their logo on like anything that auto generates merge.

48:43.300 --> 48:44.300
And I don't want to do that.

48:44.300 --> 48:46.120
I actually, this is way inside baseball.

48:46.120 --> 48:50.800
I actually just got a very messed up a box of TMB merge that I'm sending back.

48:50.800 --> 48:51.800
Yeah.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.600
That's the other thing is that's a problem too.

48:53.600 --> 48:54.600
Yep.

48:54.600 --> 48:56.320
So he is at Dumunuku on Twitter.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.000
His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.920

caught up now.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.040
I didn't read a couple of them, but I tried to respond to the ones I didn't read on air,

49:35.040 --> 49:38.200
which means our inbox is empty and we need your emails.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.680
