00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is Kota Radio, episode 384 for October 19th, 2020.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
Hello friends and welcome in to Kota Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,840
and the world of technology. This episode is brought to you by the all-new Cloud Guru,

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,840
My name is Chris, and joining us, like the soldier here he is, is our podcast buddy,

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,960
it is Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike. Hello, Chris. That was my Oprah, and I just don't,

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,600
will never do that again. Oh, so do I get a car?

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,000
You get a Matchbox car. You know, she's always going to be known for that,

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,320
regardless of what else she does. Did it like once, yeah. Oprah's known

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,760
for giving away cars, and you're known for spilling stuff on laptops.

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,960
Well, I see we're starting classy here today. I just cannot believe it. You know, sometimes I

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,480
check your Twitter feed before the show. Yeah, so here's the thing. I have a deep-seated hatred

15
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:38,320
of MacBooks, apparently. Whether it be gin, beer, or in this case, herbal tea, I cannot somehow

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,120
keep them dry. What you got to figure is perhaps you suspend the laptop in air and use a Bluetooth

17
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,680
keyboard, then you're only out a Bluetooth keyboard. See, I got a strategy for you.

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,400
Well, a not insignificant number of people on Twitter recommended a ThinkPad that actually has

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,080
holes in it for just this purpose. Yes, some ThinkPads have drain holes that actually drain.

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Now, if it's an entire glass of liquid, you're still kind of pushing the limits of the gutter

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,200
system in the ThinkPad. I also saw some people tweeted at you like a water bottle that has a

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,840
suction bottom that sticks to your table. Yes, I believe Emma from System76 recommended a sippy cup.

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,960
I mean, that could be another solution. Maybe you already have some around the house, too.

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:35,520
However, other than the trackpad, it is fine. Oh, really? That's good. I want to picture the

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,920
moment. Did you spring into some kind of action? Do you have a protocol at this point you follow,

26
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,560
like a standard operating procedure for this situation? I actually do. We have a dedicated

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,000
giant bag of rice for this. There you go. The bag of rice, man. It does wonders.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,120
Well, I'm glad you're able to save it. And, you know, it's like being home again. I keep saying

29
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,560
it's like we're in 2017 all over again. And I thought, you know, this would be the last episode

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,040
where we'd talk about SUSE. I don't think we got very much email about it. But the lizards brought

31
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,960
a gift for Mr. Dominic, an actual gift. So Kevin, who started this all. Thank you, Kevin. Sent me

32
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:22,320
two rather large SUSE pillows, lizard pillows. Oh, yeah. And roughly 30 Linux. I think it's

33
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,200
Linux user and developer. But the issue where they featured SUSE, of course, of the same issue. So

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,320
30 copies. Now, the lady where I still have a small office space who got the mail was deeply

35
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,040
confused. I mean, she's like, did you order like all of the same magazine? I said, what's on that

36
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,520
magazine? Some lizard. I'm like, oh, I still have some boxes of of SUSE around here in the studio.

37
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,120
Well, so for Halloween this year, every kid is getting a SUSE DVD. I thought you were kidding.

38
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,800
But then then I saw you tweeting something ridiculous like you don't know Linux until

39
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,880
you. Yes. And then I thought, wait a minute. Now, what is going on? What is happening to

40
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,160
to my co-host? I think he's being sucked into the dark side. You know this already, but I am working

41
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,760
on an initiative that should be done by Christmas if you believe people that give estimates that I

42
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,200
don't believe. But let's say the New Year and it does involve SUSE and it involves something that

43
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,640
requires permitting. Is this karma coming back here? So SUSE is a requirement of an application,

44
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:31,280
I take it? Yes. But I'm going a bit beyond that. Oh, oh, oh. You mean you're enjoying it?

45
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,080
Let's just say in a hypothetical world, you are a biologist, a professor at NYU. Your student's

46
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,120
name is Peter Parker. You lost your arm in an awful accident and you're thinking what animal

47
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,880
can regenerate limbs? Right. Of course. Of course. And if you notice, if eagle eyed Twitter users

48
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,920
will notice that your Coder radio announcement, I responded with the most beloved Spider-Man.

49
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,440
I would say hero, not villain. The lizard. I mean, he's just misunderstood, right? I think

50
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,320
also a SUSE user. It's the random German in his notes that sort of throws people off. But really,

51
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,160
I mean, so I am not kidding at all. I am doing some a lot of SUSE stuff and it's going to and

52
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,200
Kevin in particular is going to be excited. So is Johan. That is legitimately the other guy's name

53
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,560
because of course it is. And I'm assuming a number of Hans and maybe a few Gretels. But

54
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:28,800
yeah. So get ready for the SUSE action show. And how is the experience? I know it's early days

55
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,200
and all, but have you lost any limbs or is it actually going OK? It has gone surprisingly

56
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:43,040
smooth. Now, that is scaring me. Right. This is something I greenlit like last week, literally

57
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,200
on Thursday. And, you know, I had some preliminary conversations over like the last month and

58
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,480
everything that was supposed to be an impediment didn't impede. Now, I don't know if it's like

59
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,920
because covid people are being more reasonable or if it's something bad is going to happen and

60
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,560
delay this whole thing. You know what I mean? But it hasn't happened yet. So I don't know. You know

61
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,320
how I am, Chris. I'm a little skeptical when things look too easy. But yeah, like why is it

62
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,960
going so good? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. I can't get like a pizza delivered

63
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,240
correctly. And I'm in Florida, so there is no pizza. So like why is this working? Yep.

64
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,680
Or or is the answer the superior technology that I'm using now? Of course. Right.

65
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,880
Hashtag lizard people. Wow. So I thought we were all done with it. Just took a hard turn.

66
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,000
And now you're turning into a SUSE user. And I'm struggling to do what to do with that.

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,160
You know, it's just well, here's what you do. Give me six months. Then you have me on Linux

68
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:52,080
unplugged and we just listen to the groaning of your regular host. I like them just who's in the

69
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,800
IRC. He says Mike has committed suicide. Wow. That's good. Good stuff. I am actually legally

70
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,280
required to only drink German beer now, though. So there's that. Well, you could find worse,

71
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,400
I suppose. Well, we did get a bunch of feedback from the dark matter developers that we pleaded

72
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,680
with. So I picked a couple of them because a lot of them are long and detailed, like somebody who

73
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,160
would be a good employee would. So a non writes in, he says, Greetings from the dark matter side.

74
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,000
I work in the darkest of dark matter environments. It's large, very, very large U.S. company. And the

75
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,120
code is mostly in Java and TypeScript. Oh, interesting. And is part of an entire ecosystem

76
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,240
of software that exists within our part of the organization. None of that software ecosystem is

77
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,400
exposed to the outside world, and most things are internal to just this division of the company.

78
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,280
This does not mean that it is boring, though. The software has many users that need to get their

79
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,400
job done, and it contributes to a good experience to our end users. And I think in the end, that's

80
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,920
what counts. If you have any other questions about life in the dark world, though, I'd be happy to

81
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,400
answer them. Of course, I do have health benefits because I'm not living in the crazy U.S. So

82
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,720
everyone has access to health care they need here in Sweden. God damn Germans. Sorry. I know he's

83
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,880
a Sweden working for a large U.S. company. How about that? We get in Sweden health care.

84
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,920
I got to figure that out, man. I got to move to Canada or something. I got to get it. You know,

85
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,520
Munich is looking better every day. Also, he he wrote about Sousa. OK, so there was some Sousa

86
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,280
follow up. Yes. I forgot. He says the value of open Sousa is not that it's the most polished

87
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,400
distro out there. I'll give that a ding. Neither does it boast a especially well thought out and

88
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,960
opinionated user experience. These things together mean that I generally recommend open Sousa to

89
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,280
people that I just want to use their computer like an appliance. I set up the family and I

90
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,560
support it with Mint. And lately I've started moving some of them to Manjaro. I do love open

91
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,440
Sousa, though, because I used it quite heavily and was influenced by its governing model. And

92
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,160
I think it's one of the better things it has. Yeah, you know, the distro governance is like a

93
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,000
whole other thing about this. Talk about a lizard's nest. He says the lizards just never give up.

94
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,240
You'll never hear the end of the feedback to the open Sousa bashing. Oh, my God.

95
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,600
What have I done to myself? You know, I was between Darwin, BSD and Sousa. I was between

96
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,160
BSD and Sousa. What can I say? Yeah. Yeah. I guess it could have been worse. I could have gone

97
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,760
after the Mac. God only knows what I probably would have somebody show up at my house. Oh,

98
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,880
well, hang on. So he's dark matter. And didn't the TypeScript thing seem weird to you? Oh, yeah.

99
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,240
Thanks for remembering that. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's awfully modern. I wonder if you

100
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,520
could chime in on that. He said if we had any follow up questions, like, did you get to choose

101
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,080
that? That's the part I think we're really curious about is how much of the tool chain do you get to

102
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,880
pick versus like you're told, use this ID or use this language. So I do wonder if like DarkScript

103
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,360
was forced on them because of like the type checking and maybe they have some sort of way to,

104
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,240
I don't know, they feel the enterprise feels safer. I don't know. You know, I'm grasping

105
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,680
at straws for that one. Well, yeah. Boy, are you right? I mean, TypeScript, I think is it's a very

106
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,000
that's not conservative choice, but it's a safe choice. It is a safe choice. Runs great on SUSE.

107
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,760
So another Anon writes in, nobody wanted their name used. Hey, Chris and Mike,

108
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,520
I'm definitely on the dark matter side of the spectrum, but I've got some unique perspective.

109
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,920
So I figured I'd give you an insight on my job. I won't mention the company I work for,

110
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,120
but it is a large corporation you have definitely heard of and maybe even own products from,

111
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,200
but they no longer make consumer products. All right. He says my department is relatively small

112
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,600
in, you know, comparison to the rest of the company on the order of a few hundred employees.

113
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,520
And we do a small-scale TD. So you know how many employees I have? One.

114
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,000
So his small department, which is a couple hundred, I'm sorry, a few hundred employees,

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
and they do small scale government contracting, building hardware and software for them.

116
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,440
For the most part, the job is very corporate. I get decent insurance, average pay and great

117
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,840
retirement benefits and my very own cubicle all in exchange for a sane number of hours.

118
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,440
You may think doing development work, I spend 40 hours a week writing Java 8,

119
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,600
but I actually get to play with a spectrum of tools, including C and C++, Python,

120
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,840
TensorFlow, Docker, and JavaScript. Okay. It is not bad. He goes on to say,

121
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,160
as for the actual tools, read computers, it's complicated because we have many different

122
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,320
networks and computers for different security levels. In general, the business machines

123
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,920
run Windows and development machines run Ubuntu. Our Windows machines were just upgraded from

124
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:51,040
Windows 7 to Windows 10 in January. And our Ubuntu machines run the LTSs from 1404 to the latest.

125
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,960
Sounds like government contracted to me.

126
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,640
We are fully integrated with G Suite. Oh, interesting. So they use Gmail and Drive

127
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,560
and they use Meet and all of that stuff. Machines without internet access, we're

128
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,560
just upgraded from Office 2007 to 2016. That's interesting. Coronavirus changes,

129
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,400
he says, were also a bit of a mixed bag. Corporate didn't lay anyone off, which is awesome.

130
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,200
But benefits were temporarily reduced, which that's weird during a pandemic, huh?

131
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,840
To reduce the benefits. It's like extra mean, right? Come on.

132
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,800
I guess it's better than getting laid off, though. He goes on to say most of the company is still

133
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,360
working from home to this day, but due to the nature of our work, about 90 percent of my

134
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,600
department is back in the office. Personally, I'm kind of somewhere in between. Most of my work can

135
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,560
be done from home. But honestly, I find it so much easier to focus in my gray walled cube than at

136
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:46,160
home. Hope this gives you some valuable insights. Huh? It's that transition to working at home was

137
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,480
difficult for him, it sounds like. Had to go back to the office. Yeah, there's probably a bunch of

138
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,840
security concerns like equipment or systems that can never touch a network. I was really lucky

139
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,440
during the peak of the lockdown because, you know, there was a point where Washington locked down

140
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,520
pretty significantly and I'm the only one in the studio right now. So and I still to this day,

141
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,280
I mostly just go from home to the studio because I don't I don't want to get sick. I do. I do go

142
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,240
out more now than I used to, but it's still pretty limited. I'm still being careful and I'd never

143
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,320
really had to worry about staying at home per se because I just get in one box and then drive to

144
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,360
the next box. So I've been pretty lucky in that regard. I didn't really have to do much remote

145
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,720
work as it were. Yeah, I I miss an office like a lot. Yeah. You know what? Four year olds, man.

146
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:40,080
Yes. Yes. Very much so. Very much. That's you know, when I when I had kids is when I moved out

147
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,320
of the house and and got the studio going because I didn't want to be I didn't want to be chasing

148
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,000
after them to quiet down all the time because they're kids. You know, it's natural. Get off my

149
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,080
lawn. OK, we have one more dark matter dev that I'm going to cover today, but they all just kind

150
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,680
of came into the light. Well, we kind of remember what we did, right? Is we gave him a bag. Yeah,

151
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,240
we gave him a hard time last week. Yeah. And I actually would like it. I'm not necessarily

152
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,960
done with the topic. So if you have thoughts on this, if you're listening to this and want to

153
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,200
share your insights, please do go to Coder dot show slash contact. We'll keep it anonymous.

154
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,680
Don't have to say your name or the company. Speaking of that, totally anon wrote in and he's

155
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,160
a dark matter developer at a company that does it as a service. I'm writing him because you asked

156
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,320
about your nine to five guys. I work at an I.T. service company that does everything from the

157
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,000
help desk to outsourcing all the back end I.T. and development for our customers. That said,

158
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,640
I am on the sys admin side with some dev ops. I get handed what I get to use depending on the

159
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,920
customer I support. So I have a few laptops on my desk for each customer, along with my company

160
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,120
laptop that I have remote desktop applications, VMware, Horizon and Citrix to remote into the

161
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,320
customers who don't give me a laptop. That said, I don't really get to choose what tools I use

162
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,360
because everything's on the customer and in their environment. However, with some of our customers,

163
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,640
we have been pushing new tech like Kubernetes, but most of them only really accept OpenShift

164
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,840
because of Red Hat's backing. And my job is currently to manage those hosted clusters.

165
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,280
As for the final parts, well, we do work from home for full time now unless we need to go into

166
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,000
an office till the end of the year. That said, before COVID, we got to pick two days a week that

167
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,880
we worked from home. And because so many of the clients that we support their entire back end

168
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,600
networks, which is not really a lot of them, we get to use flex time. And that means when I have

169
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,600
to go there on off hours, I can apply that. So it's nice to have some insurance, especially when

170
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,840
the pandemic is going on during trying times. And it sounds like, this is me now, sounds like totally

171
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,640
a non-company was pretty well set up for work from home because they were letting you pick

172
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,400
two days a week. Yeah, I wonder what the transition would probably nothing, right?

173
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,200
Must have been much simpler, right? It had to have been. He goes on to say that they're kind

174
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,000
of just slowly going back to work at the office. And then our last bit of feedback, Mr. Dominic,

175
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,840
was from Oded and he wanted to follow up on a kind of a point of clarification on our Google

176
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:12,560
versus Oracle coverage last week. So he takes issue with the claim that we said where it appeared

177
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,680
that Google had copied some stuff line for line. What it was actually what they had copied was

178
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,320
something that was put in there by a different group and was just basic licensing stuff.

179
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,760
The version that was released publicly had all the comments and stuff removed. So it wasn't so

180
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,920
much that it was more of like language wording that they had copied word for word, which Google

181
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,400
would normally do, which kind of actually makes that Oracle argument. Well, a little flaccid.

182
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,520
It's one of their better claims. And it's kind of that is one that isn't particularly going to hold

183
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,920
up. He doesn't think he wrote in with all the details. But essentially what happened was Apache

184
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,760
Harmony added some stuff to the to the top of the file. Google copied that stuff. And that's what

185
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:00,480
Oracle's pointing to. So this is super weird. No, it's and it's so nuanced to really first that we

186
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,520
got to see him. I'm like, this guy's crazy. Let me just, you know, find the New York Times article

187
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,960
and look, bam, you're wrong. He is right in that it is something from Apache. What Oracle is

188
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:15,040
claiming is that by apparently, quote unquote, decompiling it and copying the comments on the

189
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,920
top of the file, that the comments would be copywritten because they compiled it. I mean,

190
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:28,560
it's it's like wacky. Yeah. Like, so it's weird. I mean, I have you know what? It's been a decade.

191
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,760
I know. Can't mom and dad stop fighting now, right? Like, oh, no. And I have to get now has

192
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,320
to go all the way to the Supreme Court. It's just so ridiculous. Dang it. Thank you, though,

193
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,760
everyone, for the feedback. Lots of good feedback. We'd like to get yours. It's a big part of our

194
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,880
show and helps us get going every episode. So coder dot show slash contact to send yours in

195
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,600
Lino dot com slash coder. Go there to get a one hundred dollars, sixty day credit towards a new

196
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,480
account. Linode is our cloud hosting provider of choice. I started using Linode two years ago for

197
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,160
J.B. and I love it. I first really started for myself personally. And then as J.B. was going to

198
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,440
go independent, I just began spinning up new infrastructure on Linode. Linode actually started

199
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,000
in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing three years before AWS,

200
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,160
because their Linux users and they saw the features and capabilities that were coming

201
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,280
to the Linux kernel and realized they could leverage that and create what we call today

202
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,240
the cloud. And Linode has really, really innovated over the years. Their cloud dashboard nails it.

203
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,720
It makes it so simple for me to spin up a machine. I think the moment, though, I was most impressed

204
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,160
with the cloud dashboard was when I had an existing system and I added a new disk. Not

205
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,640
only was that just crazy simple, if I didn't even know what these device names were or anything

206
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,280
like that, they had me covered. And when you do know, it's even better because there's one

207
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,520
click away and they give you all the advanced options that you would want as an advanced user.

208
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,720
And then after you create the disk, it comes up with a screen that gives you all the commands

209
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,560
you might want to use in the host operating system to actually attach that disk now.

210
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,440
Like, how do you do that, actually? Well, here are the commands and they're independently owned.

211
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,320
And I like that a lot. Well, you know, some companies will get VC backing and they'll go real strong

212
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,240
and real hard for a while. But when it's your infrastructure, when it's your systems, you want

213
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,760
to know what happens after that funding train runs out. Since Linode's been around since 2003

214
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,760
and independently owned and operated, that's not a concern with them. They're dedicated to

215
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,720
offering the best virtualized cloud computing. If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode. So go to

223
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,680
Quick recommendation on using your $100 at Linode. Chris, you know what you can do with that?

224
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,560
What's that?

225
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,720
Spend a bunch of SUSE leap servers.

226
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,360
They do have it on there. That's true.

227
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,640
They have open SUSE.

228
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,920
That's right. That's right. Linode.com slash coder.

229
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,840
All right, Mr. Dominic, you ready to move into the hoopla? Because of course.

230
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,680
I have been pining for this.

231
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,600
I you know, this is what happened, man, is they had the big event the day after our show and it

232
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,800
ends up there's a couple of things in there that are worth talking about. And then we got to wait

233
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,600
a week. So we're going to just get this out of our systems right now. Last week, Apple announced

234
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,120
the iPhone 12, which is a whole bunch of them, a whole zany lineup.

235
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,520
Who cares about that? HomePod mini go.

236
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,440
HomePod mini. Yeah, that's really all that matters. I am legitimately excited about this.

237
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,240
I will be buying at least a few of these.

238
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,960
Of course you will.

239
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,040
Now, I mean, I think this is a sleeper product that people don't appreciate. And I think the

240
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,320
reason is, is the price. And this is significantly cheaper. It's ninety nine dollars versus like,

241
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,000
what, three hundred dollars for the other HomePod, which is a total barrier.

242
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,160
Wait, is that still three hundred bucks?

243
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,000
Crazy Apple just doesn't drop their prices, dude. They never drop their prices.

244
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,520
That's a lot of money.

245
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,040
Every now and then they put them on sale through third party sellers like Best Buy.

246
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,160
And that's how I bought mine.

247
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,200
Well, then you spent twelve hundred dollars on HomePods.

248
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,920
No, I got one hundred dollars off on a couple of my HomePods. So.

249
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,240
OK.

250
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,200
Yeah, but these are ninety nine dollars. And I think what people fail to understand

251
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,120
about the HomePod is that it can execute any shortcut you create on your iPhone or your iPad.

252
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,200
That is tremendously powerful because they integrate with all of the apps,

253
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,480
all you know, all of the automations that Apple's built into iOS

254
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,480
can be executed from the HomePod. And that's massive.

255
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,680
And it has HomeKit. So in theory, and I find this hard to believe, but

256
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,600
you're kind of the expert on this one. If I had a shortcut that integrated with some HomeKit

257
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:20,000
devices. Right. Could I just like tell the HomePod to, you know, do that? No. Right.

258
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,040
All day long.

259
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,680
Seriously.

260
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,240
All day long.

261
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,480
So if you have those like fancy Philips lights or whatever.

262
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,280
Oh, yeah. Yeah. And HomeKit ties in really great with the open source home assistant

263
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:38,400
software that I use. So Siri has become my voice assistant for my own locally self-hosted

264
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,400
home assistant instance through HomeKit. And I can automate things using HomeKit.

265
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:51,360
And it's fast because it's all on the LAN. And the other thing about the HomePod specifically is

266
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,040
it, I believe, has the best microphones of the bunch. And a lot of times these smart

267
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,800
assistants kind of fall down when you have a fan going and it creates white noise,

268
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,680
or maybe your TV is too loud. Out of all of the home assistants that I have tested,

269
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,520
HomePod breaks through the noise the most often. And she understands you well. Like it's cliche

270
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,080
to give Siri a hard time. But when you're using her in a HomeKit capacity, it's just,

271
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:24,000
hey phone, hey slow mo, turn on lamp, turn on heater. And it just it does it immediately.

272
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,560
Plus, it sounds the best. So if you're in the iOS ecosystem, which is the big caveat,

273
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,520
I think why it doesn't get as much love as it should. It just is brilliant. It shows

274
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,680
up in your AirPlay list of devices. You can manage it as an AirPlay device. That brings

275
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,520
it into the realm of home theater. Because if you have an Apple TV, the Apple TV and the HomePods

276
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,640
are aware of their general locations. And they will treat the HomePods, if like they're behind

277
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,120
you, as rear speakers. And so the way it automatically works at my place is the sound bar

278
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,920
becomes our vocals, our center channel. And then the HomePods become the surround sound system.

279
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,960
Automatically, without me ever telling it to, I just, in the AirPlay menu, checked the HomePods

280
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,480
and their pairs, right? And they automatically figure out which side's left and which side's

281
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,600
right. Well, you tell them that. But once you tell them that, they automatically figure out who's

282
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,600
supposed to do what load. And so you get terrific sound. You get a surround sound environment that

283
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,720
is completely wireless, which is fantastic for me because I can't run wires in my current condition

284
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,240
certain situation. And on top of that, you get all of the power of any shortcut you can

285
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,560
fancy and any device that supports HomeKit. And oh, if you're crazy enough to go all the way into

286
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,200
open source Home Assistant, it's also the best voice assistant with that as well. And it's a

287
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,480
good speaker just to listen to podcasts or music on. And these minis come in now at $99. Well,

288
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,360
think about how you could use that in a surround sound environment. How easily it would be to maybe

289
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,400
put one near your couch and fill out a little bit of the sound there. Or maybe, you know, put one on

290
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,240
the counter where I'm at and I hear a little bit of sound coming from that. So I'm really excited

291
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,480
about how not only could I get more voice automation in places where I couldn't afford to

292
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,800
put a Home Assistant before, but also I can fill out my existing system a little bit better, which

293
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,600
I also think is going to be great because they just work together so easily. Damn, I might have

294
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,760
to get one. I mean, they sound great, too. And I don't know about the minis. Well, at $99, it's

295
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,480
like even if it doesn't work out right. Yeah. Yeah, I get that it's funny at, you know, $300.

296
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,000
And of course, you have to have an iPhone or an iPad or an Apple TV to make it worth it. So I get

297
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,080
it right, especially for Android users or people that are deep into the Google ecosystem. It's

298
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,360
silly. But man, there's a lot of iPhone users out there. I'm not trying to shill for Apple here.

299
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,640
I would love for this to be made by anybody. Anybody who made a product like this sounds good,

300
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,240
easy to pair, excellent home automation assistant that ties in with my self-hosted local home

301
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,400
automation system. And it all works over the land. So when I'm off grid in my RV, I still can use

302
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,040
the home pods. I don't have to have Google intermediary and a proxy connection to send

303
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,240
audio or video. It's all over the land. I mean, it's just there's a lot of advantages there that

304
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,120
people don't consider because, you know, really, I think I think Amazon has stolen the mindspace

305
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,160
here. They've really kind of nailed it because they've executed just consistently on the Alexa

306
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:22,560
product. But, you know, I literally try these things side by side. And I think you can you

307
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,000
could confidently say you can do more with an echo. But the core things I care about the home

308
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
pod is just focused on like three things. And it does those really well. It's very Apple style,

309
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,640
I suppose. So would you recommend for like a home pod version just to go with the fancy one?

310
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,120
Or I don't know. You know, I'm not sure. I kind of think maybe not. I think I would buy two of the

311
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,440
minis than one. Oh, they can do the thing where they talk to each other and like, oh, it's not

312
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,800
quite as sophisticated yet as the big pods. Right. But there is they can at least stereo pair up.

313
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,760
So you still you get two home pod minis and you're still not even at the price of one home pod.

314
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,040
And the only thing that I noticed that Apple did is they called this the home pod family.

315
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:13,120
Now, which I don't know. It might suggest there's some more coming. And I find it fascinating that

316
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,280
they're cramming decent CPUs into these tiny little things like this thing has the S5 chip.

317
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,360
What do you make of yourself? I mean, yeah, but I think it makes it. I think it matters

318
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,760
having a faster CPU in the system. I think it I think it matters. Do you have any thoughts on the

319
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,280
on the other stuff that they announced? Like the I mean, they've got like a whole smattering

320
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:35,360
of iPhones now. Buckle up. Let's talk about 5G for a moment. All right. I was a little surprised.

321
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,200
I have the blatant Verizon commercial at the beginning of the I guess, you know, we still

322
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,040
call them Kinos, I guess. Yeah, I sort of don't understand why they're pushing the 5G thing so

323
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,000
hard, given that unless you live in like literally New York and San Francisco and some other

324
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,760
metropolitan areas, you probably don't even have good LTE. Yeah. And you're not going to have a

325
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,960
good 5G. And it's not like you're not going to have it for like six months. Yeah. I mean, let's say

326
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,400
I know people like the first cash is saying like a year, I would say, especially if you're like out

327
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,720
down here in Florida, it's like five years. And also, you may not always want 5G, right?

328
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,400
Because you know, more power drain. That's why they had to make a point to say that John's 5G

329
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,160
and Jim's 5G might not be the same, which I think is always amazing that the telcos get away with

330
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,680
that. I mean, maybe it's just me, but did it strike you as weird that they were talking so much

331
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:31,520
about a network that basically doesn't exist? Yeah. And and especially in the United States,

332
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:39,200
and especially given in the past, they've never really made much fuss except for the iPhone 3G,

333
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,480
which is going quite a ways back to see Apple make a fuss about the radio technology.

334
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,080
I think there's a couple of things at play here. I think it's good to signal that

335
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,920
Apple is leading here from their position, from a strategic position.

336
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,480
They're often not the first to market in a compelling form factor with stuff.

337
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,800
Usually it's Samsung, right? If you're gonna look at the mobile market, they're pretty aggressive.

338
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,600
But in this case, Apple feels like they're really right there with the rest of the industry,

339
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,280
maybe even a little bit on the leading edge when you look at the Qualcomm modem that they're

340
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,560
shipping and the form factor and battery life that they're claiming you'll get.

341
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:22,640
I think another factor in the focus is that they worked out a deal with the carriers to take 30

342
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,680
bucks off the phone. And additionally, they appeared to work out a deal with Verizon to

343
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:34,000
actually hold the announcement of the launch of their nationwide 5G network until Apple's keynote.

344
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,640
Imagine the business arrangement there, man. Think about that. Think about what a product

345
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,840
launch that is for Verizon. Somehow Apple talked them into waiting to make the announcement until

346
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,400
their keynote. I mean, that's quite the deal. So that had to play a factor too.

347
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,640
From a technology standpoint, I actually am kind of excited about it,

348
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,480
even though it's not widely deployed yet. Number one, mobile data is a big deal for me. It's one

349
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,520
of the number one expenses in my monthly expenses. Seriously, it's mobile data. I have multiple

350
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,400
carriers, and I don't mean to, and I really follow this industry very, very closely.

351
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:22,640
I can say with some surprise that the iPhone 12 has one of the most advanced cellular modems

352
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,640
we've ever seen in the market. It literally supports almost every LTE band in existence

353
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,840
today, which is extremely rare. And it means really good LTE support. Additionally, it has

354
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,960
a four by four antenna so it can make four simultaneous connections to the cell tower,

355
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,440
which is incredible. And then additionally, it happens to have 5G and it currently supports

356
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,640
every standard of 5G that exists today. So one iPhone for all carriers. It's just one iPhone now.

357
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,160
And they've got that screaming Qualcomm chip in there. So from a purely cellular data and band

358
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:08,560
support standpoint, for mobile workers, this is a killer phone. And the mobile router support,

359
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,400
the tethering support, the Wi-Fi tethering support in the iPhone, it's pretty good.

360
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,280
It makes a pretty damn good little mobile router. And so I will likely pick one up

361
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,600
just for its LTE band support and then use the 5G when I happen to be in an area that has it.

362
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,320
And I'm not even expecting that 5G to be significantly fast. I think this is

363
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,640
the biggest misread about 5G and maybe the thing that kind of annoys me the most. I could get 100

364
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,440
megabits on LTE if I have the right modem and a good signal. I can get 100 megabits. I've got

365
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,720
I got a spot out in the woods where I get 90 megabits on LTE. It's crazy. It's like utopia.

366
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,520
Now, 5G probably not going to get me any better than that. But what it will get me that really

367
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,320
matters for my industry is lower latency. And that's what Apple really focused on. They focused

368
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,400
on gaming. They focused on medical record transfer and and video applications where latency is

369
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,040
extremely important. And the goal with 5G is to eventually get the latency as good as it could be

370
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,400
for a home connection. And I don't care what you say, but that's going to make a transformational

371
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,720
difference on the Internet, just like bringing up bandwidth to the home, brought in streaming video

372
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,360
and all of that. Improved latency will get us real time video communication. So what you and I are

373
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,040
doing will get as good as a phone call or even better, better actually. And maybe if they get

374
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,920
there and if they get if they never get the speeds up beyond what you could get in a good LTE

375
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,760
situation now, but get the latency down, I would happily use that. And this phone is going to get

376
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,720
me the closest to that that anything possibly can on the market today in a form factor that I'm

377
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,520
actually going to want to use. That all makes sense. Actually, I spoiler alert. I, of course,

378
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,440
ordered one because I mean you did. So you must have gotten the 12 pro or 12 then because the

379
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,520
other ones aren't even available yet. I think I got the blue one. Yeah. OK, good. That's what I

380
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:02,320
think I would get to. I like that. I guess like you have painted a world where like we're all

381
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,560
dancing with Taylor Swift and things are great and we're streaming it right. But I see a world

382
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,880
where every time I, you know, in the before time, somebody used to travel all the time within three

383
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,800
days of being on a trip, rising like Haza, you're on the limited plan. It is unlimited. Enjoy the

384
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:27,920
fifty six K. Oh yeah. So like if like I could give them virtually any amount of money and they

385
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,120
would like give me real unlimited help, even for even LTE, like you're saying, right? I think that

386
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,480
would be awesome. Yeah, but I'm pretty sure based on decades of history here that they're not going

387
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,360
to do that. Right. Even for like a stupid amount of money that they're going to be like, it's

388
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,680
really fast. You have low latency, very little ping, Haza. And as soon as you finish streaming

389
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,280
one one episode of The Simpsons or whatever the hell you're watching or stream one episode of

390
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:02,160
the next action show, you are done. Yes. Yeah. So I guess like, do you do you see like a cultural

391
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,520
shift on the telcos where they might like not do that? I hope. I mean, they have to. Right. They're

392
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,440
like Verizon is talking about when you get their millimeter wave connection, they're talking about

393
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,640
a gigabit connection. But the plan allows for 20 gigabytes total. Well, right. So like, literally,

394
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,000
you're not going to make it. No, it's it's ridiculous on its face. And this is one of the

395
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,680
reasons why I have multiple cellular connections in Lady Jupes. I was on a trip just recently,

396
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:38,880
and AT&T cut me off. I have I had a grandfathered iPad plan that was supposed to be truly unlimited,

397
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:44,480
but I used 500 gigs on the road and they cut me off. I had one of those. They don't like it when

398
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,360
you tether the items. They just shut it down completely. No, nothing. Just boom, you're you're

399
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,720
you're done, man. You're you're that you're over. And so, yeah, I end up paying for multiple so I

400
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,440
can spread it out. I have different carriers from in different areas. And it's such a shit show. I

401
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,400
hope I look back at this in 10 years and go, oh, man, that was sure the bad old days of mobile

402
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,840
connectivity. All right. If I could even pay like three X what I pay for the businesses wireless.

403
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,720
Right. But it was like truly unlimited. You just can't do it. No, they will. They will not sell you

404
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,360
that. Yeah. If you're like in the CIA or the FBI, they have a special plan they'll give you. Right.

405
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,400
But yeah, you're out. And I know people listening and think this is crazy. When the world is not

406
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,920
ending, go to your local Verizon store and ask for the business rep. Tell him you would or her

407
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,000
you would like to buy the highest enterprise plan that they can sell you. But you want

408
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,760
truly unlimited data with no throttling. You will be asked to leave. One of the carriers is working

409
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,760
has a plan now for quote unquote business users. It's prohibitively expensive. It's quote unquote

410
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,000
unlimited. But you're only allowed to do things like Zoom, email and VPN. Yes. No tethering.

411
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,240
That's my favorite trick. Yeah. And if you do anything outside of that, they reserve the right

412
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,400
to immediately shut down your account. Now, of course, you could VPN it up and maybe, you know,

413
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,080
they'd never know what you're using this line for. But you're always skirting around the policies

414
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,360
and rules. And if they ever did get insights into what you're doing, they could immediately shut

415
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,320
your account down. And that's how you get quote unquote unlimited. But even that is got some,

416
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:26,400
you know, asterix next to it. So that has to shift. I don't know if you know one thing that

417
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,600
could actually happen is Starlink could come along. Elon could offer something on the market

418
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,080
that is competitive and then the carriers have to respond. Is it bad that I kind of believe in Elon

419
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,080
more than, you know, the government regulating this or fixing it? That's how I feel. That's really

420
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,920
that's truly how I feel. And they've just the carriers have made such a mess of this that it

421
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,560
does make it hard to be enthusiastic. They want us to be excited about the 5G. And I think that's why

422
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,200
it stood out to you so much. I think there's technical advantages by having a modem capable

423
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,560
of it. Oh, I love the tech. Just the policy doesn't work. So funny story, because I'm not

424
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,080
really in a position just to be dropping a lot of cash. But before the pandemic lockdowns hit,

425
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:12,800
I ordered a super high grade industrial grade cellular modem router kit for my RV that is used

426
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,080
on trains and buses. It's professional gear that you just can't buy. You have to buy it from a

427
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:23,360
special reseller and all that kind of stuff. And it includes a seven in one antenna that you mount

428
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:29,200
on the roof and you wire it into this thing. And it's really cool. And it has four SIM slots,

429
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:36,640
two modems active at the same time. And then it can use a special VPN technology to bond the

430
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,800
carriers together into a single stable connection. And then you run a hosted component on the other

431
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,440
end or use their service. And that's where your traffic comes out. And so like I would run one

432
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:54,880
on Linode. I ordered that and it's like $1,200, right? But I ordered it back in March when I was

433
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,280
still employed. And so the pandemic lockdowns came and all the shipments from China shut down.

434
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,440
And I got an email saying, hey, your thing's going to be delayed. They told me if I order now

435
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,440
and they'll just include the shipping for free and all that and go ahead and charge it. And I

436
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,520
thought, this is a bad idea, but I'm going to do it. And so I said, go ahead, place the order because

437
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,720
I really want this equipment. My kids are doing school from home and the connection is not reliable

438
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,960
enough when they're all three on school calls and whatnot. And so this is the year I'm going to

439
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,360
invest in this for real. So go ahead and charge it. And then, of course, the lockdowns come and

440
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,960
it doesn't ship and it doesn't ship and it doesn't ship. So in August, I emailed the guy and I'm

441
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,880
like, so did I just get scammed here? What's going on? And he tells me, no, no, it's all due to the

442
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,640
lockdown. It should be shipping in September. It'll be fine. And so I'm sitting there pontificating

443
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,960
on if I should just cancel this thing because I just been scammed and go to my credit card and ask

444
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,040
them if they can reverse the charge. But I found another seller. And so I emailed him. I said,

445
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,280
what's the status? And he gave me the same exact story that it's all shut down, but they should be

446
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,880
shipping in September. And so if you'd like to place your order now, you can. I thought, well,

447
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,960
OK, so maybe that's really what's going on. So I don't cancel the original order. September goes

448
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,680
by. I never get it. October comes. I get an update. It should be shipping any day now.

449
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,640
October 15th comes. Nothing. October 16th arrives and I get an email saying that the the entire

450
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,400
setup with all of its modems and its antennas and it's all this stuff is all going to arrive

451
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,840
on the 20th. Oh, wow. And this whole thing, you know, is all based on LTE. None of it is 5G because

452
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,880
I just I'm not investing in 5G right now. It's ridiculous. It's all going to be LTE for years.

453
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,760
And what I hope is that people will move off the LTE network and move over to 5G. So everybody go

454
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,560
buy your iPhone 12s and get off my LTE network. Just free it up for me. I want all the spectrum

455
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,640
I can get. So I'm you know, I've got this industrial grade LTE kit now that's coming.

456
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,360
I've got to drill holes in my ceiling and all kinds of stuff. My God, I know it's going to be

457
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,720
massive, but when I'm done, I should have the most reliable LTE connection humanly possible.

458
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,840
You know, you could do like a testing rig, you know, just like drive around the country. All

459
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,800
right. Well, I'm locking the bandwidth here. Yeah. And so it's got four SIM slots, but only

460
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,720
two of the modems are active. So I'm going to have an AT&T and a Verizon and then a Google

461
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:22,240
Fi and a Ting as my backups. And yeah, I mean, I'm serious about it. It is it's a it's a massive

462
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,120
issue for me because my entire job is online. Everything I do is online. The way I communicate

463
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,760
with everybody in the team, everything is online. And so I'm going to have to do a lot of

464
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,040
online. And so and then you have the kids with their schooling and then my wife, any client she

465
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,200
does have, most of them are virtual and those are video calls. She can she can switch over to

466
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,720
LTE on her phone, but it'd be nice if the Wi-Fi was reliable. So, yeah, that's a thing. Sounds

467
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,480
awesome. Should make working from home a little bit better, although maybe maybe if you're a

468
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,800
Dropbox employee, you'll want some of these tips because it looks like Dropbox is letting all

469
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,760
employees work from home permanently with like kind of a we work style where some folks will

470
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,880
come in during the week and they'll work together and they'll have like a collab space where they

471
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,000
can give each other the Rona and then they go back home and infect their families.

472
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,320
I am relatively sure that the group email that announced this, that was not the pitch.

473
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,440
I feel like, you know, the head of engineering or whatever, the CEO was like,

474
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,440
here's the plan, folks, you're going to work from home. Everybody's like, yay.

475
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,600
Then once a month you come in, you get COVID, you spread it to all your family. Wait, what?

476
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,400
It's like what we talked about, though, what they're trying to get to is the best of both worlds,

477
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,560
where you still get the in-person collaboration and sustain the company culture. Because I have

478
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:47,120
witnessed that working for clients in various capacities. I've noticed that all remote companies,

479
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:54,080
they they front like they have a culture, but it doesn't actually exist. All the people behind the

480
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,880
other ends of the screens are all kind of lonely and disgruntled. And I say this totally just on

481
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,560
observation. It's not any kind of... Are you talking about me specifically now?

482
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,000
No, I've noticed this with several companies I've worked with. And you quickly get in a situation

483
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,760
where you have the like the management layer is preaching to you what the culture is constantly

484
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,280
and they're constantly telling you what the culture is, but it's not real. It's just...

485
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,800
It's a fancy blog post. Yeah. Where you actually come into an office space and you're working with

486
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,040
multiple people and the kind of ideology and culture of the office is generally represented

487
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,720
in the workspace. And you see that, you get that human connection, that high bandwidth exchange,

488
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,680
and you get your feels out, all that kind of stuff. And I think you then send people off and

489
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,840
they go be productive for a few days from home. Sort of like one of our dark matter developers who

490
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,680
got to work a couple of days at home and then come into the office. That's, I think, the perfect

491
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,200
balance. I think it's very funny that you put this in the show notes. I am reopening our space

492
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,520
in Plant City. Yeah, right. I thought I heard you mention that. I think you mentioned it to me on

493
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,400
Slack maybe. Yeah, in Slack. It is related to my magical SUSE thing I'm doing. Don't want to say

494
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,280
much about it now, but yeah, instead of having a large space, this is exactly what we're doing,

495
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,000
right? Like, you know, kicking off projects. We have a lot of weird hardware integration work

496
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,600
that came in, so that stuff you kind of have to do there. But not trying to really do this

497
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:27,360
until the Rona's over, which, God willing, will be soon. May never. Well, geez. Listen,

498
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:32,880
every time I listen to Unfilter, I cry a little bit. So let's just move right along. But hopefully

499
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,840
it ends. And yeah, this is the idea. Small spaces, you know, we operate in two states,

500
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:44,320
so maybe one in New Jersey soon. But yeah, it's, I don't even know what to say.

501
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:51,040
I, it's weird. I love remote work for like heads down coding. Right. But when it's stuff like,

502
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,040
oh, I have to ups you this custom board back and forth. And oh, the kid at the UPS store,

503
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,200
like spilled his tea in it. Let's be honest. It wasn't the kid at the UPS store, but moving right

504
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:09,920
along. It's kind of inefficient. So can I fry some bacon? Oh, you know, I've always got a little

505
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,200
right here. You want me to throw it on the old griddle? Go ahead. So this is bacon from Japan.

506
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Curtis, courtesy of that rich guy who invested in WeWork, whose name just literally evacuated my

507
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,560
brain. I really don't remember anymore. It's Wagyu bacon. Wagyu bacon. I'm pretty sure this is going

508
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,880
to bail WeWork out. Well, I think you'll have a lot of corporations just convert their offices

509
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,560
into WeWork like spaces, but then you'll have others that are looking to fill in gaps and

510
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,920
whatnot in like areas. Yeah. I mean, obviously, like if you want WeWork, but for adults, there's

511
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:50,000
Regis, which I use. But yeah, I, I, I'm a little mixed on this whole concept because then you're

512
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
taking a lease. Like, to be clear, our space plan city is like a traditional lease. That's why I

513
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,440
still have it. And you're not using it all the time. Doesn't that feel kind of wasteful, Chris,

514
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,440
as like an entrepreneur? Oh, yeah. 100%. It's, I mean, the studio is, it makes the production

515
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,040
of these shows so much more consistent and straightforward, but yet I still look at that

516
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,120
expense and go, hmm, could always just do it from home. But what I have right now is kind of a

517
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,760
balance. Some days I work from home, the days I'm not on air, I might, I might come to the studio.

518
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,760
I might not. I kind of break it up depending on the project work that I'm doing. And I like having

519
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,640
that flexibility. I basically have kind of cemented my idea that it's worth the business having the

520
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,360
space. But when times are tough, you look at it and you go, gosh, you know, I could, I could make

521
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,520
that back because it's not just the rent, it's the services and the utilities you have running here

522
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,600
too. And maybe insurance and you know, it ends up, it ends up being a pretty decent expense.

523
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,160
Yeah. Let's see, let's see how long I last for doing this. Although the peace and quiet,

524
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,440
especially for recording has to be just, yeah. Well, except for sometimes I have airplanes going

525
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,280
overhead. So you never know. It's never, sometimes I'm in Florida and there's like lightning

526
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,760
everywhere. So yeah, I think it's a good mix though. I think maybe wouldn't that be interesting

527
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,120
if we had a bunch of companies that didn't land on everybody works from home, but what they land

528
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,760
on. And I think what we're kind of seeing happen is a lot more flexibility because now the

529
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,440
infrastructure had been put in place, the tooling has been put in place, except for the companies

530
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,360
that really screwed it up. They're going to be in a position now where they could, where they

531
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,680
could do that. Plus he thinks like it wouldn't save them money. Having people not in the office

532
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,200
saves money. It makes it harder to watch what they're doing every single day, but there's tools

533
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,720
to compensate for that. Well, I think you need less space, right? Isn't that kind of the. Yeah.

534
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:40,000
And less power, less snacks, less things in the fridge, you know, like seriously,

535
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:48,880
the only downside is I have seen some companies that are getting a little Snoopy. Like they want

536
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,440
to up the surveillance software that runs on your company machines. So they have more confidence

537
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,240
that you're being productive during the day. I don't think that's a good trend. I don't like

538
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,240
that. And, um, there is a company out there that shopping to tech podcasters right now about, uh,

539
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,520
selling a service that helps you monitor your employees that are working from home.

540
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:16,320
Do their checks clear? I mean, no, no, of course not. Yeah. Yeah. Well now let me tell you about

541
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:21,840
now actually, you know what? Let me thank, uh, the coder QA folks. Uh, if you'd like to be a member,

542
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,240
uh, coder QA helps us stay independent. It helps us be choosy about the sponsors,

543
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,280
coder QA.com. Uh, the first coderly report is out as well for our members. You can get that

544
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,360
in the feed or as an individual download, you support the show and you also get a limited ad

545
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:43,760
feed of the show. Plus that coder quarterly report coder QA.co that's coder QA.co to sign up and

546
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,560
support the show. Why not? Uh, why not buy your buddies here at coder radio, a holiday gift that

547
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:54,480
revenue goes towards paying for editing, producing all of that. That is a, it's a business cost and

548
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,240
we'd like to make it sustainable. So that way we have a varying load of sponsors from time to time,

549
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,400
but the basics of the show are still covered at coder QA.co and thanks to everybody who does

550
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,640
support the show over there. Now, Mike, last week we teased about this a little bit, but I think we

551
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,280
got a few more minutes. We could get this in. Uh, and you recently had an adventure in Vinland

552
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,400
and I also had a new editor that I've been trying out that I wanted to mention, but

553
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:23,760
what's going on? What's going on with you and Vim? So because I am picky and the fonts were not

554
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:30,160
rendering at what I perceived as the right size in gnome three, thank you gnome. Um, I decided to

555
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:37,200
try out Vim again. I then like all Vim users spent way too long configuring my Vim IRC. Yes. You gotta

556
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,960
get the colors just right. I have been doing this for two weeks. I think this is going to be my last

557
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,960
week. So this is a very brief segment. Okay. Here's the good on Linux. Nothing renders that

558
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:54,960
better than the terminal. Visually it's beautiful. It's a great flex. You know, it looks nice. Um,

559
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,760
I probably will actually turn on Vim key bindings and Ruby mine then pie charm now,

560
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:06,560
but damn, is it a pain in the butt? For instance, I had to open my Mac and I'm like, ah, let me just,

561
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:12,480
you know, pull down my Vim RC, which is in a gist. Well, for some reason that I don't understand,

562
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,640
it simply does not work on Mac terminal. There's the plugins are not installing, right?

563
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:25,600
And it's very annoying. I really wanted to love this. I do not. So how's your editor?

564
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That's not what I expected at all. I was all sitting here. Oh my God. I was expecting this

565
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,960
whole love letter. Okay. All right. Well, let me introduce you to something simpler.

566
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,560
It's called micro a modern and intuitive terminal based text editor. That's simple. Lightweight

567
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:51,680
has easy to use features compatibility with key bindings from Vim or nano highly customizable.

568
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,200
If you want to go down that route, even a plugin system, if you want support 75 languages,

569
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,760
seven default color schemes to choose from. It supports true color schemes as well.

570
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,680
And of course, syntax color schemes are very simple to make if you want to make your own.

571
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,760
And if you want an editor on the console that can also do the multi pain thing where you can have

572
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,880
side pains and two pains and all the quad pains, it'll do all of that. I'm not talking about the

573
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,160
West pains. I'm talking about the view pains. And, um, it, um, what did I say? Mouth support

574
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,480
has mouth support. So, you know, if that's your thing too on the terminal, it has that.

575
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,520
Now you're just rubbing it in. It's like a nano alternative that's a little more powerful. It was

576
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:37,520
recommended to me on Linux unplugged by a listener and, uh, I installed it and I love it. I mean,

577
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:44,000
I still love my nano. You know, it's, I kind of joke a little bit, but I'm, I'm serious too in

578
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,680
that, um, I want, I want easy and wait, hang on. You actually like nano. Yeah. You know, I mean,

579
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,080
I, I can use Vim. I taught myself Vim because it's on literally every system. And that,

580
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,800
that was a concept that actually mattered back in the day when you had to install everything with

581
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,560
RPMs like an animal. But today it's so easy to install software and most systems ship with

582
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:10,240
multiple editors installed. I think it's a little bit of dogma that maybe is more myth than it is

583
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,200
truth. And everything is, has nano. It's easy to get nano or Pico on just about anything. And it's

584
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:21,120
such a nice, simple, everything is there. All the commands are at the bottom. It's just, uh, no

585
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:28,080
surprises, no complexity. I'm into the file. I'm out of the file. There's just a simplicity and

586
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,800
quickness to it that I really appreciate. And if I'm looking for something that's more advanced,

587
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,720
like I'm, I'm editing the sudoers file, I might use Vim or visudo. But if I'm just editing my

588
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,240
Samba config or something like, you know, a basic file on my file system, I just use nano. If I'm

589
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,640
not using VS code to begin with, I'll just use nano. In, out, easy, quick, simple keybinds.

590
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,600
And now I've started using micro more and more. And I get that I'm not leet and I feel bad that,

591
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,920
you know, I'm not leet when I say that and that I'm not, you know, cool hacker, bro. But

592
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:06,160
I just don't care. I just like the simplicity of it. That's my confession to you. And, uh,

593
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,200
I leave myself open to your judgment. I bet it works great on Azusa.

594
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:16,400
Oh, all right. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, I'll put a link to micro in the show notes.

595
