00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTORadio episode 300 for March 15, 2018.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hi everyone, and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,360
pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

4
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,880
This episode is brought to you by our two fine sponsors, DigitalOcean and Linux Academy.

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,360
We'll tell you more about those great sponsors as this here show goes on.

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:57,200
My name is Chris, and joining us for an unbelievable 300 weeks, it's our host, Mr. Michael Dominic.

7
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Hello, Mike.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
300 weeks of power!

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,360
Jeez, it is, it is, it's kind of amazing when you say that, it sounds so, so unbelievable.

10
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,000
It's really kind of hard to even wrap our head around.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,760
So we got a bunch of really fun stuff we're going to announce to celebrate episode 300.

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,280
We thought we were going to do nothing, and then it really turned into a whole team effort,

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,160
a bunch of, a bunch of really great work by Angela, Mike and I got some secret plans going

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,120
behind the scenes, and it resulted in, well, a hell of a bang for the, for 300.

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,720
I'm like, I'm like shocked because we went from like almost nothing when I left for scale

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,400
to heck of a show.

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
But it's good to be back.

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,680
We waited till Thursday to do KOTORadio 300 so that way I could be in studio.

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,440
So I've returned from the California area and I survived, Mike.

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,760
I survived their weird gas pumps.

21
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,680
You have never pumped gas until you pumped gas in California.

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
Let me tell you.

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
Wait, the pump, the pump is different?

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,480
Yeah, man, they got these low vape nozzle headers that they've retrofitted all of the

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,120
pumps with and they've also removed like the little latch where you can lock the handle

26
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,440
down so it just keeps pumping.

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
What the hell?

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, well, here's the best part.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,780
So Ford's have this really great feature that they added to their cars a few years ago where

30
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,160
there's no gas cap.

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,020
It's a capless gas system and it has a little door that opens and closes and it's great.

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,320
No more gas cap to touch, no more stinky fingers, but it doesn't play well with California's

33
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,040
low vape nozzle retrofit.

34
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,560
And I'm basing this on the fact that we had two Ford rentals that both experienced this

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
problem.

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,040
And it was one of these things where the thing would pop every five seconds.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,760
It'd take 20 minutes to fill your vehicle.

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
So I had to get the hell out of there.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,160
Had to come back here, get in studio so that way we could do 300 in studio.

40
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
How are you doing?

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
That's a lot about me.

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,640
How have you been doing, Mike?

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
How are you doing?

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
You know what?

45
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,400
You know, I was reflecting because, you know, 300 episodes is a lot, right?

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Like I was reflecting on what have we learned in 300 episodes?

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,200
And you know what I think we've both learned?

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
We hate California.

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,800
Yeah, we're going to, we're going to have to, because we've never gotten that email.

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,320
You know, we are going to have to do some reflection later on in the show, but why don't

51
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,140
we start out with an email as we do here on the program.

52
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,140
We like to do that.

53
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,140
I love it.

54
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,380
And this first one comes in from Noah, not Noah Chalaya, a different Noah.

55
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,240
And he has a question about side projects, maybe hurting him more than helping him.

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,280
Because guys have been, been a big fan listening for years.

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,720
I have a question.

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,440
Is there such a thing as a bad side project?

59
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,600
I'm a web dev by day and I work on Django and Angular, those types of things.

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,040
But recently I've been really interested in making my own video game just for fun.

61
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,000
My concern is that video games are typically made in one of like the C languages, like

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,960
C or C plus plus, maybe even C sharp, which is not something I've ever used and it's not

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,360
something I use at work.

64
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,880
Would you guys think that this would be a, would you guys think that this would be bad,

65
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,400
would look bad to my employer if I ever tried to put it on my resume for a potential future

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,840
job or if my employer were to ask about a side project?

67
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,220
I fear that I may interpret that, I fear that they would interpret that.

68
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,920
I am not passionate about web development, which I am.

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,960
What do you guys think?

70
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,000
Is this no big deal or could it hurt me further down in my career?

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
It's a tough, I see where he's going because you know, we've talked about this in different

72
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,560
approaches like sometimes when you go down something and you experiment with a different

73
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,740
language than you typically work with, you learn something that makes you better at your

74
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,740
core job.

75
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,200
But what do you think?

76
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I mean, I, first of all, who hasn't been seduced by the desire to think you're going to write

77
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,680
a video game in a few months?

78
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Oh yeah.

79
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,960
Because it's, I don't, you know, as someone who is an employer and does that kind of thing,

80
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
right?

81
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Yeah.

82
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
I certainly don't see that as a negative.

83
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,480
I might, what I might do is I might ask you, okay, so you made a game on the side.

84
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
That's awesome.

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,120
Tell me what, what you picked technology wise and methodology wise and why did you pick

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
it?

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360
Just I'll treat it like any other job, right?

88
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,720
Any other, whether it was a client project that you had as a freelancer or in fact, in

89
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,920
a lot of ways I think it's a good thing because if it's your side project, you're making all

90
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,080
those decisions that really can influence, you know, the work I'm going to have you be

91
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
doing right.

92
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
So yeah, that's true.

93
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Yeah.

94
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
That's a good point.

95
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,880
And also if you couldn't tell me, if you couldn't tell me like reasonable answers to why you

96
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,740
did things and yeah, that would be bad.

97
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,440
You're also exercising a learning muscle that you don't get a lot of use out of once you

98
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,840
become really comfortable with something and it's a good skill to keep fresh and it's a

99
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,200
way to keep something fresh, sort of like just sort of incubating something.

100
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,360
Keep that going while you still focus on your main thing.

101
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,760
I don't think there's anything bad about it because it's really going to come down to

102
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,040
the results and how you balance your focus and your commitments.

103
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,400
And as long as you continue to do that correctly and deliver on your commitments as far as

104
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,320
they're concerned, I don't think you're going to have any problem.

105
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,280
It's a net positive as far as they're concerned, I'm sure.

106
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,560
Now there's a lot there's a lot we could talk about this week, including that calendar app

107
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,080
that was mining cryptocurrency.

108
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,240
It's a new kind of shareware.

109
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,600
But let's take a moment and let's talk about the Coder Radio Super Show, which we are doing

110
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,400
today on the program.

111
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,360
Now here's a little here's a little fact for you.

112
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,360
First episode of Coder Radio was released on June 11th, 2012.

113
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,320
Now to put that in perspective, because it's like, wow, that does seem like a long time

114
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
ago.

115
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,360
What was going on that year around that time?

116
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,720
The Mars Curiosity rover landed on Mars, Obama was reelected for a second term, Eric Holder

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,880
was held in contempt of Congress, the world was supposed to end on December 21st, stupid

118
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,760
Mayan calendar, and the space shuttle Endeavor had its final flight.

119
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,960
Microsoft also released Windows 8 that year.

120
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,080
And Instagram finally released a version for Android in 2012.

121
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,480
And of course, the big one, Facebook went public that year with initial stock offering

122
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,680
that was $38 per share.

123
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,240
That was what those are some of the things that were going on the year that we launched

124
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,800
kind of puts in perspective how long ago it was Obama getting reelected.

125
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,160
Oh, such simpler times.

126
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,400
And now different times back when we had a space shuttle and Windows 8 Oh, what a train

127
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,080
wreck that was feels like Windows 8 was longer ago.

128
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,840
They really Wow, they pulled out Windows 10.

129
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,800
We watched all of that we watched the train wreck of Windows 8.

130
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,440
The RT stuff because you Metro Yeah, because the whole debacle.

131
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,040
Yeah, that release of Windows 8 really is them trying to do Metro the single sync right

132
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,960
once run across all their platforms.

133
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,120
That was big when we launched the show was really big.

134
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,220
So much has changed.

135
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:50,200
So after 300 weeks, and many, many, many, many, many, many days, we thought it was time

136
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,520
to upgrade the show.

137
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,880
So we're adding new features to your code radio program at the same great free cost.

138
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,560
Some stuff that you won't even notice, except for maybe a few very eagle eyed listeners.

139
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,520
We've totally reworked the back end for code radio starting with this episode.

140
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,120
So assuming it goes out, the new back end works.

141
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,820
It's way faster.

142
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,040
It's based on industry best practices, which allows us to do really cool things like publish

143
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,080
the code radio program to Spotify now.

144
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,520
And utilizes the cash fly CDN to distribute the downloads crazy fast.

145
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,920
Really as fast as you can slam them on your device.

146
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,360
So if you fire up your podcast app on your mobile, when you're running out the door and

147
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,760
you've only got 30 seconds of Wi Fi before you're pulling out of the driveway, you're

148
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,160
going to get the code radio program.

149
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
I'm all about that.

150
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
It's really great.

151
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,760
I'm super stoked about that.

152
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,560
We also have a new RSS feed for the program.

153
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,580
This is important.

154
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,580
And you can get it directly.

155
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,360
You can enter it directly into your RSS catcher of choice.

156
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,120
It's coder dot show slash RSS coder dot show slash RSS.

157
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,200
If you want to select from like overcast or pocket cast or look at our different options

158
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,200
as we add them, you can go to coder dot show slash subscribe for all the different ways

159
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,460
to subscribe to the weekly show.

160
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,700
Now with the new RSS feed, and I am forwarding the old feed, but you may want to just resub

161
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,280
to make sure you're getting it directly.

162
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,220
But with the new RSS feed, we're going to address some long standing requests for the

163
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,040
code radio program.

164
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,440
We're going to include links in the RSS feed for all the stuff we talk about, including

165
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
on mobile podcast clients.

166
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,220
Because our current infrastructure can only deliver the description and the embed link.

167
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,920
It cannot distribute the HTML link structured properly in a way that isn't devastatingly

168
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,780
ugly.

169
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,940
But the new feed will.

170
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:48,580
So you will now get links in your mobile apps and on your desktop podcast or wherever you're

171
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:55,480
grabbing them, and we'll also have a new contact page, which is I'm hoping a little bit easier

172
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,560
to fill out and also flags them specifically in my inbox as coder radio listener feedback.

173
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,620
So now it's like I got these areas that will just bring your emails right up.

174
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,900
So Monday morning or whatever day we're doing the show, I go into this folder and bam, there's

175
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
all your feedback.

176
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,260
It's all been pre categorized, pre labeled.

177
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,320
You get that at coder dot show slash contact.

178
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,480
So it's a new contact page.

179
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,420
If you're not guessing, we have a new site coder dot show and all this stuff is linked

180
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,100
there.

181
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:27,020
And as part of this new transition, I feel like Coder radio deserves a doubling down

182
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,780
on investment from Jupiter broadcasting.

183
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
That's why we're redoing the back end.

184
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,420
And the other the other thing that we're going to change is at least for a little while,

185
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,500
I am personally going to take over the editing on the show.

186
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,460
And I have a goal of incremental improvements to our sound.

187
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,980
Hopefully you'll begin to notice it over the next couple of weeks.

188
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,140
Then we're just going to keep iterating.

189
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,740
It's going to be a process.

190
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,580
And as part of my editing, I'm going to start including chapter markers in the MP3 file.

191
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,600
So if you're sick of us talking about hardware or sick of us talking about Apple or apps

192
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,220
or whatever it is, whatever the particular discussion is that always triggers you, you

193
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,260
can now skip over that entire section with one tap to the next topic.

194
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,420
It'll be all bookmarked in the MP3 and you'll just need a podcast catcher that supports

195
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,780
chapter markers.

196
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,140
No more complaints, no more concerns.

197
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,660
We can talk about what we want and you guys can skip right over it and we'll know.

198
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,660
We'll know too.

199
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,660
So we're able to see what people are skipping.

200
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,780
It depends on the podcast catcher, but we actually get some data on that and it'll help

201
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,780
make the show better.

202
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,340
It depends on the like I say the player, but we do get some data on that.

203
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,180
And one of the things we're also going to do is standardize the way you get to all the

204
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,180
show notes.

205
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,420
We're going to make it dead simple with the new site.

206
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,420
So you go to coder.show slash episode number and that's it.

207
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,220
You want links for everything we talked about today?

208
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,620
Coder.show slash 300.

209
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,620
Can be simpler.

210
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,620
Coder.show slash 301.

211
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,140
You know, it's just a slash episode number.

212
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,500
You get the links, you get the download.

213
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,700
You can send time coded links from there.

214
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,820
So if Mike said something crazy about Rust, you can go right to that coder.show slash

215
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,960
300.

216
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,340
You can find the link with time code and you can send people time coded links to the Coder

217
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,800
Radio program now.

218
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:11,140
So it's coder.show for the new site, coder.show slash RSS to plug directly into your RSS client.

219
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:16,020
Coder.show slash subscribe for all of the different links just on a web page for subscribing.

220
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,780
And coder.show slash contact for the ways to get in contact.

221
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,560
The secret is just go to coder.show, get the new feed, engage in the new contact form.

222
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,380
It's all going to be totally revamped.

223
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,660
And for those of you that are on mobile listening on Podcast Catchers, which is our number one

224
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,980
demographic now, wasn't when the show necessarily started, I don't even know if that was a thing,

225
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,980
but it is now.

226
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,280
And so it's time for the Coder Radio to sort of modernize a little bit.

227
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,660
So we're going to start doing multi-track audio recording and editing.

228
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,080
We're going to start publishing all of our links in the mobile client.

229
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,220
So that way when you're on your podcast listening device, whatever it might be, for me, it's

230
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,220
overcast.

231
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,260
A lot of you love Pocket Casts, I hear about antenna pod and player.fm and all kinds of

232
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,660
other podcast clients.

233
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,700
Now that's going to be a first class experience.

234
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,400
You're going to get chapter markers, you're going to get links, it's going to blast down

235
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,140
on your device as fast as freaking possible.

236
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,120
I hope it's going to make it just a little bit more competitive.

237
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,860
And then over the next few weeks, we'll keep iterating on our sound to make it even sound

238
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,220
better and better.

239
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,940
And it's all at coder.show.

240
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,920
You can still go to the Jupyter Broadcasting website, it's still going to be published

241
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
there as well.

242
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,860
But the primary home is coder.show.

243
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,220
And hopefully that'll be a good resource for people that are new to the show and people

244
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,260
who have been listening to the show for quite a while.

245
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,780
And you'll get to use the new fancy back end just by listening to the show, which I'm really

246
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,780
excited about.

247
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,940
And get some TLC up in this business, Mike, for the 300, you know?

248
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,940
So we're rolling all these new features out as part of episode 300.

249
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,220
It's like a feature release.

250
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,260
How about that?

251
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,680
But wait, there's more.

252
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,780
There is more.

253
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,780
There is more.

254
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,780
You're right.

255
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,220
People would almost think we rehearsed that, but we did not.

256
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
We got to do some swag.

257
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,900
If nothing else, Mike and I want it.

258
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,100
And so we're doing sort of an assortment of things.

259
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,940
First of all, we've got a t-shirt.

260
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,020
We've got a t-shirt and a hoodie, teespring.com slash coder 300, links are in the show notes.

261
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:03,940
You can get yourself a Coder 300 t-shirt, which, by the way, that white Coder Radio

262
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,300
logo with a 300 on it looks really good with the green shirt, just at some of the demos

263
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,380
I've seen.

264
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,440
So it's teespring.com slash coder 300.

265
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,140
We got the shirt and the hoodie, depending on where you live, you can pick whatever is

266
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,820
best for your temperature.

267
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,260
And then we have my favorite swag item, Coder Radio coasters.

268
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,120
We have fricking coasters now for the Coder Radio program.

269
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,500
How amazing is this?

270
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,820
So it could be for water.

271
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,820
It totally could be for water.

272
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,820
It might be for a gin and tonic.

273
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
I mean, I'm not saying-

274
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
No, I don't know anything about that.

275
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
No, I'm not.

276
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
What do we know?

277
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
We're just saying.

278
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,820
But yeah, check that out.

279
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,460
It's a Zazzle URL, so it's long and complicated, but we'll have a link in the show notes for

280
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,660
that at coder.show slash 300.

281
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,660
The Coder Radio coaster.

282
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,140
I've got some in the studio right now.

283
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
Hear me?

284
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa there.

285
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
Whoa there.

286
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,140
I think this is so cool.

287
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
And you got some too.

288
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,140
I saw you demoing it, quote unquote, on your-

289
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,820
I'm using one for my tea right now, actually.

290
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
Awesome.

291
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,740
$1.50 for a coaster.

292
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,820
So get like a few of them.

293
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,340
And then one of the things that we started doing with Unfilter that I think we should

294
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,060
keep doing for all the shows, it looks so cool, it looks even better in person too,

295
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:14,380
is we're launching for a limited time a Coder Radio 300 poster.

296
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:20,060
And what it is, it's a word cloud of all of our different titles forming the 300.

297
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,220
And it's a nice looking glossy poster.

298
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,660
I've got one in the hallway for Unfilter, and I really like it.

299
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,940
I can't quite get it to fit on the frame for the video people, but I'll have to just bail

300
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
on that.

301
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,460
It's not going to work.

302
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,860
And it looks so good, Mike.

303
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,820
And it's clever too, because what you get to do is you walk up to it and you see all

304
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,140
the different titles and you think about, oh yeah, I remember that.

305
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,140
Oh yeah, I remember that.

306
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,180
Oh, that was a funny title.

307
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,860
And so away from it, you see the 300, but up close, it's all the different crazy titles

308
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,460
we've used for this.

309
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,940
I'm reading some of them right now.

310
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,020
Clustered Pie, Coder Inquisition, Backend Lock-in.

311
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
Freelancer.

312
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,020
Love it.

313
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
So that's the poster.

314
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,820
That's also a Zazzle long URL.

315
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,620
We're just doing these as limited things.

316
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,340
We're not going to make a fortune off this.

317
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,980
There might be a slight profit, but check it out at the show notes, coder.show slash

318
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
300.

319
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,340
We got the t-shirt and the hoodie.

320
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,340
We got the posters.

321
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,300
And of course, the Coder coasters.

322
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,620
Coder coasters.

323
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
All that's over there.

324
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,580
So whole new features, all that stuff.

325
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,820
Why don't we just catch our breath for a moment?

326
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
You good with that?

327
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
We catch our breath.

328
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,820
Let's talk about Digital Ocean.

329
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Do it.

330
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,260
Because they're giving away something pretty great too.

331
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:33,480
If you go to do.co slash coder, you can get a limited $100 credit.

332
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,900
Now I believe you will have to put a valid credit card on file, but they're not going

333
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,600
to charge it until after you use that $100 in credit.

334
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,160
Now Digital Ocean is simplicity at scale.

335
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,020
And they traditionally offer a $10 promo.

336
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:51,020
And you can really get pretty far with their crazy fast infrastructure and scale up pretty

337
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,520
fast to a pretty beefy system with a $10 credit.

338
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,120
So when they come around offering a $100 credit, I would really jump on this if you've ever

339
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
been on the fence.

340
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,340
Go to do.co slash coder to take advantage of the limited time offer.

341
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,580
Once you apply, you got 60 days to rock.

342
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,380
You can also go if you've already have an account, but you haven't applied a promo and

343
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,520
you just want to get the $10 credit and support the show, you can do that as well.

344
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
It's Coder Digital.

345
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
You apply that to your account.

346
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
So what is Digital Ocean?

347
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,220
Now if you've never heard us talk about it, it's really our trick to look professional

348
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,100
and have fast infrastructure on demand because they've taken care of all the hard stuff.

349
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Everything's SSD based.

350
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,560
They got eight data centers all over the world.

351
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,260
They're deploying Linux and KVM systems.

352
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,140
It's rockin fast 40 gigabit connections coming into these hypervisors and they've placed

353
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:42,660
the data centers in key places that have extremely, extremely good bandwidth, generally at critical

354
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,100
connection points on the internet.

355
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,060
So you can get on their boss level infrastructure for just unbelievable prices.

356
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:54,940
My favorite rig is just three cents, three cents an hour and they're offering $100 credit

357
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,940
here.

358
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,740
When you go to do.co slash coder and they have everything you need to set up a system,

359
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
get ready to go.

360
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,420
If you want to just deploy an entire GitLab stack with an Ubuntu LTS and a Docker container

361
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,260
and it's all set up the way you want it, you do it in seconds.

362
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,220
If you want to build a system from the ground up, you can do that too.

363
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,860
And they have an API that's easy to follow, clearly documented and I'm guessing, although

364
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,480
I don't know, but I'm guessing their entire digital ocean dashboard, their whole UI to

365
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,620
manage all of this is an API client because everything's there.

366
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,460
You want to expand a disk, you can do it via the API.

367
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,700
You want to shut down a system, you can do it via the API.

368
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,580
You want to take a snapshot or a backup, you can do it via the API, which means there's

369
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,300
tons of good code already written that you can just grab and use or you can write something

370
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,300
yourself.

371
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,700
You know, we've got, we've got a Ruby bot that does it and it's great.

372
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,220
It's just awesome.

373
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,220
It's so easy to start working with because it's whatever level you want to jump in.

374
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,540
If you're a newbie, you've never even set up a web server before, or if you've been

375
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,380
deploying servers for 13 years, it's going to work for you.

376
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,100
And then whenever you get stuck, they have world-class documentation, world-class.

377
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,700
They really, they have a full-time editorial team that really works to make that stuff

378
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,900
clean and easy to follow, digitalocean.com and get our a hundred dollar limited time

379
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:13,100
promo at do.co slash coder and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Coder

380
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,660
Radio Program, longtime supporters of the show and helping us get to 300 episodes, do.co

381
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,860
slash coder.

382
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,420
It's tough out there to make money selling software.

383
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,420
Shareware was a thing.

384
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,420
Remember neg screens?

385
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,580
You can use this for 15 days and then you have to pay.

386
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,460
And then there was in-app purchases.

387
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,940
Well, entrepreneur developers on the Mac platform created an app that's designed to

388
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,700
manage your calendar and it's called Creatively Calendar 2.

389
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,260
One of the things they decided to do to monetize their application was to offer users a few

390
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,860
different options.

391
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:53,220
Number one was you could activate all of the features permanently for a one-time $17.99

392
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,420
charge.

393
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:02,340
Number two is you could subscribe at 99 cents a month to get the features of the application,

394
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:10,660
all of them for 99 cents a month or the default option, choose nothing, pay nothing and the

395
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:16,060
calendar will quote unobtrusively mine cryptocurrency in the background.

396
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,300
And that's how they're monetizing the application.

397
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:25,500
And before Apple kicked them out of the Mac App Store, they made $2,000 in three days

398
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,740
by quietly mining cryptocurrency on Mac users and they couldn't have had what, more than

399
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
a hundred or so?

400
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,100
They could have had thousands and thousands of users, this is the damn Mac App Store we're

401
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
talking about.

402
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,700
So it could have only probably only a few hundred people mining crypto to pay for the

403
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,700
app.

404
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,820
How about that for a monetization strategy, Mr. Dominic?

405
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,500
You like that?

406
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,260
So when I saw this, I didn't think it was real.

407
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,260
I was surprised.

408
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:54,220
It actually made news when it entered the store before Apple even kicked it out.

409
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,580
I was like, how did Apple let this happen?

410
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,780
Then Apple was like, yeah, no, we're kicking this out.

411
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,980
I kind of think this is one of the few cases Apple's right to kick something out.

412
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:12,020
Now Apple does have a policy that says your application must be designed to use, I think

413
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,340
the verbiage is to be power efficient as possible, is the guideline.

414
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,740
I'm not sure that like mining cryptocurrency for some app developer is what you want to

415
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,740
be doing.

416
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,340
I agree, but at the same time, if they're clear about it, if they're saying, hey, this

417
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,780
has an $18 value to us.

418
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,300
And if you mine crypto, what about this?

419
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,940
What if they say if you mine cryptocurrency for two weeks, you'll be paid up?

420
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,300
Like if they're super clear about it, it's like a splash screen when you first launch

421
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,820
the application.

422
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,180
They're 100% transparent about it.

423
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,180
You know what?

424
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,860
This might be my old madness coming out.

425
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,700
It just seems bad to me.

426
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:57,740
Yeah, I'm torn because the open source cryptocurrency enthusiast in me says this could be a new

427
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,140
way for a win-win, for users to get free apps and for developers to monetize in a way that

428
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,540
isn't skeevy, that doesn't require even setting up Stripe and setting up a subscription service.

429
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,580
You just mine the crypto and send it to a wallet and it's all happening in the background

430
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,420
and you could even nice it to a certain level to make sure it doesn't abuse a person's system.

431
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,580
I would really like to know what the audience thinks about this because I also agree with

432
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,980
you, there's going to be a lot of people that have no idea what's going on.

433
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,980
It's going to burn through laptops faster.

434
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,580
If you start to even get more than one or two applications to start doing this, you're

435
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,940
going to have a massive fight for resources on people's computers.

436
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,540
So let us know what you guys think, coder.show slash contact.

437
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
I'm torn.

438
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,220
I'm 50 50 torn on this one because it almost seems like what you'd need is like some centralized

439
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,140
crypto mining service that every application could participate in because if they all are

440
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,300
off on their own mining crypto, it's going to be a God knows what on your system.

441
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
Yeah.

442
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,600
So Apple kicked them out, but they did generate $2,000, which makes me think if they did that

443
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,740
in three days on the Mac app store.

444
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,020
Oh, yeah, no, they would have had some money here.

445
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
Yeah.

446
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,020
Yeah.

447
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,020
Yeah.

448
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,020
Hey, just a quick one.

449
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,020
I don't even think I tossed this one in the doc.

450
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,740
But while we're talking Hoopla, did you see that Google just announced the change of Android

451
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,420
where to wear OS so no more Android where it's now where OS know if you I don't really

452
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,660
have thoughts on that, but Google needed one more OS.

453
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,540
It's Yeah, I wake up every morning thinking it's time.

454
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
Yeah, really?

455
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Yeah, really.

456
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,580
I think once they get fuchsia out, and once they get also they need another OS like they

457
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,660
need another messaging platform.

458
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,120
But this is this is to better they say they want to do this because they they're trying

459
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,800
to make it clear that certain aware functions also work on iOS.

460
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:45,540
And so calling it Android where is our calling it Android where makes it sound like it only

461
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,620
works with Android devices.

462
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,460
So calling it just where OS seems to speaking of iOS devices.

463
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,820
Yeah.

464
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,060
I also went to the Apple Store, Chris.

465
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,220
Who else went to the Apple Store?

466
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,460
You say also who else?

467
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,460
You did you have a HomePod.

468
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,300
Oh, she's still giving me a hard time about that.

469
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Okay.

470
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Yeah, I picked up an Apple Watch.

471
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
Oh, you did?

472
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Really?

473
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,940
I am living the wearable lifestyle in the Apple world.

474
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,980
You know what?

475
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:17,420
It is a significantly better than every Android wear watch I've ever used.

476
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,220
Yeah, I have owned.

477
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,260
I have owned three Android wear devices.

478
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,940
I have owned two pebbles.

479
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,820
And now I've owned two Apple Watches.

480
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,120
Because what I do is I buy them and sometimes return them.

481
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,040
Or what I also have done is I've gifted them to family and friends.

482
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,420
And then they usually know like my dad and my lady and kids, they know like dad wants

483
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,580
or Chris wants some feedback on how that's all working.

484
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:46,060
And so I still get active feedback, I gave my last Android wear watch to chase from unfilter.

485
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,380
And he still tells me, you know, he tells me about all the things he's trying with it.

486
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,460
And he's an enthusiast, too.

487
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,980
So he really tries to push it.

488
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,140
But I completely agree.

489
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,400
There is wearable devices like Fitbit and Android wear.

490
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,780
And then there's the Apple Watch, which is a different device.

491
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,180
It's closer to a computer on your wrist.

492
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,180
It's smooth, too.

493
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,180
It's smooth.

494
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,180
So why'd you get it?

495
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
Why did you drop the money?

496
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,940
I mean, why out of nowhere go get an Apple Watch?

497
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,860
Well, I'm working on a project that does have an Apple Watch integration.

498
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,860
Oh, you sneaky, you sneaky, you sneaky dog.

499
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,860
Sneaky sneaky.

500
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,860
Yeah, that makes sense.

501
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:23,980
But you know, it's a customer product, but it's interesting because the development experience,

502
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,860
like where the user experience on the Apple Watch is phenomenal.

503
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,900
And I've like done a little bit of Apple Watch integration before, but like never enough

504
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,220
to care.

505
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,180
It has not improved much at all.

506
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,180
Yeah, the apps really suck.

507
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:43,740
I think if you're buying an Apple Watch to use apps, you're going to be really disappointed.

508
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:51,860
So even to develop apps, I mean, it's surprising how just like, I know this is a bad analogy

509
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:57,100
and people are going to not like it, but it reminds me of like those old Java UI frameworks

510
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,060
from the 90s, like very rigid and not very good.

511
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,360
Well, I'll tell you what, I suspect having used the Apple Watch for quite a while is

512
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,900
it's the way Apple fundamentally approached it.

513
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,860
They designed it as a device that is dependent on a master device, the phone, and it's got

514
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,660
to have a Bluetooth or a Wi-Fi connection back to that device.

515
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,040
A lot of the application processing happens on the iPhone device and then it sends the

516
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,220
data over to the watch.

517
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,240
And now these watches have built-in LTE modems, they have Wi-Fi radios, they need to be independent

518
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,700
operators that are not connected to the iPhone at all.

519
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,540
And I think that initial design choice inhibits the applications and it limits what you can

520
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,900
do on the thing.

521
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,420
And the SDK probably reflects, I would imagine.

522
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,540
Yeah, that's exactly right.

523
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,140
That's exactly what the SDK looks like.

524
00:26:48,140 --> 00:27:01,260
Which I don't know why Apple, because originally the issues were battery life for the Apple

525
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,860
Watch because the original version was very weak, didn't last too long.

526
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,420
But it seems silly now when having used Android Wear, which has lots of problems, I'm not

527
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,940
like...

528
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,620
But you can do more interesting things on Android Wear.

529
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:22,020
The problem is you have no install base and the people who do have them, there are wide

530
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,740
variations between the different watches.

531
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,020
Yes, that has definitely been my experience.

532
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:37,900
You know what strikes me about this is Google, Amazon, and Apple are all moving into health

533
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,020
and media in a really, really kind of big way.

534
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:46,460
And Apple and Android Wear, or now Wear OS specifically, are gonna have different shots

535
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,900
at monitoring your heart, your blood pressure, your glucose levels, all these things they're

536
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,300
experimenting with, with these watches right now.

537
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,960
They're about to enter a totally new market.

538
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,980
And you gotta wonder, what is the downsides to that and what are the opportunities for

539
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,540
developers at the same time?

540
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,180
I'm really torn on that because it feels like it could be extremely invasive and it also

541
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,540
feels like it could be very monetizable for people creating different apps for activities

542
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,980
or biohacking or whatever.

543
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,700
It's gonna be a gold mine for some folks.

544
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:21,480
But looking at this, at first I would have thought, I know Apple's changed the most since

545
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,780
we started this show.

546
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,740
And then I would have thought about it somewhere, I would have said Microsoft.

547
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,060
No, it's really been Microsoft.

548
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,700
They made that pivot to really actually committing to Linux and open source.

549
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,100
But when I think about it, I think it's actually Amazon.

550
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,100
I think Amazon-

551
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
Really?

552
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
Yeah.

553
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:43,580
I mean, if you think about the fact that EC2 runs the entire internet now, and Amazon also

554
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,300
is the third most valuable company in the world.

555
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,260
And in 2014, they were totally missing all of their targets.

556
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:57,920
But this year, last quarter, they made a $60 billion profit.

557
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,780
And they now get 40% of all spending by US customers online.

558
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:09,460
54% of US households with internet use have Prime, 54% of US households that have internet

559
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,980
have Prime.

560
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,960
The Echo has 30,000 skills, it's way ahead of all of the competition.

561
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,780
They're gonna be selling pharmaceuticals soon, and they're launching deeper and deeper into

562
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,700
online services.

563
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,460
And then I look at Prime now too, they're becoming a media company.

564
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,780
By early 2017, Amazon had an audience of 26 million for all Prime video programming, which

565
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,500
is like the films, the TV show.

566
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
That's pretty good.

567
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,200
2017, they had 26 million Prime video program watchers.

568
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,700
They're firing on every single cylinder, they're about to open up a new headquarters, the headquarters

569
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,700
two.

570
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,860
I don't know, I think Amazon might be the sleeper.

571
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,540
Because everything they've been doing has been at the infrastructure level for so long.

572
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,140
And on the stuff that we don't really keep a close eye on, which is the brick and mortar

573
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,500
like domination game, that I think they've sort of just arrived all of a sudden from

574
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
our perspective.

575
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,760
But they're such a huge player, especially in IT.

576
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,620
I just think Amazon might be the real company to be watching out of all of these, like out

577
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,900
of the Apples and the Googles and the Microsoft.

578
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,340
I mean, their game is kind of figured out, but Amazon's just kind of getting started

579
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,340
in a way.

580
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,340
You know what I mean?

581
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,380
Like they still have Walmart to kill, they're opening up grocery stores, they just bought

582
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:32,540
Whole Foods, they bought Twitch, they just bought Ring, and they're going into home security

583
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,840
products now.

584
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,660
They're going to completely own the home.

585
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,180
They're turning your home into a store.

586
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,180
It's interesting.

587
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:45,200
I really wouldn't have thought of them like that in terms of changing over the time we've

588
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,900
been doing the show.

589
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,900
But I guess you're right.

590
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,900
I mean, they are in a lot of ways becoming, I don't even know and it's to borrow a term

591
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,420
from Steve Jobs in the 90s, your digital hub, right?

592
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:02,060
I'm thinking about all the things in my house that effectively run on She Who Will Not Be

593
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,060
Named, right?

594
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,180
Or the fact that my first, even for my business, my first thing is, oh, let's see what the

595
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,140
Amazon prices, buying on Amazon, right?

596
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,340
Because it's just easier.

597
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,940
And they've certainly gotten significant leadership in the emerging technologies.

598
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,860
I mean, they embrace stocker and containerization very fast.

599
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,140
Yeah, yeah, and they've been rewarded handsomely for it.

600
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:32,700
I mean, they are leading the pack in terms of with AWS, Lambda, I can't remember the

601
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,900
name of the technology now.

602
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Yeah.

603
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:41,740
And, you know, also, one of the things I want to toss in there was there's a term that's

604
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,460
being coined by the industry, by startups.

605
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,900
And it's called being Amazon, which means to have your business crushed because the

606
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,260
company got into your industry.

607
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,900
And fear of being Amazon has become such a defining feature of commerce.

608
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:01,200
It's easy to forget that, you know, around the start of our show, it was already beginning,

609
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,840
but around, you know, around that time, Amazon was still predominantly a bookstore.

610
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,460
They were a larger, they were bigger than that then.

611
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,660
But that was still what they were predominantly known for is that the discussion was, I think

612
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,700
Amazon is going to put Barnes and Noble out of business.

613
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,100
I don't think there's going to be more book and mortar bookstores, brick and mortar bookstores,

614
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,420
because Amazon is going to put them out of business.

615
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,860
Well, now that's a foregone conclusion.

616
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,860
Now that's obvious.

617
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,100
Of course that was going to happen.

618
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,100
But when the show started, that was the conversation.

619
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,140
Now look at them.

620
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,580
Now they run the Internet.

621
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,120
And Jeff Bezos has multiple deals with the CIA to run private infrastructure.

622
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,700
And he just bought a huge mansion in Washington, D.C.

623
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:41,140
Bezos is like a serious player now in politics and their company is a massive player on the

624
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,140
Internet.

625
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
All right.

626
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,100
But don't they remind you of someone else named Microsoft in the 90s now?

627
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Yeah, a little bit.

628
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,840
I mean, Google does more of that than Amazon.

629
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,700
Amazon feels like something new, you know, because they started as a retailer and now

630
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,020
they've morphed into an infrastructure company and a media company.

631
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:06,340
And they're soon going to become a pharmaceutical seller and a home security company.

632
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,340
I don't know, man.

633
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,340
I don't know.

634
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,380
You know, we do have some, you know, speaking of looking back, we do have some really, really

635
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,980
good data from Stack Overflow.

636
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,900
So before we get there, let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy for sponsoring the

637
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,100
Coder Radio program, LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

638
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,180
It's a platform to learn more about Linux and everything around Linux, the stuff that

639
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,580
makes you look great on the resume and the stuff that will really challenge you and push

640
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,580
your career forward.

641
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,580
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

642
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,140
I just wanted to leave you in suspense.

643
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,980
There you can support the show and sign up for a free seven day trial.

644
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,700
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

645
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,980
They have in-depth video courses on every Linux and cloud topic.

646
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,420
If you're in the DevOps field, they have courseware just for you.

647
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:49,440
If you want to go get certifications, they got tracks that are built just for that.

648
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,380
And if you're ready to deep dive into single topics, you got 15, 20 minutes tonight, they

649
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,100
got something for you to learn about firewalling or how the file system works.

650
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,400
Finally get permissions nailed.

651
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,540
How do ACLs really work?

652
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,040
How do extended attributes work?

653
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,620
They got courseware just on that.

654
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,140
And then if you ever get stuck, they got full time human beings.

655
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,260
They're there and ready to help.

656
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,380
In fact, they have all full instructor staff that's constantly adding, updating, maintaining

657
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,100
the courseware at Linux Academy and keeping your subscription valuable.

658
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,620
And you can start with a seven day free trial at LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

659
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,740
That's LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

660
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,220
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the CoderRadio program for so darn long.

661
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,640
And there's lots of CoderRadio listeners over there too.

662
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,220
So if you join the community, you'll be among friends.

663
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,680
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

664
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,940
So Stack Overflow has released their annual survey of developers.

665
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,900
And they have a bunch of different developers that have chimed in self-described back end

666
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:53,580
developers made up 57.9%, a full stack developer made up 48.2%, and a front end developer 37.8%.

667
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,420
And mobile developers only weighing in at 20% of those surveyed, which I thought was

668
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,140
kind of interesting.

669
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:05,500
And the numbers of contributing to open source were the exact opposite of what I expected.

670
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:13,660
All respondents said that no, 56.4% of them do not contribute to open source.

671
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,780
And 43.6% said they do.

672
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,140
I actually thought it'd be reversed.

673
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,900
And when you look at just professional developers, the numbers don't change much.

674
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,620
Coding as a hobby, 80% said yes, 19% said no.

675
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,300
There's a lot of different things in here though that I found to be pretty interesting,

676
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,260
including how long people took to learn and stuff like that.

677
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:38,300
But of course, the thing that I couldn't help but notice is that Linux was significantly

678
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,140
well represented in this.

679
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,620
In fact, Linux is moving to be one of the number one development platforms that developers

680
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,620
use.

681
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,620
Do you want to start there?

682
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,860
I mean, there's lots to get into, but man, did that totally jump out at me.

683
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,300
So there's actually two things about Linux on here that I would like to start with.

684
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,660
One is target platform, which makes sense if you're doing back end development.

685
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:06,020
I mean, sure, you could be on Azure IAS, but I hope you're not on IAS, it's a bad place.

686
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,020
Azure's fine.

687
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
I like Azure.

688
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:14,400
You might also be on BSD, but at some point, BSD just hurts more than it's worth.

689
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,420
That was for you, Alan.

690
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
It's not just...

691
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,700
Did you see the two data points though?

692
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,760
It's not just that it's the target platform, right?

693
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,700
It's also the dev environment that people are working in for their machine.

694
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
What is it?

695
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,940
It's only a few percentage points off from Mac OS.

696
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,860
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

697
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,860
Which is amazing.

698
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,340
I mean, we've been doing these Stack Overflow surveys for the entire length of the show

699
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,620
and that was not the case before.

700
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,620
Yeah.

701
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,900
Visual Studio Code also super well-represented.

702
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,900
Dominating.

703
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,900
Yep.

704
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
Mm-hmm.

705
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,900
Yeah.

706
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
Windows still doing pretty well.

707
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,820
But boy, we're talking about a decline for Windows and a huge rise for Linux.

708
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,320
That is really something.

709
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,140
The majority have at least two monitors too, which I thought was kind of funny.

710
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,340
I like that.

711
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,620
I mean, there was also the most loved, dreaded, and wanted platforms.

712
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:11,500
Linux was the most loved at 76.5, but then check this out.

713
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:17,980
Serverless was the second most loved platform at 75.2, followed by AWS and then the Raspberry

714
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
Pi.

715
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,820
Then a couple bit further down was iOS and Apple TV and Apple Watch and Mac OS.

716
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,820
What?

717
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,220
Then Firebase and then Android.

718
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,020
Android way down on the list there.

719
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,060
That's a bad show.

720
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,780
The most dreaded was SharePoint.

721
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,300
Of course.

722
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
That may...

723
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,980
I mean, I just shook a little bit.

724
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,980
Keep it going.

725
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
Yeah.

726
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,140
Drupal, Salesforce, and developing for mainframes, WordPress, and Windows Phone competing for

727
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,220
shared hate.

728
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,700
And then the most wanted.

729
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,820
The most wanted, I think, to get better.

730
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,380
I don't know what wanted really means.

731
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,740
But number one, Android.

732
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,280
Number two, Raspberry Pi.

733
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,680
Number three, AWS.

734
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,740
Number four, Linux.

735
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,060
And number five, iOS.

736
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,980
Google Cloud Platform makes a few honorable mentions on the list too, but man, does Linux

737
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,820
just make a dominant showing now.

738
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,820
Visual Studio Code is pretty popular.

739
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,300
I was really surprised by that.

740
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,420
Amongst mobile developers, you won't be too shocked to learn that Android Studio dominates

741
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,420
there, and Xcode as well.

742
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,100
That's no shocker.

743
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,420
When you sort of don't really have any other good choices.

744
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,420
Yeah.

745
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,420
It's funny how that works, huh?

746
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,420
Yeah.

747
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,220
Was there any trends or any numbers in here that felt like it was out of sync with what

748
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,180
you personally have experienced?

749
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,660
Nothing shocked me other than really just how popular Linux was.

750
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:41,720
So the two shocking things for me was actually serverless and Linux.

751
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,220
That was the term I was thinking of a few minutes ago.

752
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:52,700
I get why AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, which are two prominent serverless technologies,

753
00:38:52,700 --> 00:39:02,340
are convenient, but it seems odd that they would get so much adoption so quickly, given

754
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:08,620
that most enterprises, most things that are already in production, already have infrastructure

755
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,620
behind them.

756
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,620
Yeah.

757
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,980
I have thoughts on this.

758
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,680
Because we did sort of a rundown on TechSnap, and so I kind of did a deep dive into all

759
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
of this.

760
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,940
But there's a lot of trends that you could point to, including infrastructure management,

761
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,140
containerization, Docker, serverless.

762
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:37,340
They all are really about de-emphasizing the role of the sysadmin and empowering the developer

763
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,620
to go from concept to actually deploying code much faster.

764
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:47,100
If you think about when we started the show, it was much closer to go deploy a rack system.

765
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,100
You order the hardware.

766
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,460
You've got to figure out how much hardware you want.

767
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,460
You provision that.

768
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,660
Somebody slides into a rack for you.

769
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,980
They set up the base operating system.

770
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,660
They create you a user account that probably doesn't have all the privileges you need.

771
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,100
And then they email you the SSH login info and say, OK, you're good to go.

772
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,300
And then if you don't have the package, then you email the sysadmin back and say, hey,

773
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,020
can you install this Apache module?

774
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,320
I need this as well.

775
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,120
And then he gets to it later that day.

776
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
He logs into the box.

777
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,300
The app gets the Apache module, writes you back.

778
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,360
You say it's done.

779
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,360
You log in.

780
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,360
You say, oh, shit.

781
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,700
Turns out that's not the right version.

782
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,060
I need a newer version that's in the Debian repo.

783
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,540
And then he takes two days to get back to you because now he's got to go and install

784
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
it and go build it himself.

785
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,540
And he's grumpy about it.

786
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,200
And that's how you deployed software and set up code in the past.

787
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:32,700
And now, serverless, I believe, is the ultimate version of developers are just totally running

788
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,700
the show now.

789
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,500
They're totally running the infrastructure show.

790
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,060
They've outsourced infrastructure management to the professionals.

791
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,220
They don't ever have to talk to them.

792
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,660
They have this great abstraction layer between them.

793
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,320
They just ship their Go app up to Lambda.

794
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,140
It executes and returns the results.

795
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,140
They save the results.

796
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,140
Good to go.

797
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,220
They never had to order a server.

798
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,460
They never had to email a tech guy.

799
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,800
It's all manageable.

800
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,740
And they don't have to fuss with it.

801
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:00,120
And what I think we are seeing in 2018 is the complete swing from the sysadmins control

802
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,340
everything to now the developers control everything.

803
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,120
And if you look at Linux as a platform, it was built around the sysadmin.

804
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,440
You want to install some software?

805
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
You got to be root.

806
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,540
You want to open up a port?

807
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,540
You got to be root.

808
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,860
You got to have these permissions, these file permissions.

809
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,300
Everything has to be just right.

810
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,740
And it's really about the sysadmin.

811
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,380
The sysadmin sets up the box.

812
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,820
He sets up the software.

813
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:24,300
And then the users use the system that the sysadmin has provided them.

814
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,940
This is all being flipped on its head.

815
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:33,220
And containerization and serverless is the ultimate manifestation of the shift of power,

816
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,220
I think.

817
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,060
And it's happened right in front of our faces as we've done these 300 episodes.

818
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,060
Yeah, I know.

819
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,060
I completely agree.

820
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,500
I mean, there was a point when I was debating the virtue of just like getting a rack server,

821
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,100
which now would be completely insane.

822
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,620
It's ridiculous.

823
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,860
The Linux thing, the thing that wasn't surprising for me, though, was like just the dominance

824
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,700
of JavaScript, right?

825
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:59,740
Just the absolute, you know, it's the number one most used language, according to the survey.

826
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,180
Oh, let me pull up.

827
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,180
I just had that.

828
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,300
It wasn't Rust, although that was the most beloved.

829
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,300
You probably saw that.

830
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,300
No.

831
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,300
Yeah, I did see that.

832
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,300
Scrolling up.

833
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:14,340
Also, apparently, F sharp makes the most money, as well as Clojure and Perl still ranking

834
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,020
in a handsome salary as well.

835
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,600
But the number, let's see, that's the visual.

836
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
What is it?

837
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Do you remember?

838
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
I don't know if I remember.

839
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,060
Redis is the most loved wanted database.

840
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:31,060
Libraries and tools, TensorFlow libraries, the most loved Rust is the dreaded is visual

841
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,420
basic six, and wanted is Python and loved is Rust.

842
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,540
But yeah, platforms.

843
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,540
Long time love.

844
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,540
Go ahead.

845
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,740
What specific answer were you looking for out of there?

846
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,380
Were you looking for anything particular?

847
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,380
No.

848
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,380
It's just a-

849
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,380
JavaScript is 69.8%.

850
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,380
HTML-

851
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,380
Right.

852
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,380
This is what you're looking for.

853
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,380
JavaScript is 69.8%.

854
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,580
HTML is 68.5%.

855
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,660
And then it just kind of trails off from there.

856
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:02,180
I feel like over the years we've been in the show, we've seen a maturing of JavaScript

857
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:08,660
from annoying scripting language that I have to do because jQuery, to actual viable mature

858
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,620
programming language that you can write large scale applications in.

859
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,620
I completely agree.

860
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,620
Yeah.

861
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,620
Absolutely.

862
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,180
Side note, friend of the show, Ms. Holmes of Theranos, apparently is going to jail.

863
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,180
Why?

864
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,180
What?

865
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,180
Where did this come from?

866
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,580
The SCC, Ars Technica, this just came up.

867
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,580
Someone sent it to me.

868
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,500
The SCC charges Theranos with massive fraud.

869
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:34,980
CEO Holmes stripped of control.

870
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,980
Breaking news on the quarter radius program.

871
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,980
Yeah.

872
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,980
Yep.

873
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,980
Huh.

874
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:40,980
Okay.

875
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:47,900
Let's transition from the 2018 Stack Overflow results to your observations about the last

876
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,180
10 years of living with an SDK, a particular SDK.

877
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,340
Particular SDK though.

878
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,340
The iOS SDK.

879
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,340
Yeah.

880
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,340
Yeah.

881
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,340
How's that been?

882
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,580
I mean, it feels like a lot's changed and at the same time not a ton has.

883
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,020
But I sit further removed.

884
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,500
So I was thinking about this a lot this morning because I didn't know, should I put this in

885
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,500
the note?

886
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,500
Yeah.

887
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:19,980
I think the iOS SDK literally changed my life and I think a number of other developers'

888
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,740
lives for the better.

889
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,540
Let's go back in a time machine, let's go to 2008.

890
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,940
If it weren't for this, I would have still been doing websites and Java applets, right?

891
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:37,180
I'd be working in some big company, which is nothing wrong with being a dark matter

892
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,660
developer, but you know, it's not really what I wanted.

893
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:50,040
The iOS SDK was so new and the fact that Apple insisted on no flash apps and no really cross

894
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:58,300
solutions other than HTML5 meant that people had to choose to do Objective-C.

895
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,020
This is not going to be a swift bashing session yet.

896
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,740
What that did for Mike of the past was it let me, who was young and didn't really have

897
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:14,300
too many responsibilities, take a huge risk, huge, absolutely huge, learn this language

898
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,740
that is completely unmarketable to anywhere but iOS development.

899
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:22,660
Remember iOS development was not a certain thing the day it launched, right?

900
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:31,420
But it made me and other people who took the scramble a rare commodity, a rare service

901
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:36,460
provider which basically just allowed me to build a business from there because at one

902
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:45,340
point I was one of three iOS dev shops in New Jersey and the big digital agencies didn't

903
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,340
at least local to where I was.

904
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:51,860
It did not take iOS development seriously and even when they started taking it seriously,

905
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:57,060
they just outsourced it all to us because you have to remember people say it's a little

906
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,180
different now, there's a lot of similarities between dev shops and agencies and you could

907
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,460
argue they are the same.

908
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,880
But back then digital agencies were doing print ad buying and they were doing design

909
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,680
work and maybe a little bit of WordPress.

910
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,860
They didn't want to take on this crazy Objective-C engineering and remember when the iOS SDK first

911
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,100
came out, it was rough.

912
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:30,420
This was a true C-like system, right, it's built on Mac or very similar to Mac.

913
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:36,940
So it created this whole new market where you – and this is maybe a bit of a stretch

914
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:44,620
but it enabled a lot of people I think to open businesses and compete in a market that

915
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:51,220
was so immature that the large players didn't care for at the time, that it just opened

916
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,220
the doors.

917
00:46:52,220 --> 00:47:00,260
I'm just going through it, I mean you were there, how crazy, how serious, no one thought

918
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:05,700
the App Store was going to be serious because things like this, Windows Phone, the old version

919
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:13,220
of Windows, whatever they call it, had apps kind of, Palm had it, Blackberry, but the

920
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,020
carriers got all the money, it was awful if you were an app developer.

921
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:27,860
So Apple in the 70s, 30s, it really revolutionized that and I also think that the iPhone and

922
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:35,300
that development model has actually empowered frankly a generation of developers such as

923
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:41,460
myself who really would not have been able to do any of this stuff, right?

924
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:49,580
I mean people whine about making money online today, making money on the internet in 2008-2010

925
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,460
was not too good, right?

926
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,420
Trying to monetize a website then was not super easy either.

927
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,580
Right, or trying to make money living selling a Windows app was nearly impossible because

928
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,140
you didn't have distribution mechanisms, it was hard to reach the audience.

929
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,540
Right, Mac was slightly better but you really had to get like a Jim Dowell or someone like

930
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,740
that to basically promote you.

931
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,740
Yeah, right about it.

932
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:18,860
And if you didn't, you were screwed because who's going to go to ChrisApps.com and give

933
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:24,580
you their credit card or PayPal you some money and buy your app back then, no?

934
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,580
Really.

935
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,740
Yeah, I agree.

936
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:33,900
So thinking back, I think the hint was that there was a hacking community that was developing

937
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:38,340
around the iPhone to jailbreak it and install their own side apps but we were also being

938
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,860
told all the time, hey, you know what, we got these web apps and they're going to be

939
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:46,340
a great way to run apps on a phone and there was sort of that battle to be had and that's

940
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,540
also what WebOS came with is, hey, we're going to have web apps, this is a great way to do

941
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,540
it.

942
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,540
Ubuntu phone tried that as well.

943
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,040
So we had to watch that battle play out to see if that would work or would it require

944
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:01,880
native apps but I think what we learned was when you combine a distribution mechanism,

945
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,940
when you create a point where people know to go to find the application and then you

946
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:11,900
iterate on the features of the platform so you encourage users to keep upgrading like

947
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:19,480
faster CPUs, improved GPS, improved camera, improved cell phone modem speed, now of course

948
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,500
all the things are doing like better screens, larger screens, AR, they're trying to continue

949
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,700
that on but early on in the process, there were fundamental improvements.

950
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:33,820
The first iPhone didn't ship with an app store and it didn't even ship with 3G.

951
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,700
It was an old edge phone.

952
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,940
It just was crazy.

953
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,580
It was crazy.

954
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:43,260
And then they iterated on that and Android also did very quickly and you got to give

955
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,260
Google some credit.

956
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,220
Like they started out so, so rough.

957
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,580
I forget what it was, was it the Android market before it was called the Play Store and it

958
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,580
was so bad.

959
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,580
And...

960
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,580
Yeah, the Android marketplace.

961
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,580
Yeah.

962
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,580
Yeah.

963
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:59,180
And they iterated pretty quickly and they launched the Play APIs and they really started

964
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,580
to solve some problems.

965
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:05,380
I mean, looking back at it, what now looks like a breakneck pace, back then it felt like

966
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,900
we were waiting forever to get these features.

967
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,340
But now you look back at it and go, wow, they really hustled to get up to feature parity.

968
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:16,540
And so the Android platform very doggedly did that as the iOS platform continued on

969
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:22,340
and they both offered this new thing which wasn't available really to developers at least

970
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:27,220
to any wide capacity and that is a centralized app store with a review mechanism, a payment

971
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,100
mechanism so I didn't have to give payments information to each freaking developer for

972
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,020
each app I want to buy.

973
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:40,080
And they set up these OSs in a way that I, as an end user, not even having to understand

974
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:45,980
how sandboxing works, somehow know that I can load these phones up with these apps and

975
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,400
it's not gonna trash my system like it would slow down an old Mac or an old Windows box.

976
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,540
So there was a lower level of risk for users to experiment.

977
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,420
I didn't have to give payment information out a thousand times and it was just one tap

978
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,660
to delete it and I could leave them a bad review.

979
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,540
And so the barrier of entry was lower for developers, it was lower for end users, and

980
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,380
it was just like adding fuel to a fire.

981
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:09,980
And I think that's why it worked, I just think that's why when you say it enabled a new generation

982
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,580
of developers, I think that's one of the reasons it works so well.

983
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,140
And what the hell is gonna come along that replace that?

984
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,860
How do you top that?

985
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:18,860
I can't imagine.

986
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,900
It's gonna be coming eventually.

987
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:29,540
Well, yeah, I mean, we argue about this all the time, right?

988
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:38,060
I think, and this is where these chapter marks are gonna come in handy, I think we have been

989
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:44,740
a little negative on Apple because looking back, Apple's done a lot of dumb things, right?

990
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,980
Like when they decide they wanna impose their own like social mores and blah, blah, blah

991
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:53,300
on people and they overreact and like start ripping out Civil War video games or educational

992
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:58,860
programs because they don't like whatever, that's too much.

993
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:06,180
But the idea of an open marketplace, because the App Store is relatively open, right?

994
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,980
They do bad things, I've had issues, we had the thing where they took down, they unfutured

995
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,740
Coder Radio and we said something they didn't like, right?

996
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,100
But that is just human nature.

997
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:26,180
And I remember back to what it was like before the App Store, it was so much worse.

998
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:30,940
So when you say, where are we going, well, I think the future looks like the past.

999
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:36,380
I look at Echo apps, not apps, but Echo skills.

1000
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:42,580
And I look at the monetization story there, I look at, if I was in college, if it was

1001
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:49,460
10 years ago and I wanted to just write younger version of me, right?

1002
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:54,500
Mike today, who's in college, just getting out of college, starting a business, what's

1003
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,460
going to happen?

1004
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,580
Well I don't know how that Mike makes any money.

1005
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:04,020
I mean sure you can do consulting and you can build Echo skills for other people, but

1006
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:08,340
the pool of people who are going to want you to do that is going to be much lower because

1007
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,900
there's no way to really monetize it.

1008
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:15,460
I know, I understand that Amazon does send checks to people, but that's a little more

1009
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:19,920
than Jeff, Mr. Bezos' grace, right?

1010
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,220
There's no like, like again-

1011
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,620
There's no full-time strategy there.

1012
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:32,660
We rightly beat up on Apple, but the norm of you having a backend that you log into

1013
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:37,260
to the platform vendor site and they give you how many sales you have, where they came

1014
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,780
from, what the conversion rate was, foreign currency, what your year to date is, what

1015
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:48,740
your monthly is, and when your next wire transfer is coming in, that is, if you did any kind

1016
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:53,140
of like Blackberry development, what I just described is heaven, right?

1017
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:57,520
iTunes Connect, for all its warts, was absolutely revolutionary.

1018
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:03,580
The idea that the individual developer could, and I understand, and again, you can play

1019
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:13,060
tapes of myself criticizing Apple, but more or less be on an open plane, a flat plane

1020
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:19,060
against larger companies or larger developers, is something that did not exist until Apple

1021
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,700
made it happen, right?

1022
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,820
Your best bet in the past was you do some kind of freeware, shareware version, and you

1023
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:29,220
know, like Diablo 1, you try to monetize it after the fact, but then you have piracy and

1024
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,700
you basically made no money.

1025
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:37,940
What I'm worried about is I see all the, like I think Echo skills are amazing.

1026
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:44,380
I think these voice assistants, I think bots, I think all this stuff is going to be huge.

1027
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,860
Making money on this stuff is very, very hard.

1028
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:53,020
It looks like the strategy is going to have to be a holistic one of the bot or the skill,

1029
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,020
whichever term you prefer.

1030
00:54:54,020 --> 00:55:02,500
I tend to think that the skills are actually just a form of bot, but is not your product.

1031
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:08,700
It is another box you have to tick as part of your entire go-to-market strategy, right?

1032
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:13,260
And you have to monetize your service in some other way, whether that be consulting or you

1033
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,780
have like a, you know,

1034
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,780
Crypto miner.

1035
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,780
Yeah.

1036
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,780
Perhaps not.

1037
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:25,140
Maybe not the Bitcoin, but you got what I'm saying, right Chris?

1038
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,140
Or am I off the rails?

1039
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,140
No, I totally follow you.

1040
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,140
I like it.

1041
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:33,220
And it's the accumulation of really five years of reflecting on this stuff.

1042
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,860
And actually you're not just reflecting on it, you're actually out there working at trying

1043
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,260
to make it successful.

1044
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,780
And I totally follow like, how would new Mike start today?

1045
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,980
I wondered that about Chris too.

1046
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,300
How would new Chris start today?

1047
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,000
I don't know how to make it work.

1048
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,980
So we just got to keep doing what we're doing, I guess.

1049
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,580
I guess we just do this for another five years, Mike.

1050
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,580
That's the solution.

1051
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,580
Here's to another 300.

1052
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,580
Yes.

1053
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:55,180
Here's another 300, Mr. Dominic.

1054
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,640
Another 2000 days of Coder Radio.

1055
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,780
Is there anywhere you'd like to send people throughout the week to get more Dominic in

1056
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,780

1057
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,780
Yeah.
