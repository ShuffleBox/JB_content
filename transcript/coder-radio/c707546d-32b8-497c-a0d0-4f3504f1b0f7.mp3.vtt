This is Kota Radio, episode 358 for May 20th, 2019.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.600
Hi everyone and welcome to Kota Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show

00:35.600 --> 00:39.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and

00:39.000 --> 00:43.280
its related technologies. I'm filling in for Mr. West Payne this week who's off in

00:43.280 --> 00:48.720
Barcelona, Spain. It's a Kota classic because joining me as always is our host

00:48.720 --> 00:54.440
battling the Gators in Florida. It's Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike. Hello, hello Chris.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.560
Hello, it feels good right? It's back. You know it's like my

00:59.560 --> 01:02.600
ex-husband came back to me. This is beautiful. I love it. I just had to send

01:02.600 --> 01:05.920
him to Spain you know then finally could be you and me again. Just the two of us.

01:05.920 --> 01:12.640
That's an expensive way to do that. Hey I'm a VP now. Listen, that's right.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.520
That's right. You got that corporate job. Actually this is funny. Elle put it all

01:16.520 --> 01:20.760
together. I don't even think Linux Academy is paying for it. I think because Elle

01:20.760 --> 01:24.760
is such a contributor to the community that they like please come. I think this

01:24.760 --> 01:28.900
I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure like it was like all expenses paid trip.

01:28.900 --> 01:31.880
Although they do have to volunteer and do work. I don't know if we told them that

01:31.880 --> 01:38.880
yet but he'll figure that out pretty quick. Surprise. Yeah I know it's good to

01:38.880 --> 01:42.120
be with you. It's good to be with you. Especially on an episode where we've got

01:42.120 --> 01:45.640
like a good mix of hoopla, a good mix of feedback. The only thing we're missing

01:45.640 --> 01:48.640
is like a classic pick or something. Yeah. Maybe we can randomly come up with

01:48.640 --> 01:51.280
something. Like the Mac Pro we could talk about? Sure yeah I'm good with that.

01:51.280 --> 01:57.400
Oh that's not a pick. That's not a pick. That's a dream. That's a dream. All right

01:57.400 --> 01:59.880
so I was just gonna go through some of the feedback and see what you guys have

01:59.880 --> 02:04.480
wrecked while I've been gone. But you know because the universe hates me my

02:04.480 --> 02:08.400
markdown preview tool took a dump right as we started the show today. You ever

02:08.400 --> 02:11.440
had one of those? Happens all the time. I'll tell you what. I tell you. I tell you

02:11.440 --> 02:17.360
what. So anyways we're just narrowly avoiding too I should say. Narrowly

02:17.360 --> 02:20.320
avoiding the whole WWDC thing. Now I think you and Wes are gonna have to

02:20.320 --> 02:23.880
cover that next week right? Is it like it's the week after? It's very soon. It's

02:23.880 --> 02:29.800
June the 3rd? The only reason why I say we're narrowly avoiding it it's not that I

02:29.800 --> 02:33.960
mind the show talking about it it's just that if if I came on the show during the

02:33.960 --> 02:39.120
WWDC week. You'd buy five HomePods. No I'm gonna be too busy buying the HomePods to be on

02:39.120 --> 02:41.680
the show. Now everybody would assume we're talking about it because I'm on

02:41.680 --> 02:45.160
the show. Not because it's WWDC week but just because I'm on the show. Well let me

02:45.160 --> 02:49.920
explain something. Okay. If there is a Mac Pro launched we're gonna have to

02:49.920 --> 02:53.520
rename the show. Why was that? You think you're gonna get one? I have wanted one

02:53.520 --> 02:57.960
since I was a wee lad. Although I probably can't afford one given what

02:57.960 --> 03:01.920
they charge for the iMac Pro. It starts at like five thousand maybe six thousand.

03:01.920 --> 03:08.120
Oh I think five is generous. I'm thinking like eight. Really? Yeah I think

03:08.120 --> 03:12.480
it's like I think it's kidding aside I think it's a 10k plus purchase for most

03:12.480 --> 03:18.480
people. Which sounds insane to me but you know how Apple is they're gonna make it

03:18.480 --> 03:23.920
they're like you know this is our Tesla right mm-hmm yeah you wanted this fine

03:23.920 --> 03:29.160
pay for it that's what it's gonna be here's what we did we took a Dell case

03:29.160 --> 03:36.240
we laminated it a few times and we multiplied the price by 20 and ran Mac OS

03:36.240 --> 03:42.160
on it all right so let's get into some feedback from last week's episode three

03:42.160 --> 03:47.200
OS is one GPU Tom wrote in and he says Google has contributed a ton to Linux in

03:47.200 --> 03:51.000
the open source but at this point it's no comparison to what Microsoft is now

03:51.000 --> 03:55.080
doing they've got a lot of developer mindshare as a result of that but

03:55.080 --> 03:58.920
Microsoft's has spent a lot more on acquisitions and developer relations and

03:58.920 --> 04:03.080
has simply made some great moves since Nadella took over you have VS code

04:03.080 --> 04:07.200
github and typescript which are all crushing it now and it sure looks like

04:07.200 --> 04:11.560
2019 will be the year that Microsoft took over the software development scene

04:11.560 --> 04:16.000
he says by the way your analysis has been right all along all roads do lead

04:16.000 --> 04:18.820
to Azure Google was busy trying to pivot to the

04:18.820 --> 04:25.000
enterprise with Google Cloud Microsoft came along and snatched up the hard one

04:25.000 --> 04:31.480
dev mindshare right underneath them Google blew it by not buying github and

04:31.480 --> 04:36.520
I admire how Google tends to prefer to spend on engineers but in this case

04:36.520 --> 04:43.480
Microsoft outflanked them he's right only in that at all of the major events

04:43.480 --> 04:47.520
in the last couple of weeks I have seen people talking about a lot of Microsoft's

04:47.520 --> 04:51.200
tools Satya Nadella was up on stage at Red Hat VS code was on the slides at

04:51.200 --> 04:57.120
Red Hat it's huge right now what they're doing with github and the private

04:57.120 --> 05:00.520
repositories that they've just announced or public repositories as well it's it's

05:00.520 --> 05:06.600
um I don't know man it's like it's like Microsoft has has realized that they can

05:06.600 --> 05:11.560
be the the like the development platform for the for the web and Google is trying

05:11.560 --> 05:15.560
to still trying to like get like their infrastructure to be a legitimate

05:15.560 --> 05:20.160
product like they're going through a renaming process right now yeah they are

05:20.160 --> 05:25.720
actively trying to solicit businesses I've gotten a couple of notes from

05:25.720 --> 05:30.480
listeners that have gotten offers from Google to come in and write them a check

05:30.480 --> 05:34.880
to move off of AWS like they're they're really scrambling right now someone told

05:34.880 --> 05:38.400
me something like that I sort of didn't believe it I've got three different

05:38.400 --> 05:43.080
stories really that I can't directly share on air one that I have very very

05:43.080 --> 05:46.080
very familiar knowledge with and two others that I got very good

05:46.080 --> 05:50.560
descriptions of what the offers were yeah I mean there's so much there just

05:50.560 --> 05:55.160
with the AWS stuff and Google like if you've ever used Google App Engine and

05:55.160 --> 06:00.220
you've also used AWS or digital ocean and Docker Google it's just not a

06:00.220 --> 06:05.840
pleasant environment to work in it's not that it's bad it works right I mean I'm

06:05.840 --> 06:10.840
not trying to but yeah they're there's they're somewhat behind I mean I would

06:10.840 --> 06:16.600
say from a DevOps perspective my preferred solution is just do and doku

06:16.600 --> 06:22.320
my way to glory but if I have to use one of the big clouds AWS is uh although

06:22.320 --> 06:28.080
honestly Azure cuz yay click to deploy and I'm lazy you know I feel like what

06:28.080 --> 06:33.280
what Google Cloud had going for it was we can be sort of the neutral cloud

06:33.280 --> 06:36.600
provider we'll work with Kubernetes early on before anybody else would you

06:36.600 --> 06:41.440
know if they were that was that was their big well one and I shouldn't say

06:41.440 --> 06:45.080
they're big but that was one of their big value ads is that they were more

06:45.080 --> 06:48.360
vendor neutral they would work with multiple different vendors and clouds

06:48.360 --> 06:54.000
yeah and it turns out that wasn't that hard for the other vendors to implement

06:54.000 --> 06:58.320
it didn't take them that long to figure out a way to provide Kubernetes services

06:58.320 --> 07:02.040
and things like that and that's on my mind right now just because our crews at

07:02.040 --> 07:07.200
KubeCon like Wes but that sort of changed the game and I think it removed

07:07.200 --> 07:10.800
some of the value proposition of Google Cloud not all of it in fact there was a

07:10.800 --> 07:15.680
tech snap episode we did towards the beginning of the year I believe with a

07:15.680 --> 07:20.800
training architect from Linux Academy Matt you Lason who is brilliant and

07:20.800 --> 07:24.960
really knows the Google Cloud platform and was able to clearly clearly

07:24.960 --> 07:29.360
articulate reasons why it is a good product and so that is you know fair

07:29.360 --> 07:32.360
enough to them it is if they've built something there but it seems a little

07:32.360 --> 07:37.120
too late and I think that's really Tommy Tom's point in the feedback what do you

07:37.120 --> 07:42.680
think about this emax romance er wrote in hadn't really crossed my mind let's

07:42.680 --> 07:47.400
just chew on this for a sec for a second he says isn't in theory the Windows

07:47.400 --> 07:52.360
subsystem for Linux a version one more interesting from a technological point

07:52.360 --> 07:57.480
of view sort of more like how wine but it was in the opposite direction whereas

07:57.480 --> 08:03.200
WSL 2 is more like a tiny VM that's just running a Linux kernel in hyper V so

08:03.200 --> 08:07.400
it's not as tech like they were trying to do something technically really

08:07.400 --> 08:12.600
interesting with WSL 1 it didn't quite get there but in a way isn't it

08:12.600 --> 08:16.160
actually a more interesting technological experiment when you're

08:16.160 --> 08:20.380
doing that translation instead of just doing a big old VM I mean interesting in

08:20.380 --> 08:25.560
terms of was it more interesting to read the Microsoft research papers sure was it

08:25.560 --> 08:30.360
more practically viable well it's hard because WSL 2 isn't really out in a 1.0

08:30.360 --> 08:36.640
form yet yeah fair enough my bets gonna be no day-to-day like like you know we

08:36.640 --> 08:39.760
were talking a little bit about like my assertion that Windows 10 might end up

08:39.760 --> 08:46.320
becoming the most popular quote-unquote Linux distro yeah I mean it I I just

08:46.320 --> 08:49.440
have a feeling that from a practical boring perspective of getting crap dumb

08:49.440 --> 08:56.160
WS 2 is going to be the way to go but certainly there's an alternate universe

08:56.160 --> 09:02.760
maybe where I definitely get us a point where the work being done on WSL 1 for

09:02.760 --> 09:06.400
lack of a better term that kind of translation strategy might have actually

09:06.400 --> 09:09.320
bled into services like wine and stuff like that although we have a lot of

09:09.320 --> 09:13.680
stuff like that now right we have proton we have wine I almost feel like weirdly

09:13.680 --> 09:18.160
enough the odd man out here is Mac in terms of being able to kind of like

09:18.160 --> 09:22.480
cross-pollinate between the you know the ecosystems the systems right operating

09:22.480 --> 09:26.560
systems I do get his point and it did make me smile I think I kind of agree

09:26.560 --> 09:31.280
doing that translation is maybe more interesting but when it really comes

09:31.280 --> 09:34.520
down to it and you're just trying to get work done especially when you're trying

09:34.520 --> 09:39.280
to develop software the practical nature of having the entire kernel it's just

09:39.280 --> 09:44.800
matters so much more that that functions that I think at the end of the day I

09:44.800 --> 09:49.040
think we will not even really give it a second thought it doesn't matter moving

09:49.040 --> 09:54.840
forward speaking of Windows I was just reading this feedback from mangas I'm

09:54.840 --> 10:00.040
sure I'm getting that one wrong and he's he's pointing out a tool that makes me

10:00.040 --> 10:06.360
realize something if I were to spend like a solid year or to three years like

10:06.360 --> 10:10.320
just getting my head into Windows 10 I bet you I could make it a killer

10:10.320 --> 10:15.040
workstation OS he says hey Mike I wanted to point you to a little tool that you

10:15.040 --> 10:18.760
can use to update your Windows machine from the command line one of the

10:18.760 --> 10:23.520
features is it will do a reboot loop between updates meaning you just run

10:23.520 --> 10:27.040
something like this from a fresh install you come back a couple hours later with

10:27.040 --> 10:30.960
a fully updated Windows machine we'll have a link to that in the show notes

10:30.960 --> 10:36.760
ABC update I believe is what it's called and I bet you there is tons of like

10:36.760 --> 10:40.080
tools like that that if I could learn how to use those on Windows I could

10:40.080 --> 10:45.480
probably get by pretty good yeah I mean that would have saved me just so much

10:45.480 --> 10:50.680
time yeah that first the fresh install it's such a bad experience on Windows

10:50.680 --> 10:55.960
like it just really sucks it's weird to me that no one unlike the Windows team

10:55.960 --> 11:02.280
is like hey this is this is terrible can we like fix this right right and the

11:02.280 --> 11:07.560
excuse is always that this is the go-to the go-to excuse is well most Windows

11:07.560 --> 11:11.960
consumers never experienced that Windows they experience a Windows that they have

11:11.960 --> 11:16.400
pre-purchased on a PC yeah you know what those images are always like six to nine

11:16.400 --> 11:21.440
to a year out of date right six nine months maybe if you're lucky that they

11:21.440 --> 11:25.360
still have months worth of updates firmware updates and driver updates and

11:25.360 --> 11:28.600
all the individual applications with their individual install wizards and

11:28.600 --> 11:33.880
their individual update wizards are all gonna run it's no good but I like that

11:33.880 --> 11:37.520
feedback I lose really good feedback that was all from the subreddit this

11:37.520 --> 11:41.200
week I was gonna do a deep dive into the email inbox but there were so many great

11:41.200 --> 11:44.520
comments in the subreddit I stopped there and I left the email for you guys

11:44.520 --> 11:47.320
next week I didn't rob Peter pay Paul this week

11:47.320 --> 11:50.840
coder radio dot reddit comm if you want to jump in on that or if you would like

11:50.840 --> 11:57.160
to send an email it's coder dot show slash contact well it's kind of a lull

11:57.160 --> 12:02.120
this week cuz last week was Red Hat summit and it was the Python conference

12:02.120 --> 12:10.080
and it was build and Google IO and a few others this week it's like there's some

12:10.080 --> 12:14.720
hoopla but it's not like gonna change your world hoopla but that gives us an

12:14.720 --> 12:19.520
opportunity to kind of chat about a few things that are more retrospective and

12:19.520 --> 12:23.680
introspective and there's a post that you was it you that sniffed it up you or

12:23.680 --> 12:26.680
West sniff this up and we've been chatting about it in our slack this

12:26.680 --> 12:30.920
looking back at an app that somebody wrote like six years later where they

12:30.920 --> 12:35.320
took a really hard line stance about something and then you know six years

12:35.320 --> 12:39.080
later had some reflection and realized not everything is as black and white

12:39.080 --> 12:42.760
we'll link to the whole thing in the show notes but six years ago he writes I

12:42.760 --> 12:47.600
wrote one of my most popular blog posts on logic in a rails app in which I

12:47.600 --> 12:52.400
debate some of the critiques about extracting code from the controller but

12:52.400 --> 12:56.960
to summarize his argument was that rails is just a UI layer and business logic

12:56.960 --> 13:00.060
should be put in domain objects instead of keeping them somewhere in the model

13:00.060 --> 13:05.000
view or the controller he says to give you some context he writes it was a time

13:05.000 --> 13:08.840
when I was starting to grow as a rails or Ruby developer I was reading a lot of

13:08.840 --> 13:14.260
blog posts on the topics and I started to have very strong feelings as to how

13:14.260 --> 13:20.080
rails code should be written fast forward six years I'm back man I'm

13:20.080 --> 13:23.280
bringing I'm bringing everything it's all the classics and he says a lot of

13:23.280 --> 13:26.240
things have happened in my career as a software developer my experience has

13:26.240 --> 13:29.580
gotten more rich I've launched more projects my day-to-day work has changed

13:29.580 --> 13:34.280
I've climbed the company ladder and frankly he's gotten more emotionally

13:34.280 --> 13:37.760
mature which thankfully has prevented him from writing a few more

13:37.760 --> 13:42.640
controversial blog posts so what do I think about the post now he writes well

13:42.640 --> 13:46.360
it's really about the trade-offs and the personal preferences if you found a way

13:46.360 --> 13:51.060
to keep all the logic in the controller while your team iterates fast and does

13:51.060 --> 13:56.520
not make silly mistakes code is easily digestible new features can be added

13:56.520 --> 14:00.160
without pain then good for you it doesn't really matter what any other

14:00.160 --> 14:04.520
person says he writes that and I wonder this is really what I'd like to get your

14:04.520 --> 14:07.980
thoughts on too it's very hard to maintain a productive discussion on the

14:07.980 --> 14:12.520
internet about the right approach for building software because that may be

14:12.520 --> 14:17.520
very similar to just discussing religion for some people there's no much there's

14:17.520 --> 14:21.280
so my says there's so much hidden context that you might as well just

14:21.280 --> 14:26.040
respect the other's decision and focus on their personal insight instead oh my

14:26.040 --> 14:30.640
gosh that's beautiful that is that is my philosophy right there in words I've

14:30.640 --> 14:33.520
never been able to put it and I'm curious what you think about that I think

14:33.520 --> 14:39.600
that's pretty fair I mean I his original argument from six years ago isn't kind

14:39.600 --> 14:42.120
of that compelling to me either way because I just sort of don't think it

14:42.120 --> 14:48.640
matters it's weird though right like I had myself have been going through this

14:48.640 --> 14:54.600
kind of his enification process you sort of have to at some point just because

14:54.600 --> 14:59.160
like you're gonna end up dealing with a lot of systems and a lot of

14:59.160 --> 15:03.480
integrations now don't I'm not always perfect in this right it's a journey

15:03.480 --> 15:08.760
right it's it's a journey where you have to accept things that are maybe like

15:08.760 --> 15:13.000
violating what you consider to be principles of good engineering or

15:13.000 --> 15:17.440
whatever but yeah I mean I think it's interesting that this is a rails

15:17.440 --> 15:23.640
developer same as Andre Lisnick rails was known for being quite shall we say

15:23.640 --> 15:27.840
strict when it was originally launched way back in the you know the bad old

15:27.840 --> 15:33.420
days of what is it 2006 2008 oh yeah now rails is legacy and people are

15:33.420 --> 15:37.920
basically doing whatever the hell they want right having said that I'm not sure

15:37.920 --> 15:43.960
I'm ready to shave my head and join the the Hare Krishnas quite yet I mean the

15:43.960 --> 15:47.520
definitely are things that are just bad right like there were such a thing as

15:47.520 --> 15:53.360
wrong not everything is relative I pass it to Chris all right I think you well I

15:53.360 --> 15:55.600
don't really think we do I think we don't dwell on it I think you're

15:55.600 --> 16:03.240
probably right and it's it's it sort of tracks my evangelism for Linux when I

16:03.240 --> 16:07.080
was younger I built a career around convincing people to switch to Linux

16:07.080 --> 16:12.680
sure both you know as a contractor and as a podcaster and it was a everything

16:12.680 --> 16:19.520
should be on Linux everybody everything all Linux as I got older my mind shift

16:19.520 --> 16:25.040
has changed to Linux is a great solution for me but everybody has a reason to use

16:25.040 --> 16:29.640
the tools that they need to use and I don't understand all of the context of

16:29.640 --> 16:33.720
it and I think in part it has been I've been doing something that on the surface

16:33.720 --> 16:38.080
seems simple and people think they understand what's involved with making

16:38.080 --> 16:41.920
something and then when you actually learn what's involved you understand

16:41.920 --> 16:45.320
there's there's so many there's like what the words he uses here perfect

16:45.320 --> 16:50.760
there's so much hidden context there's so much hidden context that I cannot

16:50.760 --> 16:55.840
appreciate or understand that I just need to trust in their personal insights

16:55.840 --> 16:59.640
if I find that if I find someone to be intellectual and seems to have their

16:59.640 --> 17:04.760
crap together then I just tend to trust their insights and don't get judgy about

17:04.760 --> 17:09.160
the tools or the platforms they're using and I think that's a similar transition

17:09.160 --> 17:13.360
the author went through here and essentially yeah and I yeah I think

17:13.360 --> 17:17.080
there's also like there's the extremes here right there's full-on Buddhists and

17:17.080 --> 17:23.600
and then there's what is in my opinion far more common like reddit rage right

17:23.600 --> 17:30.880
yeah how much do you want to bet those people either skew young or they have

17:30.880 --> 17:34.360
something else going on if they're if they're I bet there's not a lot of

17:34.360 --> 17:37.520
people raging on reddit above 40 that don't have a complex set of

17:37.520 --> 17:44.000
circumstances speaking of complex circumstances I know right and the other

17:44.000 --> 17:46.640
and this is something we didn't get a chance to talk about a lot last week the

17:46.640 --> 17:51.600
Python language summit like I just alluded to earlier was going on and true

17:51.600 --> 17:57.080
to form we have pulled out what may be what some consider the most quote-unquote

17:57.080 --> 18:05.160
controversial talk it was by amber brown from the twisted project and she shared

18:05.160 --> 18:09.080
some of her criticisms about the Python standard library I thought maybe for

18:09.080 --> 18:12.520
some context if you're not familiar the twister project just a really short

18:12.520 --> 18:17.640
version it's an event based framework for internet applications so you know

18:17.640 --> 18:22.280
HTTP events SSH events IMAP events DNS events it something happens it triggers

18:22.280 --> 18:24.880
something yeah it's like an it's a networking library it's a very fancy

18:24.880 --> 18:30.720
networking library yeah it's great and boy she had some things to say and I

18:30.720 --> 18:33.760
just thought I'd read just you a couple of highlights we won't have to like read

18:33.760 --> 18:37.440
it all but she says Python claims to ship with batteries included but

18:37.440 --> 18:41.600
according to Brown without external packages it's really only marginally

18:41.600 --> 18:46.660
useful for example async IO requires external libraries to connect to a

18:46.660 --> 18:52.360
database to speak or to speak HTTP the SSL module requires monkey patches to

18:52.360 --> 18:57.520
connect to non ASCII domain names etc actually she looks like four different

18:57.520 --> 19:01.200
examples other standard library modules are simply inferior to alternatives on

19:01.200 --> 19:06.600
pypi the HTTP dot client documentation advises readers to use requests and the

19:06.600 --> 19:11.000
daytime module is confusing and compared itself to competitors such as arrow and

19:11.000 --> 19:15.360
default till and moment but there's also just poor quality lagging features and

19:15.360 --> 19:19.560
obsolete code she says the batteries are leaking she thinks some of the bugs in

19:19.560 --> 19:25.520
the standard library will never be fixed the batteries are leaking yeah yeah

19:25.520 --> 19:27.800
that's pretty good isn't it that is pretty good

19:27.800 --> 19:33.560
savage savage yeah and even when bugs are fixed pypi libraries like twisted

19:33.560 --> 19:38.160
cannot assume that they'll run on the latest Python so they must preserve their

19:38.160 --> 19:42.960
bug workarounds forever Brown identified new standard library features there were

19:42.960 --> 19:46.280
really too little or too late leaving users to depend on back ports to use

19:46.280 --> 19:50.160
features that were in Python to she's got several examples like socket dot

19:50.160 --> 19:54.520
send message and she says twisted is forced to ship its own C extension to

19:54.520 --> 19:59.600
use the send message in Python 2 even though pythons 2 is nearly at the end of

19:59.600 --> 20:06.680
life she says it's going to be until like the end of time they're going to

20:06.680 --> 20:11.120
hey she says quote distributions like Red Hat and others will keep Python 2

20:11.120 --> 20:20.920
alive until the goddamn end of time 100% true she says so we should set the same

20:20.920 --> 20:24.280
state here right cuz I think folks who don't work in like a Ruby ish Python

20:24.280 --> 20:29.400
world won't understand there are many reasons to dunk and make fun of Ruby

20:29.400 --> 20:35.560
developers and our defense is always how's that Python 3 transition going

20:35.560 --> 20:41.960
because it's not right right so there's a huge current schism between Python 2

20:41.960 --> 20:46.000
and Python 3 and like yes if you are doing a new project of course you just

20:46.000 --> 20:51.820
use Python 3 if your organization allows you to which spoiler alert many

20:51.820 --> 20:57.160
don't and you're fine but the truth is the transition just hasn't gone well

20:57.160 --> 21:02.640
it's caused like if you ever want to laugh it just go into a Python forum and

21:02.640 --> 21:07.120
say need help upgrading from Python 2 point insert version here to 3 and just

21:07.120 --> 21:12.440
like watch not that we should troll each other's communities that's wrong I mean

21:12.440 --> 21:18.640
I want to take a moment and just say Python I have a soft spot for Python so

21:18.640 --> 21:23.520
I got to defend my Python love a little bit here it is it is complicated but I

21:23.520 --> 21:27.360
don't know if the solution is to cram everything into the standard library and

21:27.360 --> 21:33.200
rip all the code out and to criticize it for for some of these things I think the

21:33.200 --> 21:36.940
flipside could also be argued you could argue that by developers like the

21:36.940 --> 21:43.200
twisted project continuing to use Python 2 code and encourage users to use the

21:43.200 --> 21:47.660
older Python stuff that you're slowing down the overall Python ecosystems

21:47.660 --> 21:51.600
yourselves and that if they were making users move forward the overall

21:51.600 --> 21:55.560
ecosystem would be in better shape so the blame goes both ways here I got I

21:55.560 --> 21:58.960
mean I just gotta defend Python a little bit yeah no I'm not actually against

21:58.960 --> 22:02.960
Python right so it's funny because I have kind of the opposite thing coming

22:02.960 --> 22:06.740
at this from someone who when given the choice between Python and Ruby went Ruby

22:06.740 --> 22:12.240
years ago I'm kind of jealous of the standard library like one of one of the

22:12.240 --> 22:17.360
annoying things for me is every Ruby project there's always like four or five

22:17.360 --> 22:22.800
gems you always have to use and in addition to rails right which is in

22:22.800 --> 22:29.400
itself like 30 gems it just seems crazy like like that model of architecture

22:29.400 --> 22:33.440
always makes me a little nervous because you have all these like literally 20 or

22:33.440 --> 22:38.320
30 external dependencies at least where in Python most of that basic stuff is

22:38.320 --> 22:44.520
kind of just built in batteries included hmm yep I think the challenge is and

22:44.520 --> 22:53.040
this is where this is where I think amber has has a great point is that the way

22:53.040 --> 22:58.640
the transition has effectively gone down from 2x to 3x I'm not gonna use

22:58.640 --> 23:03.560
individual versions because it's just too hard has basically created two

23:03.560 --> 23:08.840
pythons ah yes and you have to look at it from her perspective she's not a

23:08.840 --> 23:13.680
Python app developer you know we're like writing scripting or doing me she

23:13.680 --> 23:17.680
may be all of those things in addition but in her talk she's primarily

23:17.680 --> 23:22.480
representing her open source project which because of just their users

23:22.480 --> 23:27.640
demands right twisted is not a small project has to support both let's call

23:27.640 --> 23:32.360
it both the streams of Python which I don't know man I've been hearing about

23:32.360 --> 23:39.720
the Python 3 transition since before we started the show at some point I mean

23:39.720 --> 23:43.280
you had a you know last year they got rid of the benevolent dictator for life

23:43.280 --> 23:47.280
my why can't the last act be yeah and by the way we're just not supporting

23:47.280 --> 23:51.440
Python 2 which I know is destructive and bad and there are recordings of me

23:51.440 --> 23:56.240
complaining about things rails has done that like destroy stuff I was using and

23:56.240 --> 24:00.160
maybe rewrite it but it seems like there's some Delta between two

24:00.160 --> 24:05.160
relatively incompatible versions and you know we just blow things up every time

24:05.160 --> 24:07.640
you we have a change right like it seems like there's got to be a middle ground

24:07.640 --> 24:13.040
maybe like three years you know I think there's a handful of projects and I

24:13.040 --> 24:19.240
believe pythons one of the top three that really moved red hats hand on

24:19.240 --> 24:24.920
introducing a new feature to rel called app streams or in fedora it's called

24:24.920 --> 24:29.720
modularity and this is an idea where you can now have virtual software

24:29.720 --> 24:34.080
repositories that are outside of the version of your main distro so you can

24:34.080 --> 24:38.600
install rel 8 but you could install the rel 7 version of Python if you need old

24:38.600 --> 24:43.080
Python and when rel 9 comes out you could be on rel 8 and you could install

24:43.080 --> 24:47.040
the rel 9 version if you needed a newer version of Python or PHP or whatever it

24:47.040 --> 24:50.880
might be and it's then it's just all through your software package manager

24:50.880 --> 24:54.400
and it's all gets updated as long as it's a supported version that you know

24:54.400 --> 24:59.360
rail makes available and it's projects like this that have forced the software

24:59.360 --> 25:03.320
distributions the Linux distributions and others to come up with these kinds

25:03.320 --> 25:07.520
of creative solutions and you know that's probably you know it's also it's

25:07.520 --> 25:12.120
these kinds of things that have led to the rapid adoption of containers yeah I

25:12.120 --> 25:15.240
would think so because in that case you could have a container running the 2x

25:15.240 --> 25:21.280
stream the 3x stream and hopefully be okay okay so um there is also what is

25:21.280 --> 25:25.920
being quoted this is according to the high found blogspot article that we'll

25:25.920 --> 25:30.240
have linked in the show notes the most controversial comment that Brown made in

25:30.240 --> 25:33.760
her speech you know again and we're not criticizing I think good on her for

25:33.760 --> 25:37.720
bringing up these issues so I want to make that clear and that was adding

25:37.720 --> 25:42.680
modules to the standard library stifles innovation by discouraging programmers

25:42.680 --> 25:48.360
from using or contributing and completing pi pi package or pi pi

25:48.360 --> 25:52.320
packages I don't want sounds weird when I say it out like that is the naming

25:52.320 --> 25:57.440
that I never quite understood why they named it that but yeah yeah that's that's

25:57.440 --> 26:03.360
some that's some bacon I I don't know if I buy that I could I could kind of see

26:03.360 --> 26:06.960
it I guess they're worried about essentially being Sherlocked would be

26:06.960 --> 26:11.560
the concern I guess but the standard library is never gonna move as fast as

26:11.560 --> 26:18.360
an individual project oh obviously right and if there was ever a community where

26:18.360 --> 26:22.320
that was true maybe Cole balls a little slower and I you send your email to Alan

26:22.320 --> 26:27.440
at Jupiter broadcasting I mean I don't know I did at one point author and

26:27.440 --> 26:33.920
support an HTTP library and objective C long long ago and like you know NSH TP

26:33.920 --> 26:38.840
did exist right but yeah you could do like a get request in one line and at

26:38.840 --> 26:43.720
the time that was you know new for iOS with my library why why wouldn't that be

26:43.720 --> 26:47.160
true in other languages I'm just actually it is I'm using a library called

26:47.160 --> 26:53.240
sucker punch in rails Ruby on rails that does I think it's what is the hell is it

26:53.240 --> 26:56.840
delayed jobs but it does them as like it's just an abstraction right it does

26:56.840 --> 27:01.120
them as simple you know it spins up the workers all that fun stuff for you it's

27:01.120 --> 27:06.960
just a nicer interface I I do wonder if it's a more of a cultural thing in the

27:06.960 --> 27:10.120
community that Python developers are just used to turning to the standard

27:10.120 --> 27:14.160
library first maybe it's maybe it's because you know it's a lot of that you

27:14.160 --> 27:18.240
always know you it's available kind of kind of situation I think can I zoom out

27:18.240 --> 27:21.560
here for a second zoom out while you were talking and you're touching on a

27:21.560 --> 27:26.040
couple of these things like my community my community guy hat slipped on and I

27:26.040 --> 27:31.880
started thinking what's obvious when you read through the event and it happens a

27:31.880 --> 27:37.000
couple of different times in a couple of different ways the core team and some of

27:37.000 --> 27:40.920
the major developers on some of these projects are essentially just they're

27:40.920 --> 27:44.640
talking past each other and they have different sets of core concerns in fact

27:44.640 --> 27:48.440
in her talk Brown even kind of pointed out a little bit she said that few

27:48.440 --> 27:54.800
Python core developers are also major library maintainers so essentially to

27:54.800 --> 27:58.880
the core Python developers a library author complaints are devalued or

27:58.880 --> 28:01.360
ignored because you know it doesn't affect them there's not there's nothing

28:01.360 --> 28:04.560
that they're working on it's not they can't be their problem she said there's

28:04.560 --> 28:09.120
that issue there and so looking at this I think to me it's clear that people are

28:09.120 --> 28:14.280
talking past each other and then I also take Brown's point here that if nobody

28:14.280 --> 28:17.600
has any skin in that particular game they may not take it as seriously as they

28:17.600 --> 28:22.080
take their part of the job and so you have an empathy problem as well yeah and

28:22.080 --> 28:26.160
also you know I keep making analogies to Ruby one thing Ruby does not currently

28:26.160 --> 28:30.960
have that Python does is Python's being asked to do a lot of stuff right a lot

28:30.960 --> 28:34.960
of different domains with different I'll use the word stakeholders and different

28:34.960 --> 28:38.320
types of developers where let's be honest if you're right writing Ruby

28:38.320 --> 28:42.840
you're writing Rails right so for instance maybe the data scientists group

28:42.840 --> 28:46.920
who uses Python maybe the ML people all have different concerns compared to

28:46.920 --> 28:51.040
let's say you're a flask developer or Django developer and there's this weird

28:51.040 --> 28:57.480
Ubuntu guys running desktops app in Python to boot yeah are they still

28:57.480 --> 29:02.520
around anymore GTK is that a thing no I thought I thought I was using Vala now I

29:02.520 --> 29:08.440
thought that you've been drinking Cassidy's elementary OS Kool-Aid I see

29:08.440 --> 29:15.160
sometimes I tell you what sometimes it's just so pretty okay you know before we

29:15.160 --> 29:18.920
go I wouldn't mind since I haven't talked to I wouldn't mind getting like

29:18.920 --> 29:22.320
an update on on your Linux setup right now you run in Linux and is it still is

29:22.320 --> 29:26.200
it elementary is it Ubuntu is it pop where you are right now so things have

29:26.200 --> 29:30.640
calmed down my desktop workstation is the Mac Mini with Mac obviously oh yeah

29:30.640 --> 29:34.240
Mojave right yes you have to on those newer ones you don't have a choice you

29:34.240 --> 29:37.960
do you don't know choice how is the sound level on that thing well I have it

29:37.960 --> 29:43.360
plugged into the LG monitor so is it quiet though like you hear any fans no

29:43.360 --> 29:47.720
much less than yeah no it's the quietest machines yeah that's nice the

29:47.720 --> 29:55.200
laptop is the daughter which is running pop night I just updated it 1904 yeah

29:55.200 --> 30:02.480
1904 which is fine right pop is very Mac OS like in that it just works and every

30:02.480 --> 30:06.600
once in a while I forget which OS I'm on in Ruby mine and I get the wrong command

30:06.600 --> 30:12.080
the wrong key commands when you put the Mojave in dark mode I think it looks a

30:12.080 --> 30:17.280
lot like no Michelle yes it's also terrible though I'm liking my Mojave

30:17.280 --> 30:21.440
light these days just because there's always that one app I use that like

30:21.440 --> 30:26.240
doesn't respect dark mode and it's like whoa blinding geez we run an old stuff

30:26.240 --> 30:31.360
geez I'm sorry I will not pay for Photoshop again and then and then there

30:31.360 --> 30:35.200
must be a Windows box in this mix now yeah there's a there's a Windows there's

30:35.200 --> 30:38.160
a Windows laptop that's just used for demos and testing and there's Windows

30:38.160 --> 30:44.240
VMs basically everywhere are you are still WSL spelunking I am I'm liking a

30:44.240 --> 30:49.520
penguin quite a lot once WSL 2's out I'm probably gonna take a very serious look

30:49.520 --> 30:55.480
at it really yeah it's shipping a lot of things on Windows I mean most things

30:55.480 --> 31:00.440
it's weird I say that most things you know by volume and just by time worked

31:00.440 --> 31:04.100
we're are shipping on Linux because most of this technology is like web and

31:04.100 --> 31:08.000
server technology so it's all like back end anyway but the front ends more and

31:08.000 --> 31:12.480
more are just becoming like Windows I wonder if I bet you out there must be a

31:12.480 --> 31:16.080
build of that new terminal floating around out there I know you can build it

31:16.080 --> 31:18.840
from source right now but there must be a pre-built one I'm telling you it's

31:18.840 --> 31:22.720
compelling it sounds like some of the WSL folks that are involved like the

31:22.720 --> 31:26.920
penguin developer and some folks from canonical were treated pretty well by

31:26.920 --> 31:31.600
Microsoft around this entire thing got some information we're at the event at

31:31.600 --> 31:35.440
build if they could make it that seems like Microsoft did right I mean weirdly

31:35.440 --> 31:42.300
enough going into WWDC I'm actually looking at Microsoft saying okay what

31:42.300 --> 31:46.200
can Apple show for developers at WWDC which is allegedly a developer

31:46.200 --> 31:49.760
conference during that little keynote it's gonna be the year of marzipan no

31:49.760 --> 31:53.520
doubt right I hope it's not I hope in marzipan isn't the ace they think they

31:53.520 --> 31:57.680
have up their sleeve it is the answer is don't worry about all this other crap

31:57.680 --> 32:00.920
just develop for the Apple ecosystem it's simple it's clear this is how you

32:00.920 --> 32:04.160
build the application for both platforms this is how you'd sell it I

32:04.160 --> 32:08.600
mean it's it's a complete story it's an end-to-end story I mean for me it's just

32:08.600 --> 32:12.000
not a practical story no no for many I don't think it is I think that's their

32:12.000 --> 32:16.520
issue that's their gamble is is it practical for enough or is their

32:16.520 --> 32:21.360
ecosystem big enough that makes it forces some people to make it happen but

32:21.360 --> 32:24.960
yeah when you look at it it just marzipan and it just doesn't seem as

32:24.960 --> 32:28.000
compelling if it can't run on other platforms it's funny because when I

32:28.000 --> 32:31.560
think desktop software that I like professionally have to support it's

32:31.560 --> 32:35.600
always Windows now if you could write a marzipan application that would run on

32:35.600 --> 32:42.280
Windows and Linux like electron does dad let me just fantasize for a moment okay

32:42.280 --> 32:47.960
that they create some sort of super fast electron competitor you know just a

32:47.960 --> 32:51.240
screw with Microsoft it's not gonna happen but then it would at least be

32:51.240 --> 32:55.000
somewhat compelling right but if it's just you could your iPad app can run on

32:55.000 --> 33:00.600
the latest version of Mac OS that's a tiny tiny market there's hardly any iPad

33:00.600 --> 33:06.160
users and there's hardly any users of the current Mac OS like okay yeah all

33:06.160 --> 33:10.760
right I'll target about what is that about 300,000 people and how many of

33:10.760 --> 33:12.960
them are actually willing to pay me which is the other thing we didn't even

33:12.960 --> 33:17.000
cover this week the Apple Supreme Court app store pricing thing yeah I just

33:17.000 --> 33:19.760
don't even know what to make of that you know I think it's not gonna matter

33:19.760 --> 33:24.760
really yeah I mean what they're gonna lower 30% to 20% I mean what do you what

33:24.760 --> 33:28.080
do you think is gonna happen I don't know so for those of you that don't know

33:28.080 --> 33:31.480
this essentially opens up the possibility for people to sue Apple for

33:31.480 --> 33:35.040
monopoly practices with the App Store both both users and developers just

33:35.040 --> 33:39.160
yeah yeah and you could really see how a group of developers or users could come

33:39.160 --> 33:41.960
together and put a hell of a suit together there's gonna be some lawyer

33:41.960 --> 33:47.000
that love to go after some of that Apple money yeah but I mean I've heard

33:47.000 --> 33:52.880
everything from Apple doesn't have an issue here to Apple will have to enable

33:52.880 --> 33:58.480
sideloading of applications like they'll have to do gatekeeper for iOS I would be

33:58.480 --> 34:02.840
amazed if that happens but I know but the idea would be by default it only

34:02.840 --> 34:07.280
runs applications from the App Store but you can download applications but you

34:07.280 --> 34:10.360
have to run them in a certain way where the users authorizing them or something

34:10.360 --> 34:13.760
like you know I you know how like gatekeeper works on the Mac yeah yes I

34:13.760 --> 34:19.440
do I disable it yeah yeah I don't know it's hard to say with these kinds of

34:19.440 --> 34:24.320
things it really is we're going into an interesting place I mean I think you

34:24.320 --> 34:29.440
know just do a quick prediction I think this year's WWDC is either going to be

34:29.440 --> 34:32.360
one of the most interesting because they do something really really cool with a

34:32.360 --> 34:36.200
Mac Pro which really cool for Apple would be just do the obvious simple

34:36.200 --> 34:43.660
black box or like I have this concern I know people are gonna be mad the Apple

34:43.660 --> 34:47.980
Action Show but I have this concern that they think a Mars up hand is a really

34:47.980 --> 34:51.520
good idea and that it's like super cool and people are gonna be thrilled and

34:51.520 --> 34:55.280
like all the longtime developers were leaving for like Linux and Windows and

34:55.280 --> 35:00.200
moving on to web technologies all of me and a bunch of other people throwing the

35:00.200 --> 35:04.520
whole like Mac Exodus time are gonna just like come back and do Mars a pen

35:04.520 --> 35:09.600
which scares the crap out of me because it says there it suggests they're like

35:09.600 --> 35:13.600
missing the boat completely right it's definitely not a play to reclaim

35:13.600 --> 35:19.480
developers right like I I don't know I would be interested to hear from the

35:19.480 --> 35:24.280
audience yeah are you out there are you psyched about Mars a pen and if so why

35:24.280 --> 35:28.960
what like what do you is it that you already have a successful iPad app and

35:28.960 --> 35:33.600
you just like to kind of spiff off some sales for Mac which makes sense I mean

35:33.600 --> 35:36.320
okay I'll give you an example of this you know because you're saying like you

35:36.320 --> 35:41.920
know you run on the Mac mini what if as a result of bars a pan slack rebases

35:41.920 --> 35:46.400
their Mac app off of their iPad version and it uses half the amount of RAM it

35:46.400 --> 35:51.560
launches twice as fast it's only two gigs okay yeah I mean what if like what

35:51.560 --> 35:57.040
if what if that so there's an example of where developers from those companies

35:57.040 --> 36:01.160
who are already producing applications for both platforms can now save time and

36:01.160 --> 36:06.560
money and build for one and gets them off of electron possibly I doubt I

36:06.560 --> 36:09.400
actually seriously doubt slack would do it they have so much invested in their

36:09.400 --> 36:13.280
electron app now but it's a great example of one that would be a great

36:13.280 --> 36:17.600
opportunity I mean I kind of I almost feel like slack is the perfect case to

36:17.600 --> 36:22.000
do it right because they're their Mac app is notorious widely used and like

36:22.000 --> 36:28.200
notoriously crappy compared to native Mac apps but that that's just it's such

36:28.200 --> 36:32.600
a limited use case right so you already have to be big enough on Apple's

36:32.600 --> 36:39.960
platforms including Mac OS which is like just a very small platform for that to

36:39.960 --> 36:43.240
be worth it right what if you have a new project you're starting Chris are you

36:43.240 --> 36:50.520
really starting in marzipan no no given like Xamarin exists electron exists

36:50.520 --> 36:54.840
flutter exists it's more about you're starting you're gonna make an iOS app

36:54.840 --> 37:00.040
and now you can also make some Mac sales I think that's what it might be oh yeah

37:00.040 --> 37:05.640
it's gonna be shovel we're central to right like yeah yeah yeah yeah basically

37:05.640 --> 37:09.080
I'm thinking about it from like games to where the UI doesn't have to be very

37:09.080 --> 37:13.880
Mac like like those Altos Odyssey type games yeah I could see that if that

37:13.880 --> 37:17.080
would seems like that would just be a no-brainer for those shops it's gonna be

37:17.080 --> 37:24.160
a lot of crap man it's gonna be a lot of crap it's gonna be rough it's the Mac is

37:24.160 --> 37:29.020
going to such an interesting place right now with with marzipan and arm on the

37:29.020 --> 37:35.320
horizon and Apple's focus on iOS and the Mac Pro lingering like there it's it's

37:35.320 --> 37:40.120
it's interesting times for them right now and I feel like it's funny because

37:40.120 --> 37:44.120
just as a quick aside like my Linux world is more rock-solid than it's ever

37:44.120 --> 37:48.480
been like I'm the ThinkPad is still really really really working for me and

37:48.480 --> 37:53.680
I've been stupid happy with XFC it's just a very simple desktop environment I

37:53.680 --> 37:57.800
just really need my apps I don't need anything more it's stupid quick the

37:57.800 --> 38:01.600
thing wakes up faster than a MacBook this ThinkPad with all open source

38:01.600 --> 38:06.080
graphics drivers and XFCE like it's legitimately before the screens even

38:06.080 --> 38:10.340
like halfway up it's awake and ready to go it's really great and so I'm looking

38:10.340 --> 38:13.840
back you know from a very detached perspective now because none of my gear

38:13.840 --> 38:17.480
is dependent anymore on what they do where when we were doing the show just a

38:17.480 --> 38:20.240
couple of years ago there were some pieces in the production pipeline that

38:20.240 --> 38:28.240
were Mac machines and very critical I just I don't know it gives me a very

38:28.240 --> 38:31.280
different perspective now and I can't help but just chuckle a little bit

38:31.280 --> 38:33.840
because it's just fascinating to see where they're gonna go you know for

38:33.840 --> 38:38.560
people that depend on it for their day-to-day work tool who I say you know

38:38.560 --> 38:41.520
you look at Windows 10 the thing that they really have going for is not only

38:41.520 --> 38:45.320
is the surface line pretty decent Mike but then you do have a bunch of other

38:45.320 --> 38:49.960
vendor options if Microsoft ever screws that up and that's the Windows and

38:49.960 --> 38:54.120
Linux advantage I know I harp on that but I just think you look at it where

38:54.120 --> 38:58.480
there's just so much uncertainty right now on that platform and where I'm at I

38:58.480 --> 39:01.320
feel like I have more certainty than ever I've got more hardware choices than

39:01.320 --> 39:05.680
ever my desktops working better than it ever has I don't know it's just a really

39:05.680 --> 39:09.600
weird position to be in it's weird I mean and for those of us who are like

39:09.600 --> 39:13.640
somewhat tethered to the Mac ecosystem because we my case you know have to

39:13.640 --> 39:20.920
compile iOS apps and deploy them it's it's interesting like just ten years ago

39:20.920 --> 39:27.120
Apple I felt really had a good like firm grasp of the developer market right and

39:27.120 --> 39:32.120
now it's just like maybe it's the relative society see we I mean we can't

39:32.120 --> 39:39.560
really post more to it but it just seems like okay like I okay he cards on the

39:39.560 --> 39:45.280
table I'm terrified that they're gonna like release this Mac Pro and then in a

39:45.280 --> 39:49.600
year or two you know there will be lots of excited people who've been waiting

39:49.600 --> 39:54.220
for a Mac Pro who will spend lots of money right like this is a type of

39:54.220 --> 39:58.920
machine people are going to finance seriously no yeah and then they're gonna

39:58.920 --> 40:03.560
like switch to arm in a year or two right with their own chips I know that's

40:03.560 --> 40:08.400
what I was saying right which which is kind of like holy shit like you can't do

40:08.400 --> 40:13.240
like it's a huge risk it's a huge risk and it's it's so weird to me because if

40:13.240 --> 40:17.320
they had just like not been stubborn and made a simple black cube called it a Mac

40:17.320 --> 40:21.680
Pro and everybody would have been happy years ago I certainly wouldn't have gone

40:21.680 --> 40:26.820
down this primrose path here right like you it would have been fine right or put

40:26.820 --> 40:31.600
this another way wouldn't marzipan be a great opportunity for Apple to come out

40:31.600 --> 40:35.160
clear they're on the stage of WWDC they name this thing whatever it's gonna be

40:35.160 --> 40:40.480
finally called and they say and by the way this is the technology we're using

40:40.480 --> 40:45.160
to move the Mac to the ARM platform so that way you just knew straight up right

40:45.160 --> 40:49.520
then because there's a very good chance at the second half of the marzipan story

40:49.520 --> 40:54.280
is prepping the Mac for ARM and I think this is a great opportunity for them

40:54.280 --> 40:56.720
just to be straight up all right you want to depend on the Mac platform you

40:56.720 --> 41:00.840
want to plan for the next few years this is our intention and this is their

41:00.840 --> 41:04.680
opportunity this year at WWDC to be clear about it otherwise you're buying a

41:04.680 --> 41:08.880
$10,000 machine or what our $5,000 machine if you get a deal on an iMac Pro

41:08.880 --> 41:14.960
with a ARM transition looming on the horizon that you have no insights on yeah

41:14.960 --> 41:17.800
absolutely I mean and they have done stuff like that before without the

41:17.800 --> 41:23.360
telling you part remember the several years ago when they changed X code to

41:23.360 --> 41:27.560
compile not to native code but to bytecode which is there and why well

41:27.560 --> 41:30.440
because they had the Apple watch in labs but they didn't want to announce it and

41:30.440 --> 41:33.960
they needed to compile down to that architecture or whatever it was right I

41:33.960 --> 41:38.640
don't know and that was a good move you know it's made it it's made like the

41:38.640 --> 41:42.480
Apple watch transition to 64-bit lickety-split yeah I mean I mean the

41:42.480 --> 41:47.160
question is if you're a developer what tools are you using that exists on Mac

41:47.160 --> 41:53.280
OS that don't exist on Windows 10 or Linux and unless the answer is I

41:53.280 --> 41:58.960
develop iOS apps it's kind of like just do whatever you want and probably don't

41:58.960 --> 42:03.360
choose Mac at this point yeah and you're gonna get a taste of it because I

42:03.360 --> 42:10.240
believe then so Mojave is the last version of Mac OS that supports 32-bit

42:10.240 --> 42:13.560
applications well that's the other thing bunch of people have a bunch of like

42:13.560 --> 42:17.880
internal legacy Mac apps that are just gonna break yeah so that'll be a good

42:17.880 --> 42:23.600
test of the markets resiliency how how many people hold off on upgrading how

42:23.600 --> 42:27.040
many people upgrade and have things break or how many people upgrade and

42:27.040 --> 42:31.520
it's flawless like I have a suspicion I wouldn't have very much trouble I think

42:31.520 --> 42:35.480
a couple Adobe things I have are 32-bit and I don't really care about those too

42:35.480 --> 42:40.080
much so yeah that's what that'll be an interesting testing of the waters

42:40.080 --> 42:44.000
because that'll be out in the fall I would imagine yeah it should come out in

42:44.000 --> 42:47.520
the fall yeah yeah which is probably when the Mac Pro will ship too it'll

42:47.520 --> 42:52.800
ship in the fall with the new OS so does a Mac Pro ship do you think I think it

42:52.800 --> 42:58.480
does not a WWDC of course I know maybe they announce it then pre-orders open up

42:58.480 --> 43:03.760
like in October or whatever you know and then when the OS ships the Mac Pro ships

43:03.760 --> 43:07.760
and it ships in the week or two around the new OS with the OS pre-installed

43:07.760 --> 43:11.960
that seems like their style doesn't it because they'll satisfy everybody if

43:11.960 --> 43:15.520
they just announce it they don't actually have to ship it it'd be I mean

43:15.520 --> 43:18.520
they should because they're so far being remember that I think the trashcan was

43:18.520 --> 43:25.960
released and I might be wrong but I think was released in 2013 yes it's just

43:25.960 --> 43:32.160
just ask John circuit so he'll give you a hour by hour so they may not even

43:32.160 --> 43:37.900
release this thing they probably will not release this thing at WWDC and right

43:37.900 --> 43:44.680
now as we record this episode the current Mac Pro ladies and gentlemen

43:44.680 --> 43:53.080
yeah December 19th 2013 Wow December of so it was it was basically probably

43:53.080 --> 43:58.720
started shipping early 2014 yeah so 2020 if you pre-order one on day one happy

43:58.720 --> 44:02.960
new year second week of January and you know it's great to you know it's so

44:02.960 --> 44:07.000
great about Apple it's so it's so great because a product is a product and it

44:07.000 --> 44:10.680
costs a certain amount of money right and it doesn't matter you if you go to

44:10.680 --> 44:15.160
Best Buy right now or you go to the Apple Store or wherever you go there's

44:15.160 --> 44:19.720
still the same prices that they launched them with in 2013 of course they are a

44:19.720 --> 44:26.680
3 gigahertz late 2013 model with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 256 gigabyte

44:26.680 --> 44:32.080
hard drive and a single 8 core processor you know instead of a dual processor

44:32.080 --> 44:42.120
$4,000 for a machine from 2013 like I love that I love that about Apple it's

44:42.120 --> 44:46.880
like you know that the price is the price and it never changes you know what

44:46.880 --> 44:50.280
I wish I could negotiate like Tim Cook man that's like no just cost what it

44:50.280 --> 44:59.000
costs 1978 days since the last update well mr. Dominic it people don't have to

44:59.000 --> 45:02.920
wait that long for a coder radio in fact no it's every single week often on

45:02.920 --> 45:06.600
Mondays you can get it over at Jupiter broadcasting comm all the links

45:06.600 --> 45:10.160
subscribes all that stuff we have a dedicated site coder dot show go check

45:10.160 --> 45:13.240
that out coder dot show and of course the live stream calendar is Jupiter

45:13.240 --> 45:17.480
