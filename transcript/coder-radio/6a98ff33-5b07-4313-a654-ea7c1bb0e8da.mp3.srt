00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is Coder Radio, episode 338 for December 31st, 2018.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hi everyone and welcome to Coder Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and its related technologies.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This episode is recorded across the Pacific Northwest and the beautiful state of Florida. My name is Chris.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's not so important. What's more important is who's joining me from Florida. Why, yes, it is our very own Florida man. It is Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hello, Mike. 2019 is at the yes-a, at the bings-a. Oh, I thought maybe the year he finally, finally, finally went away.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Mesa gonna be with you forever. That's why I'm getting that impression. It's taking 338 weeks for it to sink in.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But it's starting to finally sink in. How are you doing? Did you have a good holiday? How are you?

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I had I had a wonderful holiday. I somehow accidentally bought out the toy store. Oh, yeah. I think I went a little overboard.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I did that, too. And I have discovered the joys of napping. Yeah, I was actually I wasn't sure if you wanted me to out you or not.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But Mr. Dominic is joining us fresh off of a nap. You know, I think it's about 3 p.m. where you're at right now.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And that I find is my peak napping time. If I'm going to if I could if I could sneak away and have a nap, that's peak nap time.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And it sounds like an old man thing to say, but naps might be one of the best life hacks.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm proud of you, although your timings a lot. It takes me at least for me.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It takes me a solid 30 minutes to turn back into a human being after a nap.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You know, I can do it pretty quickly. But let me tell you something. There is no greater luxury than going to sleep at two o'clock in the afternoon.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh, I know. I mean, it's decadent. It is. And it's one of the perks of, you know, being your own boss.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Right. Yes, absolutely. Yeah. I especially after our last episode where we got really hard on that whole thing.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Like it is there. It is good to sometimes take a step and go, man, you know, it's nice being being the master of my own domain.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's right. So the process. See, you want to learn my napping secret here?

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I do, because I actually no joke. It sounds like a bit, but I am planning to hone a healthy nap hygiene and hopeful habit in 2019.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So any tips you have for me, I would really appreciate.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So I have been perfecting the nap because you're right. You don't want that like groggy like nap hangover.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes. I don't think I can burn an hour. Right. I think I've got like a half hour, 45 minutes.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Maybe I can sneak here and there every other day.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So the trick is you want to do it right after you eat lunch.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I was thinking that, too, because you get like the food coma, the food coma.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And you want to have a little bit of coffee before you go to sleep, but right immediately before.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, man, this is good. Right. So that way, while you're sleeping, your body is digesting the caffeine.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You wake up the caffeine. Absolutely. You start metabolizing the caffeine.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So when you finally like in this case, the alarm for the show came on and woke me up.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You you're loaded with caffeine. So it only takes a minute or two to stabilize.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
OK, so are you are you a rough sleeper like I am?

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Like I have pretty horrible sleep. Yeah. Have you have you done a sleep study?

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The missus is pretty aggressively pushing.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah. My missus is pushing me to go get my second sleep study right now.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah. It's the worst. It's the worst.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's the worst. Yeah. I've gotten pretty deep into sleep tracking.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And I use a couple of different apps because, like I said, I'm deep into it.

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And what's great, I got to say a little quick Android versus iPhone on sleep tracking is I would say the most robust sleep tracking goes to Android.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sleep as Android is not nothing beats that.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Especially if you have Android where. But there is a distinct advantage to the way the Apple Watch does sleep tracking that is neat.

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And that isn't such that the Apple Watch is just tracking your movement and your heart rate and things like that and saving them to health kit.

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And then the apps analyze the health kit data so you can have three or four different sleep apps that aren't drawing down your watch battery or your phone battery while you sleep.

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They're analyzing the data collected while you slept. And so that is really cool.

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I've got different views into different sets of sleep data as I'm trying to lose weight and exercise.

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I mean, I'll get into this a bit later in the show and I'm tracking it all with these apps.

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's actually it's gone from just like navel gazing and playing with myself to actually creating a feedback loop that is that is reinforcing positive behavior that is positively influencing my sleep.

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm really excited about today's episode because I'm in a good space with like where I'm going in 2019.

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And it sounds like you've got some serious goals like, you know, I hate how I really I'm not a big fan of New Year's resolutions because I kind of just want to start right now.

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's always been my thing. But goals or new ways of thinking, thought technologies, if you will, or frameworks, I'm kind of all about that for the new year.

51
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So I think I'm really excited about today's episode to chat with you about it because you're full of good hacks already.

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But why don't we start with an email from Nicholas? Because this is great. Nicholas goes way back. In fact, he says, I've been listening since episode one.

53
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's a man who can tolerate some pain. Right. Like, Nicholas, first of all, thanks for putting up with us.

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We are not easy to listen to for that long. And I greatly appreciate your fortitude and willingness to put up with my ridiculous behavior.

55
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And I won't I won't speak for Mike, but you know what I'm talking about. All right. So I think we all know what we're talking about.

56
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He says, I've been listening since episode one. And I remembered I even remember, he says, when Koda Radio was being announced on the Linux action show.

57
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The start of my software career happened around the time of the start of the show, and I've never missed an episode.

58
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A couple of episodes ago, Chris struck a chord in regards to the future of Microsoft and Electron.

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It just so happens that weeks prior, I decided no J.S. had staying power and it was time for me to get involved.

60
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I come from a strong sequel in Java background. I well, you know, those established technologies.

61
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've branched off several times to learn Haskell or Clojure or Scala and Q2.

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
After learning these technologies and watching their adoption and communities flatline or decline into nothingness.

63
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I now feel like a defeated Viking sailing back with no treasure after a long raid.

64
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That is that is very relatable, Nicholas, right there.

65
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He goes on to say, when learning something new, I tend to have similar thoughts as Mike, or at least I think based on his comments.

66
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I remember back when Mike had his first run with Qt years ago, he got me excited about it and I could see why.

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There's an architecture beauty to Qt that causes a software developer to assume Qt has to take off.

68
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
How could such an engineering accomplishment not take off?

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's like this with so many great languages and frameworks, though.

70
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think the comments Chris made about Microsoft Electron and an electron have weight.

71
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Not not because node.js and JavaScript Electron are great technologies,

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
but because JavaScript has become the lowest common denominator for inexperienced developers to write a lot of code quickly.

73
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And often they make a big mess in the process.

74
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's also proving to fulfill the right once run everywhere promise.

75
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
My hope for 2019 and beyond is that Microsoft will get ahead of this being more of a Linux guy.

76
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I never expected Microsoft to be the shepherd for so many open source projects.

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And now. They have the potential to start replacing major applications with electron.

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Great show, guys, and best of luck for 2019.

79
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, Nicholas, isn't that interesting about the part that he says in here that really resonates with me?

80
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Is when he talks about how he looked at Qt and thought, how could such an engineering accomplishment not take off?

81
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I feel like we get stuck in that trap a lot, a lot, and sometimes early in the game before anything's taken off,

82
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
you don't have a lot of things to base your decision off of.

83
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So you kind of have to look at the engineering merits of something.

84
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's not always the biggest factor.

85
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Sometimes the market has other ideas, right?

86
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Things just don't go the way I mean, really, by all accounts, Qt should be huge right now.

87
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I mean, it's pretty big, but it should be. It should be.

88
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It should be. It should almost especially for kind of a more Linux leaning audience like we have.

89
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I feel like it should be more of a standard platform.

90
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's the way it should be a standard.

91
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It should be a standard, right?

92
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Like you want to develop an app using app as very loosely for, frankly, if you're a Linux action show or Linux unplugged user or action news now,

93
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I like the switch, by the way. I like the news.

94
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah, yeah.

95
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It has, you know, I mean, just saying, side note, it's had an unbelievable year.

96
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's been great.

97
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's been fabulous.

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
In fact, I'm dating you actually because I can't remember if it was Linux unplugged or Linux action news,

99
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
but our disappointed Viking reveals something in his email here that I'm struggling with.

100
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You know, I'm using my Mac and my Galaga like 50-50 because I have this giant Swiss project I'm doing.

101
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:27,000
One thing that keeps bothering me is that the apps on my Mac are pound for pound better with the exception of Slack, which is terrible.

102
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

103
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah, you know, and the other thing is, the other thing too is, you and I were chatting about this off air,

104
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,000
is that on the Mac, you generally, you have three or four apps to pick from and maybe one or two of them is really good.

105
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They're all slightly more than you'd like to pay for them, but you are willing to pay for them

106
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
because they are far and above beyond anything that's a web app or on Windows or on Linux desktop.

107
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And that, I mean, that hurts for me to say.

108
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

109
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And what I realized I was doing, and you guys that have been listening like Nicholas to the show for a long time,

110
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
know that I kind of, I come at this with an anti-web app bias.

111
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm an old fart who feels like my applications shouldn't be in a browser because the browser is unstable.

112
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's a security vulnerability.

113
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's also just a lot of runtime more than ever than to just run an application.

114
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It makes Wine look like a simple, simple thing when you're running a Windows application on Linux.

115
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If you think about it, if you think about running a Windows application under Wine on Linux,

116
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
that's more pure than running a damn application in a web app under, you know, Chrome or whatever.

117
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But as I, I'll just make this quick, as I've been transitioning to Linux after I got the ThinkPad and I just really went all in,

118
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I stopped video editing.

119
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That was really the marker, wasn't the ThinkPad.

120
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It was when I stopped video editing.

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I just, I just, all the Macs went out of my life.

122
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I just flushed the toilet.

123
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
All the Macs were gone.

124
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm no longer in the need of a Final Cut OS.

125
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And I started leaning a lot more on web apps and it's just awful.

126
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's just been, 2018 has been the year of web apps for me and it's been awful.

127
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah, I can't tell.

128
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm going to give you a real world example.

129
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I mean, I'm going to exclude Xcode from the conversation because that's kind of a compulsory.

130
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Same like Visual Studio on Windows.

131
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Like if your job requires it, then it's sort of a conversation ender.

132
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's sort of, yeah, right.

133
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
If you're developing in Swift and Xcode, yeah.

134
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But goddamn, an OmniGraffle, right?

135
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Like I just, I have to make a lot of like pretty diagrams for people because people want to know before they hire us to, you know,

136
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
build these systems for them, what they're going to get or at least what we think, you know, upon a discovery, right?

137
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Obviously things change.

138
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And I have been through at least a dozen, either web applications, wrapped electron apps, LibreOffice draw when I was in a particularly dark place.

139
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And it just makes more sense for me if I'm not already working on the Mac for that particular project to just switch over to the Mac and do it on Omni.

140
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Because I know it sounds like the dumbest thing if you've never used OmniGraffle, you're going to be like, no, it's the big deal.

141
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It is. It's Visio for human beings.

142
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Right. It's Visio if you don't actually hate yourself.

143
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah. Yeah. If you're not a cutter.

144
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Jeez. Got me on that one. All right.

145
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But unfortunately, like all things from the Omni group, it's not available on anything but the Mac and maybe, maybe iOS.

146
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And if and get ready to pay, because if you want the good version, it's 200 bucks.

147
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, by the way, that's the other irony.

148
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The iPad Pro version of this app, which does exist, is better than most of the web app alternatives on desktop.

149
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, 100 percent.

150
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So if I had to like let's just say like I did no more Swift work, which I got to talk about because for some reason that came back up.

151
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I probably would be more inclined to like get a Thelio, but still do all this documentation work on an iPad.

152
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Welcome to my world right now.

153
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, and Slack on iPad. I just want to say. Yeah. Well, native. It's so much better.

154
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's so much. You could just like port that. Right.

155
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
When this when that Marzipan thing comes out to port it to Mac, that should be their first step.

156
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
They should. And then. Yeah, seriously.

157
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Then the Mac version would be the best desktop superior to all the desktop versions.

158
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, I'm I'm not surprised that you and I are both feeling this way because think about it.

159
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So Omni Graffle. Great example. I think Omni Graffle is maybe the perfect example.

160
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The Omni group is the company that makes that Omni focus and a few other applications are pretty well known for.

161
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And they've been around for like 20 years.

162
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So you've got a dev shop with a 20 year legacy.

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You've got a platform that has 20 plus years of design ethos and thinking and language.

164
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You've got a stable, well set of documented APIs.

165
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You've got a distribution mechanism that you while it takes a large cut, provides your CDN and provides your payment processing, provides in that purchase mechanisms.

166
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Is it that surprising that you and I are sitting here going shit somehow, man, this has resulted in a better set of applications than what you get when you run something in a web browser on a free desktop.

167
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I actually don't think it's that surprising. It's disappointing.

168
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's for sure, because I'm a user of that free desktop talking to you on you.

169
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm on one right now as we're doing this. But I got to say, like Omni Graffle, Slack, you know, I'll throw another one out there.

170
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's just I'll stack this up against anything that's available on Android or the Linux desktop airmail.

171
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, yeah. If you have a few mail accounts, if you know if you if you're if you're tracking a female, nothing beats airmail.

172
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I've tried everything else. Nothing beats airmail. That is my email client of choice on Mac.

173
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, I will. It's that's what I use on the iPad.

174
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So the the. The weird shift that I'm I am really struggling with a bit is I've gone from a workflow shift where my desktops are my main source of truth to where.

175
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
His sounds, this sounds so douchebaggy, but it's just it's just the truth.

176
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
My my my iPad is the source of truth now. The iPad is because it's got I a writer, I a writer.

177
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'll put a link in the show notes. It's got to be one of the best text editors I've ever used.

178
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's got working copy on my iPad. Working copy has got to be no offense because Code Journal was awesome.

179
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But working copy has got to be one of the most powerful get clients for iOS that I've ever used.

180
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's just here's why I like working copy. Working copy can run in the background as glue.

181
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And you don't ever have to really use the app. Yeah, they've they've they've.

182
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So I can just I can be an I a writer and I can be writing show notes and I can be writing notes and I can hit save and working copy is saving that up on my GitHub repo for me.

183
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And it's saving each version up on GitHub for me as I'm sitting there writing and I'm just I I got to I really it's just so great because I just fire up the app.

184
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I just start writing. I hit save and everything in the background is going up to GitHub with me not having to do anything.

185
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And this workflow is pretty good. And so what I've what I've been doing over time is I'm trying to come up with.

186
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Workflows that are not specifically locked into iCloud. They're not locked into Google. They're not locked into one particular cloud vendor, but they work really great.

187
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And I can access them from the desktops and the iPad. But the primary the primary dependency is that the iPad can work flawlessly.

188
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The desktops and laptops are now secondary. If I can get it, if I can view it, if I can edit, that's great.

189
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But it has to be on the iPad, which is a complete 180 from where it was before the iPad Pro.

190
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I've even I know this sounds stupid, but I've even gotten myself set up now with a mechanical keyboard, a great mechanical keyboard, which one?

191
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's I think it's Mattias Pro. It's got the the one that's designed for the Apple command key.

192
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't know what I think it's. I'll try to find it. I'll try to put it in the show notes. I got the Mattias Pro hooked up to a USB hub that has power.

193
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's got it's got a professional sound connected to it. And then it's got professional monitors.

194
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I've got my speaker set up, my sound system and my speaker set up connected to my iPad is is bigger and more expensive than the iPad.

195
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's my editing speakers. I don't do a lot of editing anymore, but I have started editing on the iPad using Fahrenheit, which is a fantastic audio editor.

196
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And what I've learned is I've had to eat a little bit of my own hat because I wrote iOS off as a consumption operating system.

197
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You know, it's cute for phones. It's good. It's reliable.

198
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's you can expect it to perform on your phone and it makes a good phone operating system.

199
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But on the tablet, you know, Android's way better because you get access to the file system.

200
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You can connect actual storage devices. You can install a file browser like the Android would be a way better tablet operating system except for that.

201
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
They just dropped the ball and and the workflow on iOS has gotten a lot better.

202
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Some of the some of the things that I've really noticed is it's a lot like Unix.

203
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I know that sounds crazy, but a bunch of small apps I string together to accomplish something.

204
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I've gone on too long about it, but.

205
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It this 2019, I I have no idea at the end of 2019 where I'm going to end up with my desktop Linux usage because I think.

206
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I just I think I think I'll get into it, but I think I'm in a mindset now where the strongest will win.

207
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And whatever comes out strongest is what I'm going to end up using. And I go into it without any bias.

208
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So whatever just works the best for me is is what I'll walk out using by the end of 2019.

209
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I mean, in terms of different Linux environments or or whether it's the Linux desktop at all, all of it.

210
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So I'm going to launch a new series soon on the network, but I'm just really busy planning to get married and all that kind of stuff.

211
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Once I get all that done, I'm going to launch a series on the network called Distro Hopper,

212
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
where I just go through a bunch of different desktops and distros and try them all out and just see which one works for me.

213
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And if at the end of it, none of them work for me, I'll be honest about it. And I'm just going to switch.

214
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm just I've got this has got to stop. This has got to fucking stop. You know what I mean?

215
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Like this is yeah, I feel the same way. Yeah. Like it's it's like I've got a problem in a way.

216
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Like I've got a problem and I can't I am compulsive in this regard and I've got to get a handle on it because I'm wasting too many of my CPU cycles on it.

217
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You feel similar?

218
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So I'm going to make a cheap joke about myself breaking computers, but seriously, like I have paved and wiped and installed.

219
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Either Mac OS or.

220
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I know you feel this way, too, right? You have a way you want your system set up.

221
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And just always having to hop around, always having to switch has proven to be a tremendous waste of time.

222
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I got to be honest, I'm like I almost feel like if I can do one process improvement for the new year, it's.

223
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You know, whether I have to keep juggling Mac and Linux because I'm going to be stuck doing Swift development, I just have to have one set up for Mac, one set up for Linux.

224
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah. And that has to be good for the year. That's what I'm that's exactly where I just has to be done.

225
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah. Right. And you know what? Waste of time.

226
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I think maybe when when the cards fall where they are or where they may or whatever this whatever the stupid saying is, you know, maybe I end up on a known desktop and I get a 13 inch MacBook.

227
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Or something. I don't know. I don't know where it's going to go. I tell you what it comes out to.

228
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But we're relatively sure Windows 10 is not going to win this this beauty contest.

229
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
No, no. This isn't really what we we assemble here to talk about today.

230
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But but it is both of us kind of saying like we're not going to have another 2018 where we just flip and flop for like the whole year trying to figure this out.

231
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Like, yeah. And you know what? Part of it, part of for me is there's a risk in offending a portion of the audience.

232
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
If I come out and I say, you know, this is just way better on XYZ platform.

233
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what I choose. If I come out and say.

234
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm dropping plasma because of the multi monitor issues that I'm having and I'm switching back to Gnome and I'm switching back to Arch.

235
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm going to offend a ton of Ubuntu users and plasma users who have identified me as one of their champions who's rallying people to try plasma.

236
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And if I say if I say, well, I'm I'm I tried Gnome and it just didn't live up to what I want and I'm sticking with plasma, I'll offend all the Gnome people.

237
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So and if I say I'm switching to Mac, I'll offend all of the Linux users. And if I say the Mac didn't cut it, then all of the Mac people listening will say, what the fuck, man?

238
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You didn't give it a true shot. You're such a biased Linux user. Like, there's no winning for me in this.

239
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I've just got to get through it and have it over with. Yeah, I don't I don't think I'm going to be a little mean.

240
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I really don't think people should care as much as they do. That's it. Right.

241
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Like if the head of the Linux Foundation runs Linux or runs Mac or runs Windows, it shouldn't matter if that's it.

242
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
That is it. So like Swapnil is a Linux journalist who has a YouTube channel called The Fourth Industrial Revolution, if you want to look him up.

243
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And if you go look at his comments on his YouTube videos where he's interviewing Linus Torvalds, Greg Kh, just great people in the open source world.

244
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
He's there at the events. Excuse me. He's there at the events interviewing these people and he's doing a great job.

245
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And the comments are always, hey, man, did you edit this on a Mac? Hey, man, why aren't you using Linux Swap?

246
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Well, I mean, come on, Swap, why aren't you using Linux? And, you know.

247
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It is an obsession in the wrong area, because if you think about it, the desktop for Linux and for FreeBSD for all of the non-commercial operating systems is trivial.

248
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It really doesn't matter. All of the money being spent on open source is being spent on the enterprise.

249
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
All of the money being spent on desktop development is being spent in the commercial operating systems.

250
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The free desktops are, by the grace of God, a secondary benefit we get by Linux being a champion on Android and on IoT on servers.

251
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And for some reason, Red Hat spends an irrational amount of money on free desktop projects.

252
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And we are all here running our free desktop sort of riding on the coattails of desktop. Desktop Linux is riding on the coattails of server Linux.

253
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So are you suggesting that I'm not sure that I don't agree with this, that since the real game for Linux is an IoT and on the server,

254
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:44,000
all these little flame wars about, for instance, GNOME versus Plasma, which I think is the dumbest argument that goes on, are kind of completely useless.

255
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
We're not important.

256
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Total distractions.

257
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah, I have to agree with that.

258
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah. Meanwhile, there's like a whole billion dollar industry out there that is booming.

259
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And we're sitting here worried about are people writing Qt apps or GTK applications?

260
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Are you running Mac OS, Windows or KD or Plasma?

261
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Are you on Pop OS or are you on Ubuntu Mate?

262
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Are you on elementary OS or are you on Arch?

263
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Are you on OpenSUSE or are you on Fedora?

264
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The things that we're worried about are just, that's not what the market's worried about.

265
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
No, not at all.

266
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah, that's what the, I think that's ultimately going to be the lesson, hopefully of 2019,

267
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
because now that we have Microsoft being bigger in the space and a bunch of other companies,

268
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I don't, in a weird way, I do think we're going to see continued growth in the Linux desktop.

269
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah.

270
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But I think it's going to somehow be different.

271
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I think a lot of the real big money action is going to be, and continues to be, right,

272
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
this isn't a new trend, on the server side and particularly the IoT side, I think we're

273
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
going to see something pretty, I don't want to say like Docker for IoT, but something

274
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
like that that standardizes the IoT landscape.

275
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's one of the dirty little things that if you've ever done IoT development, it's very,

276
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
unless you're using like a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino, which is kind of IoT, but I'm

277
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
talking like 5G.

278
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yeah, also it's like consumer grade hardware, so it's a bit of a risk too.

279
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yeah, I'm talking about like real industrial grade IoT.

280
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
All of these platforms are kind of their own beautiful little ponies.

281
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Oh, sure.

282
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You've got to collect logs, you've got to ship updates, you've got to manage the lifespan

283
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
of the hardware, and you've got to stand up all those backend services to provide that.

284
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You've got to build all of that, unless you go with Azure Sphere OS.

285
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Right, which I still don't think, I mean, Azure Sphere is very interesting, but what

286
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm thinking more is like an open source, kind of like a Docker, like an abstraction

287
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
over the core system.

288
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Sort of like how, and I'm just saying as a comparison, not that it's going to be this,

289
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Project Treble is for Android, where you kind of abstract away some of the hardware stuff

290
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and you can keep the kernel and the software layer current, and then it's just this abstraction

291
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
layer that you have to kind of fiddly worry about the hardware implementation details.

292
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Something sort of like that, but for IoT?

293
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

294
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Exactly like that.

295
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I could see that.

296
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I could definitely see that.

297
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I think that'd be really, really good.

298
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And then let's move on.

299
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I want to get to your goals for the next year, but back to your Microsoft point, just super

300
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:39,000
quick, isn't Microsoft sort of total change of tone and doubling down on open source in

301
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
a way like a weird validation of everything that I just talked about?

302
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Microsoft is sort of proving that it's about the server side.

303
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's always been about the server side.

304
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And the desktop is just secondary for people that want to compete in that market.

305
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But if you're not making the hardware like Macs, like Chrome, like the Surface, then

306
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
it's almost not a game worth playing.

307
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You have to be, at this point in 2019 now, it has to be everything that has to be a complete

308
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
product.

309
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It needs to have storage.

310
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It needs to have applications.

311
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It needs to have all of these third parties that connect in with it, like Mac OS does,

312
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
like Chrome OS does, like Android does, like iOS does, and Windows.

313
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah, I think that's exactly the point.

314
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I think it's going to be...

315
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You mentioned a few weeks ago, I think, some pretty aggressive kind of hinting or predictions

316
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
about what Microsoft might do with Electron.

317
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah.

318
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
If they do that, I think that's going to be more than just make Electron on the desktop

319
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
better.

320
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I think we're going to see some sort of holistic...

321
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We're going to see something...

322
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
How can I say this?

323
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Like something where that technology, where the Electron technology becomes glue between

324
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
your server, your client software.

325
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Something bigger than just making Electron less crappy.

326
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah.

327
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah, of course.

328
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
That is Microsoft's bread and butter there, isn't it?

329
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That is really what they're kind of good at.

330
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,000
In fact, not to double down on my own theory here, but in a way, Microsoft, for a very,

331
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
very long time, has been a huge proponent of write once, run everywhere.

332
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
They've just done a really bad job.

333
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Well, they've done a great job.

334
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Hey, Chris, I have to update my J-Shot.

335
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'll be right back.

336
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Thank you.

337
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yes.

338
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You know exactly where I was going.

339
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That is exactly...

340
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
They've done a good job.

341
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
If you're in the Microsoft-only ecosystem, then write once, run on all Windows platforms

342
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
has worked for quite a while.

343
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But this is really about truly legitimately write once, run everywhere.

344
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Of course, it's the VHS of programming languages, but it is truly write once, run everywhere.

345
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And my prediction was that Windows would become the premier platform because Edge rebasing

346
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
on Chromium, they could bake in an Electron runtime into the OS.

347
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And Electron applications, it would require some modification in the stack like we talked

348
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
about.

349
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We covered that.

350
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
But it would make Windows a premier platform to run these Electron applications.

351
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And Microsoft would really just be fulfilling something that they've put a lot of energy

352
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
behind for a very, very long time, which is different attempts at the implementation.

353
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Once you get things like Office or a couple of other core applications in Electron, what

354
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:56,000
really starts to matter is that Chromium engine, not really even the Win32 API or the GDI-based

355
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:04,000
desktop, what really starts to matter is can you render that Chrome web data.

356
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And Microsoft, if they can get all of us to transition to that, gets a ton of flexibility

357
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
on the future of Windows.

358
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I don't know where they go with that.

359
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But if they're not thinking of this, if they're not, I mean, if they're not thinking about

360
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Electron as one of their many escape hatches from the Windows code legacy, then I don't

361
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
know what's wrong with them.

362
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's got to be part of...

363
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Microsoft doesn't do just one thing.

364
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Microsoft does things when it's beneficial in three, four, or five ways.

365
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And when they can say, all right, this benefits us in multiple ways, then they act.

366
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The move to Electron with their acquisition of GitHub, it enables them to provide applications

367
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
from multiple platforms, from mobile to desktop, and it allows them an escape hatch to get

368
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
off of the Windows code base if they want to move to something in the future.

369
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It just seems like they got to do it.

370
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
They got to.

371
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Yes, I'm even more ambitious than that with if they're going to do it.

372
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It's not going to be Windows, Linux, Mac, server, IoT.

373
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's going to be...

374
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
In fact, I think this is for everybody, including TMB, and I think you're going to see it a

375
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
lot too in the open source space of, you're not selling an app anymore.

376
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You're not selling consulting services.

377
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You're selling a full solution.

378
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Part of that may be you have an iOS app that runs Swift.

379
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Part of it may be that you're using some sort of like Azure Spheres.

380
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Actually, if they just do what they're doing with Azure Spheres with Electron, where there

381
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
is proprietary, I believe, I don't know.

382
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Did they say that we're going to open source Spheres OS?

383
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Ah, good question.

384
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I don't know.

385
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So, I mean, it's Linux, but the things they've added from my conversation with them are crash

386
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
metrics, secure updates, and things of that nature.

387
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And I don't think those are open source.

388
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Well, and there's also on part of...

389
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
In one way, the way that they market Spheres OS is kind of weird because it's not just

390
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
an IoT operating system.

391
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
The real value there is getting the basically pre-rolled security and a bunch of the pre-rolled

392
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
functions by connecting it to Azure, right?

393
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And that is...

394
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So, if you're considering...

395
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm just going to take a little Spheres OS tangent here.

396
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
If you're considering Spheres OS for your project, what you're really considering is

397
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
not, these are the boards I want to run.

398
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Right.

399
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
What you're saying is, I am buying this entire holistic solution that includes backend processing,

400
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
various security technologies on the backside.

401
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I know the Azure stuff is still proprietary.

402
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
This is how I'm going to collect my crash logs.

403
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
This is how I'm going to ship updates.

404
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
The whole package.

405
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yep.

406
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Right.

407
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I think more and more after listening for you for a few weeks about what you think about

408
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Electron, I think a very similar strategy where it's not you're running a desktop app

409
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
in Electron.

410
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It is you are producing a full holistic solution, leveraging these integrated technologies.

411
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It could all be all the way down to IoT, right?

412
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I could see some kind of weird integration between Microsoft approved Electron app and

413
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Spheres OS.

414
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Maybe that's too far.

415
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Maybe they don't see that as the same market, but why wouldn't they have just as they do

416
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,000
in Spheres OS, special prefabbed, basically developer niceties so that you as the ISV,

417
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
as the end developer can ship a just more robust solution, which is frankly what I think,

418
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
especially going into the new year, that's what it's going to be all about.

419
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's not going to be about give me a desktop app or give me a web app.

420
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It's going to be, I need an entire solution and I don't care about the platform.

421
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah.

422
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And does that, so going back to Nicholas's email, it started this whole conversation.

423
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
He talks in there about how Qt would have to be the dominant victor because it was such

424
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:13,000
a well engineered solution, which is how I felt about the Linux desktop for so, so long.

425
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And it's not really that, is it?

426
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's about the comprehensive product that makes it onto the market.

427
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's really, it's about so many other factors that we as geeks can kind of tune out a little

428
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
bit because, you know, a lot of times we'll, you know, in order to be ahead of everybody

429
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
else, you kind of, you kind of have to turn to kind of tune in to what's new and what

430
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
has possibilities.

431
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And you kind of have to tune out what popular culture is telling you to pay attention to,

432
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
to a degree.

433
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You know, you have to balance that.

434
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And I think we as geeks sometimes get trapped in this way of thinking and we think, well,

435
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the properly engineered solution is obviously is going to be the winning solution.

436
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah.

437
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I mean, I would add that Qt is kind of a weird special case because of their dual licensing

438
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
situation.

439
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah.

440
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And I've personally been in meetings where just the uncertainty around when exactly do

441
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
you violate the GPL has, yeah.

442
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
All the time.

443
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
All the time.

444
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Every day.

445
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I should get a shirt, violate the GPL every day and see how well it sells.

446
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I would not wear it because I know one of these jokers would actually try to, I could

447
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
already see it.

448
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That'd be no good.

449
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
All right.

450
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Well, why don't we, why don't we start talking about the things that we gathered here today?

451
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Sounds good.

452
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Great email, Nick.

453
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You definitely derailed us for 48 minutes.

454
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Thank you.

455
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Thank you, Nicholas.

456
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And thank you for listening since episode one.

457
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I really appreciate it.

458
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So moving forward now to your plans for next year.

459
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
What do you think, Mike?

460
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
What are your, I mean, if you want to call them goals, we can call them that.

461
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But where are you going next year?

462
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And if nothing else, what does present Mike hope that future Mike pulls off?

463
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That might be the way to think about it.

464
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah.

465
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Well, I really want to remove a lot of the thrashing from my processes.

466
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The biggest one being, you know, distro hopping and destroying laptops is not good.

467
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I know it sounds kind of like a joke, but it really was a tremendous source of just

468
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
waste, particularly of time.

469
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I need to start shipping first party products faster.

470
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So like not not not.

471
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
OK, just to make sure I'm clear, you mean not projects that you're doing because you

472
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
got a client doing them, but ones that you might sell directly to the market?

473
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yeah, I mean, continuing to do both.

474
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But the products through the market, it's definitely important to have a few things

475
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
out there.

476
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And there's just a lot of tools that I need for myself that currently don't exist or

477
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
don't exist in a form that I like.

478
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So I think that's a pretty good place to start.

479
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah.

480
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
This one, I think, is a little controversial.

481
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,000
OK, so I went on Twitter and I asked about TDD again because I knew Kara Swisher wasn't

482
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
available and I figured I'm going to get in the flame more.

483
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I mean, I think it would.

484
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I need to take another look at it.

485
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I still really, really don't buy it because I've just run into enough shady consulting

486
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
shops that just use it to pad invoices.

487
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Oh, sure.

488
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I mean, well, OK.

489
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah, I mean, do you not buy it in the sense that, you know, it's a small shop with only

490
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
so much time and a few people to actually do real work?

491
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Not not to even mention people that could be dedicated to writing tests.

492
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I mean, so if I guess flip your your lens, you're looking at the situation.

493
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And if you had a 25 person development team and three of them could be dedicated to writing

494
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
tests all the time, then maybe test driven development wouldn't be so bad, right?

495
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It's scale, isn't it?

496
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It's a scale issue.

497
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It could be a scale issue.

498
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I mean, I definitely agree with that.

499
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Obviously, you know, if we were 25 people.

500
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yeah, that probably does make sense.

501
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You've still got to answer questions about like test coverage and do you write tests

502
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
first, which we're doing TDD.

503
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You probably should.

504
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Although many people on Twitter say, well, they just do it in parallel.

505
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah.

506
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The real the real issue, because theoretically, if you buy the TDD Kool-Aid, even even at

507
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
a small scale, it should produce a benefit to you.

508
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I I have I have begun to sip upon the Kool-Aid and.

509
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,000
The people that I talk to that are trying to convince me, they tell me that if you spend

510
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
if you spend 10 hours, 20 hours developing your tests and thinking that through, you

511
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
spend significantly less time doing actual practical development because of all of the

512
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
front matter you had to do to create the test and work that through.

513
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And it generates these endpoint goals for you to test against.

514
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And so it's like sort of it just does so much of the pre-work.

515
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I have yet to actually verify this to me.

516
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm more of a just let's just jump in and start building kind of guy.

517
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But this is what I'm being told, because this is how they kind of work at Linux Academy

518
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
for their development, is they're like, let's define the scope.

519
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Let's define the test.

520
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Let's make sure this meets what we expect.

521
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
How do we measure it?

522
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Now we start building.

523
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And the head of engineering at Linux Academy told me that, you know, if we spend 20 hours

524
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
ahead of time planning, then that takes 20 hours out of development time and that she's

525
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
she's personally seen that and believes it.

526
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I have yet to adopt the methodology.

527
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Well, I've heard that before.

528
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And then when I get into the kind of like.

529
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
How question I get answers, it's yeah, right.

530
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah, it's definitely something I'm going to be exploring.

531
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm going to be pretty aggressively exploring the first quarter because it's getting to

532
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
the point where, you know, when this all became popular, we had just started the show.

533
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And there were a lot of naysayers, myself included.

534
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Now it's just the case that like maybe not TDD itself, but certainly automated testing

535
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
of some stripe is basically the accepted good practice.

536
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And there just has to be a reason for that, right?

537
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Like I hope maybe this is another agile consultant trick, but I hope it's good.

538
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I'll tell you what the skepticist in me says is that it's a way for people that are getting

539
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
paid full time by a business to justify their hours.

540
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:45,000
However, however, if you look at the way we do shows.

541
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It kind of is there is an analogy.

542
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
We spend a significant amount of time before the show thinking about the show, planning

543
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
the show, organizing the show, talking about the show.

544
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
In fact, the thing that takes the least amount of time in releasing the show and everything

545
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
is the actual recording of it, right?

546
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Like the editing takes more time, the planning, just you thinking about it takes more time.

547
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And all of that work means that when we sit down and do the show, we have a pretty tight,

548
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
compressed, ready to go show.

549
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And so we do all of the legwork ahead of time, and that's kind of what TDD is, if you think

550
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
about it in that way.

551
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Like that's how I've started thinking about it.

552
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And I guess that's the way to put it.

553
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I've shifted the way I think about it.

554
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Instead of validating the end result, I'm thinking about it as a way to validate the

555
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
work before I even start.

556
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And I think that's the shift.

557
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
If you're going to do TDD, that's the shift you got to make.

558
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I could be wrong.

559
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I'd love to hear what the audience thinks.

560
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah, I'd love to hear what the audience thinks.

561
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I mean, this is something where it's either going to be one of these situations where

562
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I just haven't seen the light yet, but maybe I will.

563
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So what else is in your future for 2019?

564
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
What else?

565
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I mean, that's big.

566
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I think some serious Swift development.

567
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

568
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
What?

569
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I'm sorry.

570
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Do we need to end the show?

571
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Should we just hang up?

572
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Should we rage quit right now?

573
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Hang on.

574
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Let me remove all liquids and metal objects from my desk.

575
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I can only imagine what the rest of your day was like after that Swift episode.

576
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I never thought about that.

577
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I never thought about what Mike's day was like after that.

578
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I know what my day was like.

579
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
There should have been a bonus content of just following me around with a GoPro, watching

580
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
me just rage at the world.

581
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Well, it's time to wave the white flag of Objective-C.

582
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Really?

583
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It only took me five years.

584
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Okay.

585
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
All right.

586
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I mean, I'm there with you, man.

587
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I was there for this fight with you.

588
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Unfortunately, the iPad Pro is becoming too good.

589
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And we kind of alluded to this in the beginning of the show, although I don't know if you

590
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
knew, oh, I did put it in the doc.

591
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:09,000
But there's just too much opportunity to make actual production apps for iOS right now,

592
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
which is what I have wanted.

593
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And please listen to the back catalog.

594
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And I have a feeling episode 104 will be your favorite.

595
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That I was willing to lose $40,000, work on Windows just to do this on WinRT.

596
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I still know iOS like super well.

597
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I do it for contracting work.

598
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I know what you mean.

599
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I know what you mean.

600
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It's still in that sweet spot for you.

601
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And say you want to scale out a team, like you know how to scale that out.

602
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I know all the tools.

603
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I know the code signing.

604
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
The art expectations.

605
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
How to play the App Store game.

606
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I know how to work with Apple reps.

607
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yeah.

608
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah.

609
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yeah.

610
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Yeah.

611
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And you know, it honestly, it would be a little silly and frankly a little petulant to just

612
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
not go with the flow.

613
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
This is the flow now.

614
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Hang on.

615
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm choking on blood right now.

616
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I know, right?

617
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
This is the flow.

618
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
This is now the flow, which we have now.

619
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's so amazing that this show really kind of started before the App Store was a phenomenon.

620
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And we've watched this happen, this phenomenon of learning how to game the App Store.

621
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Learning how to make sure that you're meeting the right features and getting the right design.

622
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And it would be honestly negligent if I took a completely, you know, just removed, detached

623
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
perspective.

624
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
You would be negligent in your business not to pursue this.

625
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Right.

626
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And it's exactly what I've been droning on about for six years.

627
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Seriously.

628
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So.

629
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah.

630
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah.

631
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's, you know, whether I think Swift is ultimately going to be a better language than Objective-C,

632
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
that's I think it really doesn't matter.

633
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
It doesn't matter.

634
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It doesn't matter if it's better or worse than Go or Rust.

635
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It doesn't matter.

636
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It's better than Rust.

637
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I mean.

638
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Oh, man.

639
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The emails.

640
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
They're coming already.

641
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
No, but the point is, right.

642
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
This was my dream.

643
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
If you listen to the back catalog, I was always, always, always on about this production tablet

644
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
apps.

645
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And I'm seeing you luxuriate with your Voltron out iPad Pro.

646
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Did you see the random?

647
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Did you look in the random thread today on our Slack?

648
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Did you see what I'm doing?

649
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Did you see what I'm doing?

650
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I did see that.

651
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I did see that.

652
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's amazing, dude.

653
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
For Batman.

654
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You can't do that with a laptop, right?

655
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
No.

656
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
No, you can't.

657
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It's getting to the point where literally it's the Surface RT dream come true.

658
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
All right.

659
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So for the audience, I got myself a tripod mount for the iPad.

660
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Now you're like, Chris, why do you have a tripod mount?

661
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Well, so think about somebody who is obsessed with production standards, who has to join

662
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
a weekly or sometimes many weekly video conferences.

663
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
One of my burdens, one of the things that is wrong with me is that I am obsessed with

664
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
making sure that my camera shot looks awesome in those meetings.

665
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I know I shouldn't, but I can't, I can't be on camera and have it look bad.

666
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Like I can't do that.

667
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Like, why am I like, I'll just turn my camera off, right?

668
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
So I got myself a tripod.

669
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I got to stand for the iPad.

670
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I already had a ring light.

671
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So I've got a vanity light that turns on and I've, I've mounted the iPad in the middle

672
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
of this vanity light with a ring light around it.

673
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So that way I am, I am the best looking person on those meetings.

674
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It's not the iPad doing that for you, I'm just saying.

675
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Hell.

676
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
But you can't, you can't, you can't mount your laptop like that or a desktop.

677
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And I don't like running the Zoom app on Linux.

678
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
It's actually kind of nice that Zoom does make the Zoom meeting thing available for Linux.

679
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I do appreciate that.

680
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Thank you.

681
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And I do use it, especially for like the quickies.

682
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I love it.

683
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
But for like the meetings where I'm going to be in a solid meeting for an hour, I would

684
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
rather have my laptop available to get work done in the meeting.

685
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And then I just use the tablet to run the native application.

686
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And I put that thing up on a, on a, on a, on a stand.

687
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And when I'm done, I pop it out and I, and I just put it back in its keyboard folio and

688
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
it's back to being a, you know, an email Slack, telegram machine.

689
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You know, it's just, it's really versatile in a way that a desktop computer is not.

690
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
All right.

691
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Are you, do you want me to do a couple?

692
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Do you want, are you good?

693
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
You go, take it out, take it away.

694
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Yeah, I'll do a couple.

695
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So I'm going to do something that anybody that is a listener of the Cortex podcast,

696
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I have it linked in the show notes, is maybe familiar with.

697
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And I don't normally do this kind of thing, but I've decided to do in the spirit of Cortex,

698
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
a year of theme.

699
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And I'm going to do for me personally, and only I could do this.

700
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It's interesting.

701
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
The year of structure, 2019 is going to be the year of structure.

702
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I, I, nobody else could really apply structure upon me.

703
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
You know, an employer and a significant other, they can't, I just reject it.

704
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Don't, don't give me your rules.

705
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Don't give me your playbook.

706
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I define what the playbook is.

707
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Right.

708
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But this, this has been a different kind of transition for me.

709
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:31,000
2019 is going to be interesting because after my divorce about four years ago,

710
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I just sort of embraced working my fucking ass off, just worked my ass off,

711
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
just really dedicated myself to working hard.

712
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And I said, things like routine and structure and rules, those are for losers.

713
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I'm going to focus on my work and things are going to flow from that.

714
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And that's what I'm going to do.

715
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And that's been good for a couple of years.

716
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I, you know, I built up the business.

717
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I got it to a point where I could sell it and, and then be choosy about how I sell it.

718
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So not only was I selling it, but I sold it in a way where I could be choosy

719
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,000
and make sure that the genuine things that are important about this network don't die.

720
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And for the most part, it's been a net positive.

721
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You know, editorially, they stay out.

722
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
You've never been, I mean, I'm not to speak for you, Mike,

723
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
but you've never been contacted by anybody at Linux Academy saying what you can or cannot say.

724
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I've never had a conversation with you saying what you can or cannot say.

725
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And, you know, so I wanted to make sure that it was a good sale too.

726
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And I had to get the business in a spot where it was enticing.

727
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So I had a bargaining chip there to make it sustainable.

728
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It wasn't like a big plan of mine.

729
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I didn't have some big plan for years.

730
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's just how it worked out.

731
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
But that's because I really just focused hardcore on the company.

732
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But I paid for that personally.

733
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I think some of the, some of the issues I had recently were a result of that.

734
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But I thought structure and rules were for people who had day jobs, you know, day jobs.

735
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Not for us self-employed people.

736
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
We make our own rules.

737
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Not for us wildcatters.

738
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
No, we're rogues.

739
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
We make our own rules.

740
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
We're rogues on the King's Highway.

741
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That's right.

742
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
That's right.

743
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Go as fast as I want.

744
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Nobody's going to give me a ticket.

745
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Turns out that was a bunch of horseshit, but I'll get to that.

746
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And in a way, it's not my fault.

747
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It's all completely my lady's fault.

748
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Thank you so much for making me do this.

749
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
No, not really.

750
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It's sort of been one of these things where I felt like after a couple of years I needed to up my game.

751
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And the only way I could up my game is by creating some routines and some structure that I follow.

752
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And structure is, and routines are interesting.

753
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And I'll give you an example.

754
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
If I told you, and this is actually true.

755
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:03,000
If I told you that every morning for the last month I've gone to the gym every weekday at 6 a.m.

756
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Shocking.

757
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Actually, I've gone at 5 a.m.

758
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I haven't gone at 6 a.m.

759
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I've gone at 5 a.m. every day.

760
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And I've been restricting my eating window from about 10 a.m. to about 4 p.m.

761
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And if it's outside of that, I don't eat.

762
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Wow.

763
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
How's that working for you?

764
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Pretty great.

765
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And you're impressed by that.

766
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Because what I am signaling to you is that I am a dependable person who outside of work has my shit together personally.

767
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And I'm going to these things.

768
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And I'm doing these things.

769
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And I'm not trying to brag.

770
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I'm just saying there is actual value in signaling that to the people around me.

771
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,000
So I'm officially now the leader of a team of people around me.

772
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And I expect them to do better than they've ever done before.

773
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
But if I expect them to do better than I've ever done before, well then I sure as hell need to start doing better than I've ever done before.

774
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Because actions speak louder than words.

775
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So when I wake up at 4.45 a.m. and I fucking don't feel like going to the gym, I remind myself that it's more than just my health.

776
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I am sending a message to the people around me about consistency.

777
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
About being a fucking adult.

778
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
About being responsible about the shit that I'm trying to do and getting it done.

779
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
And if I commit to it, I'm going to do it.

780
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Because that's what adults do.

781
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
That's what professionals do.

782
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
And that's what this whole year is about.

783
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And I said earlier, I was blaming my lady.

784
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But what kind of came up is she is shutting down her clinic.

785
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And she's going to more of like a mobile setup where she's going to go to people.

786
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And she's going to set up group sessions at retirement homes or community centers or hospitals and treat people there instead of having a clinic where they come to.

787
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And she's been struggling with, well, how do I know when to get up in the morning?

788
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
How do I know, you know, what my schedule is?

789
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
How do I keep myself accountable without any structure?

790
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And that's really what sort of made me think about this in a way where when I got divorced a few years ago, I rejected anybody that tried to apply rules to me or structure because, you know, screw them.

791
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I'm my own boss.

792
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
But now I see the value in it.

793
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I see the value in routine.

794
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I see the value in structure.

795
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And I'm choosing to implement it upon myself.

796
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Like I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to adopt a regime of structure over 2019 and I'm going to make myself try it for a year because the first month sucks.

797
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
The second month sucks.

798
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
The third month sucks.

799
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
In fact, and I was talking to Carl about this at System 76 because I've been thinking about this for a while.

800
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So when I was visiting Carl, I I said to him, I said, Carl, you are as long as I've known you, which has been about 13 years, you have been in great shape.

801
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Carl looks ripped in a shirt like seriously, even even somebody who's killing himself to, like, keep that company going and transition it to a production company.

802
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
He looks great. He looks great. Yeah.

803
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And so I said, Carl, what do you do? And he said, here's the thing, Chris.

804
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
It takes nine months of going to the gym every day before you like it.

805
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
You've just got to do it.

806
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And that is my my thinking for 2019 is the first nine months are going to be like eating the shit sandwich.

807
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I'm just not going to like it because I I like to think of myself as a free spirit, as a creative individual who sets his own schedule.

808
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm a I'm my own man. Right.

809
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:44,000
But now my own man is going to apply rules upon himself that he has to follow that is going to affect everybody I live with.

810
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It's going to affect my lady. It's going to affect my kids. It's going to affect me.

811
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Like rules are lying are laying in over twenty nineteen.

812
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:00,000
My kids are with me for this week and my I feel bad for them because they show up.

813
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
And the first thing is, is here's dad's three new rules for this week.

814
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Not the only three rules, which would have been the way it was before.

815
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Right. It would have been here's the three rules.

816
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Now it's here's three new rules and you will all be following them this week.

817
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And I'm I'm still waking up. I'm you know, I'm still getting up early every single morning.

818
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
It's the holidays or not. It doesn't matter. It is a year of structure.

819
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I'm going to spend one year living a year of structure in an attempt to up my game, to be more of a professional,

820
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:40,000
to to be a professional in a way that extends beyond just podcasting, that extends beyond my time on the microphone and my time editing and publishing,

821
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,000
but extends into when I wake up in the morning, it extends into what I eat, how I drive.

822
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You know, I love to speed. I love to go fast. I really love to go fast.

823
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Like I go on road trips where I can go fast on purpose because that area is legally allowed to go fast.

824
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And so I have to constantly reign myself in when I'm in Washington because Seattle has the worst traffic in the world.

825
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And so, like, you know what? Be a fucking professional.

826
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Get your shit together. Be a man. Be an adult. You know, it is it is so funny.

827
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I have recently. So I bought myself a road road bike for not a motorized.

828
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Hey, good for you. And I have been going just about every day. Really? Obviously, Christmas Day.

829
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I couldn't go. But yeah. Yeah. I didn't go to the gym Christmas Day either. I have been right.

830
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Well, of course, things like that, you don't do it right. I have been doing that.

831
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I have been cutting out fried food as much as possible. You know, less booze.

832
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Right. Feel better. Get more work done.

833
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,000
And I think, yeah, I think I'm going to join you in this. Actually, I will do the nine month challenge.

834
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It is you got to do it for nine months, right? Like three months isn't enough.

835
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yeah. Are you feeling results already, though?

836
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:05,000
So. This has been probably the most positive thing about it is and I've intentionally not talked about it much,

837
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
but I am tracking it on several different fronts.

838
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:17,000
And probably the number one metric I am noticing is my mood is much better in the mornings.

839
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Just like my outlook on things. What would normally be like a catastrophe is yet another challenge in which I realize I can get something out of it.

840
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I don't know the best way to phrase it, but I go from being somebody who is dreading the next problem to somebody who is taking all of the problems I'm facing,

841
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
combining them together and coming up with a great solution. And it's it's like a it's a higher energy.

842
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,000
It's like a I don't know, like I come into work at six a.m. and I'm just like, I'm good to go.

843
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Like I'm I'm a super positive person and I feel really good. And it's not it's not massive.

844
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:09,000
But like I was talking about at the beginning of the show, I have a really, really significant sleep problem.

845
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I I get about 30 minutes on average of sleep per night. Which is pretty bad.

846
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And it's not a joke. I'm not like it's not things that keep me up at night.

847
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It's a it's a it's a significant life impacting problem that makes me tired.

848
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
It makes me grumpy. It makes me feel like everything is a challenge. It's awful.

849
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
30 minutes of deep sleep a night. The last time I remember having a dream as an example, I don't know.

850
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I mean, a lot of people dream. I don't. The last time I remember having a dream was when I was in the hospital after my surgery

851
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,000
and I was propped up and I could and they had a breathing thing on me and I was being supplied air.

852
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
That was the last time I dreamt. And that was September 11th.

853
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:09,000
That's the last time I had a dream. It's not good. It's not good.

854
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:19,000
And so the last couple of months as I've been ramping this up, it started before Thanksgiving, really.

855
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I have seen significant improvements in my sleep and then now and it's not great still.

856
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:36,000
But now I'm getting two hours of deep, genuine REM sleep per night. Two hours from 30 minutes is a significant improvement.

857
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And I feel like a new person. I feel like I have more energy. I feel like I'm willing to tackle more challenges.

858
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I feel like so many things. And so I've been willing to go to the gym, for example, because I'm not so damn tired that I can barely function.

859
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Two hours of sleep, man, after a couple of years of 30 minutes, I'm feeling really great.

860
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I'm going to the gym. I'm fasting or intermittently fasting. I'm showing up at work and I'm feeling great.

861
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And I'm getting a ton of stuff done before the day even starts. I'm ahead of everybody who I work with on the different time zones.

862
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It's pretty good. And all of that has been trackable with different applications.

863
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And I don't think this is worth just shrugging off, like tracking, being able to see on a chart my sleep improve and my exercise improve and my heart rate improve.

864
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Because I wear this watch 24-7. Well, 22-7 because it charges. But you know what I mean?

865
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Like it's it gets my daytime heart rate. It gets my sleeping heart rate. It gets my heart rate when I'm swimming.

866
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,000
It gets my heart rate when I'm on the treadmill. It gets my heart rate when I'm having sex.

867
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Like it constantly is tracking my heart and I'm able to see the difference of my heart rate when I'm sleeping versus when I wake up versus the middle of my day.

868
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And I'm seeing my heart rate drop. I'm going from like a resting heart rate of 100 beats per minute to a resting heart rate of 90 beats per minute.

869
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And that's it's a small adjustment, but it's a big one. Right. And in fact, right now it's even better.

870
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Like my average has gotten down to 70 for the last week. I see a physical improvement in how hard my heart is beating.

871
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And I'm getting more sleep. So I do see a positive feedback loop as I go through this.

872
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I see a positive feedback cycle that encourages me to keep doing this.

873
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,000
So has your stability in your night of sleep, for lack of a better term, improved?

874
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It's still hit and miss. Like last night was rough. I was up a lot last night. I was up at 11 p.m.

875
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I was up at 1 p.m. I was up at 4 p.m. and I was up at 5 a.m. 4 a.m. 5 a.m. and 6 a.m.

876
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It's still not every night's great. Not every night's great. But it has, on average, gotten significantly better. Significantly better.

877
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And I'm trying to get a better sleep hygiene in general. So that way I go to bed around. I try to go to bed around 9 p.m. every night.

878
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I don't always successfully do it. But what's crazy is, you know, you always hear people talk about like reducing screen time and blue light, which always sounds like hocus pocus.

879
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But it sounds like black magic to me. Yeah, it does, doesn't it? On the nights that we don't watch Star Trek, I sleep better.

880
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And Star Trek is one of those things that's like soothing to my soul. When I'm sick, I watch Star Trek. Like that's it's like it's mom's home cooking for me.

881
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And even still, on the nights that we don't watch Star Trek, I sleep better. And what I mean by sleep better is I actually start registering some level of sleep around 10 p.m.

882
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And if I watch television, I don't start registering any kind of level of deep sleep until 1 a.m.

883
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And I have we've thankfully, my lady Hadia is super willing to work with me on this because she wants me to sleep more, too.

884
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And so she's been willing to like, let's do TV nights and non TV nights and we'll do some testing. And when we see results, we're like, well, let's test it again.

885
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
And then we see the results like, OK, well, let's test it again. And I'm you know, I'm kind of taking it.

886
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I'm kind of taking advantage of the fact that she's willing to work with me on this because she sees it as a big improvement, too.

887
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:34,000
She's seen the results. I'm a different man. I know you've changed. It's like you've found sleep, Jesus.

888
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Can we use that as a title or would that offend everyone? I don't know.

889
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I don't know. I think it's worth a shot. I just want to throw it out there of all the crazy titles we've done.

890
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I feel like this may in fact be the best one. Yeah. Yeah, I know.

891
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:54,000
So architect, we've lost a few people in the chat room. I'm I've gone away. Yeah. People don't understand why dreams and REM sleep and deep sleep like that.

892
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
They don't know how it all connects together because this is stuff that I've I've been reading.

893
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
So you have the problem, right? That's the. Yeah. Yeah.

894
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,000
This is stuff that I've gotten like really passionate about and been reading about and researching about for like a year or more now.

895
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And people listening to this cold have no idea what I'm talking about. But maybe we can bring it back.

896
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Maybe we can bring it back to Coder Radio a little bit like, you know, like there's an obvious tie.

897
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Right. So, I mean, there have been tons of papers written out about complex, you know, thinking and logic, i.e.

898
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
software development, the negative effects of sleep deprivation on that.

899
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,000
And I get all you people in college, people are still like, you know, 22 are going to say, no, I can do it.

900
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,000
You can do it. Then you I'm going to say a decade later, it's going to get harder.

901
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
You're going to notice that. I mean, I just had a three a.m. night last week.

902
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Right. I used to do those three times a week. No problem. Bounce.

903
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I was like death all day the following day.

904
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I mean, I couldn't think clearly. I was just and I wasn't you know, it wasn't like a hangover situation.

905
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:07,000
It was a I was literally up at three. I'm doing some droplet management.

906
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
It's just it's not the right way to do things.

907
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Mike, party. Yeah, I don't party alone. I party with droplets.

908
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:25,000
That's how I party, man. We all party. I hope so. Otherwise, I am messed up.

909
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Architect is clarifying his opinion, by the way, in the chat room.

910
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
He says, I'm not saying that just because you don't remember your dreams, you're not sleeping.

911
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I'm just saying. So is that clear? Fair enough. Yeah. OK, fair enough.

912
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Well, what about Rust? You're going to learn Rust in 2019?

913
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
You know, I'm going to devote exactly zero time to learning Rust.

914
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
OK, that will surely just make everyone listening happy.

915
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
And no one listening will be upset by that statement.

916
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
No, not at all. And I think we know what the YouTube comments are going to be like now.

917
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Well, Mr. Dominic, what else? What else? Anything else?

918
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
These aren't predictions. These are personal goals for 2019.

919
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I got the year of structure. You've got. So hopefully I hopefully I feel for you, man.

920
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I hope that this is going to be the year of testing for you. Year of testing.

921
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
You're going to nail it. You're going to, you know.

922
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I think that's probably my going to be the hardest transition for me.

923
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
And I'm wondering if it's not going to be a come to Jesus moment.

924
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I just. Yeah. Yeah. It's got to be like somebody is really, really, really upset.

925
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And you have to sit there and go, what could we have possibly done to avoid this situation?

926
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Right. I mean, that's kind of what you want to avoid.

927
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
That's what happened to me with the whole ruptured appendix is not that I had an appendix appendix issue,

928
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
is that I tried to work through it for three weeks until it became a deadly issue.

929
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Right. Like, how far do you push something? It's true.

930
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
How far are you willing to go before your. Yeah. Yeah.

931
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And the reality is, the sooner you call it, generally the better off you are.

932
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Like the more you've limited the damage.

933
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
For me, like it took till I lost the functionality of my right leg before I went to the hospital.

934
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Like looking back at it, I feel like I was in some sort of weird fugue state.

935
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Like I was sleeping hours and hours a day.

936
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
There were some days where I slept the entire day and all night.

937
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And it took until I lost the ability to move my right leg because the bacteria that my appendix was leaking

938
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,000
rotted away my muscles. Don't let that happen to you.

939
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I would like for that not to happen. Yeah, you got to call it.

940
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
You got to call it. You got to be just aware of that kind of stuff.

941
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,000
And I don't know, that's always kind of the game is walking that line.

942
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
You want to walk it as far as you can, but you don't want to go so far that you can't repair the damage.

943
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Now, that's a good point. Well, Mr. Dominic, where should we send people?

944
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Where do you want them to go? Apparently the sleep clinic.

945
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
No, go to actingmanuco on Twitter.

946
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I would say that. That's what I was going to say.

947
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,000
You could check out at Chris LAS, the networks at Jupiter Signal, and the shows at Coder Radio Show.

948
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
We also have the subreddit, coderradio.reddit.com. Checked it this morning.

949
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And we've got the contact page. That's how Nicholas got a hold of us.

950
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Just go to coder.show.com. I was going to say, you could choose Coder Radio from the drop down

951
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
at jupitabroadcasting.com. But that's old school. We're working on a new version of the site.

952
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
That's my prediction for 2019 is a new jupitabroadcasting.com. How about that?

953
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:36,000
In the meantime, coder.show slash contact and coder.show slash 338 for the links on this week's episode.

954
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Thanks for joining us. See you back here next week.
