This is Koder Radio, episode 437 for October 25th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,960
Hello friend, welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,960
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,760
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru, a cloud guru has a cloud playground.

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,760
My name is Chris, and joining me like the champion he is, even after a late night support

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,000
session, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello Mike.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hey, why not?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,720
There must always be another Python script.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,520
You know, one day we'll figure out a way to automate you somehow, you know, I'll join

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,280
you one day and I'll just be chatting with Alice and I won't even realize it for like

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
the first 15 minutes.

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,320
You know, I know it's coming honestly.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Please do.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
Yeah.

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
Would you take that?

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
I know, right?

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,880
I would like to be lounging in a soaking tub like a Russian czar.

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Sure.

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Oh yeah.

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,200
So do you like the golden girls?

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,280
Oh man, thank you for being a friend.

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,920
I love the golden girls.

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,560
Listen, if there's a gift, there'll be a card in it and it'll say exactly that.

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Yeah.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,360
I'm bingeing the golden girls because there is something about B. Arthur's D that gives

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,680
me strength when I need to keep going.

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,160
Yeah, she's so sassy.

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
She's so sassy.

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
Ooh.

33
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
What was that?

34
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,520
And now I'm coming back all of a sudden.

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,400
You got, you got somebody else in there listening to me?

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
No, something bad happened.

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Hang on.

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Thank you for being a friend.

39
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
Traveled down the road and back again.

40
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
All right, now I hear you.

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
All right, there we go.

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:02:00,400
One of the problems with my house being like all Apple is any, like my kid can hijack what

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,200
I'm doing because I'm using the AirPods Max for the show.

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Right, right, right.

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,080
It was my, uh, was it Stonheiner's who got me?

46
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,240
They broke, so.

47
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,680
It seems like it really sucks too.

48
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,600
Like it messes that auto figure out where to play from all the time.

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
It's a horrible feature.

50
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,760
Like if someone turns on an iOS device, it just looks like, oh, let me steal the feed

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
from the Mac.

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
But anyway.

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,680
Well, do I sound any different today to you?

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
No, why?

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,120
Oh, because I'm talking to you from space.

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
I'm talking to you from space today.

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,200
I'm a, this is the first live stream and the first VoIP call I've ever done over Starlink.

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Ooh.

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,520
I mean, in the order of things air, I've done love first, but in for, you know, what airs,

61
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,560
but in terms of recording schedule, this is it, baby.

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,880
This is my first production trial.

63
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,160
I found, I found a spot in the woods.

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,360
Like I had to drive around for a bit to find enough clearing because there's so there's

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,640
like a tree canopy around here, but I'm out here way away from the coast because there's

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,920
a cyclone bomb going off that has like 60 mile per hour winds on the coast.

67
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
So we went inland.

68
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,320
We're right at the foot of the Cascade mountains and I found a clearing in the woods where

69
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,640
I could get the RV level and I put Starlink the little dish out there and it's awesome.

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,600
We're doing the whole show live from the RV.

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,040
Everything streamed from the RV, everything.

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,680
It's pretty cool.

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,080
It's a game changer for my work.

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,280
I got emotional when I first started using it because I've never really had great internet

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
in here.

76
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,160
So in the art and business, is this like a big investment or?

77
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,000
You know, it's, it's 400 bucks to get the dish.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
So it's like an eighth of a MacBook pro.

80
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Right?

81
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Yeah.

82
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,240
And then, uh, you, you got like a hundred dollar a month service, but as of right now,

83
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,680
cause it's still kind of technically in the beta, uh, there is no caps.

84
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,840
There's no limits like I have with LTE.

85
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,080
There's no throttling and I've seen upwards of 240 megabits and I've seen probably an

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,360
average of 130 megabits.

87
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,120
My ping time right now is a recordings around 30 milliseconds to Google.

88
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,680
Not bad at all for space, right?

89
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
Jesus Christ.

90
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Major Tom.

91
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
I know.

92
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,720
And you know, these damn dishes are Linux boxes.

93
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,040
There's a Linux computer in there that does everything you need to talk to the dishes.

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,080
I mean, to the satellites, I don't have to go through their router.

95
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,760
I can plug it directly into my router so I can manage it with all my LTE connections

96
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,700
and everything else that I have.

97
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,760
And it just integrates in with my land, my existing wifi access points are connected

98
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
to it.

99
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,800
It's Oh, it's glorious dude.

100
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,760
It is glorious.

101
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
It's game changer time.

102
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,440
It really, it really means, you know, I can go out and about and I don't even need the

103
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
studio.

104
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Like if it burns to the ground, I'll be okay.

105
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,140
I preferred it, you know, cause the studio isn't moving and isn't constantly changing.

106
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,460
Isn't affected by the rain like this place is loud sometimes, but yeah, it's pretty cool.

107
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,500
It's pretty cool.

108
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,720
So I know you were up pretty early this morning and since I've been out and about hunting

109
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,240
in the woods, I didn't get a time to go through the email, so I thought maybe you and I would

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,360
chat about like Alice launch, follow up and how support's been and you know, and I know

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,240
you've at this point you've run some ads outside of Facebook and I don't know, like how's that

112
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
going?

113
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
How's the support stuff going?

114
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,040
Uh, so yeah, there's a lot.

115
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,960
I mean, I was up working on Alice late last night.

116
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,280
Of course, when you have real customers, you have edge cases and you have to handle that.

117
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,120
When I say I was up late last night, this is where the golden girls reference comes

118
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:35,160
in, picture it, Florida, 2021, a man hunched over his MacBook air, wakes up cradling said

119
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,520
MacBook air on the kitchen floor with a visual studio code open.

120
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Okay.

121
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,120
Did you just wake up in a haze?

122
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,880
According to get lab, I wrote like a lot of code last night and I kind of cut memory usage

123
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,560
analysis by about 20% who sounds inspired.

124
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Yeah.

125
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,640
I mean, if you've read it in the Lovecraft, you would be a little concerned, but yeah,

126
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,360
that sounds, uh, inspired as something.

127
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,320
I would say I opened the interdimensional portal where I just started writing things

128
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,920
and see.

129
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Did you, did you really?

130
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Are you kidding me?

131
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,120
Did you switch to see overnight?

132
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,360
Like in some weird fugue state in like a, a like focus state in the middle of the night,

133
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,080
you just said, you know what, Python's been great, but you know what's even better.

134
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
Is that what happened?

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,840
I mean, I can tell you what my exact thought process was cause one of the beauties of this

136
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,240
just being a pure like exhaustion thing.

137
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,480
So like Alice architecture, right?

138
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,160
It uses Python as the primary language and then some rust.

139
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,040
Now the problem with rust is, and this is a technical term.

140
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
It's kind of a little bitch.

141
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Yeah.

142
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm familiar with that term at three in the morning.

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,920
You sort of don't care.

144
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Yeah.

145
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,760
You're kind of like, you know, you don't want to fool with this.

146
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,160
I just want to get it done.

147
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,040
So then you drop to see for reasons that are very insane.

148
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm just so I understand like the context.

149
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,000
Were you under a time pressure as well?

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,880
Like were you trying to get something done for this client?

151
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
I had to get something done for this morning.

152
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Uh huh.

153
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Uh huh.

154
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Okay.

155
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
So I woke up, did the demo.

156
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,640
It was a special thing for a customer and the demo went well, but then I looked at the

157
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,800
code and somebody who works with me looked at the code.

158
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,080
The commit logs themselves are amazing.

159
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,480
It's the rantings of a madman, but phrase in terms of algebra, you got to show this

160
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
to me.

161
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
This is good.

162
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,760
Cause remember Alice doesn't really like, so this is like the dirty little secret of

163
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Alice.

164
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
She doesn't need to understand the data.

165
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Right.

166
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,880
She doesn't need to understand the structure of the data.

167
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Sure.

168
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
Sure.

169
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
Right.

170
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,960
Like I said, like those old fashioned silhouette paintings, everything is basically see, right?

171
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,000
Like if we go back into, I mean everything's binary, but you know, I hate you Fox pro.

172
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,520
I hate you so much.

173
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,040
That's a, that's one for the kids to Google Fox pro and then they'll understand.

174
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:06,960
I can't say that my code will make anybody happy other than it works, but it's like if

175
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,520
you could think of what functional C programming looks like, that's, that's what it is.

176
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,960
Like I didn't even go objective with it.

177
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
I was that pissed.

178
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,400
I just went straight C. I like, I like to think of this as sort of a Dr Jekyll and Mr

179
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Hyde kind of thing.

180
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
You know what?

181
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
When I flip out, I'm a C programmer.

182
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Exactly.

183
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Yeah.

184
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,200
I send mean tweets and I write C. Although I didn't tweet, I'm very proud of myself.

185
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Good job.

186
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,520
You know, I mean, uh, and I don't even think I got, did I get a slide?

187
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,440
I don't even think I saw slack rant last night.

188
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
No, no.

189
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Wow.

190
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
Huh?

191
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Personal growth.

192
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Yeah.

193
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
I'm going to miss that mic a little bit.

194
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
Not going to lie.

195
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Made for good show content.

196
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Could have missed that guy.

197
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,780
But you know, this works too.

198
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,780
This works too.

199
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,780
We're here.

200
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
We are hashing it out on the show.

201
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,780
So I'll take what I can get.

202
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,640
The difference is pounding, uh, Jasmine tea tea, huh?

203
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,080
You know, I'm with Ted lasso on the tea.

204
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
It's not for me.

205
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Chase with vodka.

206
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,480
But I've tried, I've tried, you know, I like the idea of a nice steady caffeine drip

207
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
all day long.

208
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,080
Cause I just like, I go to the, I go to the max.

209
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,840
Oh, oh, do you know why I'm still standing?

210
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Hmm.

211
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,080
Amazon makes their own energy drinks.

212
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Really?

213
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Like an Amazon basics energy drink.

214
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
I swear to God.

215
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Yeah.

216
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,960
I have them in my, in fact, I have one in front of me.

217
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Jesus.

218
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
I can't believe they haven't done this before.

219
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,160
It actually makes a lot of sense.

220
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
How are they though?

221
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Well, I'm sorry.

222
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,360
Why is there a pink elephant flying by?

223
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,440
Is he got Jeff Bezos face?

224
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
What's going on?

225
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,460
I can say this is a more of a medicinal product or definitely not drinking this because you

226
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,760
want to.

227
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
But it works.

228
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Yeah.

229
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Okay.

230
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Hmm.

231
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
I'll have to look for that.

232
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,000
I mean, if I like take a heart attack tonight, that sucks.

233
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,560
I've only had three of them, so I think I'm okay.

234
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,680
You'd be careful over there.

235
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,160
It's like pulling in, um, pulling in.net packages and then the.net foundation decides that they

236
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,340
hate you and you can't do, Ooh, too much now, you know, I've been wondering how to talk

237
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:05,280
about this because I don't follow it very closely and I didn't want to like, you know,

238
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,120
we just got done getting everybody upset over workers rights because you and I did not understand

239
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,640
like what a big controversy this is in the actual world of employed people right now

240
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
because you and I are out here on the fringes.

241
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:22,360
I just say literally woke up on the kitchen floor and we just walked right into that one,

242
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,600
like a couple of jackasses.

243
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,720
So I didn't want to do the same thing when it came to this.net stuff because we got emails

244
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,160
into the show and people like, I want to know what you guys think about this and people

245
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,280
seem fired up.

246
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,480
And so I could tell there was a couple of things happening.

247
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,620
First of all, it seemed like there was some questioning of really what the.net foundations

248
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,840
role was and was it really there just to normalize Microsoft's control.

249
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
That was a whole issue.

250
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,800
At the same time, there was backlash going on because Microsoft decided to reverse a

251
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,260
feature and then move that feature into the paid version of visual studio and everybody

252
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,260
got really pissed.

253
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
Yeah.

254
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,360
So, so, so this is two separate things though, right?

255
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Yeah.

256
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Microsoft.

257
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,840
So I think that one's the easier one to talk about.

258
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,040
It's a live reload of basically Blazor, which is like, I don't know if you've done like

259
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,220
Python ginger or Ruby or be right, sir.

260
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,080
It's the.net equivalent to a templating engine that was going to be on all platforms and

261
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,400
VS code.

262
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,280
And then they decided to not do that.

263
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,360
They said for reasons of time, but then it leaked that it was for strategic reasons.

264
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
IE, huh?

265
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,160
We're giving away a great editor.

266
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,560
We also sell an editor that seems bad.

267
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,800
You know, it's also awkward is like names of the business execs that said it'd be better

268
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
to withhold this.

269
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,640
Like they're, they, their identities were included in these documents that the community

270
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
got.

271
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,360
It's just, well, it's, it's worse that what it was that it was a, I forgot her name, but

272
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,320
it was a woman that woman's boss, right?

273
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,200
The VP above her actually ended up reversing it.

274
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Yeah.

275
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,640
It's like you got publicly overruled.

276
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
That's like, Oh geez.

277
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Yeah.

278
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Yeah.

279
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,080
And then Microsoft said, uh, you know, we made a mistake at executing on our decision

280
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,640
and it took longer than expected to respond back to the community translation.

281
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
We got caught.

282
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Yeah.

283
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,160
We got caught and then we had an internal debate and then we didn't know how to proceed.

284
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,600
And then finally we got common sense and realized that this wasn't the Hill we wanted to die

285
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,920
on and realized our reputation was being burnt over this and it wasn't going away.

286
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,680
So now we're making a public statement.

287
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,560
Oh boy, that's pretty bad.

288
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,760
Well, the problem is the visual studio business, right?

289
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,680
Visual studio proper doesn't really make sense with the rest of Microsoft right now.

290
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,320
And I know I sound like a madman, but it's a legacy thing, right?

291
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,720
But their whole thing is driving developers to Azure and making money on Azure.

292
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
Yeah.

293
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,840
There's no reason to be charging for visual studio.

294
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,960
The simplest way to solve this problem is forget about community professional enterprise.

295
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,120
Just make visual studio free done.

296
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,640
You know, I, I agree and I think Microsoft has done such a good job of transitioning

297
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,120
to the quote unquote cloud era that we don't really tend to pick at the bones of where

298
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,600
they haven't really improved.

299
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,560
And when you look at some of their more traditional, generally on premise focused businesses, they're,

300
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,120
they're still milking those for as much as they can and they don't really want to move

301
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
on.

302
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,560
And I think visual studio is the key to that ecosystem that, you know, build it here on

303
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,040
your premises and you run it right here on your intranet and their corporate applications

304
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,360
that need to be maintained or need to be updated for compatibility purposes or need to be converted

305
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,660
for whatever reason.

306
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,700
And that's where they're still selling a bunch of visual studio code, I think.

307
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,980
And so for, to them, to them, it'd be crazy to give it away for free because it's kind

308
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,960
of become an, it's the enterprise product and they don't like giving that stuff away

309
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
for free.

310
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,960
There's still very much traditional Microsoft in some of those areas.

311
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,840
No one wants to turn down a check, right?

312
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,380
But the other issue was it was a little fuzzier, right?

313
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:04,080
They were doing something strange with having to control get hub accounts that were.

314
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,320
Yes, yes.

315
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,720
This is one of the reasons why I didn't really bring it up before because I, I didn't follow

316
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,200
it very well, but I, I guess it was something, it was something, something in that, uh, in

317
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
that regard.

318
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,520
But you know, I, I, it's hard to know from the outside if this is a genuine controversy

319
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,560
or if this is a personality conflict.

320
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,840
And this was kind of both.

321
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,800
And it seemed like there was an apology attempt about it.

322
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,560
And that apology was also really taken poorly.

323
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,600
And when you're coming in from the outside and you see all that stuff, it's just sort

324
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,000
of an off put.

325
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,880
And I just didn't really think, I don't want to wade into this drama.

326
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,080
But now in retrospect, I actually kind of regret it because I think there was something

327
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,760
genuinely happening here between Microsoft and the development community.

328
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,040
And the drama aspects of it were just enough that it put me off and I didn't pay attention

329
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
to it.

330
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
Yeah.

331
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,120
I was also tired of getting yelled at, so I also ignored it, but I do feel we should

332
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
have covered it.

333
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,240
And having said that, I'm not sure what the right thing is, right?

334
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,480
Like, you know, I'm getting more and more like granola hippie ish where I feel like

335
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,360
open source things need to be run by nonprofit, you know, five oh one three or five or whatever

336
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:22,040
it is foundations, not corporations because you're always going to end up in a commercial

337
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
conflict.

338
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Yeah.

339
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,480
I mean, look what happened ultimately to sent us, you know, I think that was a, that was

340
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,040
a conflict of the sales department versus the engineering department there internally

341
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,960
at Red Hat based on, you know, what we can kind of piece together.

342
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,880
And then I know someone's going to say, well, there is a.net foundation, but look at who

343
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
runs the.net foundation.

344
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,640
Like, look at the board like, okay, can I fry some insane bacon that people are going

345
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
to get mad at?

346
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,920
Man, you know, I bring bacon every single week, just in case it's not really a conspiracy

347
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,420
theory at the time.

348
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,200
I would almost argue that anyone who's an MVP or otherwise, if you have been on the

349
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Scott Hanselman show, you should be disqualified from the.net foundation port.

350
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,800
If you are an employee of Microsoft, you should be disqualified.

351
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,900
If you actually think windows is a good operating system, you should be disqualified.

352
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,120
The last one I'm joking, but the first time, serious, right?

353
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,560
No, I think maybe it's good.

354
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,240
I think I like all of them because it's kind of like, like, I love Hanselman.

355
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,280
He's a nice guy, I guess, but they're so in their own world and they're trying to come

356
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,520
into this open source thing.

357
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,560
It's like, no, actually, we're not buttoned up professionals here.

358
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
We're assholes.

359
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
Yeah.

360
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,720
I mean, we have BSD users and we let them hang around.

361
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
They make me sick.

362
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,640
Oh, well, and they're not competing in a Microsoft ecosystem.

363
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,480
They're competing in the greater tech ecosystem.

364
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,840
So that's where I actually think maybe they don't like windows point is actually rather

365
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,520
relevant because you got to get outside the Microsoft echo chamber.

366
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Right.

367
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,400
Like, get Marco Arment there and he's going to say, your code makes me want to cry because

368
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
it's so ugly.

369
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,560
I get people who like actively hate.

370
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,920
Yeah, but but then they'll fix the font and he'll be happy.

371
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
So it is true.

372
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
That's just a problem.

373
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
And he's it's Helvetica.

374
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
No, I.

375
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,400
Oh, now it's San Francisco on Mac, which is basically that they were tired of paying the

376
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
license for her.

377
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,680
But I think your point was taken.

378
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,640
It does seem Miguel de Caza tweeted and he'd know he tweeted that, well, the inspiration

379
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,520
for the foundation was the Gnome Foundation, which I'm not sure, but I think he was saying

380
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,080
that, yeah, it's designed because, you know, Red Hat's a huge influence on Gnome.

381
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,380
And you look at, you know, the contributions to Gnome and the and the foundation and who

382
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,380
runs all that.

383
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,100
And they're either Red Hat employees or, you know, affiliated it.

384
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,180
It feels very much like Red Hat runs the Gnome project, although they would say that's very

385
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,180
much not the case.

386
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,640
And they would dispute and they would say I'm being toxic even saying that.

387
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,360
But you just look at the numbers, right.

388
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
And it seems sort of the same for the foundation.

389
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,320
Wait a minute, Chris.

390
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
That was inappropriate.

391
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,560
Are you suggesting that people follow their financial incentives?

392
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,080
Leno dot com slash Coder.

393
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,720
Go there to get one hundred dollars in credit.

394
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,920
And of course, you support this here show, but I mean, one hundred dollars in credit

395
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,260
on a new account for 60 days.

396
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,260
That's a bold statement.

397
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,340
If you think about it, think about that from a business standpoint, like when you're coming

398
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,640
up with that offering, what are you really saying as a business?

399
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
It means you believe in your product, right?

400
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,700
It means you believe your product will speak for itself.

401
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,080
And if you give someone one hundred dollars, they can actually really try it for more than

402
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
just a hot minute.

403
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,000
I mean, that's really what it is.

404
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,080
And I think that's a bold statement and one that I find appealing.

405
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,040
You know, I've used Linode for a couple of years, but I have friends that have used Linode

406
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
for over a decade.

407
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,500
They've been around since two thousand and three.

408
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,620
They use Linux for stuff way before anybody thinks you can use Linux for that stuff.

409
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,880
This is something you come across if you do any kind of like research on the note like

410
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,280
I have because I check out all of our sponsors.

411
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
Right.

412
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,400
And I did some I did some reading like Linode.

413
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,280
First of all, they were the first to really figure out where user mode Linux was going.

414
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,040
They were the first to really figure out that using a bunch of Apache virtual hosts was

415
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,480
only going to scale so far and that there were new features in the kernel that could

416
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,880
really change the game.

417
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,600
And they saw how you could run multiple secure machines on one piece of powerful hardware

418
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,880
way before AWS even existed.

419
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,400
But what's great about Linode is they've really kept it interesting.

420
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,800
They've really innovated all along because they're so passionate about this.

421
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,340
You know, when you really get into something because you care about it, you put everything

422
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,340
into it.

423
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,120
That's why they have the best customer service out there.

424
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,280
That's why they have such a comprehensive marketplace for easy deployment of great open

425
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,940
source projects.

426
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,120
And it's not just like the standard checklist of course, they have those like your next

427
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,620
clouds and whatnot, but it's because they also really know this stuff.

428
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,680
So they have some really good ones that when you see them and they're like, oh, that is

429
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
a great idea.

430
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,680
Maybe I should.

431
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Maybe I should do that.

432
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
I mean, that's what's so great.

433
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,160
Going back to that hundred dollars is you can try this stuff.

434
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,620
I'm out on the road right now and I rely heavily on Linode as an intermediate infrastructure

435
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,200
between the studio and my RV.

436
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,120
I can move things up to Linode and then push them down at the RV at the pace the RV's connection

437
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,940
is capable of handling.

438
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,700
That is so, so handy.

439
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,680
And it's just one of the many ways that it's sort of like, it's like it honestly is like

440
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,300
Linode is the moons that orbit Jupiter.

441
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,280
And they're, they're supplying our infrastructure from orbit.

442
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,780
That's honestly how we look at it.

443
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,040
And I, I've, I consider them an integral part of our business and I think you'd be really

444
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,660
comfortable and I think you'd be really impressed if you did too.

445
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,960
Or if you're just setting up a project for friends and family, or maybe you already have

446
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,920
like a lot in one cloud provider and you're feeling like that's a big risk and you want

447
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,120
to go something that's a little more spread out, you know, go with a multi-cloud approach

448
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,640
and don't put all your eggs in one basket.

449
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,880
Linode is also great for that because their pricing is 30 to 50% cheaper than the other

450
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,120
major hypervisors out there.

451
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,480
Just go try them out.

452
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,880
They're just a great, great set of offerings that all come together to make it the best

453
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,000
place to run anything that runs on Linux.

454
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,680
Yeah, you can run it on Linode.

455
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:58,000
So go to linode.com slash coder, get $100 on a new account for 60 days and you support

456
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
the show.

457
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,160
Linode.com slash coder.

458
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,040
I know this got your attention.

459
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:11,960
Microsoft is officially, unofficially deprecating UWP or the Universal Windows platform.

460
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Mmm.

461
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Madre Forgers.

462
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,560
It's like, you know, Microsoft has been so cagey about this the entire time.

463
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,600
They didn't say it's retired.

464
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,800
They didn't say it's deprecated.

465
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:26,400
They said, quote, it will only receive bug reliability and security fixes.

466
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,000
No new features.

467
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,120
But it didn't actually say it was deprecated.

468
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,640
So this is not about UWP.

469
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,860
This is about Windows Phone.

470
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,600
And I need a Deckard Kane.

471
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,000
Stay a while and listen.

472
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,400
Long ago, in a galaxy called New Jersey, I thought it was a good idea to make a significant

473
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,820
for me at the time investment in Windows Phone development.

474
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,880
If it sounds like I'm crying, it's because I am.

475
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,840
Chris, how would you say that went?

476
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
Pretty badly, Mike.

477
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
Pretty badly.

478
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
That's what I'd say.

479
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,240
I'd say you made a big bet.

480
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,680
You got some good hardware.

481
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,800
You had some good concepts for apps.

482
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,720
And then just as you got rolling, Microsoft pulled the rug out from underneath you and

483
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
sent you tumbling.

484
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,280
Actually, we can't sell these.

485
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Yeah.

486
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
So, yeah.

487
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:18,020
The worst part is my wife at the time, her job was selling them.

488
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,040
She worked for Microsoft.

489
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,080
I should have known when she came home every night was like, damn, I can't sell these phones.

490
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,200
That may be not the best choice.

491
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,280
Could have been an indicator, you know, a data point, perhaps.

492
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Could have been.

493
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,240
But I was insane.

494
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
So I'm sorry.

495
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,200
Every time I think about Windows Phone, I like it destroys my mind.

496
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I know.

497
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Because it was such a good system.

498
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,060
It's like WebOS.

499
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,860
It's so good.

500
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,920
But it was too good for the world.

501
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,040
Well, a lot of the a lot of the visual cues that we now just take for granted, like things

502
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,600
that indicate there's a little more content to the left or the right or to the bottom

503
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
of the screen.

504
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
That was them.

505
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
They came up with that.

506
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,300
The whole flat trend.

507
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,800
They started the flat trend again.

508
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Exactly.

509
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,400
All the in the advanced notifications and what is it, Android 47, whatever the new one

510
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
is.

511
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
You mean Android NSA edition?

512
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Yeah.

513
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Yeah.

514
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
OK.

515
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Oh, hang on.

516
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Hang on, Chris.

517
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Oh, oh, Mr. Chaney.

518
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Yeah.

519
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
No, I know.

520
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
He said it.

521
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
What?

522
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Right.

523
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Right.

524
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
No, you got to watch out.

525
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
He's a jackass.

526
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,160
Reminds me of better days, Brock, when we were together and I was losing tents.

527
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Simpler times.

528
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Yes.

529
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Anyway.

530
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Times.

531
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
UWP.

532
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,160
I was trying to figure out the same framework about seven times, so I'm trying to figure

533
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,720
out how to get to UWP.

534
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,380
So it was Windows phone seven.

535
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,720
It was Silverlight, right?

536
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,960
And then it was Metro?

537
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Was Metro after Silverlight?

538
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
Yep.

539
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Metro.

540
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,760
And then they even called it Project Reunion for a short period of time.

541
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
No, Reunion's new.

542
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
Reunion's the.

543
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,160
I thought it was a code name for it.

544
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,160
But Reunion's the new Windows app SDK, isn't it?

545
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
That's what it is.

546
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,040
No, because there was a whole Stephen Sanosky thing that everybody's going to rewrite their

547
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
stuff in C++.

548
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Yes.

549
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,560
I think that was just like Windows SDK, which is weird because that's the current name now.

550
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Right.

551
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Right.

552
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
They do that sometimes.

553
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
I know.

554
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,360
You all can Google this.

555
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
They really do.

556
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,920
We'll have a link in the show notes for it.

557
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,440
But point being, this is not the first, and frankly nor will it be the last time that

558
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,920
something that is UWP will be deprecated.

559
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,080
And I personally hate them.

560
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,560
I don't know what to say.

561
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,400
It was such a good idea, Windows Phone, executed so poorly.

562
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:37,600
UWP was a good idea, but they just couldn't make it work because no one is buying apps

563
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,920
on Windows that aren't like enterprise, you know, call me sales guy apps.

564
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,000
That's it.

565
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,320
They lost their market opportunity to make that move.

566
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,460
It was too little too late.

567
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
Damn shame though.

568
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Really is a damn shame.

569
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,600
Do they make it up for you with Visual Studio Code?

570
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,120
I know that you were keen to see VSCode.dev light up in this last week, and it's as you

571
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
would expect.

572
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,000
It's a full, well, a fairly full web edition of VSCode in the browser.

573
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,880
You can open up local files, though.

574
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,460
So it's kind of just like VSCode since it's an electron app.

575
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
But now it's in the browser.

576
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,140
It does have a few limits because of that.

577
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,560
But what do you think of this?

578
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,600
Now as someone who, you know, often gives away Thalios to students learning STEM, I

579
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
think this is great.

580
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,560
That's a good point.

581
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,040
My kids are so web app first now, I think because of the Chromebooks, like when they

582
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:27,040
want to edit a video or edit a photo, they go to Google and they search for web apps

583
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
to do it.

584
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Wait, your kid's school has Chromebooks too?

585
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Oh, yeah.

586
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
It's funny.

587
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Yeah.

588
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,160
My son, it's they're like, he thinks Chrome is the OS.

589
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Mm hmm.

590
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
Yeah, they all have them.

591
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,440
He also asked me for a guy Fox Max, so I was concerned.

592
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,720
And even on their on their laptops at home, now they've asked for Chrome because that's

593
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,960
what they're used to using at school.

594
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,240
And you know, they get pretty impressive results from some of these web apps.

595
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,320
The school teaches them like the video editing app and stuff like that.

596
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,880
So VS code dev kind of does fit right in with that world.

597
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
I haven't thought about that.

598
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
Yeah, it makes a ton of sense to me.

599
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,680
I mean, VS code is really just like a node JS electron app, right?

600
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,960
So you could run a VS code server.

601
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,160
In fact, that's been possible for a long time.

602
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,640
But the difference here is this is hosted by Microsoft on their infrastructure, and

603
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
it's quick.

604
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
It's snappy.

605
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,640
And they're updating it directly.

606
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
Right.

607
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,680
So what they're going to do is let me run a bunch of code on it and delete it.

608
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
I'm still mad, guys.

609
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,880
I'm still mad.

610
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,480
Windows phone eight was great.

611
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,400
You know what works great is their integration with GitHub now.

612
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,560
So you can be a GitHub and you can be on a repo.

613
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,360
And if you hit the period, I think it's just you hit period on your on your keyboard.

614
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,520
It opens up that repo in GitHub and you're instantly editing the files inside VS code.

615
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
And of course, it's because the extensions went out.

616
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
It knows the language.

617
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,800
Yeah, it's great.

618
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,920
You know what I've done is on my home assistant box here in my RV, I've set up a VS code web

619
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
instance.

620
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,920
I have a local VS code editor running on my Raspberry Pi that I can just fire up from

621
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,080
any computer with a bookmark, you know, from tablet to from a desktop machine.

622
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,640
And I find that super useful because I can edit stuff directly on my file server using

623
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,720
that.

624
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Very handy.

625
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,480
But the one that Microsoft set up here lets you access things on the local machine just

626
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,440
using the file system access API.

627
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,600
So you have to have a browser that supports the file system access API.

628
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,760
But most do.

629
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,720
There are some things that won't work.

630
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,800
The terminal and the debugger are not going to work, obviously.

631
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
It's a lightweight version.

632
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Not quite.

633
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Everything's there.

634
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,680
Microsoft breaks it out into good, better and best.

635
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:28,640
They say that obviously things that just detect the language type and can do text completion,

636
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,880
that's going to work good.

637
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,560
Your better experience is going to be your TypeScript, your JavaScript and your Python.

638
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,680
That's going to be your better experience.

639
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,800
And your best experience in VS code for the web, surprise, surprise, is what they call

640
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,960
quote, webby languages, such as JSON, HTML, CSS and all that kind of stuff makes a ton

641
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
of sense, right?

642
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Yeah.

643
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,800
In that case, it's going to be it's going to be exactly as identical to the desktop as

644
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,000
it gets using VS code dot dev.

645
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,400
What they take, they give us.

646
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
You feel better now?

647
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:03,400
I'm still pissed.

648
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,920
This episode is brought to you by Datadog, the monitoring security platform for developers,

649
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,840
security professionals, operation teams and anyone that's working in the cloud age.

650
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,720
Unify your metrics, your traces and logs all in one place and troubleshoot issues faster

651
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,320
and break down silos and communicate better between teams with Datadog.

652
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,280
They have incredible, beautiful real time dashboards.

653
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,720
Go to Datadog dot com slash Coda Radio, not only for the trial, but also so you can just

654
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,480
see these beautiful real time dashboards.

655
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,740
And you can plug in over 450 technologies you probably already have in your business.

656
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:41,480
You can easily pivot from a high level overview of your entire environment.

657
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,160
Right down to a granular level, individual metrics and events.

658
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,080
They offer infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, security monitoring,

659
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,920
real time user monitoring and so much more in one place.

660
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,120
So go get started with a free Datadog trial.

661
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,880
Go to Datadog dot com slash Coda Radio.

662
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,760
Go see why thousands of companies and hundreds of Coda Radio listeners are using Datadog

663
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,700
as their monitoring solution.

664
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,160
If you start a free trial and you create one dashboard, well, Datadog will also send you

665
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,160
a free t-shirt and I could use one of those right now.

666
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,520
There's no washer and dryer out in the woods.

667
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,860
Free stuff's always great and a trial's even better.

668
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,120
Go see why Datadog is so darn great.

669
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,320
Go to Datadog dot com slash Coda Radio.

670
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,200
A little bit of Apple stuff before we get out of here.

671
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,480
Just the tip.

672
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,320
So WWDC must be dead because Apple has announced tech talks.

673
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,800
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

674
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,800
I think this is this is Apple getting ahead of the sandwich.

675
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Seriously?

676
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Oh, I do.

677
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Yeah, yeah.

678
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Oh, I agree.

679
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,040
Developers can now interface with Apple experts in virtual sessions that happen on October

680
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,360
25th to December 17th.

681
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,400
Developers can register for office hours and get 30 minutes with a developer and get app

682
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,560
improvement ideas, design revisions and even help with bug fixes.

683
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:02,680
This is Apple trying to make up for what people paid two thousand dollars to go to WWDC for

684
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,600
was the chance to talk to an Apple developer after a session.

685
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,520
Now they're doing tech talks with Apple experts and they're going to move this to a one on

686
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,920
one guidance kind of thing that you can schedule virtually.

687
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,240
And they're going to do these every now and then.

688
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,720
And I think they're going to eliminate the developers coming to WWDC and now it's just

689
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,360
going to be Apple in the press in the future.

690
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,500
So are you saying that they're going to never have an in-person WWDC or are you saying there's

691
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,540
not going to be any WWDC?

692
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,360
I'm saying there's going to be a WWDC.

693
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
It's just you ain't invited.

694
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,240
It's just going to be the press and the mucky mucks.

695
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,000
You know, it's going to be maybe the developers they're featuring up on stage because I think

696
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,560
what they're going to do is a hybrid event going forward, mostly produced with a few

697
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,000
hands on things and then a press area and they'll have an expanded press area so the

698
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,600
YouTubers can do their vlogs.

699
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,440
But developers, you're getting these virtual events.

700
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
You're out.

701
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
We say that with such disdain.

702
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,000
They can't be having three thousand developers there all in all and just what are they going

703
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
to do?

704
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It just doesn't scale anyways.

705
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,680
WWDC is not just about talking to an Apple engineer and getting help.

706
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,560
It's a, I mean, it's a social event, right?

707
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
It's like, yeah, it's like everybody.

708
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
It's our annual cotillion.

709
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
I don't know.

710
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
I think you're absolutely right.

711
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
It's huge.

712
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,320
If you look at the Apple press.

713
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,920
They all know each other because they see each other at WWDC and that's how they've

714
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
all networked.

715
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:24,600
It's been absolutely critical to Apple forming a community with these representatives and

716
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,120
thought leaders in that community.

717
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:32,160
I mean, it's been huge and it will be not good for the Apple community.

718
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,840
Somebody will probably come along and offer an event, but it's not going to be the same.

719
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,280
We've seen this happen before.

720
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,160
You know, Macworld, Apple used to be involved and they pulled out.

721
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,400
It's not unusual for Apple to do this.

722
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
More I think about it, the more I think you might be right.

723
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,680
But it'd be a loss.

724
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
It's disappointing, right?

725
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,320
To see all these community events, not just Apple ones, but all of them having suffered

726
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,320
so much.

727
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:58,000
My only thought on that is when you can't pro and con human interaction, like, you know,

728
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,920
I have a different connection with Optimus Graves in the chat room right now because

729
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,800
I've met him in person now.

730
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,940
I will always think of that now when I see him show up in the chat room and it until

731
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,040
you've had the experience that I've had where you take virtual only relationships and convert

732
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:18,680
them into person relationships and you do that for years, then you start to go, oh,

733
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,440
this is actually the most important and most valuable thing I do.

734
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,280
I thought it was having a booth and giving a good talk.

735
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
And you know, when I go to these events, it's not.

736
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,240
And I had to come all the way around on the issue because I went into it like the people

737
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,640
that say the hall track is the most important thing in the networking.

738
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,400
That's a bunch of lazy people who don't want to go learn in sessions.

739
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
That's who they are.

740
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,320
And they're wasting their, they're wasting their money, you know, their company money

741
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
or whatever.

742
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,420
I seriously was that guy when I started going.

743
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,360
And by the end of it, I was completely on the other end of it.

744
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,280
I was like, wow, it's the most important thing I do is go out to lunch with the audience.

745
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,180
And the most important thing I do is, you know, I've met a lot of the hosts at events

746
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,180
and just stuff like that.

747
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,420
Then it's just been absolutely critical.

748
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,240
And I think until you've experienced that a few times, you don't realize it because

749
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,860
it's, it's ephemeral.

750
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,560
It's not something that could be on a pro and con list.

751
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,980
And it varies a little bit for each person and each individual.

752
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,080
And so it's so easy to say, well, coronavirus is dangerous.

753
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,920
Therefore we should do this or it's cheaper to do this.

754
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,000
But man, we are missing out.

755
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,680
And I think we don't interact as well with people and we don't give people as much grace

756
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,900
and leeway when they're having a bad day, when we only interact with them online.

757
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,000
But when you've worked with them in person or you know them for a little while in person

758
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,160
and you've seen them have a bad day in person, when they're having a bad day over Slack or

759
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,160
telegram, you're able to be more generous because they're an actualized person in your

760
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
mind.

761
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Yeah.

762
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,920
So I've always been like the hall of track is the most important, right?

763
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Yeah.

764
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,320
You've known all, you figured out way before I did.

765
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
Wow.

766
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
But it also makes sense, right?

767
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,360
Cause I'm trying to sell, you know, software or whatever, right?

768
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
Right.

769
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
Yeah.

770
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
You were going, exactly.

771
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,760
You were going into sales and I'm, I was going at it from, I need to absorb as much information

772
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,680
as possible to relay it in a podcast.

773
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:03,360
Sorry to be so negative folks, but I'm worried that we will just have permanently lost a

774
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,400
bunch of community events because of COVID.

775
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Yeah.

776
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,160
It, it seemed like it's going to happen now that it's gone on for so long.

777
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,120
Really and I know the big ones are great, right?

778
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:20,040
WWC, Linux Northwest, but I actually tend to enjoy the smaller local ones where it's

779
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,720
like folks that you might actually like, I mean, Tampa is not tiny, but all right.

780
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,720
So make fun of me.

781
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
All you want.

782
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,720
I love the stress.

783
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
It's our local theater.

784
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,520
Like it's, there's a small chance you'd run into them, right?

785
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,360
Going out with their spouse or whatever at the theater that you were just at a tech conference

786
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
with.

787
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,760
And if the conference is only, let's say a hundred, 200 people, it's not like a giant

788
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,040
thing.

789
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,320
Those are, I like those a lot, they're not as well produced and the food sucks and all

790
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,960
this kind of stuff, but they don't have like all the art in the hallways and the banners

791
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
and stuff.

792
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
Yeah.

793
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,960
They don't have a band.

794
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,120
Like Shakira is not coming telling you that he's still alive, but totally that's a, that's

795
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,580
a Silicon Valley reference for anybody who knows it, I don't know.

796
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,520
It's just like, you know what, like there's a company called source code in Tampa.

797
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,240
I used to see those dudes all the time.

798
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,280
I haven't seen them in a year and a half, two years now cause there's no events, right?

799
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,600
We're all like holed up in our little caves.

800
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,120
You know, doing the Linux events, I've, I've attended events that are 30 people and I've

801
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,080
done events that are, you know, 20,000 people.

802
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,320
And I mean that like some of the, some of the larger corporate events that are down

803
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,400
in Vegas or on the East coast, um, like I've never been to some of those, but those are

804
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,160
even huge, like bigger, right?

805
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,160
Larger events.

806
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,920
And so it really scales, but I think we all kind of know this humans don't work very well

807
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,240
at that scale, like when you're that big, everybody just becomes just another anonymous

808
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
face, just one of the mini in the crowd.

809
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,720
But when you're at an event that's between 230 people, you have 200 and maybe even 10

810
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,200
people like in that range, that's enough where your brain can actually individualize each

811
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:00,180
person and, and actually like make some connections and it's a better event because of that.

812
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,720
And plus people are better in smaller groups.

813
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
There's that too.

814
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
People behave better.

815
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,160
Yep, they're more accountable in a smaller group.

816
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,800
So all of those things are part of the social dynamic as well.

817
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,560
They're more willing to afford someone grace if they're like having a bad time and just

818
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
dunking on them.

819
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Yeah.

820
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,620
So, um, I think it's kind of unfortunate, but this is of course, Apple's made no announcement,

821
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:25,500
but if I were Apple and I were going to wind down developers at WWDC, the way I would do

822
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:32,080
it is by getting out ahead of it by launching these tech talks, I know, and it would be,

823
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,580
you know, maybe for the better because you really want to pay $2,500 every year to maybe

824
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,800
get a chance to talk to a presenter when you could just schedule something and have it

825
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
on your calendar.

826
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,680
See, I think that's a bad argument, right?

827
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,680
That's yes, WWDC is ridiculous.

828
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,160
The ticket price is nuts, but people mimic WWDC, even people who would say they don't,

829
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
they do.

830
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
Oh yeah.

831
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Look at Google IO.

832
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,400
If WWDC and Google IO go this way, like for instance, you know what?

833
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,920
I have never been to WWDC.

834
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,920
Every year I got a ticket.

835
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,920
I couldn't go.

836
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,920
Every year I wanted to go.

837
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
I couldn't get a ticket.

838
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,600
So it was like, yeah, but like all conf is nice, which is like the folks who didn't get

839
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,000
a ticket, but it runs in parallel.

840
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Well, and yeah.

841
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,160
And to your point, there's still networking benefits to going, even if you don't attend

842
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,920
the actual WWDC event itself.

843
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,080
I was talking about this last week.

844
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,240
Wasn't I a Florida developer conference of Florida, Florida dev conf?

845
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,800
I don't, I think it's done.

846
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,520
I mean, I tried to reach out and say, Hey, what's going on?

847
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
You know?

848
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
Yeah.

849
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,620
But you know, I was literally going to have TMB sponsor it.

850
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,980
No one's responding.

851
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,840
It seems like it's not happening because of COVID, but that was like the, I, the ideal

852
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,560
relatively small conference.

853
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
It was in Disney world.

854
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
So that's great.

855
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
Bring the kid, right?

856
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,640
Bring everybody, you know, yeah, how it is because mom or dad, whoever was, it's, it's,

857
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,280
it's a family event and a business event.

858
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
Yeah.

859
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
Those are nice actually.

860
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Right.

861
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,360
So like, you know, with the moms and dads where the tech people will go to the conference

862
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,560
and hang out in the contemporary hotel, that's where the conference was hosted.

863
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,640
And the other parent would be like with the kid, right?

864
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,840
Like in, in, I don't know, Narnia animal kingdom.

865
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,480
I'm not super up on Disney, but it was always the same.

866
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,840
Like I've, I've been down here so long, like I'd recognize, Oh, Hey, there's the big companies,

867
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,080
but Oh, source toots here.

868
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,120
Oh, you know, the guys from Orlando are here, right?

869
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
They just changed their name.

870
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,120
I don't remember.

871
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,120
They're the guys who made rails for zombies, but they have a different name now, but it

872
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,120
doesn't matter.

873
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,800
I feel like we're going to lose something if we don't have these in person events.

874
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,920
Maybe we'll be lucky and it's not a reduction.

875
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
Maybe it's an expansion.

876
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,140
Maybe it's this plus WWDC, but we'll find out.

877
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,440
And then others, like you say, we'll follow.

878
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,440
And that's also why it matters because it really will have a ramifications beyond just

879
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,820
Apple.

880
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:58,840
But before we get off of Apple, um, the reviews have landed today as we record of the Mac

881
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:04,120
book pro M one pro and M one max, we're starting to see impressions of people that have them

882
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,360
for about a week and more, and maybe we can change.

883
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,840
And I think you've, uh, you've had a bit of an internal struggle on this one.

884
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,000
I've seen several orders go by in slack and I don't know if any of them still stand.

885
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So last week you said, no, I don't think I'm going to do this, but then you started reading

886
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,680
the reviews and hearing the impressions and I think you changed your mind.

887
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,040
So where are you now?

888
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,040
Are you going to get one?

889
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
Did you get one?

890
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,040
What's happening?

891
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,760
I ordered a 16 inch M one pro.

892
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,320
Oh, and then canceled it.

893
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,320
Okay.

894
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,480
I then ordered a 14 inch M one max, right?

895
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,360
With 64 gigs of Ram who?

896
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,360
And then canceled it.

897
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:47,000
Oh, I am pleased to say I am not getting one of these.

898
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Okay.

899
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,080
You've come to a decision again.

900
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,080
For now.

901
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Okay.

902
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Let's be honest.

903
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,080
I can't be trusted.

904
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,760
I tell you, it'd be a no brainer if they'd announced a desktop.

905
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,480
So you know, when Apple announced the M ones, it feels like it was forever ago.

906
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,720
You know, you asked me then if I was going to get one and I said, no, I'm going to wait.

907
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,720
16 gigs is not enough.

908
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,760
Bram, that was a hard limit for me on the Mac book pro back in the butterfly keyboard

909
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
days.

910
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,340
I just, I need more than 16 gigs of Ram.

911
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,340
Can't do it.

912
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,340
Hard pass.

913
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,640
But I knew that Apple was going to address that.

914
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,520
So I said, okay, let's start setting aside some money now.

915
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,480
I want, you know, I want to be ready in case they announced something.

916
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,920
I want to buy, especially if they announced a desktop and you know, I hate talking about

917
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,920
this stuff because people, people get weird when I spend money.

918
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,680
So I want, you know, I, I was very careful about this because I knew if I bought an Apple

919
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,640
product, it was going to be a big deal for some people and I, you know, kind of upset

920
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
a couple of people.

921
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,760
So I wanted to be, I wanted to be measured, save my pennies for a while and watch to see

922
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,240
what they had.

923
00:40:49,240 --> 00:41:00,000
And I've decided to pull the trigger on a 16 inch, 64 gigabytes of Ram max with two

924
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,600
terabytes of storage.

925
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,440
And um, I think that's it.

926
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,520
I think that's the only changes I've made and that'll be on its way.

927
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,440
And um, we're going to, I, you know, I've waited, I've waited this entire time to see

928
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,160
what it's like, but I'm pretty impressed with what Apple announced, and so I've decided

929
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,840
to go all in and pick one up.

930
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,640
I don't know what the Linux compatibility story is going to be or anything.

931
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,400
Um, and of course it's not my only machine, I still, I'm going to keep my ThinkPad and

932
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,080
I still have my desktop, so we'll see.

933
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,120
I'm going to just essentially add it to the arsenal and see if it becomes my primary daily

934
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
driver.

935
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,120
I'm going to be very interested to see what the virtualization story is.

936
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:43,320
I will add to this that one of the deciding factors was that I got a chance to try out

937
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:51,600
an M1 Mac mini and I installed a virtualization software on there and loaded up Fedora 35

938
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,960
in that VM and full screened it.

939
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:03,040
And it was so fast, I could not, would not be able to tell you I was in a VM and I'm

940
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,960
using Wayland with 3d acceleration and you just would not know.

941
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,160
It worked.

942
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,940
It's the, it was the fastest virtualization experience I have ever had on a computer.

943
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:19,080
And so if it was that good on an M1, I can only imagine how good it'll be on an M1 Max

944
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,380
with a lot more RAM given to it.

945
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,960
So I think it's going to be a pretty good situation that way, that ways, and that's,

946
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,080
that's a big, that's a, that was why I wanted more RAM to begin with is for virtualization

947
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
and containers.

948
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,920
So I'm going to pull the trigger and I'm going to get one and it's been ordered, should be

949
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,040
here like at the end of November, like right before Thanksgiving, I think it's a lot of

950
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,500
money to spend on a computer, but I knew it would be when I started saving my pennies

951
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
for it.

952
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,880
I knew it was going to be expensive and uh, yeah, I wanted to make sure all my ducks were

953
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,100
in a row and I decided to pull the trigger after last week's episode, after doing some

954
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,160
more thinking and try and test it out of the mini.

955
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,840
And I'm a little nervous at spending that much money cause it's makes me a little uncomfortable,

956
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,160
but it's done, it's on its way and it's currently processing.

957
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,960
I think because I, because I just delayed my order and, and hemmed and haught about

958
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:14,240
it for a little while, I got initially a shipping notice of like December 24th was what it was

959
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,680
going to arrive and I thought, well, okay, you know, whatever, that's fine.

960
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
I'm not in a big rush.

961
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,680
Uh, fine.

962
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,960
I'll go for it.

963
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,580
And so I just put the, submitted the order and then I got an email from them a few days

964
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,100
later saying that now my estimated ship date is November 24th.

965
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,360
So I think when you put your orders in and then canceled them, it must've made room in

966
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,680
the queue for my order.

967
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,680
Yeah.

968
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,680
Well, I hope you like it.

969
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,240
Well, I would look forward to the review.

970
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,640
Yeah, we'll see.

971
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,240
I'm uh, I'm so far impressed by the reviews that have trickled in.

972
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,640
They, it looks, it looks like a lot of performance and you know, for me, like I'm, I'm not a,

973
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,120
I'm not, um, super up to date on the best ways to use macOS, but I've used it enough

974
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,600
over the years that I don't feel like macOS is going to be the big stumbling block that

975
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,320
it is for like a lot of my friends who are going to try these machines out and I get

976
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,800
in, they get in, they, it's like when people have been long time Android users and they

977
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,120
switched to iOS that they just lose their minds.

978
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,160
They don't know what to do, but I've had enough exposure over the years that I, I haven't

979
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:21,840
used, um, big Sur and I haven't used, um, mozzarella or whatever the next one is.

980
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,680
But, uh, I don't think it should be that big of a learning curve.

981
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,680
Oh, really?

982
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,680
Yeah.

983
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
Isn't it?

984
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
It comes out today too.

985
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Isn't it Monterey?

986
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
Yeah, I think so.

987
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
It's a little cheese.

988
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,680
I think it comes out today.

989
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,320
But you know, it's, it's kind of, it's kind of like you had been saying, like the M1,

990
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,440
when I tried that Mac mini and I was using the VM machine and I put like, I gave the

991
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,200
VM like eight gigs of Ram or something like that and I was using, I was like, Oh, Mike

992
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,200
was right.

993
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,680
This has been, I could have bought an M1 when they announced them and it would have been

994
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,520
powerful enough to do the job I needed to do.

995
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,080
I think it would have been fast enough.

996
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,160
I kind of just wrote it off because of 16 gigs of Ram and only, what is it, a four core

997
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,160
or an eight core processor?

998
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,040
I don't know, but it was like, come on, that's not enough.

999
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,200
I want to run three operating systems at once and six containers and I want to have all

1000
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
my desktop applications.

1001
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,960
That's just not enough.

1002
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,800
And then I tried that M1 and it wasn't even like a fresh install or anything like that.

1003
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,720
It was an M1 from when they were released and I loaded up that software and I'm full

1004
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,880
screen that VM and I thought I could work all day long in this VM and not feel like

1005
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,240
I was sacrificing anything really.

1006
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,800
And I could have, yeah, I could have done that six, nine months ago.

1007
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,840
I didn't need to wait, but I'm kind of glad I did because now I'm going to spend my money

1008
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,960
on a much nicer machine, which should be an even better experience.

1009
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,000
But it was one of those experiences like, yeah, Mike was right.

1010
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,200
I'll admit it.

1011
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,720
The M1 is fast enough.

1012
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,960
And the thing is too, and I know you said this, but it really makes a difference when

1013
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,760
you experience it.

1014
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,640
The machine doesn't even make a sound like I, when I touched it, it was cool to the touch

1015
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,760
and you know, I'm running, I was running it quite a bit because I didn't close any of

1016
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,760
the desktop apps.

1017
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,200
The browser was going, I had chat going and I went to town with the thing.

1018
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,200
I was really impressed.

1019
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,800
And that's what really pushed me over to get the MacBook because I thought, well, this

1020
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,240
laptop, if this mini is this powerful, then that laptop with an even faster chip is going

1021
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,640
to be plenty powerful.

1022
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,640
How are you liking the mini?

1023
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,920
Is it, is it holding up?

1024
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,800
Well, I only had it for a couple of days.

1025
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,260
It wasn't mine.

1026
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,200
So I gave it back, but it was really nice when I tried it, you know, I hooked it up

1027
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,680
to an external disk, my, my keyboard, I hooked it up to the launch keyboard.

1028
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,880
I hooked it up to a Asus, you know, just like screen.

1029
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,440
I bought an Amazon for years ago and a Logitech mouse and it felt nice.

1030
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,280
It's like, this is the nice thing about the mini is if you have, if you have your parts

1031
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,760
already, you just plug this thing in and you're good to go.

1032
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,840
And there's nice aspects to that.

1033
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,240
And I wish Apple had more offerings than just integrate all integrated systems except for

1034
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,240
this one, but we'll see.

1035
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,240
Maybe they will over time.

1036
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,920
But yeah, I thought it was a nice little box.

1037
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,080
Could make a good little home server for sure.

1038
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,360
It's food time for both of us, so we'll wrap it up by saying thank you to our friends at

1039
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,360
a cloud guru.

1040
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,560
Go find them on social media.

1041
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:02,120
It's just slash the cloud guru on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, you know, if it's a social

1042
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,480
media, well, they're over there.
