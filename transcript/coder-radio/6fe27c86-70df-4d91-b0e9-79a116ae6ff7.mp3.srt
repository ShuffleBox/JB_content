00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
This is Koto Radio, episode 331 for October 29th, 2018.

2
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,560
Hi everybody and welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,080
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,360
I'm over here in the now forever grey Pacific Northwest. My name is Chris and joining us

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,840
is our host, established in the always sunny, always temperate conditions of the beautiful

6
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,000
Florida, it's our host, the one and only, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike!

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,160
How's it you, sir? Oh, it's been a while, Jar Jar. Oh, it's been a while, Jar Jar. Oh,

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,440
I've missed you so much, Jar Jar, so much. Why don't you get the hell out of here and get Mike

9
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:16,000
on because we've got a show to do, all right? Bye, sir. Yeah, yeah. What an attention seeker.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,880
I tell you what, I was going to say something worse, but I'll just keep it PG here at the

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,840
intro. You know what I mean? But that Jar Jar, I don't trust him. A bit of an attention seeker.

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,040
Don't trust him. Yeah, you know, he's just a bad guy doing bad things. I agree. You got to get him

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
out of there. Get out of here. You got to get him out of there. Hey, you know, since I didn't want

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,520
to curse for Jar Jar's sake at the top of the show, how about right here at the top of the show,

15
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,120
I just give a real quick fuck you to the Twitters. I am so sick of Twitter. You just casually say

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,480
something the other day and now I've got three days worth of crap in my feed. That's my bad.

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,160
I ended up deleting the original tweet because I was like, OK, I don't know how we got here,

18
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,160
but it's not what I like. Bail, bail, bail. Yeah, I'm just like, you know, I can't reason with you

19
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:08,320
guys. You know, it's funny how like a just slightly incorrectly stated tweet, which is easy to do in

20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,880
a super short format or like somebody who's just not even familiar with a certain knowledge domain

21
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,040
asks a question because they've just discovered this domain exists and the and the crap storm

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,120
that it will generate four days on Twitter. Whoo. I got to tell you, that was that was like Mike

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,320
stepped in it. So, you know, we know we have to retreat to the show. That's all I was going to

24
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,640
say. That's what we do. We retreat to the show. We got a good batch of feedback up in here.

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,080
Got some cute follow up. This little company, this little upstart called IBM just purchased

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,920
this other little upstart you may have heard of called Red Hat. Let's pour one out for Red Hat.

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,680
Yeah, we got some GitHub news. And then if we have time, I'm going to take one more crack

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,120
at a golden topic here in the Coder Radio show, the remote workers. New study out showing remote

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,680
workers are outperforming office workers. And I know we've talked about this over the whole

30
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,280
history of this show, but now here I am finding myself an employee of a company based out of Texas

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,240
and I am now a remote employee and no longer. See, when we've talked about this before on the show,

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,040
I've been the boss and everybody's been working remotely for me. Now I'm working remotely for

33
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,320
somebody else. Whole other side of the coin, my friend. Totally different set of experiences,

34
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,760
let me tell you. So if we have a chance, I'll get to that in the show, too. Now we probably should

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,000
know that I know that I set it up so much. I'm sorry about that. I just got carried away.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,240
Let's start with Jacob's feedback. He's the Marine that wrote in a while ago on the show.

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,720
He says, hey, guys, I'm the Marine that asked for advice with zero experience

38
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,120
after listening to up hold on hamburger menus in the way after listening to your advice.

39
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,920
I put myself out there and I applied. I'm currently relocating to Florida to a government

40
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,520
contracting company as a C sharp and Russ developer. Thank you again. Well, now that's

41
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,880
a success story. Congratulations, Jacob. It's great to hear that. Maybe maybe go look up.

42
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,920
Mike, I hear Florida is just all one really small. Everybody down there knows each other.

43
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,040
It's really we all just know each other. Yeah, I didn't. You know, we all have alligators.

44
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,240
It's a good time. But yeah, I think we need a bell for this one. It's code radio success.

45
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,800
I agree. Yeah, everybody under 40 and code radio has to in Florida has to stick together. I believe

46
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,480
otherwise. You know what? There's so few of us. Oh, I know. I know. Hey, wait a minute now. Hold

47
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,320
on. My this pastebin link says no good. This one from Robin about setting you straight on WPF.

48
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,360
Did this go away? It says no good. Did it go away? Well, I can give you the gist. So I last week I

49
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,640
had stated that dotnet core did not work with WPF on windows, which it turns out is not true. It

50
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,800
works with WPF only on windows. So the deal is basically this. And this is kind of what Robin

51
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,880
wrote in to tell us. WPF does not work on other platforms, but it does work on windows. But you

52
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:07,840
can have dotnet core in a WPF app. Oh, okay. So nuance. There's like a lot of nuance. So

53
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,600
basically, that's how things like Avalonia work. Avalonia UI, which is a cross platform framework.

54
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:24,160
It will under the hood use WPF controls on windows, but still use dotnet core or it can

55
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,120
still use dotnet core. And Robin shared some good links that I will throw in the show notes

56
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:37,360
about kind of where Microsoft says dotnet core is going. All in all, it is going to be the future,

57
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,000
or that is their stated goal. The area of error in this case on my part was

58
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,760
stating that dotnet core could not be used with WPF on windows. That's not the case. It can,

59
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,200
but it can only be used with WPF on windows, which I still think is ridiculously confusing, but

60
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,720
it is a little, you know, basically the UI framework of WPF does not exist on any of the

61
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,400
platforms. Right. That's okay. That's what I'm rocking. All right. Well, so it's good to get

62
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,600
the clarification, I suppose. Boy, that seems sort of limited, but I actually kind of make sense.

63
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,200
That's how it would be. So thank you, Robin, for writing. And if you want to give us some feedback,

64
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,640
there's a couple of ways. The most official channel is the contact page at coder.show

65
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,840
slash contact. There's also the subreddit, which I try to check before each show. And I know Mike's

66
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,760
in there several times during the week too. And of course, when Twitter isn't blowing up,

67
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:37,440
you can also add Domenico and I'm at Chris LAS if you want to tag us on there. So I wasn't going

68
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,160
to bring this up, but you put this in the show and I didn't want to trigger you, but we do have

69
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,560
a new release from the cute folks. It's Design Studio 1.0. Big release. And they're hyping it,

70
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,000
man. They're hyping it hard. And to me, the cute outsider, it does look pretty good for building

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,720
some effective workflows for Qt and QML. I mean, it looks good, but obviously I haven't tried it.

72
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,840
Yeah. It looks interesting. Basically, it's a design tool that runs on Windows and I believe

73
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,240
Mac. I mean, they have a lot of talk about taking Photoshop files and generating QML.

74
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,440
Yeah. It's pretty interesting. Basically,

75
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,880
you have designers who might design your interface and you want to kind of create a,

76
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,200
I don't even know what to call it, not an asset pipeline, but kind of like a UX pipeline for them

77
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
to generate some layouts for you. Right.

78
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,240
For you to kind of use as a baseline. And then it does live previews and it'll do like,

79
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,840
it'll frame rate counter to give you an idea of how it's actually going to perform. It'll zoom in.

80
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,720
Yeah. Yeah. I have not gotten my hands on it yet, but certainly if this works,

81
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,120
this would be pretty cool. Anything that makes the development process faster,

82
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,280
particularly when somebody hands you a giant Photoshop file with a million layers

83
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,680
and you just like want to get a baseline layout template to work with.

84
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,360
The other aspect that's interesting is the timeline-based animations,

85
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,600
which is a timeline or a keyframe-based editor that lets designers create animations without

86
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,600
having to write any code. That's pretty nice because you could see how if you want just even

87
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,720
a basic proof of concept animation, this would be a useful tool. It might not be super sophisticated,

88
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,240
but relaying an idea before you start spending tons of time building something is extremely

89
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,720
valuable. And this thing has a lot of new features they're adding to the timeline-based animations.

90
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,960
Yeah. I think at worst, this is going to be a pretty good prototyping tool to say,

91
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,160
well, this is something like we could do. And then maybe you have to go back and

92
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,640
Yeah.

93
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,280
do the animations for real.

94
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,840
But in the meantime, you're building Qt and QML. I don't know about this Photoshop bridge. That's

95
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,560
the part that seems the most dicey to me. They label it as import your graphics designs from

96
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,840
Photoshop, create reusable components directly from Photoshop. Okay. Maybe if they're providing

97
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,080
very specific templates that you start with in Photoshop, I could buy that. I could see that

98
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,800
working. Maybe it's a pretty cool feature. If it does work kind of makes me wish like I could have

99
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,040
like a research team that I would be like, Hey, go try this. Come back, report back to the show.

100
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,680
But if anybody out there has a chance to let us know, do contact us because the Photoshop bridge

101
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,720
and the time-based animations and the Qt live preview stuff really seems pretty slick. Is there

102
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,800
anything else that jumped out at you about it? You know, not really. I mean, there's a level

103
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
of magicalness going on here that we've seen lots of these tools over the years. We've been doing

104
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,960
these shows for different platforms. I would be very curious to see how it actually performs.

105
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:42,160
But certainly I think there's particularly in the Qt space an opportunity for this to be

106
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,800
very useful. Yeah. Yeah. And for prototyping could be particularly invaluable. All right.

107
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:55,200
Well, moving on to a little breaking news here. This is a release on the Swift announcements

108
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,160
forms. We at Apple are making it a priority to support high quality tooling for all Swift

109
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,080
developers, including those working on non-Apple platforms. We want to collaborate with the open

110
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,800
source community and focus our efforts on building common infrastructure that can be

111
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,080
shared by Xcode and other editors and other platforms. To that end, I am excited to announce

112
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,840
that we are going to start a new open source project for Swift and C family language services

113
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,120
based on the language server protocol. We have chosen to adopt Lisp so we can benefit

114
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,480
from its active community and wide adoption across other editors and platforms. This means

115
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,200
that Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text or whatever your favorite editor happens to be

116
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,320
can use the same service as Xcode and any improvements we make to the service will

117
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:55,200
benefit them all. Wow. That's great. That happened. This announcement came out,

118
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,360
I think because of the delay, about 10 days ago or so, 14 days ago when we were recording this.

119
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,240
Have you had a chance to sit with this? Have you sat with this monumental announcement?

120
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:12,880
I've been trying to get more context for it and it seems pretty straightforward. They are trying

121
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:20,240
to make sure that Swift and basically the Apple development ecosystem are not completely locked

122
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:27,680
down, which feels weird and shocking. There are lots of people, if you read around about this,

123
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,480
who have been trying to implement their own LSP language service because they just can't,

124
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,960
whatever, they want to work in Vim, they want to work in some other tool. Whatever the tool is,

125
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:47,840
everybody can teach his own. I find this weirdly surprising, but good in a happy way.

126
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,800
Like certain other surprises we'll talk about. You're getting ahead of yourself there.

127
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,240
To be super clear, if you just develop an Xcode, this will actually end up benefiting

128
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,560
you in the long term as well, but the immediate benefits are probably going to be for folks who

129
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,080
are trying to write Swift in Vim. If that sounds weird to you, keep in mind that there's things

130
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:18,400
like Vapor and even IBM, I forgot the name of their solution, but IBM has a Swift, don't call

131
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,800
it Rails, but Swift-like backend solution that you can run on Linux. It's completely possible.

132
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,320
So a couple of points of clarification. The LSP service will use source kit D to get Swift-specific

133
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,280
highlighting support or code completion support, those kinds of things.

134
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,680
There was a question asked in the forum if the developers would be using lib syntax

135
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,280
X to implement highlighting, but that would be, it looks like probably not. It looks like what

136
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,560
they're going to do is they'll essentially be a library that you can grab. The intention is for

137
00:12:50,560 --> 00:13:00,800
part of this to replace the existing library they're using today and really make it available

138
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,560
to all editors. Really, truly make something that's available to all editors so you could

139
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,120
have syntax highlighting in Visual Studio Code or Atom or like Mike uses Emacs all the time.

140
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,200
I'm like, yeah, they could be making, oh yeah.

141
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,040
There's some Google developers that are jumping in on this too and they look like they're pretty

142
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,160
pumped about this. They say, Google is also very interested in contributing.

143
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,000
We have a fair amount of work in this area to meet some of our internal needs.

144
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,840
We're excited to see this moving forward. Isn't that interesting? Well, I'll be one to watch,

145
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:43,040
but if it pales in comparison to what feels like maybe one of the largest stories

146
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,080
of the year, not just an open source, but of the year, some breaking news on Sunday.

147
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Got all the breaking news in the Coder Radio program today. IBM announces they're going to

148
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:03,520
acquire Red Hat for just a small amount of money. Nothing that much, just a few billions, like 34

149
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:11,360
of them, which works out to be about $190 per share, which is a 60% premium over their Friday

150
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,560
closing price before the announcement. Red Hat will become part of IBM's hybrid cloud division,

151
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,960
with Jim Whitehurst, the CEO of Red Hat, reporting directly to IBM's CEO.

152
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,560
I don't know. You kind of went through the gamut of reactions through Twitter,

153
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,120
and I think one of your reactions was I really didn't think it would be Red Hat first. In fact,

154
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,520
I think the implication was you thought it'd be Canonical that sold first.

155
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,200
Yeah, I sort of did. Yeah.

156
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,720
Isn't this something? And you got to wonder if it does mean that maybe Canonical is going to be

157
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,920
more likely to be an interesting purchase for maybe companies like Microsoft or Amazon.

158
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,160
Amazon, yeah. So what was your initial take on this? Like your first raw reaction when you saw

159
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,080
this? Well, you know, I mean, full disclosure, I think this is pretty common, but it was a little

160
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,520
bit of dread. It was a little bit of, oh no, this is, I mean, and I got to be clear, I do not have

161
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:13,120
that reaction to all acquisitions. Like the GitHub Microsoft acquisition, I was more like, well,

162
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,800
this is interesting because there's a lot of rumors that GitHub was falling apart at the top

163
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,400
and they needed new leadership. They weren't like making enough money.

164
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,200
Right. But when the Red Hat one gets announced, I try to, here's the game I've tried to play.

165
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,640
There's two things I've asked myself. Number one, who else would I rather it be? And number two,

166
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,280
is the new owner better than the old owner for some of their various things that they have?

167
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,800
And my sense to the second question is no, but my sense to the first question is,

168
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,720
I'm not sure who else I'd rather have buy them. Let's say, I mean,

169
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,520
who else would have the money to buy Red Hat? I guess, you know, 30-

170
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,960
They had Amazon, Microsoft, I mean, all the big boys, but who would want to would be an interesting,

171
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,920
maybe Amazon, but you know, the canonical Amazon marriage would make a lot more sense.

172
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,440
Right.

173
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,240
I think.

174
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,480
Right.

175
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,760
And still be terrible, but-

176
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,960
Although Red Hat's pretty big on there. I think, you know, I think Ubuntu may have it

177
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,680
beat, but they don't release specifics. So it's hard to say.

178
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,800
Red Hat's already public too. Right, Red Hat was already a public company on like GitHub. It was,

179
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,800
yeah.

180
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,720
You know, there's one thing, because I know, I know a handful of people who work at Red Hat.

181
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,640
And there's one thing that I would say is consistent about a lot of people who work there

182
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,680
is they went to go work at Red Hat because it was Red Hat and they wanted to contribute to

183
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,840
open source in a way that would actually make a difference. Because working at Red Hat,

184
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:44,560
you were working on projects that would ship. And I just, I know a lot of people who are

185
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,000
working there because it's Red Hat, not because it's IBM. And I don't know what that means for

186
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,440
those engineers, what they're going to do. And I feel for them, put yourself in their shoes just

187
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,720
for a moment. A lot of them, the majority of them found out about this via Twitter, the news,

188
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,960
Linux action news, a couple of them found out via Linux action news. It was not well communicated.

189
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,880
And so when you have a bunch of employees there that are super passionate about your unique company

190
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
culture, which they're very proud of, Jim Whitehurst has written a book about it.

191
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,000
And they're working there because of open source and wanting to be a player in open

192
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,680
source and make a difference and contribute to open source in a way that will actually go out

193
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,240
and ship. You got to figure there's going to be a certain amount of talent train after an acquisition

194
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,720
like this. You got to figure that's something given IBM's aggressive history of, you know,

195
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,560
domestic layoffs and like aggressive offshoring with their consulting work, which is like,

196
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:49,120
I read somewhere 70% of their business now. I don't even know if they'd see that as a problem.

197
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,400
Yeah. So TechCrunch has an interesting take on this. Jonathan Schieber over there says that

198
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,560
what the latest $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat really tells us is that IBM needs a way to

199
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,920
save its failing Watson business. And this is an interesting take here. Watson, which is the

200
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,760
business division focused on artificial intelligence, whose public claims were always

201
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,040
really more marketing than actually market driven, has not performed as well as IBM had hoped. And

202
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,600
investors are losing their patience. There's also some critics, including analysts at the

203
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,920
investment bank, Jeffries, that have been skeptical about Watson's ability to deliver

204
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,920
what IBM claims for over a year. And earlier this year, the online medical journal Stat reported

205
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,160
that the Watson was giving clinicians recommendations for cancer treatments that

206
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,120
were unsafe and incorrect based on the training data had received from the company's own engineers

207
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,320
and doctors. All of those woes were reflected in the company's latest earning calls where it

208
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,240
reported falling revenues primarily from the cognitive solutions business, which includes

209
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,840
Watson's artificial intelligence supercomputing services. So there's a few folks out there that

210
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,000
have their take on this is IBM made a big marketing bet on artificial intelligence and Watson. They

211
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,640
did a whole blitz about Watson and it's not actually delivering real financial results.

212
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,680
And so they need to get back to basics. They need to get back to the cloud. They need to

213
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,160
get back to selling services. And of course, a lot of those services in the cloud are powered by

214
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:26,240
Red Hat. What do you think of that? I mean, I think it's hard to say that this isn't a,

215
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,440
you know, this is anything but a shot at the cloud business. I hadn't heard that Watson

216
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,120
was struggling so much revenue wise. That's at least according to TechCrunch. I'll have a link

217
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:45,600
in the show notes. I think there's a lot of areas that they've invested over the years. I am no

218
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:53,360
expert on IBM, but having watched them just sort of tangentially since the PS2 was being sold by IBM

219
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:04,640
since then, they've had my interest. I believe that they have lost their way. They became a sales

220
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,400
and consulting company and they went too far. They got too hooked on that sauce and they didn't.

221
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,840
What has IBM done recently? What have they done? You know, you can point to things that Amazon's

222
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,240
done and Google's doing and Microsoft and Apple and even Oracle and the companies in that,

223
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,400
even that outer tier of large tech companies, but IBM, they've sold a lot of services.

224
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,320
But what else have they done? What comes to mind when you think of what IBM's done? All that comes

225
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,760
to my mind is stuff they used to do. I mean, they're effectively a giant consultancy now.

226
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,680
Right. My point is, and I'm not trying to take anything away from other than saying

227
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,000
in that light, it seems obvious that this is a desperation play, a 60% premium.

228
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,320
Huge mark. Yeah, that's crazy though. That's-

229
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,400
34 billion. Now mind you, Red Hat is on track to make 3 billion this year.

230
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,760
So they got 34 bill for the sale. The way this was rushed out and the fact that the

231
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,720
employees weren't informed when the culture management issues are massive with IBM,

232
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,240
this is a huge issue for, I mean, Red Hat and now IBM. The fact that they weren't properly warned,

233
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,600
the fact that this is a $34 billion acquisition, it kind of makes me wonder if there wasn't another

234
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,120
interested party. And announced on a weekend, by the way.

235
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
A Sunday when I think they were planning-

236
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,280
Sunday.

237
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,480
They were planning to have a corporate meeting on Monday and then this came out on Sunday.

238
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,760
And it started out as rumors. So then Red Hat just jumped on it on their Twitter account and

239
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,840
confirmed it and posted the blog post. Seemed pretty rushed to me.

240
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
Strange. So maybe there's other bidders.

241
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,160
So do you see this as another step towards consolidation? Meaning,

242
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,560
do you think that other dominoes are now going to fall?

243
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,080
It does make me wonder what's next for Canonical as they're trying to go public,

244
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,920
as they're trying to raise funding, maybe even look at selling. It makes me wonder,

245
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,360
it makes me wonder what's the next move. And you have to figure that some of the platform

246
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,640
providers that compete with IBM, but have Red Hat VMs on their platform are a little nervous

247
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,120
right now. And you have to figure that Microsoft's looking around going, God, look at Azure.

248
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,520
We've got like 30% of these things. I mean, who knows what it is. They don't really often say,

249
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,440
but we've got like 30% of these things running Ubuntu. Especially if you count the containers.

250
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,320
If you look at the containers we're running, they're like 70% Ubuntu. This is a platform

251
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,520
that's obviously critical to Azure making money. And it's obvious they will spend money

252
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,480
to make Azure a success. So you got to figure, somebody over there is talking about this right

253
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,520
now. Okay. If Microsoft buys Canonical, all I am going to do is hang out in Telegram and on

254
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:55,120
r slash Linux for about a week and just watch. Well, what's worse? IBM buying Red Hat or Microsoft

255
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,360
buying Canonical. I would argue that Microsoft buying Canonical would be less of a threat to

256
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:10,000
Linux in general. Red Hat is responsible for the gnome shell. They are the primary stewards of GTK,

257
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,520
SystemD, PulseAudio, Fedora. Oh, who uses Fedora? Not that Canonical doesn't make genuine

258
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,160
contributions, but I actually have more faith that Microsoft would run them properly and the

259
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,160
contributions they do make would continue. In fact, perhaps Microsoft would even resource them

260
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:34,240
better. But in the case of IBM, what's the argument for IBM to continue developing Pipewire to create

261
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,360
a unified audio and video pipeline for the Linux desktop? What's the point? Why does IBM care about

262
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,440
that if this is part of their hybrid cloud division? See Red Hat did, and that's something

263
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,840
Red Hat is working on. I don't really see IBM being too fired up about that.

264
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,680
Yeah, I mean, maybe it's a little unfair to characterize IBM this way, but they really do

265
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,640
feel like they've been focused on basically pumping up their consulting business and not

266
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:07,680
developing products or projects in quite the same way as, since we're comparing apples to apples,

267
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:14,400
a Microsoft who every week there's a new major Microsoft product or announcement or open source

268
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,000
thing or, I mean, not that this is the Microsoft action show, but they're really doing a lot in

269
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,120
the space right now. Yeah, IBM, yeah. I mean, they've ran some commercials, they've contributed

270
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,400
code for sure, but yeah. And the other thing about it, about this whole, about this whole,

271
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:39,040
like Microsoft or whoever would buy Canonical, you have to figure with Canonical, with Canonical,

272
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:46,960
with Canonical, their business really is selling that server support and the server side.

273
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,000
The desktop is almost kind of, the desktop components on a bit are, I don't want to say

274
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,440
autopilot because that sells short the work that they do put into it, but they're based on upstream

275
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,320
projects for the most part, right? So there's not a same required, like they don't have to have a

276
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,880
huge desktop division. They can have a sustainable desktop division. So Canonical, you could acquire

277
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,160
Canonical and it would still make financial sense to run the desktop side of the shop.

278
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:24,560
Red Hat has all of these really long-term investments that are like foundational

279
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,280
technologies. Like I said, GTK, but also others like Stratus storage is something they're working

280
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,680
on right now. There's these big ones in there that, I don't know, we'll see. The claim is that

281
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:41,520
they're going to run as an independent operator for a while at least. Yeah, that always happens.

282
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,720
So is this just how, this is how it always was going to go? Is this it? I mean, is this what

283
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,640
this was all about? Like in the 90s, what Red Hat represented and what Microsoft represented

284
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,600
were so cornerstone to how I experienced technology. Microsoft was the bad guy and Red Hat

285
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,320
was the rebels and now Microsoft is an open source citizen and Red Hat is going to be owned by

286
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:16,960
the original establishment in technology. It's just really, it's really, it's kind of a,

287
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,360
it's kind of a whomp whomp into a story. I mean, I realize the story's not over yet, but

288
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,320
I don't know, all this fuss and then this is what we end up with. Is Red Hat's gone?

289
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,120
Marc Andreessen had a good post that came out this morning about how Red Hat was really one of the

290
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,200
only successful truly open source companies. And with them basically going, I mean, not basically,

291
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,280
they are in fact being acquired by IBM, right? The only one other than them was Sun. And honestly,

292
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:54,000
my initial reaction to this news was to pour one out for Javaduke because it's the same thing.

293
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,480
I mean, I'm not going to say if like IBM is worse than Oracle, but it's not good. I mean,

294
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,320
we already see some of the shenanigans with the Java SDK agreement on the Oracle side.

295
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,440
I can imagine Red Hat's contributions after a couple of years, eventually starting to be much

296
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,600
more focused on cloud, whatever that cloud, but whatever it is that would actually like generate

297
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,760
revenue for IBM. No, I don't know. They are consulting, you know, who knows what their

298
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,000
actual plan is, but I'm trying to think of another major company that is, you know,

299
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,160
of that late nineties, mid nineties, actually kind of open sourcey generation that is still around

300
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,400
and independent. Yeah. Hmm. I bet you, I bet you there's a couple, but I just, I'm not,

301
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,960
I'm not, they're not coming to mind. Like not as much as blender blend. Yeah. Blender is not.

302
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,840
Not at the scale. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I really, the more I think about it, the sadder I get,

303
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,240
and I don't want to be, I keep trying to remind myself that IBM does have a great sales team

304
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,200
and IBM is going to bring enterprise credibility to Red Hat's offerings even more.

305
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,760
And the bill to sell it is parts of huge packages. Red Hat believes that they are sitting on top of

306
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,320
a $1 trillion market that they just can't address and that they need the resources of IBM to fully

307
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,480
address that market. This is, this is what they think. So Jim Whitehurst thinks at least.

308
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,360
Yeah, that's a very convenient thing to think.

309
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:35,200
So in other news, get hubs now officially part of Microsoft, Chris. Yeah. Yeah. Ooh. Yeah. Good.

310
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,840
Yeah. With government approvals received, the acquisition announced in June is officially

311
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,400
complete and get hub is now part of Microsoft. How do you, you know, how do you even follow any

312
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,840
of this up? Like we're just at a place now where this consolidation. Yeah. We're in a phase of

313
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:00,160
consolidation. Maybe, maybe it'll leave fertile ground for new upstarts. I don't think so though.

314
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,120
I don't think so. Yeah. I think we're, I think what's happening is an entire business cycle is

315
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,680
basically coming to its end. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And I feel a bit of mourning. I don't know what it is,

316
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,920
but there's a bit, there's a touch of sadness for it, which doesn't feel like an appropriate

317
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,840
response. It feels like this doesn't really affect me. I shouldn't feel sad, but at the same time,

318
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,520
it's, I feel like there, it's an era that's passing and a special company that was unique

319
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,480
is getting absorbed into a larger organization that, that quite frankly has failed to impress

320
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,320
for the last few years. I think their Watson stuff has smelled like bullshit from afar.

321
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,640
A lot of us have kind of thought that, I mean, I think you and I've talked about it, how it just,

322
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,640
it's marketing hype. I think we've talked about that on this show and so I just, they kind of,

323
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:53,360
you know, I kind of lost faith in IBM. And now to see this, we'll see, we'll see where it goes.

324
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,520
Just, just don't know. And you know, time will tell, as they say on these things could take

325
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,720
years before anything major changes, to be honest. Oh, I would hope that they would be,

326
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,120
you know, respectful of the community and, and red and indeed red hat was making money.

327
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,400
Right. So it's not like, it's not like this is a ship that's on fire.

328
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,840
Right. 30, $34 billion though, that, that took some serious effort on their part. That's IBM's

329
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,080
very serious about this move. You know, you want to make sure you get a return on investment on

330
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,160
34 billion. Can I make, can I make, can I make a coder prediction? Yeah. I say canonical Amazon.

331
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,920
If canonical gets acquired, it'll be Amazon. If they try, if they treated them like a Zappos,

332
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,360
that would be okay by me. That's not going to happen. No, it wouldn't. No, no, it wouldn't.

333
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,280
They might let them work remote though. Yeah. So, uh, remote workers, according to an article over

334
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:56,720
at inc.com are outperforming office workers and research shows that, uh, the real issue comes

335
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,520
down to employees being able to, unable to concentrate at their desk, uh, which is, uh,

336
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:07,120
that's an interesting reason. I'll tell you, um, that I'll go through their reasons and then I'll,

337
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,520
I'll, I'll give you my thoughts here. They say productivity, uh, with no office distractions

338
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,760
and greater autonomy, remote workers have the freedom to get more done. In fact, according to

339
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,160
a nationwide survey, 65% of workers said the remote work would give their productivity a

340
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:27,280
boost. Another 86% said that working alone allows them to hit maximum productivity. Despite the

341
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,200
distance though, remote workers are actually sometimes the best teammates. This is another

342
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,880
reason why productivity goes up. This is because the distance demands more communication and

343
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,360
without being able to lean on physical proximity, remote workers must reach out to another frequently

344
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:49,760
and with purpose leads to stronger collaboration. And then there's presence. Often office life is

345
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,160
littered with absences, workers who are calling six, sneaking out early to run an errand or even

346
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,040
go to an event on time. But remote workers don't really need to make excuses since they're not tied

347
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,520
to any office. They can design their workday to meet the demands of their lives. If they have a

348
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,520
cold, they can work from home without spreading the germs to the office too. There's just a,

349
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,160
these are just a few reasons. No beard taps or hammocks are necessary. You're right in the

350
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:22,640
article. But I'll tell you. So my experience is sort of a mixed bag with remote work.

351
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:29,760
So the first part is when I do go down to the Keller office, I can not work in a cubicle there.

352
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,360
I can't, like they have a few like open desks with like keyboard stands and second monitors

353
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,200
and phones and all that kind of stuff. And I was like, oh, I got a power cord, USB-C,

354
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,320
I'll just sit down and hook up. I just can't work like that. People be talking. Like they're all

355
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,200
talking. They're just talking, talk, talk, talk, bitching, mostly bitching. Sometimes you'll hear

356
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,080
somebody on the phone bitching, they're bitching. I don't want to hear any of that when I'm trying

357
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,040
to work. They're talking and I need to focus. So I had to go lock myself in a sound booth to go

358
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:08,320
work. But here remotely, there are certain things that you just don't get to participate in like a

359
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,720
group lunch in the office. You're kind of left out of that kind of stuff. Or another example that

360
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:23,120
drives me crazy right now is they have a small packet loss about every 10 seconds on their

361
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,040
network that mostly doesn't affect anything except for VoIP calls. Like web browsing,

362
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,520
even watching video doesn't impact it because everything buffers, everything pretty much sorts

363
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:39,120
it out, TCP retransmits. But VoIP calls, which are not only UDP, so they don't retransmit,

364
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,360
but also highly susceptible to packet loss. So remote workers, things get cut out. You can't

365
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,960
hear every 10 seconds or so what people at the office are saying, but they don't hear it because

366
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,800
they're not on the side of the call against the dropout, so it doesn't get fixed. It's not a

367
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,560
concern. So there's small things to it. But then on the plus side, I today decided I'm going to

368
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,040
start working at 5 AM. I came in, I started working at 5 AM today, and I just have the office to

369
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,560
myself. Nobody's here to steal that perfect morning productivity that I managed to achieve,

370
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,680
which is rare and prescient. And I was able to come in and have the morning to myself

371
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:22,720
and sip on my caffeinated beverage and get some work done with no interruptions for hours,

372
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:29,440
which just wouldn't be possible in an office. So there's definitely those kinds of mixes and

373
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:38,640
minuses, but the tools today, Zoom meetings, Slack, Dropbox paper, Google Docs, they are so common

374
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:44,000
and effective that everybody's using those same core tools, rather you're on the land at the

375
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,640
land at the office or you're remote working in Alaska. Everybody's on the same tool set now.

376
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,960
Everybody's using the same exact tools and applications to do everything. And that

377
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,680
consistency has made a huge difference, especially when you're dealing with applications that don't

378
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:04,560
require a VPN or don't require special crazy network security, because these are services

379
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,440
like Slack and Google Docs. And removing those barriers has made remote work as a remote employee

380
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,400
much simpler, much easier. And I think it makes a big difference if you have a large percentage of

381
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,920
your work base that's remote. If you're one person who's remote, or there's two or three people that

382
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,720
are remote and everybody else is local, you're really the odd person out. And so if you have

383
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,560
a large percentage that are remote, then there are certain accommodations that the company makes,

384
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,040
like putting HR files online in a secured location instead of paperwork that you have to go in and

385
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,040
fill out and then hand to them. There's little accommodations that can be made for employers

386
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,200
for employees to make that stuff smoother, to give them resources through a web portals or whatnot

387
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,840
that don't require physically going to somebody's office or doing an inner office mail. Anyways,

388
00:35:53,840 --> 00:36:02,640
so I'd say on the flip side of remote work now, I think my overall takeaway is as an employee,

389
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,800
I am definitely more effective remote, definitely considerably more effective. When I go into the

390
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,720
office, I'm effective in a different way. So what I do is I batch. So when I go down into Texas,

391
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,840
I batch meetings or certain types of conversations that I'd rather have in person or something that

392
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,120
needed like a group of people at a table, I'll batch that stuff up. So it's a good kind of

393
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,120
hybrid approach, I think, to remote work. And when I kind of came to that conclusion and making it

394
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,800
really easy by following some of the travel hacks that have been sent into the show and by keeping

395
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,600
a go bag down at the Linux Academy office, I can jump on a plane, it's a four-hour flight max,

396
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,000
and if I leave here in the morning, I can get down there mid-afternoon and actually get

397
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,440
worked on that day. And that works pretty effectively. And that kind of flexibility

398
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,840
is really nice to have. But it's still not a perfect arrangement, I'd say, just because of

399
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:06,080
things like VoIP calls sometimes can be a little crappy. If you have a room full of people that are

400
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,280
having a meeting and you're the one remote worker who's joining that meeting, you kind of have to

401
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,800
sit there and wait till they remember to connect to you and that kind of stuff. But overall,

402
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:22,800
it's nice to have the flexibility. Yeah, I'm still not sure what I think about it.

403
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
Really? This article didn't change your mind at all or anything?

404
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:33,040
It didn't change it. I think it's what I'm doing because it's the best of all bad solutions,

405
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:40,080
but I think remote work can... I'm not sure. I'm not sure if it either creates new issues or it

406
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,440
can exacerbate issues that are already there. Well, let me tell you what I was struggling

407
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,360
with. And I wonder if you've tried this when you're doing remote work. The biggest struggle

408
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,800
for me was a drop in my energy level because I'm sitting around this place all day long in my office

409
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,640
chair, going upstairs, going downstairs, just in this building all day. It's quiet. There's nobody

410
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,600
I'm interacting with. And by the afternoon, or sometimes even in the morning, if I start really

411
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:10,480
early, my energy starts to drop off. And one of the things I've been experimenting with is going

412
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:18,000
to these various locations to work that are more public. This sounds very basic of me, but to be

413
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,840
honest, I've found it's working really well. I got the Starbucks app, which I've never done this

414
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:31,200
before. I got the Starbucks app on my phone and I order up some egg bites and some caffeine,

415
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,800
and I walk into the Starbucks, I grab it, and I sit there and I work on their Google

416
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:44,160
wifi for like 45 minutes in a public space, like a regular person. It's weird. You ever tried this?

417
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,360
It is weird. It keeps the energy level up though, is what I'm trying to get. Like changing it up.

418
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,720
I'll have to try it. Yeah. I find that if I do the right kind of work there, I can't be like

419
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,080
super focused. It has to be kind of light work, but I do a certain amount of light work there.

420
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,440
And just the change of vibe and location and all of that. And just really the ability that I can

421
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,440
actually legitimately work at a Starbucks is, I don't know, it just feels cool. And it doesn't

422
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:19,920
have to be a Starbucks. It could be Joe's Coffee. Wes likes to go to a local brew pub and he just

423
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,360
hangs out. That's more my- I know, right? And it's down on the waterfront, the Seattle waterfront,

424
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,200
too. So he gets a table where he can look out at the water. They got wifi. I mean, the guy's got it

425
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,120
and he can walk there from his place. That's the setup. I mean, that Wes Payne, he knows what he's

426
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:40,800
doing. Now me, I'm just going to basic Starbucks here, but it's worked for me for a little bit now.

427
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:47,120
And when I added this semi-recently to my remote work regime, when I sat here, I'm thinking to

428
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:53,680
myself, why am I at this desk? I'm getting sleepy. And I could take the same exact laptop and I could

429
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,440
go work somewhere else. And the thing about that app on the Starbucks thing, and there's probably

430
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,960
other places that do this, is there's no waiting. There's no lines. There's none of that fuss that

431
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,440
I'm not a big fan of. Like when you order food with this app, you walk in and it's just right

432
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,160
there on a hot plate waiting for you. And you just grab it, you say, thank you. And they say,

433
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,200
thank you. And you go sit down and you leave. It's the best thing ever. Yeah. Isn't that great?

434
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,320
So it's, I have found that tweaking my remote work by about every other day or so, I'll go

435
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,040
do this. And I've been doing it for about two weeks. I found that working outside can sometimes

436
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:37,520
help going on if you have a backyard or a porch. Sure. Sure. I'm also one last thing I'm trying

437
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:44,240
to do. And then I'm also trying to leverage a few more of the Google tools, which I've resisted

438
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,400
because it, you know, it's, you know what the thing is, is like, I'm already in on Google

439
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,840
apps because Linux Academy and Jupiter broadcasting use Google apps and we use Google docs to do this

440
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:02,480
show. Right. And the other thing is, is it's getting ubiquitous. Everybody has a Google account,

441
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,200
family members. Like when I go to a family thing or, you know, for Hadia, my fiance,

442
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,320
she has a, everybody has a Google account, everybody. So if I want to share something with

443
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,000
them, it's almost guaranteed I can share a doc or a photo or whatever. So yeah, I have,

444
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,800
I have bit the bullet and I ordered myself one of those Google home hubs.

445
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,200
Going to try that out. It's got the little calendar on there, you know? Now, will that and your home

446
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,080
pods could have like a battle royale to death? I hope so. I hope that would be so amazing if

447
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,000
when I'm not around, they're like, they're like fighting it out, like packet wars,

448
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,080
the sending, trying to send like ping of death to each other. Yeah. I'm going to give it a go.

449
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,600
We'll see how it works, you know, and I'm going to use the integration with Todoist,

450
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:50,320
which is my to do app of choice. So can we talk about our least favorite topic again? Sure.

451
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,720
I am, as you know, in the market for a workstation. Oh my goodness. This again. Yes. This again,

452
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,600
there is an Apple event tomorrow and system 76 is doing some very pretty videos while telling

453
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,960
you nothing about the product they're going to ship, which is a interesting marketing strategy.

454
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,160
Classic. Classic. I don't even want to know what these videos cost.

455
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:26,880
So tomorrow, supposedly there may be new iMacs and the new quote unquote pro Mac mini.

456
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,520
And I have been seeing a lot of excitement about the pro Mac mini and I just want to maybe lower

457
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:43,760
some expectations. Okay. Because if this computer indeed is, you know, announced and like released

458
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:50,960
within a reasonable timeframe after tomorrow, all it's going to probably be is a MacBook Pro

459
00:42:50,960 --> 00:43:02,320
high end 13 low end 15 in a little box. Right. So it's really not, I, my guess is that it's just

460
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,800
given history and that they're coming out with a Mac pro and that the iMac pro exists. It's not

461
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,560
going to hit that sweet spot for most people, I think listening to the show.

462
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,960
Why not? I mean, you know, you put an I seven in that thing. You put a MVME SSE,

463
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,320
SSD in there. I think you want a GPU, right? Cause I think otherwise you may as well just go with

464
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,480
the laptop. Although I will say that I have come to the conclusion that laptops make terrible

465
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,640
desktop replacements for the most part for me, I don't know that it's a big enough Delta to,

466
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,600
to have that make sense. I don't know. I mean, I could almost see what you're saying.

467
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,240
I guess I could see what you're saying on the GPU, but it seems like with, with Thunderbolt

468
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:53,680
and all of that stuff, there's other methods now to get the USBC stuff. The USBC, the whole

469
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:02,080
ecosystem is so flaky and crappy right now. Like what's the point? So then you have the idea of a

470
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:09,600
bumped iMac, right? Which I think is maybe the more viable option. Cause you can get like an

471
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:18,480
NVIDIA card, hopefully. And it's, you know, a very nice 27 inch monitor. What if that doesn't

472
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,440
exist, right? Apple has been super stingy with their hardware upgrades, unless you're willing

473
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:31,040
to spend like $5,000. Sure. Am I, am I overly pessimistic because I've been responding to

474
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:38,160
people with, I don't think the event is going to be what you want it to be.

475
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,040
I thought this was going to be an iPad event. And I would say it is an iPad event, but they also have

476
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,840
Macs. Yeah. I'd say it's a safe bet to keep lowered expectations. If they don't update the Mac mini,

477
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:55,760
that is a tragedy. That's a tragedy. It's a travesty and a tragedy. And I wouldn't expect

478
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,560
a lot on the iMac. For me, I feel like the iMac is fairly competitive. You just recently got the

479
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:09,680
iMac pro. We had the iMac pro ship recently and the iMac 5k isn't really that competitive. So you

480
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:16,000
could see some updates there. You're not going to see any teasing for the Mac pro. I disagree on the

481
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,200
Mac mini. I don't think they need to make that much of an update to it. I think if they just

482
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,960
basically ripped off the Intel NUC, people would be happy. The mini is a glue machine. It's not a,

483
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,640
not a performance desktop. You stick it all together with the mini. You know what I mean?

484
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,520
And yeah, it's, well, it's a media server from a lot of people, right? And you know,

485
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,160
the iPad pros, I'll be curious to see what they do there. Be curious to see. Again.

486
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,400
Well, those have already leaked completely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. USB-C they say, but that really could

487
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,120
just be a USB-C dongle in the box for all we know. We don't really know. We'll have to wait

488
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,400
and see tomorrow. You know, all will be revealed, right? Because like we can speculate now, but

489
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,240
really it's like literally tomorrow. This show will be already stale. Yeah. In two days, whatever

490
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,680
the hell Thelio is probably would know to probably be today when the show's coming out. Well,

491
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,840
anyways, that has been, that has been, I was good. I liked that. You know, we should, we should,

492
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:15,440
we should actually make this an official segment. Don't you think? Like we could call this,

493
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:27,040
we could call this a lowered expectations with Mike. Yeah. Is that going to be the, I like it.

494
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,400
You know what? I love it. There's all kinds of things I can. That'd be great dude. Next week, Rust.

495
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,160
Yeah. All right. Well, anything else you want to fire bomb before we get out of here? You good?

496
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,840
I hope Twitter goes bankrupt. I don't know. Oh, oh. In the meantime,

497
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:50,880
where can people find you on Twitter? We are the worst. I'm at Chris LAS.

Like say you want to send us some contact. Guess what? Coder.show slash contact. It's pretty fancy

502
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,680
how that works, huh? Anyways, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the show. We'd love
