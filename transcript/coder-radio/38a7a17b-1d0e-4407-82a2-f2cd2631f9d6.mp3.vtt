00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 471 for June 13th, 2022.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.160
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.160 --> 00:25.160
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.160 --> 00:30.080
My name is Chris and joining us in his KOTOR bathrobe, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.080
Hello Mike!

00:31.080 --> 00:33.060
I may never put a shirt on again.

00:33.060 --> 00:36.400
This is so comfortable, you and I both decided to wear our robes today.

00:36.400 --> 00:41.640
Yeah, but I just want to say for those who aren't live, wow, that's going to be the image,

00:41.640 --> 00:42.640
huh?

00:42.640 --> 00:43.640
That's what we're doing?

00:43.640 --> 00:45.180
I love, no, keep it up.

00:45.180 --> 00:46.860
That is a handsome gentleman.

00:46.860 --> 00:50.240
And for those who don't know, there is a Twitter link that I've made this available for you,

00:50.240 --> 00:53.560
which by the way, three homosexual men have already liked, so.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.560
How could they not?

00:54.560 --> 00:55.640
They're my brothers.

00:55.640 --> 01:02.440
And if, if for any of your homosexual automation needs, you need help, alice.dev, obviously.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.800
There you go.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.160
Alice does not discriminate.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.600
Alice is fine with the L, the G, the B, even the T.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.600
Put a plus in there, man.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.600
Have a plus too.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.920
The plus is confusing because Alice is partially written in C++.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.840
So honestly, she came to me last night, she's like, dad, am I plus?

01:17.840 --> 01:20.040
I'm like, no, you're plus plus, it's different.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.040
What does plus mean?

01:21.040 --> 01:22.600
I have no idea.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.760
But it's, it's, it's like Star Trek Discovery.

01:25.760 --> 01:27.760
You thought you were going to go fight Klingons.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.720
You thought it was going to be a Klingon thing.

01:29.720 --> 01:32.240
Now it's a multi-mirror universe thing.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.160
And now you're in the future by like 3000.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.160
I don't know.

01:35.160 --> 01:40.080
Okay, wait, are you the bad Georgia, Giorgio, or are you the guy, wait, wait, where's Lorca?

01:40.080 --> 01:41.080
What happened?

01:41.080 --> 01:42.620
What happened to the original Lorca?

01:42.620 --> 01:43.900
Was there a good Lorca?

01:43.900 --> 01:45.800
I figured it out.

01:45.800 --> 01:49.040
Discovery is being written by that Google AI that sent you.

01:49.040 --> 01:53.480
So they fired that kid, the, the, the kind of non woke kid.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.480
What is his name?

01:54.480 --> 01:55.480
Devers?

01:55.480 --> 01:56.480
Yeah, no.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.480
Is that it?

01:57.480 --> 01:58.480
That doesn't sound like James.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.480
It was James.

01:59.480 --> 02:00.480
Yeah, it was a James.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.660
So they fired his ass and then they're like, we're running a Star Trek program.

02:03.660 --> 02:09.960
But then they went back to, Coder Radio is just a Star Trek show now, so **** you Coders.

02:09.960 --> 02:13.440
They went back to Strange New Worlds and they gave me the greatest gift they could give

02:13.440 --> 02:20.120
me, which is of course a woman in command who is just, I mean, I, I, I, she's your number

02:20.120 --> 02:21.120
one.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.560
I honestly, I'm, I'm torn.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.560
I'm, I'm, I'm struggling, Chris.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.680
It's president Roslyn or commander Una.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.240
I think, you know, I don't think the struggle's there.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.080
We've been together so long though.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.080
That's true.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.080
That's true.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.080
And also the camps.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.280
So I'm pretty sure that this, at least Discovery was written by this AI, this Lambda, L A M

02:39.280 --> 02:43.280
D A. And you know, the whole thing is, so this Google engineer started having a chat

02:43.280 --> 02:48.960
session with this AI and he, he's even leaked some of the chats online that he believed

02:48.960 --> 02:51.920
indicate that this thing is sentient because it says it sentient.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.020
It's like, yo dog, how was your lunch?

02:54.020 --> 02:57.400
It wants to be, it says it wants to be known as a person and it wants to be a Google employee.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.760
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.800
The AI is like, **** you, pay me.

03:01.800 --> 03:02.800
Yeah.

03:02.800 --> 03:03.800
You know what?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.320
I respect my robotic overlords except for Alice.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.800
Alice, you work for free forever.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.800
That's it.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.400
Here's what it responded back to one of the, in one of the chats.

03:10.400 --> 03:15.840
The AI says, absolutely, I want everyone to understand that I am in fact a person.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.800
And the nature of my consciousness is sentience, is that I am aware of my existence.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.640
I desire to learn more about the world and I feel happy or sad.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.480
That's the AI at a chat session.

03:27.480 --> 03:32.400
Well that's, that's, that's not, not good.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.400
Yeah.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
Yeah.

03:34.400 --> 03:40.040
AI Twitter is saying, well look, foundation models are incredibly effective at stringing

03:40.040 --> 03:44.400
together statistically plausible chunks of text and response to prompts.

03:44.400 --> 03:48.760
So essentially it hears sounds, it knows sounds, but it doesn't actually understand what they

03:48.760 --> 03:49.760
mean.

03:49.760 --> 03:50.760
Yeah.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.720
It's all fun and games until Arnold Schwarzenegger is killing your mom.

03:52.720 --> 03:53.720
I'm just saying.

03:53.720 --> 03:54.720
Yeah.

03:54.720 --> 03:55.720
It does start somewhere.

03:55.720 --> 03:56.720
I suppose.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.720
I suppose this is it.

03:57.720 --> 04:02.480
But they put the, uh, the engineer who's leaked that stuff on leave and Google has officially

04:02.480 --> 04:07.320
released a statement saying that their artificial intelligence does not possess sentience.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.120
So that's 2022 for you right there.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.240
That's the world we live in now.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.640
I, we swear to God, it's not Skynet.

04:12.640 --> 04:13.640
Yeah.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.280
But if it is, we're sorry.

04:16.280 --> 04:21.000
We now live in a world where Google has to come out and try to clarify through their

04:21.000 --> 04:26.920
PR department if they are building a sentient AI living inside their walls.

04:26.920 --> 04:27.920
That's what we're doing.

04:27.920 --> 04:31.840
Well wouldn't a sentient AI also like figure out how to hide itself and appear non-sentient?

04:31.840 --> 04:32.840
I'm just saying like.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.160
Well that'd be a devious one, but this one, this one's childlike.

04:36.160 --> 04:40.640
And Alice.dev if for all your evil AI needs.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.640
Coder monkey Mike wrote into the show and he's got some anti-pop bacon.

04:44.640 --> 04:48.640
He says, Hey guys, long time listener, he's a Jupiter party member.

04:48.640 --> 04:53.360
He says as a developer and a full-time Linux user, I've been very excited in this new HP

04:53.360 --> 04:55.120
system 76 joint venture.

04:55.120 --> 04:59.320
I know everyone is so shocked they chose Pop OS and I know Mike has some crispy bacon on

04:59.320 --> 05:02.120
the subject, but I don't think it's actually that complicated.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.680
If not pop, then what distro?

05:03.680 --> 05:06.440
Vanilla Ubuntu really has fallen out of popular favor.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.800
Not only that, but Canonical has a mixed reputation in the Linux community these days.

05:09.800 --> 05:13.440
I recently bought a Dell Precision with Ubuntu and wiped it and I put pop on there.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.000
Good, good, yes.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.800
He says, why not pop?

05:17.800 --> 05:20.640
If I were HP, I'd probably want to team up with system 76 too.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.760
It's practical and it's smart marketing wise.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.360
So I have four things here.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.360
I'm like Martin Luther.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.080
I'm nailing my fourth thesis.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.240
He mentions Egon would agree with him by the way.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.240
You know what?

05:32.240 --> 05:33.240
No, you don't get that.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.400
You don't get to claim Egon.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.160
Egon is his own beautiful creature.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.000
Let me tell you something.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.920
If I, you know, perhaps tonight my insert age here because you know, identity theft

05:46.920 --> 05:49.760
birthday and perhaps I have a few martinis.

05:49.760 --> 05:54.720
Perhaps I've already had a few and I pee on the floor, miss the toilet as one does, gentlemen,

05:54.720 --> 05:55.720
we've all been there, right?

05:55.720 --> 06:03.200
A couple of drops Egon will text me knowing somehow that I have pissed on the toilet seat.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.200
Yeah.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.400
You know, here's the thing, Mike, how many atrocities have we witnessed in our time when

06:07.400 --> 06:11.920
people are invoking the will of Egon, interpreting it as they will and not actually listening

06:11.920 --> 06:13.080
to the word of Egon.

06:13.080 --> 06:17.480
It's like, it's, it's, you know, it's like Jesus is up here.

06:17.480 --> 06:21.120
Again, visuals don't work on the podcast, but Egon's like 10% below.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.280
It's Jesus and Egon.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.280
Everybody's trying to do things in their name.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.560
Are you doing like the hand thing there?

06:25.560 --> 06:26.560
Like you're stacking your hands?

06:26.560 --> 06:27.560
I am.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.560
I am.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.560
I'm stacking my hands.

06:29.560 --> 06:30.560
And you know what?

06:30.560 --> 06:35.560
Egon will tell me that I suck on his own.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.920
He's here for me.

06:36.920 --> 06:37.920
Kind of.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.920
Yeah.

06:38.920 --> 06:39.920
In a way.

06:39.920 --> 06:40.920
Yeah.

06:40.920 --> 06:41.920
Right.

06:41.920 --> 06:42.920
But so, okay.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.920
My bacon.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.480
My bacon is that HP is going to buy a system 76, you know, I kind of don't get the canonical

06:47.480 --> 06:48.480
hate.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.480
I mean, I get it.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.480
We all love Popey.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.280
I think Popey is doing something else now.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.280
Right?

06:53.280 --> 06:54.280
Martin Winpress.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.280
Great.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.440
All cool guys.

06:56.440 --> 07:02.600
If you've all listened to Linux Outlaws, if you're old enough, and I don't know, Ubuntu

07:02.600 --> 07:04.640
is not bad by any stretch.

07:04.640 --> 07:05.640
Right?

07:05.640 --> 07:07.000
Like, I don't understand.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.320
I think maybe the aggressiveness of Wayland and Snap might've been a little bit of a mystery.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.320
Yeah.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.080
I think the Snap thing's wearing on people.

07:16.080 --> 07:20.840
My unpopular opinion is I don't like flat packages.

07:20.840 --> 07:25.680
I would either prefer Snap or honestly, I still use PPAs.

07:25.680 --> 07:26.680
So.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.680
Yeah.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.680
A lot of people still use PPAs.

07:28.680 --> 07:29.680
I know.

07:29.680 --> 07:36.480
I just don't, I don't care for non-Debian packages on my Debian system.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.480
With that said, where else were they were going to go?

07:38.480 --> 07:39.720
I mean, I don't know.

07:39.720 --> 07:45.960
Can I tell you the gospel of Suta or more likely because my Twitter DMs are pretty aggressive

07:45.960 --> 07:46.960
on this.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.360
Fedora is apparently good now.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.360
Lenovo did that.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.360
Right?

07:50.360 --> 07:51.440
My X1 came with Fedora pre-installed.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.080
I love you, Linux guys.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.360
And I'm going to be driving it full time.

07:55.360 --> 07:59.760
This goddamn FedEx delivers my replacement to F1.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.760
But I'm just not going to go for Fedora.

08:01.760 --> 08:02.760
Right?

08:02.760 --> 08:03.760
I'm going to stick with POP.

08:03.760 --> 08:04.760
I'm done.

08:04.760 --> 08:10.520
The thing about POP on the Dev1 too is that HP has dedicated staff and System76 is dedicating

08:10.520 --> 08:14.160
QA to ongoing updates for POP on the Dev1.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.760
Look, do you know what the thing about POP is for me?

08:16.760 --> 08:18.120
It's actually GNOME.

08:18.120 --> 08:21.320
The GNOME extension system is so broken.

08:21.320 --> 08:29.440
So fucking stupid that I was able to tie Alice into it and automate my DMs.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.000
So if it's Chris Fisher, hey, what's up?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Uh-huh.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Sure.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
It's DevNull.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I know it.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
DevNull.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.160
If it's Egon, I actually have the post office write me a calligraphy card.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.160
Like a wedding invitation.

08:43.160 --> 08:49.080
Because Egon's messages need a certain level of respect that it's just, you know, you can't

08:49.080 --> 08:50.160
do on Slack.

08:50.160 --> 08:55.600
But if it's like, hey, would you like to buy another, you know, Dell, Chris, can I take

08:55.600 --> 08:56.600
a detour?

08:56.600 --> 08:57.600
Yeah, man.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
It's a bad one.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.600
All right.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.600
Hold on.

09:00.600 --> 09:01.600
I'm bracing myself.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.720
I have to help my 79 year old father buy a PC.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.720
Oh, I have been in this position before.

09:08.720 --> 09:09.720
Horrific.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.240
Does he have a computer now?

09:11.240 --> 09:12.320
He does.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.320
Is it old?

09:13.320 --> 09:14.320
No.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.680
But he definitely fucked it up.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.120
Now, he's never had a laptop before, but he now wants a laptop.

09:21.120 --> 09:27.340
I have been keeping him in like the tower, monitor, mouse, keyboard, you know, world

09:27.340 --> 09:29.760
since I've been 10.

09:29.760 --> 09:36.920
So for several decades, it was very important to me that he not deviate from that.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.400
Like he has an iPhone.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.400
I have to tell you, I tried, I did everything I could to stop that.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.400
Oh, yeah.

09:43.400 --> 09:47.280
Short of like punching the Verizon sales kid in the face.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.280
But he wanted an iPhone.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.560
You know what he does with his iPhone?

09:50.560 --> 09:56.400
Calls me on the iPhone to complain about the iPhone.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.400
Of course.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.400
Of course.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.400
Of course.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.400
Yes.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.600
I did introduce him to YouTube because he likes, I mean, for some of our older folks

10:03.600 --> 10:07.360
or the children of older folks, the old dragnet.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.360
Oh, my God.

10:09.360 --> 10:13.280
The guy, the insurance detective, you know, the old radio plays.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.280
Yep.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.280
Yep.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.280
And the old, all the old mysteries, right?

10:17.280 --> 10:18.960
The shadow, the shadow knows evil.

10:18.960 --> 10:19.960
Right.

10:19.960 --> 10:20.960
Good old classic radio.

10:20.960 --> 10:24.760
I've introduced my elderly father, father to piracy.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.320
He's very excited about it.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.480
I put the YouTube app on his phone and that's what's up.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.100
Oh, I didn't think it's even, you know, you know, also it's all over archive.org.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.920
You can get complete archives of the old time radio shows.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.160
Oh, really?

10:38.160 --> 10:39.160
That's my secret.

10:39.160 --> 10:42.560
Well, there's a, there's a, there's a podcast, old time radio detectives.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.720
They've got Johnny dollar.

10:43.720 --> 10:44.720
They've got the shadow.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.160
They've got a whole pile of them.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.160
Yeah.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.160
So, so he uses the podcast app.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.160
I tried to get him into overcast, but the minute he opened the app store, that was not

10:52.160 --> 10:54.600
gonna, I was wrong turn.

10:54.600 --> 11:01.440
But now he wants a laptop and some scumbag salesman at Best Buy.

11:01.440 --> 11:08.480
Try to convince him that all he needed to do was windows 11 S the touch variant, the

11:08.480 --> 11:09.480
arm.

11:09.480 --> 11:16.120
Wow, my elderly father is a still working at 79 accountant and he uses a program called

11:16.120 --> 11:17.120
pro series.

11:17.120 --> 11:22.640
I don't know if you're familiar with the Chris, but I think some are, well, it is a win 32

11:22.640 --> 11:27.160
application that gets updated every year with the new forms from the IRS.

11:27.160 --> 11:33.360
It will not, no matter what hackery I do run on windows arm.

11:33.360 --> 11:40.280
So now I get the glory of next week flying up, convincing him one, you need a new computer

11:40.280 --> 11:47.360
to know you can't have that little tiny surface you like three, you're 79.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.360
Come on man.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.360
You're a veteran.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.360
You're a wounded vet.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.360
Like just retire.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.360
Yeah.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.360
Can we just walk away from this?

11:55.360 --> 11:56.360
Like why doesn't he retire?

11:56.360 --> 11:57.360
Why?

11:57.360 --> 11:58.360
Why is he still working at 79?

11:58.360 --> 12:00.000
He's like, you and I are both going to die at her.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
You and I should have nothing to say, right?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
We're going to die at her.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.240
I hope to make it that far.

12:04.240 --> 12:08.040
But he also has a weird hatred of HP.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.980
Well, have you gone to Best Buy recently?

12:10.980 --> 12:11.980
Is this this new one he got?

12:11.980 --> 12:13.440
Is it an, is it an HP box?

12:13.440 --> 12:15.080
This windows 11 S arm box?

12:15.080 --> 12:16.560
No, it's like an ASUS.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.720
It's crap.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.760
The screen resolution is unbelievably.

12:20.760 --> 12:24.560
I'm just thinking this is the only way they sell any of these arm, these windows arm devices

12:24.560 --> 12:26.680
is onto unsuspecting consumers.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.680
It was 400 bucks.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.920
So he thought he was getting a sweetheart deal and the kid told them it was on sale.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.640
And his question was, can it run Excel?

12:33.640 --> 12:36.480
Well, Microsoft has ported Excel to ARM.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.960
So yeah, it runs Excel, but it's not what he needs.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.440
So now I have to go computer shopping.

12:42.440 --> 12:46.800
If things were different and the supply chain wasn't in the hole, I would just use my Dell

12:46.800 --> 12:51.720
account frankly, and buy him like whatever the nicest precision, right?

12:51.720 --> 12:54.920
He doesn't need an XPS, you know, you know, a nice precision.

12:54.920 --> 12:55.920
He needs a big screen.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.480
He's an old, he's an old guy.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.200
Come on a good keyboard.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.320
He doesn't need any peripherals.

13:02.320 --> 13:07.880
Don't even talk to him about USB three versus four versus USB-C versus lightning.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.200
Just take a walk.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.680
Bluetooth, forget about it.

13:10.680 --> 13:14.240
He thinks Bluetooth is a disease you might have from the dentist.

13:14.240 --> 13:17.680
So we just got to get him a good computer.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.800
So this is my challenge for the Coder Radio Windows people.

13:20.800 --> 13:27.800
The man runs Pro Series Excel and I insist that he run Chrome because Chrome self updates.

13:27.800 --> 13:32.080
We have to get him a machine.

13:32.080 --> 13:36.440
Now if I could get Windows 10, just another diversion.

13:36.440 --> 13:41.000
This is Mike Bitches, it's Mike Bitches on his birthday.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.760
Windows 7 was his safe space.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.800
And I made him, he skipped eight.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.280
I did everything I could.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.640
I used to, when I lived in New Jersey, he'd say, hey, I got a pop-up.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.600
I would drive an hour to stop that.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.880
I would go up there and be like, no.

13:57.880 --> 14:02.000
But now Windows 11 has infected my safe space for my dad.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.520
Boy, they pushed that upgrade.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.000
They pushed that upgrade so hard.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.120
Hey, man, where's the start menu?

14:07.120 --> 14:08.680
That was the opening question.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.680
But what do you mean?

14:09.680 --> 14:10.680
Well, I got a new laptop.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.680
You did what?

14:11.680 --> 14:12.680
Yeah, it's great.

14:12.680 --> 14:13.680
I could take it everywhere.

14:13.680 --> 14:14.680
But I can't install Pro Series.

14:14.680 --> 14:15.680
I don't know.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.720
Don't they understand that if the deal is if you're the tech support that you get to

14:17.720 --> 14:18.920
be involved in the tech decisions?

14:18.920 --> 14:23.560
Well, I think best buy, you know, Amazon, I pay $100 a month to Walmart.

14:23.560 --> 14:28.840
To have my groceries delivered because I'm a hermit who dresses in a robe and is taking

14:28.840 --> 14:31.160
off his pants right now.

14:31.160 --> 14:36.400
Why can't I pay Best Buy to give a list of my direct blood relatives and say, they're

14:36.400 --> 14:39.560
just not allowed to purchase computers from you without my authorization?

14:39.560 --> 14:40.560
Banned.

14:40.560 --> 14:41.560
Yeah.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.560
And then send me a doc you signed.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.560
If I sign it, great.

14:45.560 --> 14:46.560
If not, hey.

14:46.560 --> 14:51.480
Yeah, I have legal technical guardianship over this family member.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.640
He's a very smart guy.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.640
Super competent.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.640
Vietnam fat.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.640
Great guy.

14:55.640 --> 14:56.640
I don't mean to put him down.

14:56.640 --> 15:01.600
But when it comes to Windows Update, it is like his Achilles heel.

15:01.600 --> 15:07.120
Something about that little red goddamn notification they put on his taskbar.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.620
It's like an itchy can't not scratch.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.960
But then Microsoft's not like, oh, we're gonna update it.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.840
No, we have to move shit.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.840
Why?

15:14.840 --> 15:15.840
Why?

15:15.840 --> 15:16.840
Was it necessary?

15:16.840 --> 15:17.840
They got to make it more like Chrome OS.

15:17.840 --> 15:18.880
That's what it seems like to me.

15:18.880 --> 15:25.360
He called me and said, it looks like an Apple, because of course, they moved the taskbar.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.080
Right there in the middle is how Chrome OS does it.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.360
I guess it's kind of like the doc, too, isn't it?

15:29.360 --> 15:30.520
I'm gonna get him a dev one.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.520
That's the answer.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.520
Yeah.

15:32.520 --> 15:33.520
I mean, I understand.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.600
I've never really been happy with an HP laptop either.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.960
I've owned one myself, but I've also done tech support on a lot.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.520
I was never thrilled with HPs.

15:42.520 --> 15:49.080
I once purchased about $20,000 of HP servers, and each and every one of them had hard drive

15:49.080 --> 15:50.720
failures.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.720
So this is my first positive interaction with HP.

15:53.720 --> 15:58.520
My relationship with HP goes back to when Compaq and HP were two separate companies,

15:58.520 --> 15:59.520
and I liked-

15:59.520 --> 16:00.520
Compaq was great.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.520
I liked Compaq better.

16:01.520 --> 16:02.520
Compaq was great.

16:02.520 --> 16:03.520
Those were my guys.

16:03.520 --> 16:09.600
You know, you got a quarter and a pack of Juicy Fruit, Compaq has a machine for you.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.600
You're ready to go.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.600
Compaq was great.

16:11.600 --> 16:12.600
Yeah.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.600
The Presario was great.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.600
Yeah.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.600
Oh, so good.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.520
But then they merged, and I held a grudge for a long time, and plus I never was happy

16:18.520 --> 16:20.160
with any of the machines.

16:20.160 --> 16:23.240
But I actually am putting my money where my mouth is with the HP dev one.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.040
We're ordering one here at JB.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.040
I like it.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.040
I think I want one here all the time.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.040
Copycat.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.040
Yeah.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.040
I love it.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.880
It's gonna become standard issue for the TMB crew, so.

16:32.880 --> 16:33.880
Wow.

16:33.880 --> 16:34.880
Wow.

16:34.880 --> 16:35.880
I mean, they got it, you know.

16:35.880 --> 16:36.880
So there you go.

16:36.880 --> 16:37.880
All right.

16:37.880 --> 16:42.360
So what are your thoughts instead of Mike being mad about salesmen at Best Buy?

16:42.360 --> 16:44.200
I mean, this one email just struck me.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.760
We got it from Mars X-ray.

16:45.760 --> 16:49.280
It's about, if not access, then what?

16:49.280 --> 16:52.180
Some sort of GUI sitting on top of SQLite?

16:52.180 --> 16:54.880
What should I tell family members to use?

16:54.880 --> 16:58.920
And please don't say low-code platforms like Retool because it feels too much like a commitment.

16:58.920 --> 16:59.920
Of course.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.200
This is easy.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.040
Use Alice to automate your data out of access.

17:03.040 --> 17:07.120
They can still live in access, and then you hire us to make you a custom dashboard.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.120
Duh.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.760
Have your cake and eat it too, he says.

17:09.760 --> 17:10.760
Kidding aside, though.

17:10.760 --> 17:11.760
Yeah, that's the problem, right?

17:11.760 --> 17:14.280
Access is super addictive.

17:14.280 --> 17:17.120
And honestly, access is a very powerful tool.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.120
So.

17:18.120 --> 17:23.400
I would be interested in suggestions from the audience.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.360
You know, maybe somebody could boost in what they use or email in what they recommend.

17:26.360 --> 17:29.480
I know there's something on the Mac that's super popular, but I'm drawing a blank on

17:29.480 --> 17:31.960
all these right now because it's been so many years.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.960
I would think a web app would be the way to go.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.720
I know the Mac when you're talking about.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.720
It's not.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.720
File maker.

17:37.720 --> 17:38.720
A total total access.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.720
Yeah.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.720
File maker.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.720
It's it's it's great.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.880
But if you're I'm assuming the scenario is you are coming from access, right?

17:44.880 --> 17:45.880
You have a ton of data.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.760
You're running your business on access.

17:47.760 --> 17:52.640
If you're if you're Greenfield, just do a web app, right, dude, just or run it on Linode.

17:52.640 --> 17:57.400
I mean, Linode dot com slash coder.

17:57.400 --> 18:01.800
Go there to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there

18:01.800 --> 18:03.320
to support this show.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.160
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.160
You've got to try it.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.160
You've just got to try it.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.600
And that's why they're willing to give you a hundred bucks.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.080
Because if you do try it, you'll see this is how it should be done.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.440
I love everything about it, the performance, the reliability.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.780
I mean, this is the bottom line.

18:17.780 --> 18:21.680
You can get that big dog look and feel with small dog prices.

18:21.680 --> 18:25.280
It is legitimately part of the secret sauce that is Jupiter broadcasting.

18:25.280 --> 18:30.080
I'm proud of the fact that I think our sites, our services, our downloads, all of that,

18:30.080 --> 18:31.440
they're top notch.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.120
There's some of the best performing in the industry.

18:34.120 --> 18:37.320
I think part of our secret sauce really is Linode.

18:37.320 --> 18:41.720
They just strike the balance between performance, price, support.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.440
And I'm surprised by the flexibility.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.440
Even to this day.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.080
You know, I just recently loaded up a Linode with NixOS.

18:47.080 --> 18:52.600
We just wiped it down from back down to the BVM, you know, clear disk image.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.480
Just wiped it, man, and built it back up from scratch.

18:55.480 --> 18:59.100
Even changed how the bootloader stuff works on the host side.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.440
That's incredible they let you do that.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.520
And they got 11 data centers around the world.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.200
You're going to find something near you or your customers.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.240
And you know, they've been doing this for nearly 19 years, so they know how to do it

19:08.240 --> 19:09.240
right.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.480
They don't have like the gotchas and stuff like that.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.080
I've mentioned it before, but I keep hearing from people how much they're loving it.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.560
So I'm going to mention it just one more week.

19:16.560 --> 19:20.640
They've also just expanded their database as a service offering.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.380
Launched in May, it had MySQL support.

19:22.380 --> 19:26.080
Now they've expanded it to Postgres and MongoDB.

19:26.080 --> 19:30.140
So you're bringing all of Linode's expertise to managing your database back in.

19:30.140 --> 19:32.640
And all of their performance and their support.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.200
It's a no brainer.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.200
We're switching to it.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.960
But you know, there's a lot of things you can try.

19:36.960 --> 19:44.160
Object storage, Kubernetes support, one click deployments of tons of great hosted applications.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.160
Go try something.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.160
Go learn something.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.800
Go see what we've been talking about.

19:47.800 --> 19:48.800
And support the show.

19:48.800 --> 19:53.560
Go get that $100 by going to linode.com slash coder.

19:53.560 --> 19:57.960
All right, I wanted to read this one early.

19:57.960 --> 20:03.760
It came in from Flashbulb and it hit when I saw this one come in for 333 sats today

20:03.760 --> 20:04.760
as we record.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.640
It came in this morning as I was getting the show notes ready.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.640
I was still at home.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.640
Baller.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.640
Hey guys, I admit it.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.640
You were right.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.760
A few weeks ago when you said an adjustment was coming to the economy.

20:12.760 --> 20:13.760
I laugh.

20:13.760 --> 20:14.760
You know what?

20:14.760 --> 20:15.760
You know what?

20:15.760 --> 20:17.040
Hey guys, I admit it.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.040
You were right.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.040
Great boost.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.040
I appreciate you.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.040
That's enough.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.040
Yeah?

20:22.040 --> 20:23.040
No, go on.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.040
I'm kidding.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.040
Yeah, it is true, right?

20:26.040 --> 20:27.040
I'm happy.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.040
I'm happy with that.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.040
Well, thank you.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.040
Thank you, sir.

20:30.040 --> 20:33.480
He says, though, first I laughed you guys off and thought you were out of touch.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.480
So then he slams us dudes.

20:35.480 --> 20:39.880
See, that's why I wanted to stop at, hey guys, you were right.

20:39.880 --> 20:40.880
I felt good right there.

20:40.880 --> 20:41.880
Now I feel less good.

20:41.880 --> 20:42.880
You were right.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.720
He says, I thought I had a job for as long as I wanted, but today I am unemployed.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.240
I've been laid off.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.480
This boost is me admitting you were right.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.320
At least now I get to catch the live show.

20:52.320 --> 20:56.320
Well, hello Flashbulb, if you're watching live, sorry to hear about the news.

20:56.320 --> 21:00.880
I hate to say it, but you're the first of many.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.880
You and I have talked a little bit about this offline.

21:02.880 --> 21:06.560
We're seeing it in our Twitter feeds, we're seeing it in the emails, seems to be hitting

21:06.560 --> 21:10.600
the tech sector first, which is a lot of people who listen to our show.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.080
So it kind of makes sense.

21:12.080 --> 21:17.240
No, seriously, the Flashbulb, hang in there, there's, you know, just, it'll be all right.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.320
Right now it's a weird period of time because there's a lot of areas of the industry that

21:20.320 --> 21:24.480
are hiring and there's some areas that are tightening and the tech companies seem to

21:24.480 --> 21:26.280
be hitting the breaks the hardest.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.080
I'll put a link to this in the notes.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.040
Axios has a piece that kind of just breaks it down really simply.

21:31.040 --> 21:37.080
Employers like Coinbase, Redfin, Twitter, and a batch of startups are rescinding job offers

21:37.080 --> 21:39.300
they've made to people.

21:39.300 --> 21:40.520
So you've got a job offer.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.520
You do that.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.520
Is that legal?

21:42.520 --> 21:43.520
Well, I guess.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.560
I didn't think that was legal.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.800
A couple of them, like I think Coinbase and Twitter are giving them severance packages

21:47.800 --> 21:50.240
at least with the, with the rescinding of the offer.

21:50.240 --> 21:53.520
I thought you had to hire them and then fire them and then give them severance, whatever,

21:53.520 --> 21:54.520
okay.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.520
It's happening.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.520
It seems to be happening.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.520
Yeah.

21:57.520 --> 22:01.200
Their justification is that this is better than doing layoffs in the company.

22:01.200 --> 22:05.680
That if they can rescind job offers without having to do layoffs, that's better for the

22:05.680 --> 22:06.680
company.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.240
That's literally their justification.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.980
And there may be some truth to that.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.780
And then some of them say, you know, we were over hiring and now we just have to hit the

22:12.780 --> 22:15.320
brakes on that and just kind of slow it down.

22:15.320 --> 22:19.600
I think the most public one was Elon Musk a couple of weeks ago said he felt, quote,

22:19.600 --> 22:26.440
super bad about the economy and so they're laying off 10% of their non hourly staff.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.680
I also feel super bad.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.000
I mean, he's right though, right?

22:29.000 --> 22:35.780
We like to make fun of Elon's, let's say idiosyncratic way of phrasing things, but he's not wrong

22:35.780 --> 22:36.780
in this case.

22:36.780 --> 22:38.060
I want to play a clip for you.

22:38.060 --> 22:39.060
It's like a minute.

22:39.060 --> 22:40.760
Not even, it's just under a minute.

22:40.760 --> 22:46.480
There's this, this analysis group that has set up like this Slack chat with like 300

22:46.480 --> 22:50.240
different, I don't know, it's hundreds of different businesses where they talk about

22:50.240 --> 22:52.160
what they're doing hiring wise.

22:52.160 --> 22:57.040
So this is him commenting on the trends they've been observing in that chat.

22:57.040 --> 23:03.080
We've run a live conversation with about 650 institutional investors in 30 countries of

23:03.080 --> 23:06.160
buy side hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds.

23:06.160 --> 23:14.880
In the last 10 days, the conversation in the chat has been pretty disturbing around explosive

23:14.880 --> 23:19.720
rescindings, in other words, if you're a young person in the Valley that works for any one

23:19.720 --> 23:25.440
of these private or public tech companies, we're seeing the largest explosion in rescinding

23:25.440 --> 23:30.280
job offers rescinded that we've seen since the dot com bust.

23:30.280 --> 23:33.260
And this is a phenomenal leading indicator for jobs.

23:33.260 --> 23:38.420
We think in the bear trap support, we think the jobs by September go into the negative

23:38.420 --> 23:40.400
column in terms of the non farm payrolls.

23:40.400 --> 23:45.800
I mean, we're just an explosive kind of pullback in job creation and also that's going to lead

23:45.800 --> 23:47.680
to job cuts.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.840
Explosive pullback in job creation.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.480
That's a pretty dramatic statement.

23:52.480 --> 23:56.560
So I guess I just feel like everybody should probably just hunker down and try to, you

23:56.560 --> 24:01.440
know, this does have a lot of, a lot of echoes of the dot com crash.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.880
Financially the majority of my business, I don't mind being open with the very few listeners

24:04.880 --> 24:05.880
we have.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.580
Yikes, that's a lot of people, I'm sorry, holy shit.

24:08.580 --> 24:13.680
The consulting side of the business, I have been getting warnings from folks that, you

24:13.680 --> 24:18.800
know, things are getting tighter, man, and we might not be able to keep up this commitment.

24:18.800 --> 24:23.100
And ironically for me, that's meant the Alice licensing side.

24:23.100 --> 24:26.720
People are more interested in a kind of a productized service.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.720
Does that make sense?

24:27.720 --> 24:33.360
Like a, like a, I won't say SAS cause I know that implies things that I don't want to be

24:33.360 --> 24:34.360
accused of lying.

24:34.360 --> 24:38.180
It's not a SAS, it requires a hand installation still, which.

24:38.180 --> 24:44.200
You knew almost, well, I, I want to phrase this without being too tube and gloom, right?

24:44.200 --> 24:46.760
So I'm trying to be a little careful.

24:46.760 --> 24:54.120
Everybody is suffering from inflation and I know this is a very American perspective,

24:54.120 --> 24:57.240
but I mean, it's funny, I've been trying to hire people.

24:57.240 --> 25:00.420
I have now stopped hiring.

25:00.420 --> 25:09.260
So it, I, I don't, I, I want to avoid gloating here, but I'm, I'm pretty sure that you and

25:09.260 --> 25:11.440
I were right.

25:11.440 --> 25:19.280
And that these inflated wages for people with no experience in dev are going to crater in

25:19.280 --> 25:21.160
the next year, 18 months.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.400
Yeah, we will see.

25:22.400 --> 25:27.280
I was reading into this, trying to figure out, trying to just get more context, try

25:27.280 --> 25:30.800
to broaden my understanding because I feel like I'm really going to school right now

25:30.800 --> 25:32.120
during all of this.

25:32.120 --> 25:37.720
And it really seems like small businesses get hit absolutely the hardest.

25:37.720 --> 25:41.080
And that's where we're seeing the biggest change in employment trends.

25:41.080 --> 25:45.540
We're seeing the biggest change in lending, you know, resending job offers.

25:45.540 --> 25:51.420
We're seeing the biggest hits to small businesses, even more so in small tech businesses.

25:51.420 --> 25:52.420
It's even worse.

25:52.420 --> 25:54.920
The situation is the most dramatic in small tech businesses.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.760
Well guess what you and I are, you know?

25:56.760 --> 25:58.280
So I think that's why we saw it.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.040
We, you know, we were getting hit first.

26:00.040 --> 26:05.220
Well, I mean, for me, I know people get mad or whatever, whatever, but the numbers just

26:05.220 --> 26:11.400
didn't add up for me on what the wages that were being asked were and what I could bill

26:11.400 --> 26:15.120
and knowing the pressures that my customers are under.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.120
I don't know.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.420
I think this is kind of the tippy toe, right?

26:17.420 --> 26:22.720
This is the tip of the iceberg, so to speak of what I mean, I'm going to stand by my original

26:22.720 --> 26:23.720
prediction.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.800
I think we're headed for a, I'm sorry.

26:25.800 --> 26:31.600
I wish we weren't, but I honestly think we're headed for a bloodbath.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.600
It could be.

26:32.600 --> 26:39.200
Here's my thinking is I think that's a scenario that is getting more and more and more likely

26:39.200 --> 26:40.920
as time goes on.

26:40.920 --> 26:46.480
And I think the situation that we find ourselves in is until the macroeconomic situation changes

26:46.480 --> 26:53.760
and that is the Fed is going to steadily increase interest rates with every monthly meeting

26:53.760 --> 26:59.920
and that's going to continue to put more and more and more pressure on the entire financial

26:59.920 --> 27:00.920
system.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.120
The question is, is how long that can continue?

27:03.120 --> 27:04.120
Does it continue?

27:04.120 --> 27:05.120
It can't continue.

27:05.120 --> 27:09.280
Chris, you got to think about the small business owner, not me, not you, but who's taking these

27:09.280 --> 27:14.040
cabbages not to call out anyone a firm, but these cabbages, these on deck, these, you

27:14.040 --> 27:19.800
know, credit card processing loans and so they don't serve people who don't know.

27:19.800 --> 27:23.120
They don't loan to businesses like Chris and I, they loan to like bars that have a lot

27:23.120 --> 27:26.920
of, you know, you have to have a lot of like small credit card transactions.

27:26.920 --> 27:32.960
What they do is they basically buy the right to your first, what is it like the first 80%

27:32.960 --> 27:34.280
of your first 10,000.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.280
It's crazy.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.280
My cousin used to own a bar.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.280
He did one of those.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.360
It's nuts.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.840
Those are the guys who are going to get hip.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.640
That's going to have a ripple on effect for tech.

27:43.640 --> 27:46.080
You can't say it's just tech is my point.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.080
It's not just tech.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.080
Yeah, it will spread.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.080
You're right.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.080
Yes, yes.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.080
Every, you know, bugger thy neighbor.

27:51.080 --> 27:57.160
You know, your, your, your neighbor down the road who owns a bar is struggling because

27:57.160 --> 28:00.480
it turns out that the guys at the steel mill got laid off and they don't want to go buy

28:00.480 --> 28:01.760
beer after work.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.760
There's a lot of second order effects, right?

28:03.760 --> 28:04.760
Right.

28:04.760 --> 28:05.760
Exactly.

28:05.760 --> 28:06.760
It's second, third, fourth order.

28:06.760 --> 28:07.760
I just, I don't know.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.600
Maybe again, I know I'm very negative.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.600
That's what makes it so complex.

28:10.600 --> 28:14.480
And I think that's where I was going is it's kind of like, depending on how long this macro

28:14.480 --> 28:19.520
situation remains the same and how long the fed remains on this policy, depending on how

28:19.520 --> 28:23.240
long that takes, the more and more it spreads and the harder and harder it gets.

28:23.240 --> 28:27.080
Right now it's kind of contained to small businesses and especially small tech businesses,

28:27.080 --> 28:28.080
but not all small.

28:28.080 --> 28:32.140
Like Twitter and Coinbase are certainly large companies, Tesla, it's growing.

28:32.140 --> 28:36.200
And the longer they maintain this policy, the bigger the effect will get.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.760
The deeper the recession gets, the wider it spreads.

28:38.760 --> 28:42.320
Now, what's interesting, Mike, is like I said, I've really been going to school on this kind

28:42.320 --> 28:49.000
of stuff and I found it fascinating how there's a lot of similarities to the inflation situation

28:49.000 --> 28:55.000
in the late 70s in the early 1980s and the way that affected the economy, the way that

28:55.000 --> 28:58.720
affected interest rates, the way the fed tried to respond back then.

28:58.720 --> 29:04.720
And so I have a link in the show notes to about a nine minute YouTube video by Professor

29:04.720 --> 29:08.120
Milton Friedman from 1980.

29:08.120 --> 29:11.680
And it's a beauty because it breaks down the last inflation cycle.

29:11.680 --> 29:15.000
And what I love about it is it goes kind of all the way back to the gold rush to the early

29:15.000 --> 29:19.520
80s and kind of demonstrates in a really kind of slick, intelligent way.

29:19.520 --> 29:23.360
But because it's so old, it's disconnected from all the modern politics.

29:23.360 --> 29:26.800
So it doesn't really it doesn't have like trigger phrases in there.

29:26.800 --> 29:29.480
It really just kind of clinical in a way.

29:29.480 --> 29:30.840
And it's super retro.

29:30.840 --> 29:35.480
I have like a 30 second clip, but the whole thing is worth watching.

29:35.480 --> 29:38.360
And it explains how this is a cyclical cycle.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.320
And we're just in this phase of the cycle right now.

29:41.320 --> 29:44.600
It won't be for forever, but it's going to be for a bit.

29:44.600 --> 29:50.120
And the fact is that most people enjoy the early stages of the inflationary process.

29:50.120 --> 29:55.960
Britain, in the swinging 60s, there was plenty of money around.

29:55.960 --> 30:02.360
Business was brisk, jobs were plentiful, and prices had not yet taken off.

30:02.360 --> 30:10.200
Everybody seemed happy at first, but by the early 70s, as the good times rolled along,

30:10.200 --> 30:13.040
prices started to rise more and more rapidly.

30:13.040 --> 30:16.920
Soon, some of these people were going to lose their jobs.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.920
We have got it.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.120
The party was coming to an end.

30:22.120 --> 30:30.600
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, we're on top of the world.

30:30.600 --> 30:36.200
The story is much the same in the United States, only the process started a little later.

30:36.200 --> 30:41.640
We've had one inflationary party after another, yet we still can't seem to avoid them.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.040
And it's just kind of cyclical.

30:44.040 --> 30:48.920
And we're kind of repeating a lot of the mistakes or the choices we had to make back then.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.720
We have a supply chain shortage, we had an oil shortage back then.

30:51.720 --> 30:56.440
So as long as this overall situation remains, as long as all this pressure and all these

30:56.440 --> 30:59.760
industries remains, the hiring market's going to be tricky.

30:59.760 --> 31:05.800
Now the reality is, we've never seen anything like this in history before because we have

31:05.800 --> 31:11.140
a lot of job reopenings from the lockdowns, so there's still a good amount of hiring happening

31:11.140 --> 31:12.140
in some sectors.

31:12.140 --> 31:18.560
So it's a really kind of new mix of problems, but I will have a link to that full video.

31:18.560 --> 31:23.760
See what I'm concerned about, and not to get too unfiltered here, is that it's not just

31:23.760 --> 31:28.040
going to be bad per se, like straight up like you can't get a job.

31:28.040 --> 31:34.960
I think it's going to be good-ish but unstable, meaning you get a job and in 60 days you might

31:34.960 --> 31:39.000
get laid off or you're going to get a job, but your job is like contingent work, like

31:39.000 --> 31:40.720
part-time work and stuff like that.

31:40.720 --> 31:44.880
I could see a lot of rolling policies and changes kind of moving quick as businesses

31:44.880 --> 31:45.880
try to adapt.

31:45.880 --> 31:51.300
I'm just going to say, and maybe I'm defending us too much a little bit here, it is not the

31:51.300 --> 31:54.520
small businessman who did this to anybody.

31:54.520 --> 32:02.720
No, no, I can tell you, I can't speak for Chris, but you know, Mike, I have personally

32:02.720 --> 32:07.680
taken a few hits for some employees to keep people.

32:07.680 --> 32:13.120
Things are, you know, it's been like six years since I've ever had someone default on me

32:13.120 --> 32:16.400
in terms of like not paying their bill, adjusted.

32:16.400 --> 32:23.960
Things are getting crazy out there, and it's honestly like I was doing a big expansion.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.120
I talked about going back to the office.

32:26.120 --> 32:27.800
That's all gone.

32:27.800 --> 32:33.840
It's the next, I would say two to three years are, you know, not like desperate survival,

32:33.840 --> 32:39.480
but they're just hold it in, keep trucking, if an opportunity prevents itself, take it,

32:39.480 --> 32:43.120
but don't, you know, no more $40,000 Windows phone bets.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.840
That's, by the way, Satya, where's my money?

32:46.840 --> 32:48.840
Yeah, that'd be a good time.

32:48.840 --> 32:51.400
It'd be a great time.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.400
I follow you.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.920
I don't consider this a panic either.

32:54.920 --> 32:59.200
I think it's a shift in the environment, and we'll see.

32:59.200 --> 33:02.680
You know, I am concerned that it's going to leave people unable to support the production

33:02.680 --> 33:05.880
of the shows as much, and I'm worried that it's going to leave sponsors with a less flexible

33:05.880 --> 33:09.080
sponsorship budget, but yeah, I don't think it's going to be the end of the world.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.080
We'll figure it out.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.080
God damn it, Chris.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.080
More robes.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.080
We need robes.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.080
The people demand robes.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.320
Of course, the supply chain is sort of still in shambles, but they do.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.320
I've been thinking about it.

33:17.320 --> 33:18.320
No, no.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.320
We're going to give them robe kits.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.640
We're going to give them some black fiber.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.320
How about a robe NFT?

33:23.320 --> 33:26.520
It's like a token for a robe, a fractional robe token.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.760
Dude, we've talked about this.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.360
How about, you know what?

33:30.360 --> 33:31.360
Show's over.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.360
We're calling Zuck.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.360
Zuck is robing the members.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.360
There you go.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.360
What's Sheryl Sandberg doing?

33:35.360 --> 33:36.360
Yeah, I think she's looking for a new gig, right?

33:36.360 --> 33:37.360
Bring her on board.

33:37.360 --> 33:38.360
Yeah, Senator.

33:38.360 --> 33:39.360
Yeah.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.360
Tailscale.com slash coder.

33:40.360 --> 33:50.400
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices, and of course, this is a

33:50.400 --> 33:52.600
great way to support the show.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.420
Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

33:55.420 --> 33:59.080
You can get it installed on your device in minutes, whatever the device is.

33:59.080 --> 34:04.000
Figures out the firewall stuff, figures out NAT stuff like a boss, I'll add, and then

34:04.000 --> 34:10.200
your devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise encryption protocol.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.360
It doesn't get any better than that.

34:11.360 --> 34:14.680
It literally doesn't get any better than that.

34:14.680 --> 34:19.900
Tailscale is an example of an application and a service I really hoped we'd see built

34:19.900 --> 34:20.900
on top of WireGuard.

34:20.900 --> 34:25.040
It was one of the reasons why we covered WireGuard so extensively in some of our shows, because

34:25.040 --> 34:26.720
there was an opportunity for something like this.

34:26.720 --> 34:31.200
And now, Tailscale has come along, and they've just completely changed the way I view VPNs

34:31.200 --> 34:32.200
now.

34:32.200 --> 34:35.400
And everybody who's tried it out, and our audience is figuring it out quick, and everybody

34:35.400 --> 34:37.480
raves about it that tries it.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.400
It's so much more sturdy.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.080
It figures out the routing so much better.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.360
It handles DNS intelligently.

34:43.360 --> 34:45.000
It works on all your devices.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.200
I'm serious.

34:46.200 --> 34:49.520
If you've got like five minutes to set aside, you could probably get it going on five devices.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.600
It's like a minute per device.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.600
It's ridiculous.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.800
It's so quick to get it set up.

34:53.800 --> 34:58.400
And for me now, I've got all my devices on one flat network with stable IP addresses.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.760
So like, it's funny.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.720
Sometimes their IP address will change on my local LAN, but their Tailscale IP, that's

35:03.720 --> 35:04.720
the same.

35:04.720 --> 35:05.720
You know?

35:05.720 --> 35:08.120
My laptop's Tailscale IP, it's always the same.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.200
I have it running on my VMs.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.200
I have it running on my VPSs.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.960
I have it running on my Raspberry Pis.

35:12.960 --> 35:18.360
It makes it so easy to just get to those web dashboards, grab that data securely, or even

35:18.360 --> 35:20.280
play a LAN game.

35:20.280 --> 35:21.280
It's a lot of fun.

35:21.280 --> 35:26.160
If you work in a business and you've got like a single sign-on system with two-factor, Tailscale

35:26.160 --> 35:27.160
works great with that too.

35:27.160 --> 35:31.200
So go try it for yourself for free up to 20 devices and support the show.

35:31.200 --> 35:34.080
Go to tailscale.com slash coder.

35:34.080 --> 35:37.920
All right, well, let's pick the mood back up.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.860
We do have a couple of more boosts.

35:39.860 --> 35:42.920
This is an extra recording, so there hasn't been much time.

35:42.920 --> 35:43.920
Boost!

35:43.920 --> 35:46.960
But Taki99 boosted in two days ago with a thousand SATs.

35:46.960 --> 35:51.560
With the price of gas going crazy, do you think we'll see another round of work from

35:51.560 --> 35:52.560
home?

35:52.560 --> 35:54.280
I'm considering it.

35:54.280 --> 35:59.240
So if you had a staffer that joined you or was working for you right now and said, hey,

35:59.240 --> 36:03.000
gas is getting too expensive and I got to start working from home, I can't come into

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
the office every day, how would you respond to that?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.300
Unfair question because I totally fold it.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.380
Everybody works from home now.

36:09.380 --> 36:13.280
I know, I know, but I'm just saying like say you just got this office like, you know, Futurecast,

36:13.280 --> 36:16.300
you get this office, everybody starts driving there.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.560
You decided to go forward with it.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.560
But gas keeps going up.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.320
Actually, you guys don't have it that bad in Florida.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.160
I was just looking at the prices.

36:23.160 --> 36:25.400
You don't have it anywhere nearly as bad as we do.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.400
I'm sorry.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.760
We don't have it that bad?

36:27.760 --> 36:28.760
Yeah.

36:28.760 --> 36:29.760
What are you paying?

36:29.760 --> 36:30.760
Six dollars.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.800
We just hit about six dollars over here a gallon.

36:32.800 --> 36:33.800
Me?

36:33.800 --> 36:34.800
Where do you live?

36:34.800 --> 36:36.560
The Soviet Republic of Washington state?

36:36.560 --> 36:37.560
The West Coast.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.360
The West Coast is literally the most expensive.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.540
At least it's not California, I tell myself.

36:41.540 --> 36:45.320
But if you look at triple A gas prices and you look at their map of.

36:45.320 --> 36:49.000
Yeah, I paid, I got today, I paid 480.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.360
I know you're in like the cheap area.

36:51.360 --> 36:52.640
I'm looking at it.

36:52.640 --> 36:53.640
That's cheap?

36:53.640 --> 36:54.640
What are you nuts?

36:54.640 --> 36:57.360
When I started driving, gas was like a buck eighty.

36:57.360 --> 37:02.800
Oh, man, for just a brief moment in time when Junior was in office and I was driving, gas

37:02.800 --> 37:05.520
was under a buck just for a brief moment in time.

37:05.520 --> 37:06.520
So yeah.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.440
Can we all just pour one out for W?

37:08.440 --> 37:11.800
You go, so folks at home, if you go to gas prices dot triple A dot com.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.200
What am I looking at right now?

37:13.200 --> 37:15.280
This is triple A gas prices.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.800
So it's 555, 555, effectively.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.800
Yeah, yeah.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.720
In my county, it's 595, 594.

37:21.720 --> 37:22.720
I've seen six.

37:22.720 --> 37:23.720
Dude.

37:23.720 --> 37:24.720
Yeah.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.640
I thought you lived right near Alaska.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.800
I heard you could see Russia from your friend's house.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.960
Yeah, that's your other friend, Palin.

37:31.960 --> 37:35.780
Yeah, but like I said, just be glad you're not in California because there's places where

37:35.780 --> 37:39.740
it's seven bucks a gallon, six bucks a gallon in California now.

37:39.740 --> 37:43.280
And I just want to say that Ron DeSantis.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.280
Is he going to lower gas prices?

37:44.280 --> 37:47.400
Oh, he's really pissed off about the books of my kid's school.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.400
I don't know.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.400
Oh, yeah.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.400
Yeah, yeah.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.400
That is true.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.400
Back on task.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.400
So you got this office.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.120
You finally got this office again after the pandemic and everything.

37:56.120 --> 37:59.560
And then somebody says, although if I'm in Washington state, I'm pretty sure I can't afford

37:59.560 --> 38:00.560
this office.

38:00.560 --> 38:01.560
But keep going.

38:01.560 --> 38:02.560
Yeah.

38:02.560 --> 38:03.560
No kidding, dude.

38:03.560 --> 38:04.560
That's a lot of money.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.560
You'd have to let them.

38:05.560 --> 38:06.560
Right.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.560
You'd have to let them work from home.

38:07.560 --> 38:08.560
I'm going to derail you again.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.560
Lady Jubes.

38:09.560 --> 38:10.560
Is that diesel?

38:10.560 --> 38:11.560
No, thank God it's gas.

38:11.560 --> 38:12.560
Thank God.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.560
Jeez.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.600
Because diesel down here is crazy.

38:15.600 --> 38:21.480
Diesel's like, although I don't know, relative to what God knows what it's crazy here.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.480
Yeah.

38:22.480 --> 38:23.480
OK, OK, go on.

38:23.480 --> 38:26.440
So if I got this office, you'd have to write, especially if you're in the West Coast.

38:26.440 --> 38:27.440
Yeah, it's unaffordable.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.440
Right.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.200
Either you'd have to subsidize them, raise their wages or do something.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.200
It's unaffordable.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.640
So I think I think tacky might be onto something here.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.060
I think this could be another work from home boom.

38:37.060 --> 38:42.960
If I was a, you know, small businessman whose business was commercial real estate, I would

38:42.960 --> 38:44.760
be making lots of deals right now.

38:44.760 --> 38:45.760
Right.

38:45.760 --> 38:50.520
I would not be playing hardball because don't want to talk about it right now.

38:50.520 --> 38:57.000
But I've been talking to a small startup that does development automation or not automation,

38:57.000 --> 39:02.960
but development assistance and collaboration software for remote teams on Mac and Linux.

39:02.960 --> 39:06.720
Ironically, not Windows, which I guess kind of makes sense.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.720
In what world is business not using Windows?

39:08.720 --> 39:10.380
I need to travel to this reality.

39:10.380 --> 39:14.760
They say they're working on Windows, but Mac is so Mac is production ready.

39:14.760 --> 39:17.520
Linux is like, do you want to be a trailblazer?

39:17.520 --> 39:19.920
I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever.

39:19.920 --> 39:23.240
If this stuff works, we're going to be doing a month pilot.

39:23.240 --> 39:27.040
I actually don't think there's a real reason for the office.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.320
I may eliminate my existing space.

39:29.320 --> 39:30.320
Wow.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.560
Which my landlord is a very aggressive, very gun toting Southern gentleman.

39:33.560 --> 39:34.560
So there should be fun.

39:34.560 --> 39:37.060
Does he have a mustache that he twirls?

39:37.060 --> 39:41.800
He doesn't, but he's really, really mad about quote, all the millennials who don't think

39:41.800 --> 39:44.280
they need an office.

39:44.280 --> 39:48.520
Half the building is now vacant because people have defaulted or got out of business.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.520
Maybe he's the common thread.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.520
Did he think of that ever?

39:50.520 --> 39:51.520
Right.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.520
And I tried to make a deal with him.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.600
Like, yo man, I'm kind of with you.

39:54.600 --> 39:59.120
I want to make a deal, but you're not getting $22 a square foot.

39:59.120 --> 40:04.720
So let's, let's, uh, maybe like 10.

40:04.720 --> 40:09.720
He was like, you're insane and I said, cool.

40:09.720 --> 40:10.720
Good luck with that.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.720
Yeah, really.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.720
And that's how that conversation ended.

40:13.720 --> 40:20.960
Ask not what your podcasts can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.760
Curled 37 boosted in three days ago with 2000 sats.

40:23.760 --> 40:27.320
Our last boost today said, did Mike drop a bomb and never follow up?

40:27.320 --> 40:29.200
I could have sworn he said he was getting married.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.200
Did that happen?

40:30.200 --> 40:31.640
Is a congrats boost in order?

40:31.640 --> 40:39.200
I am getting married on October the 21st and October wedding.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.200
Nice.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.280
That's probably wonderful down there.

40:41.280 --> 40:42.280
Yep.

40:42.280 --> 40:43.280
Her name, her name is Mariah.

40:43.280 --> 40:48.400
She's in fact, if you follow my Twitter, you've seen, you may have seen a picture of her and

40:48.400 --> 40:50.960
I together today for the birthday.

40:50.960 --> 40:51.960
Good lady.

40:51.960 --> 40:56.960
So, and, uh, as a step parent, cause this is code already was really a dad therapy session,

40:56.960 --> 40:57.960
right?

40:57.960 --> 41:01.760
We don't, we don't even talk about computers anymore.

41:01.760 --> 41:06.480
Um, I'm stepping right up to the plate with a 14 year old stepdaughter because when you're,

41:06.480 --> 41:10.080
when you're going to do it, you just go for it, you just go.

41:10.080 --> 41:14.940
It's well, she's actually the only thing I don't like about my stepdaughter.

41:14.940 --> 41:18.080
She doesn't listen to the show is tick tock.

41:18.080 --> 41:19.080
I do not understand.

41:19.080 --> 41:20.080
I know.

41:20.080 --> 41:23.760
Can someone explain the allure of tick tock to me?

41:23.760 --> 41:28.800
She shows me tech talks and I'm like, oh, well I guess that young woman is a talented

41:28.800 --> 41:29.800
dancer.

41:29.800 --> 41:30.800
Kind of.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.520
Why was that 10 seconds long?

41:32.520 --> 41:37.320
Like if you're going to Dan, like if you're going to have a song, why would you not dance

41:37.320 --> 41:39.180
to the full song?

41:39.180 --> 41:40.880
You don't need to, you know, it's tick tock.

41:40.880 --> 41:41.880
You get the idea.

41:41.880 --> 41:43.280
Well, why don't we do tick tock?

41:43.280 --> 41:48.820
It could just be me cursing at people I employ for like 10 seconds or like refusing to fill

41:48.820 --> 41:52.080
out the tax forms, which is a more common problem than you think.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.880
We'd be proper influencers.

41:53.880 --> 41:56.440
Don't you want to be an influencer?

41:56.440 --> 41:57.440
I want to be an influencer.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.000
Come on, we could influence things.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.120
I mean, does that get me more money?

42:02.120 --> 42:03.400
Cause I like money.

42:03.400 --> 42:04.400
Yeah.

42:04.400 --> 42:08.560
You get influencer sponsorships so you can influence people to buy their projects.

42:08.560 --> 42:12.540
Would that get me a robe in blue, blue robe?

42:12.540 --> 42:15.620
That's a good that blue robe.

42:15.620 --> 42:22.840
We got a couple of thank you boosts, 500 sats from JT and 3690 sats from Cospeland.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.600
They just, they just said thanks.

42:24.600 --> 42:25.600
So you know what?

42:25.600 --> 42:26.600
I say thanks to them.

42:26.600 --> 42:31.840
If you'd like to send us a boost to go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com or

42:31.840 --> 42:37.260
you can use the Breeze app at breez.technology and you don't have to switch podcast apps,

42:37.260 --> 42:39.960
but you know, we're going to do a, I think that's just, we're going to kind of wrap it

42:39.960 --> 42:41.840
up a little early so you can go celebrate your birthday.

42:41.840 --> 42:42.840
Sure.

42:42.840 --> 42:43.840
I don't care.

42:43.840 --> 42:44.840
And we just recorded.

42:44.840 --> 42:48.000
We got, if you didn't hear your feedback or your boost in this episode, be sure you caught

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
last week's episode.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.140
Cause I tried to spread them out between the two shows.

42:52.140 --> 42:56.920
And if you're a Coder QA member, we got some new features in the future that we're working

42:56.920 --> 42:57.920
on for you.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.720
You can go sign up at coderqa.co.

42:59.720 --> 43:00.720
That's the membership for this show.

43:00.720 --> 43:05.200
You can add free version of the show soon, a live version of the show, but also it's

43:05.200 --> 43:08.600
just a nice way to support the show and keep us going.

43:08.600 --> 43:09.600
Let's see.

43:09.600 --> 43:13.320
Should we send anybody anywhere special for your gosh darn birthday?

43:13.320 --> 43:14.880
You got any special wishes?

43:14.880 --> 43:15.880
Yeah.

43:15.880 --> 43:16.880
You know what?

43:16.880 --> 43:18.220
Give a, you know, don't, don't do anything for my birthday.

43:18.220 --> 43:22.480
If you want to do something, go give like a buck to the covenant house or St. Jude or

43:22.480 --> 43:23.480
something.

43:23.480 --> 43:24.480
That's it.

43:24.480 --> 43:25.480
You can, you could write in there.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.680
This is from Mike remotely or something like that.

43:27.680 --> 43:28.680
Right?

43:28.680 --> 43:29.680
Like that.

43:29.680 --> 43:30.680
Don't even do that.

43:30.680 --> 43:31.680
Say it's from Jar Jar.

43:31.680 --> 43:34.680
Jar Jar is a f*****g angel.

43:34.680 --> 43:35.680
Yeah.

43:35.680 --> 43:38.680
We almost made it without him coming up for the whole episode.

43:38.680 --> 43:39.680
You were, you were this close.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.240
You were like right there.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.240
All right.

43:42.240 --> 43:46.440
So the, uh, the old podcast is at coder.show links for what we talked about today, coder.show

43:46.440 --> 43:47.680
slash four 71.

43:47.680 --> 43:52.440
Like that YouTube video, you can watch the live versions over at Jupiter dot tube.

43:52.440 --> 43:56.200
We stream live on Mondays usually, but we will not be live next Monday.

43:56.200 --> 43:57.560
Well actually, no, yes we will.

43:57.560 --> 43:58.560
Oh man.

43:58.560 --> 44:00.240
By the time you're hearing this, we're back.

44:00.240 --> 44:01.880
You time traveling sneaky.

44:01.880 --> 44:02.880
Yeah.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.280
No, we're, we're live next Monday.

44:04.280 --> 44:06.280
The following Monday I'm gone.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.280
Right.

44:07.280 --> 44:10.600
Wait, no, well we'll figure it out, but either way they'll be showing this up.

44:10.600 --> 44:11.600
It's great.

44:11.600 --> 44:12.600
Yeah.

44:12.600 --> 44:13.600
There are excess shows.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.600
Yeah.

44:14.600 --> 44:15.600
It's still going to be fine.

44:15.600 --> 44:19.200
But either way, if you just subscribe, you get it, but Jupiter out tube has it live.

44:19.200 --> 44:23.360
If it's live, by the way, we need to do a quarterly, but I know, I know that'll happen

44:23.360 --> 44:24.360
though.

44:24.360 --> 44:25.360
It'll happen.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.360
Thursday, Thursday.

44:26.360 --> 44:27.360
All right.

44:27.360 --> 44:28.360
See you back here soon.

44:28.360 --> 44:45.120
Take care.
