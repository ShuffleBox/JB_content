This is Coder Radio, episode 421 for July 5th, 2021.

00:15.760 --> 00:20.320
Hello friend and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show taking a pragmatic look at

00:20.320 --> 00:24.320
the art and the business of software development in the world of technology.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.540
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

00:26.540 --> 00:32.100

00:38.540 --> 00:44.320
My name is Chris and sitting there in his podcasting position is our prominent host,

00:44.320 --> 00:45.320
Mr. Dominic.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.320
Hello, Mike.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.320
What up, dogs?

00:47.320 --> 00:48.320
Misa here.

00:48.320 --> 00:51.400
Misa ready to throw bomb bombs at all your MacBooks?

00:51.400 --> 00:53.400
Pew, pew, pew.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.400
Oh, oh, man.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.400
Oh, boy.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.400
What did you do?

00:56.400 --> 00:57.400
What did you do?

00:57.400 --> 00:58.400
I topped you so hard.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.400
I- Okay.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.720
Do you know on certain websites that means something that you don't?

01:03.720 --> 01:04.720
Easy sale, right?

01:04.720 --> 01:05.720
Easy.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.720
Right.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.720
Right.

01:07.720 --> 01:08.720
I'll slow down there.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.860
Um, you know, cause I know you've like, you've, you've spilled a couple silly cups of a small

01:11.860 --> 01:13.200
beverages here and there.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
Gin.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.200
Yeah.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.200
On a laptop.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.080
Well, I decided that if I was going to outdo you, that I'd have to outdo you by about 17

01:20.080 --> 01:21.080
gallons.

01:21.080 --> 01:25.920
And, uh, over the weekend I spilled 17 gallons of water all over all of my electronics that

01:25.920 --> 01:26.920
I have at home.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.920
Um, gallons?

01:27.920 --> 01:28.920
Gallons.

01:28.920 --> 01:29.920
Yeah.

01:29.920 --> 01:30.920
How?

01:30.920 --> 01:31.920
How?

01:31.920 --> 01:34.640
I was packing up for a little, a little trip, a little road trip.

01:34.640 --> 01:38.960
And I went around the, the place and I picked up every electronics I have and I put it in

01:38.960 --> 01:40.220
this cloth basket.

01:40.220 --> 01:46.200
Every game controller, every like USB-C charging brick, every, uh, I had a couple of Amazon

01:46.200 --> 01:48.400
firetables that I used to control my automation system.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.520
I put those in there too cause they were loose.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.520
Everything in there.

01:51.520 --> 01:55.160
And then because I was going down the road, I put it in the sink and I didn't, I didn't

01:55.160 --> 01:58.480
because I didn't want it to spill and then I, and then yada, yada, yada.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.480
I got super distracted.

01:59.480 --> 02:03.760
A couple of things came up at the last minute and I forgot to turn off my water pump.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.760
Oh, okay.

02:05.760 --> 02:10.800
I must've hit a bump and I have this super old like 2013 Mac book that has Arch Linux

02:10.800 --> 02:12.360
on it and it's a heavy tank.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.360
Of course it has Arch.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.360
Yeah.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.360
Yeah.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.360
By the way, it has Arch.

02:16.360 --> 02:22.400
And so that thing slid off the counter and hit the sink faucet and turned it on and I

02:22.400 --> 02:25.880
didn't know cause I'm driving and no one else is in the rig with me.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.600
And so I'm pulling in to get gas and I hear like the waves at the ocean.

02:29.600 --> 02:30.920
I'm like, what?

02:30.920 --> 02:34.740
And I look back behind me and my entire life goes slow-mo.

02:34.740 --> 02:38.720
As I'm coming into the gas station, I'm kind of going downhill into the parking lot.

02:38.720 --> 02:44.160
A wave of water comes rushing at me down the center of the RV and of course it spills into

02:44.160 --> 02:49.360
the stairwell and it's just all of this water that had been collecting back there, pooling

02:49.360 --> 02:51.160
up in my electronics.

02:51.160 --> 02:56.120
I get back there, man, and the basket that I'd put everything in was a bathtub.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.240
Everything's floating in there.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.240
It was all gone.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.240
I'm sorry.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.240
That's like a lot of water.

03:00.240 --> 03:06.660
And I had my Mac book, I snuck cause I brought my Mac book with me and I snuck that under

03:06.660 --> 03:10.440
the countertop and that also got wrecked.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.600
So the Mac book turned on the water and then it got water all over it and it's so that

03:14.600 --> 03:18.920
got just, that actually interestingly enough is turning on and works.

03:18.920 --> 03:22.480
I turned it on this morning after days of letting it dry and some water got under the

03:22.480 --> 03:23.480
screen.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.640
I can see some discoloration where the water got under the screen, but the machine's actually

03:26.640 --> 03:27.640
working.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.640
Well, you know why, right?

03:28.640 --> 03:31.440
They had to, they had to fortify them after you bought a few.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.440
Right.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.360
I've been doing this for over a decade.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.360
They're ready for me.

03:35.360 --> 03:40.720
I go to the genius bar, they take the 19 year old out of the genius bar and they're like,

03:40.720 --> 03:42.260
the guy's 45.

03:42.260 --> 03:46.080
He looks at me and says, what do you got, son?

03:46.080 --> 03:48.160
And I said, well, here's the deal.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.760
I was at Burning Man.

03:49.760 --> 03:57.680
Let me tell you something, let me tell you something, there's no way.

03:57.680 --> 04:03.960
I mean like, okay, 17 gallons of water is enough to, no one's going to survive that,

04:03.960 --> 04:04.960
right?

04:04.960 --> 04:05.960
I spill a martini.

04:05.960 --> 04:06.960
I'm sorry.

04:06.960 --> 04:07.960
Yeah.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.760
I'm a little pissed off right now.

04:09.760 --> 04:13.840
I spill a martini and everybody's dunking on me on Twitter for being, you know, drunk

04:13.840 --> 04:16.800
old Dean Martin spilling drinks on his laptop.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.720
You you're like, no, no, not a drink.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.640
How about 17 gallons of water?

04:21.640 --> 04:22.640
Yep.

04:22.640 --> 04:23.640
I mean, come on dude.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.640
I was so upset.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.560
And of course I was going out camping and I needed that water too.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.040
So it meant the entire camping trip, we were like out of 20 gallons of water.

04:32.040 --> 04:38.560
Oh, that was your, that was your reserve, dude, what are you doing?

04:38.560 --> 04:42.760
I, you're never supposed to leave the pump on and you know, that laptop got left on the

04:42.760 --> 04:44.160
counter cause we were in a big rush.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.840
I was trying to get out to the woods so I could record a podcast, go figure.

04:46.840 --> 04:51.480
And so I was rushing and I, I just, I made the, it's just the biggest mistake ever.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.160
Oh, good times.

04:53.160 --> 04:57.400
So yeah, 17 gallons, you have some catching up to do.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.400
Do I though?

04:58.400 --> 05:02.800
I mean, if we went back to, you know.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.080
You may have me still beat on number of machines.

05:05.080 --> 05:09.320
I just want to say this is a MacBook Air that I'm doing this show on because by the way,

05:09.320 --> 05:13.200
if anybody mentions sound quality being better, it's cause I'm on Mac tonight, not Linux.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.840
But I do have nice things to say about Cosmic later.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.840
Oh, okay.

05:17.840 --> 05:18.840
We'll get there.

05:18.840 --> 05:19.840
We'll get there.

05:19.840 --> 05:20.840
We'll get there.

05:20.840 --> 05:21.840
That's what, that's what I tell all the women I sleep with.

05:21.840 --> 05:22.840
But you know what?

05:22.840 --> 05:23.840
It'll happen.

05:23.840 --> 05:24.840
It'll happen.

05:24.840 --> 05:29.520
It doesn't really matter because most programmers are going to lose their jobs anyways, at least

05:29.520 --> 05:32.420
according to Maxi Contiere.

05:32.420 --> 05:36.800
He says that, I'm almost sure that's not how you say his name, but I'm pretty sure I looked

05:36.800 --> 05:37.800
it up.

05:37.800 --> 05:38.800
I looked it up.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.800
Contiere?

05:39.800 --> 05:40.800
Yeah.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.800
Okay buddy.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.680
You didn't have to bring attention to his weird last name though.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.400
I really did though.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.400
You did.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.400
You did.

05:49.400 --> 05:53.580
Anyway, so Mr. Contiere says that instead of programming computers directly, we will

05:53.580 --> 05:58.600
ask them to create the thing and they will do it for us, like in Star Trek.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.920
And as such, computer engineers and computer scientists will essentially need to become

06:02.920 --> 06:08.720
more like business engineers and business scientists and design the models of businesses

06:08.720 --> 06:11.960
that will employ these computers that will do the programming for us.

06:11.960 --> 06:12.960
I'm sorry.

06:12.960 --> 06:13.960
Business scientists?

06:13.960 --> 06:14.960
Mm-hmm.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.960
Yeah.

06:15.960 --> 06:16.960
Be a business scientist.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.760
Don't you want to be a business scientist?

06:19.760 --> 06:21.880
I think we are business scientists actually.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.240
You and I right now.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.240
Business?

06:24.240 --> 06:26.080
It's weird because you're right, but I can't tell you why you're right.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.360
Oh, I love those kind of.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.440
That's beginning in three months.

06:29.440 --> 06:35.360
So I actually agree with this guy's article, but I think he's kind of a D bag in a lot

06:35.360 --> 06:36.360
of ways.

06:36.360 --> 06:41.520
One, he compares C sharp to low-level languages.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.460
C sharp is not a low-level language in any universe.

06:45.460 --> 06:52.760
Let me introduce you to assembler or C and maybe C++.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.440
It's not the same thing.

06:54.440 --> 06:58.800
I think what he means is statically typed languages and he's kind of, and he's got a

06:58.800 --> 07:03.520
master's in comp sci and I get what he's saying, like the structures, blah, blah, blah, the

07:03.520 --> 07:05.820
computer, the compiler, whatever should do it for you.

07:05.820 --> 07:11.320
But ultimately, I don't know, we have enough memory now that math doesn't matter until

07:11.320 --> 07:12.320
it does.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.800
And when it does, that's where you make money.

07:14.800 --> 07:19.360
I'm in this weird position of I'm the one who put this in the show notes because I actually

07:19.360 --> 07:22.140
agree with him to a point.

07:22.140 --> 07:27.880
But I think his whole thing about like, we're just not going to dictate specs to a computer

07:27.880 --> 07:30.440
and here's why.

07:30.440 --> 07:35.920
My job of owning a software development company where we have products and we do consulting

07:35.920 --> 07:39.480
is figuring out what the goddamn hell the customer wants.

07:39.480 --> 07:40.480
No kidding.

07:40.480 --> 07:45.640
If I can't figure that out, how am I going to dictate that in terms a computer can understand?

07:45.640 --> 07:48.960
Well I think his thinking is that they'll be so intelligent.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.320
And you know what's got him on this track, right, is that GitHub co-pilot.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.720
That's what's got everybody thinking about this.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.940
I have many thoughts on that, which is also why I put it in the notes.

07:57.940 --> 08:02.580
Some people are saying that, oh, it's a GPL violator because they trained it on GPL code,

08:02.580 --> 08:07.920
but they're not making co-pilot itself available as a GPL product, which, yeah.

08:07.920 --> 08:14.840
Before we swing into co-pilot, see, I'm leery about questioning this gentleman's argument

08:14.840 --> 08:21.080
only because, you know, who am I, a guy with a middy full lit degree of hype?

08:21.080 --> 08:26.000
But the hard part of my job is not writing code, which is where he and I agree, right?

08:26.000 --> 08:31.480
The hard part is my customers change their minds all the goddamn time.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.200
And they don't even really understand what they're asking for, and I'm not saying that

08:34.200 --> 08:35.200
to be rude.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.440
No, no, you're absolutely correct.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.280
They don't do this kind of stuff on a day to day basis, so they don't even know how

08:40.280 --> 08:42.360
to articulate the requirements.

08:42.360 --> 08:47.720
And then to say nothing about, they always fail to understand the issues of scope creep

08:47.720 --> 08:53.000
and changing goalposts mid-project, like it's natural human instinct.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.480
We did an iPad presentation.

08:55.480 --> 08:59.720
We did it in landscape because it's an iPad, and they were a media company.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.760
I won't say the name because I don't know that I can.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.760
Disney.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.760
No, it's not Disney.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.200
And then at the end of the presentation, they're like, that's awesome.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.600
Great job, boys.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.760
So what does it look like in portrait?

09:13.760 --> 09:19.720
Now this is back in the iOS, like five days where there was no auto lit.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.720
Right.

09:20.720 --> 09:21.720
Yeah.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.640
You never know what the customer wants.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.640
Just like my car.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.440
I would tattoo that on my ass.

09:27.440 --> 09:32.320
I think maybe that's a continuous point is that you you will manage the business and

09:32.320 --> 09:35.360
the relationships and then provide the input to the computer.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.360
And then it will.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.360
Right.

09:37.360 --> 09:41.720
But my argument to that is you as the human putting the input to the computer do not actually

09:41.720 --> 09:43.400
know what the customer really wants.

09:43.400 --> 09:47.200
You don't know it until you ship them something and they tell you that they don't like it

09:47.200 --> 09:49.440
whether there is something missing.

09:49.440 --> 09:54.240
Then again, if the computer is doing the programming, if it has to refactor, well, at least it doesn't

09:54.240 --> 09:55.600
cost a bunch of man hours.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.160
Well, I mean, if the silence kill us all.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.160
Great.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.800
I mean, yeah, they're going to start developing for themselves is what's going to happen.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.560
Can I get the cute Cylon starting here, starting with Copilot?

10:05.560 --> 10:07.560
You know, they're going to use Copilot to do it.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.480
You know, Copilot has those cute green ears.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.480
Oh, geez.

10:10.480 --> 10:16.120
OK, so what's this about it completing code with suggestions that include swearing?

10:16.120 --> 10:22.080
Yeah, so it's sort of just took in a bunch of code on public repositories and the Doom

10:22.080 --> 10:28.360
repository, the video game Doom for folks who are doing to now classic PC game.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.680
It's great, although it sucks by today's standards.

10:31.680 --> 10:36.000
Yeah, it just regurgitated the entire code.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.280
So even the comments, yeah, even the comments for the copyright, I'm watching a video of

10:41.280 --> 10:42.680
it as you talk about it.

10:42.680 --> 10:48.080
And even just the the actual line for line copyright notice that was in the comments

10:48.080 --> 10:51.000
of the code is recreated.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.160
That's remarkable.

10:52.160 --> 10:56.120
I would not expect it to be reproducing code at that at that level.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.120
Really?

10:57.120 --> 10:58.120
I would.

10:58.120 --> 11:02.280
I mean, any anybody who's done ML understands that's just pattern matching, right?

11:02.280 --> 11:05.720
And if there is an exact pattern, if you type in the exact function name, it's going to

11:05.720 --> 11:07.480
give you the exact code back.

11:07.480 --> 11:08.480
Right.

11:08.480 --> 11:11.560
Yeah, I suppose I guess it does make sense on a technical level, but it just seems like

11:11.560 --> 11:15.840
it's something they would have tried to avoid from a product level.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.840
But how?

11:16.840 --> 11:17.840
Yeah, maybe they can't.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.840
Maybe they can't.

11:18.840 --> 11:24.120
I mean, what's the mechanism to avoid that without, you know, the the people dunking

11:24.120 --> 11:28.280
on this, the code that they regurgitated actually works.

11:28.280 --> 11:33.840
Maybe it's, you know, out of style today, whatever best practices, but it works because

11:33.840 --> 11:36.120
it works in 1991.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.240
Have they waded into copyright territory issues here with this?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.000
Like it seems I'm not an attorney.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.640
It seems like a gray area.

11:42.640 --> 11:47.240
I kind of was laughing earlier when when people were saying maybe it's a GPL violation.

11:47.240 --> 11:52.280
But if it's actually if it's going to reproduce GPL code, oh, kids, no one gives a fuck about

11:52.280 --> 11:53.280
the GPL.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.280
But basically, that was the argument.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.400
It was like, ah, don't be a big pain in the neck.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.520
Nobody's going to like you if you go so extreme.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.520
Let me ask you a question.

12:00.520 --> 12:05.800
Who who has enough money is going to sue GitHub, i.e. Microsoft, for a GPL violation?

12:05.800 --> 12:09.120
Nobody, because Microsoft pays the bills at the Linux Foundation now, right?

12:09.120 --> 12:11.720
So that's why the GPL is a fucking joke.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.680
And everybody should go to Apache or BSD.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.400
Free software is ridiculous.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.760
Such installments and asshole.

12:17.760 --> 12:18.760
Let's just move on.

12:18.760 --> 12:23.320
Well, Google may be starting their decline, according to Mike from Butte.

12:23.320 --> 12:27.480
He says, I like your take on Google CEO taking time to make decisions.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.940
However, I think I disagree.

12:29.940 --> 12:31.960
Google is suffering from their own success.

12:31.960 --> 12:36.540
Most successful companies go through this Xerox, IBM, Microsoft and now Google.

12:36.540 --> 12:40.440
They start out small with laser vision focus and ninja like agility.

12:40.440 --> 12:44.040
This is why Google was able to eat Microsoft's lunch back in the day.

12:44.040 --> 12:47.200
It was large, arrogant, complacent, sluggish.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
And they even drank their own Kool-Aid.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.160
Are you describing my mom right now?

12:50.160 --> 12:53.160
I think I was just describing Apple.

12:53.160 --> 12:57.760
Oh, yeah, listen, you can insult my mom, but not Apple, buddy.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.760
Come on.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.640
Calm down, Grist.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.940
Mike from Butte goes on to say, Google is at this point now.

13:03.940 --> 13:07.480
They're spending more time protecting their kingdom than they are innovating.

13:07.480 --> 13:11.280
Sure they're large now, but some company is going to come out of nowhere and make them

13:11.280 --> 13:12.280
irrelevant overnight.

13:12.280 --> 13:17.880
He says, look at Blackberry and what Apple did with the iPhone.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.800
Sure, Google will probably be around for decades, but they're on their way out.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.920
They're worth one trillion now, but they're already starting their decline.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.420
Just my two cents.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.720
Not a chance.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.460
OK, so Google has monopoly power.

13:32.460 --> 13:37.240
And if if we had a guy from Yelp on here, he'd tell us exactly how painful it is to

13:37.240 --> 13:39.240
compete with Google.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.280
It's not the same thing.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.080
Blackberry did not have ecosystem control.

13:43.080 --> 13:47.760
Google has ecosystem control, and that ecosystem is everybody who searches the Internet.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.760
Right.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.600
And don't forget, some of Google's properties are some of the most valuable ad real estate

13:51.600 --> 13:52.600
in the world.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.600
So if they want to promote Chrome there or another Google product, they have Google search

13:56.600 --> 13:57.600
to advertise.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.600
Chrome?

13:58.600 --> 13:59.600
Who gives a fuck about Chrome?

13:59.600 --> 14:00.600
How about just search ads?

14:00.600 --> 14:01.600
Yeah.

14:01.600 --> 14:09.520
Android is like somebody's pet project where he's NSFW, masturbating because he doesn't

14:09.520 --> 14:13.340
like the iPhone, which, by the way, iPhone is better.

14:13.340 --> 14:14.520
I guess I kind of agree.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.600
It's like I think you kind of agree.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.080
I think you're a closet Apple fan.

14:19.080 --> 14:25.520
I like the idea that that Apple and Google and Amazon will only have so much time in

14:25.520 --> 14:27.960
the sun and eventually they will be eclipsed.

14:27.960 --> 14:28.960
Not possible.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.520
I like that idea, though.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.320
But Google has such a lock on the Internet advertising market.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.320
I agree.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.060
And don't forget infrastructure.

14:37.060 --> 14:38.060
Just infrastructure, dude.

14:38.060 --> 14:40.120
They're in DNS, they're in hosting.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.120
Yeah, dude.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.200
I know Google apps for business.

14:44.200 --> 14:51.800
I mean, Chrome OS and the schools like they are the the the big five tech companies are

14:51.800 --> 14:55.360
at a level and a scale like I don't think humanity has ever witnessed.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.600
These are nation sized companies now.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.880
No, they're not nations.

14:58.880 --> 14:59.880
They're superpowers.

14:59.880 --> 15:06.280
Yeah, they're not like, you know, no disrespect to Nigeria, but they're not Nigeria, right?

15:06.280 --> 15:11.400
They're USSR, Soviet or Soviet Union, the United States, right?

15:11.400 --> 15:13.120
They are not little countries.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.640
They are.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.360
I'm sorry, but.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.880
It's just it's the Brits might say it's bollocks.

15:20.880 --> 15:21.880
It's nonsense.

15:21.880 --> 15:22.880
Yeah.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.360
Google has a lock on advertising.

15:24.360 --> 15:28.560
I deleted my Facebook account recently or a while ago.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.560
Three weeks ago.

15:29.560 --> 15:30.560
Oh, congratulations.

15:30.560 --> 15:31.560
Nope.

15:31.560 --> 15:36.920
It also deleted my business Facebook page.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.280
Or it suspended it.

15:39.280 --> 15:44.980
My traffic to my business page has been down 82 percent.

15:44.980 --> 15:46.020
That's not a made up number.

15:46.020 --> 15:48.920
That's from Fathom, the analytics company we use.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.520
Man, that is bad.

15:50.520 --> 15:56.800
I now need to re activate my personal Facebook account, right, so that we can get in, turn

15:56.800 --> 16:01.440
the business page back on and start posting in for the business or else I lose the traffic

16:01.440 --> 16:02.440
to the business.

16:02.440 --> 16:08.400
And Chris, I know you know that traffic to your business page, that's I mean, that's

16:08.400 --> 16:12.240
I think that's exactly the situation I have going on with my Facebook account and the

16:12.240 --> 16:17.420
J.B. and I just haven't even wanted to try to figure out how to fix it because it means

16:17.420 --> 16:21.160
spending more time on Facebook, you know, so it's like I've kept my account around,

16:21.160 --> 16:25.800
but I I don't think I've posted anything in three years or something, but it's still there.

16:25.800 --> 16:30.680
I deactivated mine for personal reasons, and I did not realize that that would also prevent

16:30.680 --> 16:34.080
me from accessing my business account.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.080
And that's.

16:35.080 --> 16:38.880
Oh, boy, that's yeah, that stinks, man.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.620
That's that's a hard lock, right?

16:40.620 --> 16:41.620
That's yeah.

16:41.620 --> 16:42.620
Yeah.

16:42.620 --> 16:46.640
The other thing that the other thing that struck me just yesterday is it was the Fourth

16:46.640 --> 16:53.360
of July yesterday and we were driving out to this diner that's out in out near the spot

16:53.360 --> 16:58.000
we were staying in the woods and we looked it up on Google Maps and Google Maps said

16:58.000 --> 16:59.280
the business was closed.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.400
I said, that doesn't seem right.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.240
They normally are open today.

17:04.240 --> 17:08.720
And so we kept going and we show up and sure enough, they were still open.

17:08.720 --> 17:14.520
And I thought to myself, like, how many people looked at Google Maps and it said this place

17:14.520 --> 17:17.240
is closed and they just said, I will go somewhere else.

17:17.240 --> 17:22.480
And this small, tiny little diner that's ran by a family that doesn't know anything about

17:22.480 --> 17:26.760
their Google listing or Google Maps entry has no power over that.

17:26.760 --> 17:31.380
No direct action they know what to take and Google is actively turning away perfectly

17:31.380 --> 17:33.800
good customers, telling them that they're closed.

17:33.800 --> 17:39.280
And it's an example of just how there can be some kind of malicious activity that they

17:39.280 --> 17:41.200
don't ever intend.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.480
It's not it's not it's not an intentional act on Google's part.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.960
It's just something fell through the cracks and somebody isn't updating the right page

17:47.960 --> 17:52.360
or has they haven't gotten they haven't claimed their business on Google yet or whatever it

17:52.360 --> 17:57.240
is that Google makes them do so that way their hours can be displayed correctly and they're

17:57.240 --> 17:59.080
not even aware of it.

17:59.080 --> 18:03.360
And it just shows you like they they are at a level now where they are integrated to our

18:03.360 --> 18:04.360
society.

18:04.360 --> 18:11.440
Amazon, Google, Apple, social networks that I think we can't even really fully see.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.960
Like it's just we're too in the forest.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.560
So let's let's zoom out.

18:15.560 --> 18:19.600
Nick Spites writes in with our last email and I will try to get to more emails are just

18:19.600 --> 18:23.240
a little behind, but do keep sending them in because they're big part of the show.

18:23.240 --> 18:27.640
But Nick Spites writes, I'm curious, what are your thoughts on what will the future

18:27.640 --> 18:30.360
of development look like and what might be possible?

18:30.360 --> 18:38.540
I know Chris is a Rust guy.

18:38.540 --> 18:43.500
And of course, Mike is an Objective C Jedi, but I'm curious about what you think the future

18:43.500 --> 18:45.280
is going to look like.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.280
Will it be Rust?

18:46.280 --> 18:47.500
Will it be Golang?

18:47.500 --> 18:48.500
Something else?

18:48.500 --> 18:49.880
Just curious what you think.

18:49.880 --> 18:50.880
All in good fun.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.460
Thanks, guys.

18:52.460 --> 18:56.720
So if you were to future cast, Mr. Dominic, obviously it's Rust, right?

18:56.720 --> 18:59.880
I mean, clearly all Rust.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.760
As much as it hurts me, it's JavaScript or TypeScript.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:04.840 --> 19:05.840
I could see that.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.040
Also, real time update.

19:07.040 --> 19:12.040
I just reactivated my Facebook account and I feel like you had to do it, though.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.040
You know, I'm sorry.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.040
I just threw up on the floor.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.560
I just want to say Senator Warren, are you paying attention?

19:16.560 --> 19:22.960
I was forced to reactivate my Facebook account to continue running ads for my business.

19:22.960 --> 19:32.040
Yeah, but yeah, big tech, totally just going to go away.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.680
Linode.com slash coder.

19:33.680 --> 19:37.440
Now, no matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you use, you can

19:37.440 --> 19:41.580
check out Linode and get something up and running and get your idea alive on the web

19:41.580 --> 19:42.580
quick.

19:42.580 --> 19:47.160
Linode has amazing 24-7 customer support by phone or by ticket.

19:47.160 --> 19:51.240
And along with hundreds of guides and tutorials, you're likely going to get started.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.920
And realistically, you're a member of our community.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.860
So there are tons of Linode users hanging out in our community that can answer questions

19:57.860 --> 19:58.860
as well.

19:58.860 --> 20:01.400
We have integrated Linode as part of our team.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.760
They're like the infrastructure team here at J.P.

20:03.760 --> 20:07.200
I mean, obviously it starts with us logging in and setting these things up, but you get

20:07.200 --> 20:12.600
started and you can get access to things at just ridiculous speeds and at ridiculously

20:12.600 --> 20:18.200
great prices, 35% to 50% less than what you're going to pay at the big cloud providers.

20:18.200 --> 20:22.200
And there's some clever ways you can use Linode for multi-cloud setups as well.

20:22.200 --> 20:27.080
Something we do here is we have a Nextcloud server here on the LAN that has a lot of our

20:27.080 --> 20:29.360
offline archive assets.

20:29.360 --> 20:34.520
And we can federate that with a Nextcloud server that's up on Linode that is our more

20:34.520 --> 20:39.040
daily interactive things like the editing asset files and the projects that the editors

20:39.040 --> 20:40.280
are working on.

20:40.280 --> 20:44.600
That's up on a Linode that's fast for them and gives them centralized access.

20:44.600 --> 20:49.240
And then as time goes on, we can age that stuff to our system here on our LAN.

20:49.240 --> 20:53.500
So when we want to use cloud computing, there's a lot of different ways you can think of it.

20:53.500 --> 20:57.200
And hybrid is a great option that you're hearing a lot as kind of like a hype option, especially

20:57.200 --> 20:59.120
from the Red Hat and IBM camp.

20:59.120 --> 21:03.540
But the reality is it just means using multiple data centers and multiple cloud providers

21:03.540 --> 21:05.180
to get the best package.

21:05.180 --> 21:08.400
And that's where I think Linode is extremely competitive.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.840
They're very fast.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.400
They are their own ISP.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.740
They have 11 data centers around the world.

21:13.740 --> 21:17.140
They have one click application deployments to get you up and running.

21:17.140 --> 21:19.520
And of course, like I mentioned, they have that great support.

21:19.520 --> 21:23.840
So if your production system ever has trouble, you know that you're getting the best support

21:23.840 --> 21:24.840
in the business.

21:24.840 --> 21:29.600
So go try it out and see what we've been talking about and support the Coder Radio program.

21:29.600 --> 21:34.840
Go to linode.com slash coder, get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and support

21:34.840 --> 21:35.840
the show.

21:35.840 --> 21:39.340
A great and quick use of Linux to be self hosting your own live stream setup.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.880
That's something I've mentioned before.

21:40.880 --> 21:45.520
And there is a product that you can one click deploy called own cast and it's like twitch

21:45.520 --> 21:46.760
in a box.

21:46.760 --> 21:50.440
So if you have a presentation you want to do, and you want to put it on your own website,

21:50.440 --> 21:53.920
you want to provide your own experience, check out own cast.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.260
You can deploy with one click on Linode.

21:56.260 --> 21:59.400
And you can try it all out for free with that $100 60 day credit.

21:59.400 --> 22:05.800
You go to linode.com slash coder, support the show and try it out.

22:05.800 --> 22:10.620
Well I tried out Cosmic on Pop OS 2104.

22:10.620 --> 22:15.720
After your hot and heavy take last week, I thought, okay, I got to try this out myself

22:15.720 --> 22:18.960
and see what it's really like.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.740
And there's some stuff I like about it.

22:21.740 --> 22:25.160
But I do have, I do have a couple of issues.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.000
Where would you like me to start?

22:27.000 --> 22:31.740
I guess let's make it a sandwich, but backwards, what was your worst issue?

22:31.740 --> 22:37.440
This is such a weird one, but first of all, I found it slightly unintuitive on how to deal

22:37.440 --> 22:39.520
with fractional scaling.

22:39.520 --> 22:46.360
I have a 1440p resolution laptop screen and I find that 200% high DPI mode is just, it's

22:46.360 --> 22:49.160
way too little real estate.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.200
Nothing really even fits on the screen.

22:51.200 --> 22:55.360
And it really doesn't work well with tiling either because everything is so zoomed in

22:55.360 --> 22:56.720
and so small.

22:56.720 --> 23:05.120
But the sweet spot on that 1440p Lenovo screen is 150%, which fractional scaling is just

23:05.120 --> 23:08.040
a check box away, you turn that on.

23:08.040 --> 23:13.840
But what I didn't know until I got some support from System76 is that I also then have to

23:13.840 --> 23:19.280
disable the high DPI demon in order for it not to revert my settings every time the system

23:19.280 --> 23:20.280
wakes up.

23:20.280 --> 23:25.040
And it's just a little complicated and fiddly because it involved me going in and turning

23:25.040 --> 23:29.680
something on and choosing a certain percentage and then I had to know to then disable something

23:29.680 --> 23:30.680
else.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.840
And it just wasn't, it wasn't implicitly clear to me.

23:32.840 --> 23:37.280
And so that was a frustrating experience, but ultimately one that was a bit of my own

23:37.280 --> 23:41.000
creation since I guess I had like some conflicting settings there.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.840
And once I knew what to do, I was able to solve it.

23:43.840 --> 23:47.040
Did you try the increased text size?

23:47.040 --> 23:51.740
I don't have that turned on this time around just because I'm using the 150% fractional

23:51.740 --> 23:54.540
scaling, but I typically do turn that on.

23:54.540 --> 23:55.540
So do I.

23:55.540 --> 23:56.540
Yeah.

23:56.540 --> 23:57.600
That was my, I tweeted about it.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.920
That was my like Achilles heel.

23:58.920 --> 24:03.840
I couldn't read the goddamn font and I'm not that old guys.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.420
Thank you for your help, Jeremy, but I am not that old.

24:07.420 --> 24:12.400
That should be the default and get off my goddamn lawn.

24:12.400 --> 24:18.900
The other thing that I found tricky about it is, and I can't unsee it, was the terminal

24:18.900 --> 24:24.240
icon is slightly smaller than the other two icons around it and it's centered.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.920
And I really can't unsee it once I've seen it.

24:25.920 --> 24:29.780
I feel like that's a transparency pixel issue, right?

24:29.780 --> 24:30.780
That's not.

24:30.780 --> 24:34.040
It could be or just different weird shapes, but it just, it looks, it doesn't look even

24:34.040 --> 24:38.080
and the only way to fix it is to change the whole system icon theme.

24:38.080 --> 24:41.360
And that's just kind of unfortunate, but that's such a minor thing.

24:41.360 --> 24:45.360
What I took away from it though is a couple of things they've added are like superior

24:45.360 --> 24:50.920
to other Godome setups, their launcher and the ability to turn their tiling window extension

24:50.920 --> 24:51.920
on and off.

24:51.920 --> 24:55.680
I really like that because there are certain times I want tiling windows and there's other

24:55.680 --> 24:58.200
times I don't want tiling windows.

24:58.200 --> 25:03.160
So that kind of stuff made me, I just sort of was grateful that somebody is building

25:03.160 --> 25:05.400
power user features for Linux desktop.

25:05.400 --> 25:10.620
Like it's just, I think it's not that it's not user, new user friendly, but it's clearly

25:10.620 --> 25:14.840
like the more power user you are, the faster you can move around because there's lots of

25:14.840 --> 25:20.200
keyboard shortcuts and gesture support and the tiling window manager stuff.

25:20.200 --> 25:24.920
It really seems to like kind of optimize for pro users, but yet try to be approachable

25:24.920 --> 25:26.120
for new users.

25:26.120 --> 25:30.280
And I have been waiting for somebody to do that because I feel like too often in Linux,

25:30.280 --> 25:32.920
we cater to this mythical new user.

25:32.920 --> 25:39.480
And so we create these interfaces that are very limited and that is not what's happening

25:39.480 --> 25:40.480
here.

25:40.480 --> 25:44.120
They've managed to strike a balance between making something approachable, but power users

25:44.120 --> 25:45.440
sort of optimize for it.

25:45.440 --> 25:51.120
And that I like a lot, not a fan of two bars, having a doc all along the bottom and having

25:51.120 --> 25:55.480
a top bar is way too much of my vertical screen real estate eaten up.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.540
So the doc had to go on the left hand side.

25:57.540 --> 25:59.140
They make that easy to do.

25:59.140 --> 26:03.040
But what I would love to see is that top bar gets integrated into their doc and just one

26:03.040 --> 26:05.600
bar, let's just go all in one bar.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.760
That way I can get the most vertical space possible.

26:07.760 --> 26:11.040
I know that's a pretty big change for GNOME, but I'd like to see that.

26:11.040 --> 26:17.280
I mean, I was pretty happy with Cosmic, but for them calling me, you were coming in hot

26:17.280 --> 26:18.280
and heavy a little bit.

26:18.280 --> 26:24.640
I mean, not even a little like I was a little annoyed like, OK, listen, I really, really

26:24.640 --> 26:26.200
want my desktop to be stable.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.160
Yeah, you ended up reloading, didn't you?

26:28.160 --> 26:29.160
I did reload.

26:29.160 --> 26:32.640
I think something crazy happened in the upgrade.

26:32.640 --> 26:36.720
And when I reloaded, it somehow magically worked, although I think maybe maybe Jeremy

26:36.720 --> 26:38.000
hacked me.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Whatever.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.120
It's cool.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.120
We're friends.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.880
So you were going from the previous pop to the new pop.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.640
And then this time you just went clean install, right?

26:46.640 --> 26:49.880
I was going from non cosmic to cosmic.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.280
I think this is a good release.

26:52.280 --> 26:54.000
I like where they're going.

26:54.000 --> 27:01.520
My pet peeve is I want keyboard shortcuts for, you know, quarter scaling, just like

27:01.520 --> 27:03.080
magnet dot app on Mac.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.080
Right.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.680
I really don't want to have to move it, you know, click, click, click.

27:06.680 --> 27:10.920
Yeah, they could use magnet dot app as a template for how all functionality should work with

27:10.920 --> 27:11.920
the tiling.

27:11.920 --> 27:12.920
Why don't you steal it?

27:12.920 --> 27:13.920
I mean, Apple did it.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.920
Yeah, I know, right?

27:15.920 --> 27:17.400
I think so.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.400
I agree.

27:18.400 --> 27:23.680
Like the tiling stuff, honestly, after using Windows 11, it feels like what I like about

27:23.680 --> 27:28.320
the way Windows 11 does it is you can tile per window so you don't have to.

27:28.320 --> 27:32.000
It's not just tilings all on or tilings all off.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.140
It's you can hover over the maximize button on Windows 11 or that that region.

27:37.140 --> 27:41.440
And this really nice visual guide that gives you a visual layout of how the applications

27:41.440 --> 27:43.840
will snap comes up.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.160
You choose that.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.120
The window then moves to the position you selected.

27:48.120 --> 27:53.080
And then in the empty space, it goes into an expose mode where it shows you every window

27:53.080 --> 27:54.120
available.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.200
You click the one you want.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.640
It does a smooth transition.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.040
And then those two windows are bonded together.

28:01.040 --> 28:06.080
And then if you click between the center of those two windows and you resize, they resize

28:06.080 --> 28:09.520
together on Cosmic.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.960
This does not happen.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.980
First of all, it's just all tiling on all the time.

28:12.980 --> 28:14.160
And so everything gets tiled.

28:14.160 --> 28:18.840
And sometimes you end up in a situation where like a settings window pops up and it's tiny

28:18.840 --> 28:22.000
and you eventually build up a list of exceptions, but it takes a while.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.680
But then additionally, the like the moving of the windows is jerky because of GNOME Shell.

28:26.680 --> 28:32.440
So if you resize Chrome, it Chrome resizes and then a second later, the application,

28:32.440 --> 28:36.600
the other application pops over and you see it draw on there like an old Windows box might

28:36.600 --> 28:37.600
have.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.040
And it's not smooth like it is in Windows 11.

28:39.040 --> 28:43.720
And that's the problem is I just switched from Windows 11 for the weekend to Cosmic

28:43.720 --> 28:44.920
and Pop OS.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.480
And you loved it and you loved it.

28:47.480 --> 28:53.360
Well, I felt like the way they're doing tiling windows in Windows 11 is really clever.

28:53.360 --> 28:56.200
It's like per window instead of always on or always off.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.200
Come on.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.200
You twitched a little.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.200
No, I'm actually otherwise.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.600
Otherwise, I'm it's I'm plenty happy to be done using Windows.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.600
Are you?

29:02.600 --> 29:04.360
I for for five minutes.

29:04.360 --> 29:05.360
For five minutes.

29:05.360 --> 29:10.040
I was like, you know, this is nice because I have WSL and I could play a lot more games.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.600
And then I kept using it.

29:12.600 --> 29:15.200
And the reality is, it's still Windows.

29:15.200 --> 29:18.760
Yeah, that's why I felt it's not as good as Mac.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.760
Yeah, exactly.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.040
But you got a new Thalia.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.280
Oh, my new Thalia is amazing.

29:25.280 --> 29:29.520
OK, so things I've bitched about in the Thalia is before and I'm just going to go over here.

29:29.520 --> 29:30.520
The fan noise.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.520
Gone.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.520
Fantastic.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.520
Really?

29:33.520 --> 29:37.000
And I got the one with the black, the black color finish on the wood.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Is it nearby?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.760
You know, I want to hear it.

29:39.760 --> 29:43.880
I have a full house, so I had to go into my bedroom to Chris.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.240
My personal life is a goddamn mess.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.240
You know that.

29:46.240 --> 29:49.440
So you got a whole team of people over trying to put it together right now.

29:49.440 --> 29:50.440
Is that you're telling me?

29:50.440 --> 29:55.320
No, I got a whole team of people trying to do summer school and move us to New Jersey.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.120
Oh, man, that's going to be crazy.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.880
Dude, next couple of weeks, Kota radio listeners, Mike's going home.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.880
He's going home.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.680
There you go.

30:04.680 --> 30:08.360
Yes, you're going back to the to the motherland.

30:08.360 --> 30:13.880
We are going back to the Soviet Republic of New Jersey with Comrade Mercy.

30:13.880 --> 30:14.880
The taxes.

30:14.880 --> 30:18.160
My income goes down 10 percent the minute I cross the line.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.160
This terrible.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.880
Oh, man.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.400
But the Thalia was great.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.000
I don't even know what to say.

30:25.000 --> 30:30.960
And I and I have to say, I was a bit of a how do you say this in English, bitch on Twitter

30:30.960 --> 30:36.040
because I had a bug and I was too lazy to reinstall it first before tweeting because

30:36.040 --> 30:37.040
you know.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.040
Why not?

30:38.040 --> 30:42.280
You've been podcasting for 13 years.

30:42.280 --> 30:45.120
You don't flash USB drives without bitching first.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.120
Put them on blast.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.120
Put them on blast.

30:47.120 --> 30:54.800
Listen, Marco Armit, bitches about a font, I'm just saying, like my patience, very high.

30:54.800 --> 30:58.040
I got a lot of responses from the folks over there.

30:58.040 --> 31:02.920
And yeah, turns out it was a bad it was a bad copy of the image.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.240
Well, or the upgrade.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.240
Yeah.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.240
Either way.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.240
Oh, this is the new one.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.240
Right.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.240
Something happened in the.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.240
No, no, no.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.240
The upgrade.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.240
No, no.

31:12.240 --> 31:13.240
The new one came with the old OS.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.240
That's the one I upgraded.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.160
The old one that I upgraded is fine.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.160
Yeah.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.160
The upgrade gamble.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.160
You never know.

31:20.160 --> 31:24.360
I suppose you should always wipe and pave or you could just run Mac OS snow leopard.

31:24.360 --> 31:27.720
Did you see the snow leopard available for download or something like that?

31:27.720 --> 31:29.400
Wait, wait, wait.

31:29.400 --> 31:33.960
What Apple's made a couple of old classic Mac OS is available for download.

31:33.960 --> 31:34.960
Can I have a link?

31:34.960 --> 31:38.040
I don't think you can install it on any new machine.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.920
It's not like they've made an M1 version of it.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.760
I will hunt on eBay to find a machine.

31:44.760 --> 31:49.040
I'll use my blood to revive the battery with the return to New Jersey.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.940
That means we should probably warn people that the live shows may vary in time.

31:52.940 --> 31:56.580
So they're going to have to stay flexi with us and watch the calendar and we'll probably

31:56.580 --> 32:00.200
end up at recording once you're done moving at a new showtime.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.800
Yes, I think it's the old showtime, though.

32:02.800 --> 32:03.800
Yeah.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.800
And also, why are we apologizing to them?

32:05.800 --> 32:08.240
You know, they secretly run Mac OS anyway.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.400
Yeah, that's probably true.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.200
And you know, you know, most of them don't.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.520
They don't even turn in live.

32:12.520 --> 32:13.520
Like everybody listens.

32:13.520 --> 32:19.080
They're like on overcast being like, ooh, Marco's colors are better than Apple podcast.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.920
I don't know how they find us on the podcast apps.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.000
I really don't.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.280
Because Marco blocks it because he wants to f**k us over.

32:25.280 --> 32:28.320
No, that's Apple that's blocking us.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.320
Maybe they're working together.

32:29.320 --> 32:33.320
Chris, you and I are just getting hate banged by all the Apple people.

32:33.320 --> 32:37.160
Although the 20 hour battery life, I just can't give up.

32:37.160 --> 32:41.520
You know who doesn't hate bang us, our members at coderqa.co.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.160
They take care of us over there.

32:43.160 --> 32:48.080
They support the show, they get a limited ad feed, and they get that coderly report,

32:48.080 --> 32:51.240
which we're going to be working on new and soon, although everything's a little crazy

32:51.240 --> 32:52.240
with Mike moving.

32:52.240 --> 32:57.320
But coderly, coderly, the quarterly, there, I got it.

32:57.320 --> 33:02.040
The quarterly, coderly, ha, will be out soon-ish.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.440
We do one each quarter for our members.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.440
And I got a couple ideas.

33:05.440 --> 33:08.840
I got a couple topic ideas so we can chat off air about that.

33:08.840 --> 33:15.200
But you can become a member and support the show at coderqa.co and we appreciate that.

33:15.200 --> 33:20.080
I'm at Chris LAS, the network is at Jupiter Signal, and the show is at Coder Radio Show

33:20.080 --> 33:21.480
on the Twitter.

33:21.480 --> 33:25.000
Links to what we talked about today, coder.show slash 421.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.680
Over there you'll find our contact form, we'd love to hear from you, it's a big part of

33:27.680 --> 33:28.720
the show.

33:28.720 --> 33:33.760
Also our RSS feed, so that way you can subscribe and you just get the show automatically, regardless

33:33.760 --> 33:37.360
of when we do it live or what moving's happening or nothing's.

33:37.360 --> 33:42.120
Also if you would like to risk it, you can do that at jblive.tv and we'll put those times

33:42.120 --> 33:45.080
over at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.960
We'll make it available for you on the wild side.

33:46.960 --> 33:50.680
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program and we'll

33:50.680 --> 34:04.480
see you right back here next week.
