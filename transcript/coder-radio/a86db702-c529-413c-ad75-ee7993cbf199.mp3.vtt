00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Koda Radio, episode 487, for October 10th!

00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
Hello good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art, the business, the software development, and the world of technology.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
My name is Chris, and joining me with the actual proper timekeeping, it's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike!

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Oh crap, I think I just said publish.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
You gotta be careful, you know, you gotta really review those end user licenses before you publish them.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
That's right, yes, especially when they involve fining your users.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
As we did the show prep, Chris told me a story that, well I'll leave this one to you.

00:49.000 --> 01:02.000
How bad is this? It's so embarrassing, and it's a total accident they say. PayPal never meant for you to read that EULA that says they will fine you $2,500 for each violation of misinformation.

01:02.000 --> 01:12.000
And Mike, don't worry, because that accidental EULA that they never published even qualified that if you don't have $2,500 in your PayPal balance, they got you.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
They will just automatically ACH debit it from whatever account you have connected to your PayPal account.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
So they'll just take the $2,500 directly out of your checking account.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
That's so, so screwed up.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
It's amazing!

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
So PayPal is like, we're not just going to censor you, we're going to possibly have you miss your rent. Yay!

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah, could you imagine just a random $2,500 coming out before your bills clear?

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
And also, who gets to say what's misinformation?

01:41.000 --> 01:50.000
Right. And like, okay, so maybe you didn't intend to publish this, but you're clearly working on this because there's a lot that went into this.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
There's a lot of language. That's a pretty big decision.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
That's not like a decision that like a lower ranked document writer just kind of accidentally comes up with on their own and puts into the EULA.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
That's not how that works.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Accident.

02:05.000 --> 02:13.000
So just a warning, this is going to be a very high cholesterol episode this week, but I'm going to start right off with some nice financial bacon here.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Fantastic. I brought lots of bacon this week.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
All right. This entire policy hinges on how the midterm elections go.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
The American midterms, right?

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
If for whatever reason there is a, let's say, red backlash, I think PayPal doesn't do this.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
Oh, man. And if there is a left landslide,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Then they do it.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
They do it. Right. They do it because misinformation is. Right.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
Because can you imagine, let's say, are some of our lovely blow hard politicians,

02:43.000 --> 02:53.000
Fran Paul, Ted Cruz, whatever, of my particular party that doesn't love me anymore, just getting their paws on this and having control of committees and subpoena power?

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Okay, I had not even put this into perspective, but you're right.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
This seems like what the mistake was.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
The mistake was this went out before the elections were over, before they decided which way the wind was blowing.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
That was the mistake.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
Well, the mistake, they may realize, I'm 100 percent sure the executives of PayPal agree with this.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Right. They want to do this for their own reasons.

03:13.000 --> 03:25.000
But if you're like, I don't know who the current CEO of PayPal is, but if you're on the board, you're an executive there and then you have a Republican controlled House.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Can you imagine? I mean, we have later in the show the Elon texts.

03:29.000 --> 03:41.000
Can you imagine the show that's going to happen when you get every single representative on whatever the Commerce Committee decides that he wants to subpoena your texts?

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
And they just so happen to leak to friendly conservative outlets.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
The embarrassment level is I mean, it's already had an impact on the Twitter deal and Elon Musk.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
I can't imagine what like the email threads look like on this. Right.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Like inside PayPal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, boy, that's got to be purified.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
And then we saw this with some of the investigations that have already happened.

04:04.000 --> 04:13.000
What are these representatives going to do? Well, the political affiliation of, let's say, probably 90 percent of PayPal, the executives, I mean, PayPal is probably liberal.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
Right. And they're going to say it's an anti-conservative bias to literally hurt conservatives.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
They're going to chin up a bunch of I mean, before I call it, I'm going to say this is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard of.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
No kidding. Like, you could actually ruin people's lives by debiting twenty five hundred dollars out of their checking account.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
So I don't know why they think they need to do this. Well, misinformation, it's so dangerous, Mike.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, but not being able to pay your rent or buy food is worse. Right. Oh, I don't know.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
I mean, I was told misinformation kills. So, you know, misinformation is dangerous.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
I'm doing it in a mocking tone because I obviously don't believe it.

04:50.000 --> 05:04.000
But I actually have started to think that I think some of these CEOs really do like they I think they see themselves as they're in a position of power in a unique moment of history where they can affect change.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
And because they're so detached from reality, because they're rich and they've been rich for a very long time and they kind of live in their own bubble.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
I think they kind of abstract away the world's problems and they kind of look at it and they think they're looking at it from a high level view.

05:17.000 --> 05:26.000
That's probably what they tell themselves. And they really think maybe they really, truly believe misinformation is genuinely killing people.

05:26.000 --> 05:39.000
And if you're comfortable, if the existing system has served you well, if you are essentially living a life of some privilege, you're going to actually believe that you're going to think it is true because the existing system is great.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Look how you've turned out. Things are going pretty well. Things are pretty nice for these CEOs.

05:43.000 --> 05:54.000
Right. So I would think it's reasonable to suspect that they really do want to defend the existing system and they really, truly do buy that misinformation is the biggest problem with facing democracy right now.

05:54.000 --> 06:06.000
So the problem with that is this isn't like, you know, Argarwal gets mad and throw somebody off of Twitter, which, by the way, you know, Kanye would not be on Twitter right now had Elon Musk not started his bullshit.

06:06.000 --> 06:15.000
Can you imagine that? I'm sure we've all heard the rumors. Twitter was so ready to crack down on moderation. They were getting there. They were getting amped. They had a consensus.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
And Elon's like, here's a hand grenade. Enjoy.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah, really.

06:18.000 --> 06:29.000
The problem with that is I would actually support the obnoxious. I don't love them. But, you know, the I'm throwing you off my platform kind of thing because it's like a club, right? You get thrown out.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
PayPal, if they do this, they are effectively acting as a government. They are imposing monetary fines.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Yeah.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
I mean, and that's not a little fine. Most traffic tickets are like a couple hundred bucks, right?

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
I know. It's like an overdraft fee for the truth.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
And so it's twenty five hundred bucks.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Well, inflation.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
It's not like I mean, this is.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
No, I agree. It's it's ludicrous. It's ludicrous.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Like the Hillsborough County Court might impose a fine like this for being a jackass, right? This is.

07:00.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, I don't think this is appropriate. I'm not even sure that it would have its intended purpose.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
What if you like post something idiotic that they call misinformation and you didn't know you were wrong until after the fact?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Well, that happens all the time.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Right. Thanksgiving's coming up.

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
We all have crazy liberal aunt and crazy conservative uncle or vice versa. And it's just going to be a frickin disaster.

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
Well, and the other thing that's alarming about this is it's misinformation anywhere on the Internet.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
It's not just misinformation like on your PayPal account. That's that silly.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
It is you tweet something, you write something, you do a YouTube video.

07:42.000 --> 07:50.000
It is it is pretty alarming because it could be one of those things where maybe you have a patron and they decide you're fine, you're good. YouTube decides, OK, you're fine, you're good.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
But PayPal, the payment processor, decides, no, that's that's misinformation.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
They cut you off and they fine you twenty five hundred dollars.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Also, how are they going to enforce this?

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
You know, we've had great experiences with the YouTube algorithm thinking that like me singing a bar of a song is like copyright infringement.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Right. Or something crazy like that.

08:07.000 --> 08:15.000
Are they going to debit your account and then you have to go prove that what you said you either did not know is misinformation, maybe ignorance as a defense.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Right. Who knows? Or that it's true.

08:17.000 --> 08:25.000
And the point that you were making just now, I think, is a good one in that what we sometimes determine as misinformation today turns out to not be.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
And it just requires more information, more data, more facts, more time.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
And then we discover, well, that actually was true.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
There was this old Italian dude called Galileo. I mean, his PayPal account would have been rocked.

08:36.000 --> 08:48.000
Right. Well, and there's a certain irony here where the gun shop owner that talked about Hunter Biden's gun or the laptop owner that talked about Hunter Biden's laptop, they would have been labeled as misinformation and been fined.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
But Hunter Biden or whoever else that, you know, any of the writers that wrote stories that said none of that stuff was true.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
New York Post. They wouldn't have been considered misinformation.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
You get what I'm saying? Like, well, three months later, the FBI would come out and admit that it was true.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
Right. Right. And I hate to use that example, but I think it's probably the one that people are most recent with.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Is at the time that came out, it was it was labeled as Russian misinformation.

09:10.000 --> 09:23.000
And then a year later, we discover actually now the FBI has an open investigation on two fairly serious legal matters, tax avoidance and mishandling of a firearm.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
Both of those are they're going after Hunter Biden for right now. And some of that evidence came from that laptop dump.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
So it's actually being used in an FBI investigation and now legal case.

09:35.000 --> 09:42.000
So it's clearly not misinformation, but we don't go back and retroactively address that.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
There's no system that kind of corrects for that.

09:45.000 --> 09:54.000
And so if we're going to make immediate sort of knee jerk style reactions about what is information, what is misinformation, what needs to be suppressed, what doesn't.

09:54.000 --> 10:02.000
Or I can't remember what Zuckerberg said in his interview with Lex, but it was something to like we took we tune it down so that way it just doesn't get as much spread.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
We sort of deemphasize the misinformation as they label it. There's nothing that goes back and corrects that.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
There's no self-repair. There's no system that tracks what was right, what was wrong.

10:13.000 --> 10:22.000
And so it feels like if you're going to have that knee jerk reaction, you also need to have a system that corrects itself and writes itself and keeps a record of of what was a call, a good call and a bad call.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
But we're not doing that. We're only doing the knee jerk part.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Or private companies shouldn't be in this business, right? Of deciding what you can and can't say.

10:29.000 --> 10:41.000
Well, that's a big element of it, right? Is this is this is the issue when when you have PayPal, a private company that's a private bank that's doing this and then they decide that they can monitor your speech across the Internet.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
It's pretty alarming. And I think you have to try to figure out what their incentives are.

10:45.000 --> 10:53.000
Perhaps it's just they figure it's a new way to monetize with twenty five hundred dollars a pop or perhaps like Mike suggesting there is a political motivation here as well.

10:53.000 --> 11:02.000
And if that's the case, I think we've got to look at PayPal is dead to us because this is extremely dangerous behavior and this is a massive tax on their users.

11:02.000 --> 11:10.000
It's a it's just a dangerous precedent. And it's, you know, embarrassing for them to like this is this is damaging to their brand.

11:10.000 --> 11:21.000
Also, if you've ever dealt with PayPal support, I can tell you, you should be less afraid of like political malice because I don't think they're really trying to be malicious and more afraid of their support is terrible.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
They're just going to mess this up. Right. Even with the best of intentions, they're they're not going to be able to do this.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
No one can. It's too hard. Right. It's just it's too big a job. It's too hard.

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
There is no GitHub code pilot style algorithm where you can write that's going to be able to flag this stuff.

11:38.000 --> 11:47.000
And if they do this, it's it's all it's actually this is, you know, this is like the guy who lost all his years of Google photos and emails because it got flagged.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
And they're like, oh, well, guilty until proven innocent. We're a private company. So there's no appeal to that.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
It does very much have that same vibe. But we should move on because I think we're getting a little bread to be.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
All right. Moving right along. It's such a wild world we live in now where this goes on.

12:02.000 --> 12:12.000
Just one last remark. I think of late 70s, early 80s progressive liberals, you know, like your Carl Sagan types, outspoken intellectuals.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
They would be throwing up. And I think about what how they're watching the if, you know, say they're above watching.

12:19.000 --> 12:28.000
I just think about how they would see the attempt to control information now and how I think when the Internet was born.

12:28.000 --> 12:37.000
The ability to control information was essentially dead and you can mitigate, you can manage it for a while, but the truth eventually gets out.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
And the Internet is just like a new communications medium for that.

12:42.000 --> 12:50.000
And you can't solve for communications. You can try to control private companies and control what they message, but it only works for a limited amount of time.

12:50.000 --> 12:58.000
And reducing information is never a sustainable solution because the supply side is infinite.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
And so you can only suppress the information supply for so long.

13:02.000 --> 13:12.000
But it is inevitable that you will fail to suppress it completely because it is literally on the Internet an infinite supply of information.

13:12.000 --> 13:20.000
And it's it's free to copy. It's free to distribute, you know, abstractly speaking.

13:20.000 --> 13:32.000
So trying to control speech, trying to control information through fines, through suppressing social media posts by fact seekers, fact checkers, you know, all that stuff.

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
It's it's a game designed to lose. You're never going to win that. Someone's always going to copy that floppy.

13:39.000 --> 13:49.000
Just imagine like those early progressive like your Carl Sagan looking at this and watching the attempt to control speech and control information and not recognizing their own party anymore.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
Because when I was a kid, the left was the radical speech party. They were the ones where anything goes. Let's let's talk. Let's accept anybody.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
Let's party. Right. Let's let's. Yeah. You know, let's let's let the ladies dress how they like. Let's party.

14:01.000 --> 14:09.000
Everything free sex, free drugs. Now it's in a lot of ways they've kind of switched. Right. The left has a lot of rules are very conservative in a weird way. They are kind of conservative.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
They're at least in terms of speech. Yeah. In terms of speech and thought policing and that kind of stuff.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah. It very much feels like what the conservatives were when I when I was a kid and I hated that.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
Right. And now the conservatives are just weird. I don't know what the hell happened. Ben Shapiro's fault. I blame him.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
No, I think Trump broke him forever. You know, I'm just picturing like the Cato Institute.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
There's just a bunch of guys crying at tables right now.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
Well, let's go back in time to a simpler time. Let's travel back to 2016.

14:42.000 --> 15:01.000
I take you to episode 192 of the Kota Radio program, where I attempt to make a passionate case for the merits of 3D media and Alex, a.k.a. Giga Texel on Twitter, would like your answer as to why this didn't take off when it seems to be compelling at the time.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
So I'll play the clip and then we'll see why it didn't actually happen.

15:05.000 --> 15:15.000
But the best 3D movie experience I've ever had, even compared to like going to the theaters, was with Gear VR because VR obviously is 3D.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
And so you load a 3D movie on there and it is it is actually extremely compelling.

15:20.000 --> 15:34.000
And it was lightweight enough. I have it actually right here where I could just take it on the road with me and I could watch even a 2D video and just be in my own world, even though I was just sitting in the passenger seat.

15:34.000 --> 15:41.000
And I could just totally zone out and watch some watch some YouTube or watch watch some Google Play or whatever.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
And just I mean, it was great. It was really great.

15:44.000 --> 15:52.000
And so I actually I actually wonder if maybe there couldn't be more here than there is, say, with with Android Wear or Apple Watch.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
Not to say there's a lot, but I think there might actually be more with VR than there are is than there is with the watches.

15:58.000 --> 16:08.000
You think that's possible? It could be, right? I could just be an old fogey on this where, you know, I just don't get it right.

16:08.000 --> 16:16.000
Maybe younger people will wear these and watch movies like you're describing 3D movies or whatever.

16:16.000 --> 16:24.000
I I think maybe something that would really get me going is if you could have a really good flight simulation.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
Or a space sim, you know, somewhere you're flying around controlling some.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Chris, Chris, you and I are going to go through a Stargate and I promise you.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Oh, it cuts off there. I want to know what you were going to promise me.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
Well, that didn't cut off. Comcast just turned off our Internet, right?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Oh, right. OK. Yeah.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Because PayPal is such a good idea.

16:45.000 --> 16:56.000
So, you know, here I am. I'm pretty excited because you could plug your cell phone into this thing and you could get yourself a totally passable media consumption environment.

16:56.000 --> 17:04.000
That was sort of like it's just it just took you off to another land where you're in a cool movie theater all by yourself watching a movie.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
And I thought there's something to this idea. And then, you know what?

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
Later on, when I put on the Quest earlier this year, very much a similar like there is something here.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
It's just it's not landing. Yeah.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Are you asking why I think it didn't why do I think it hasn't landed?

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
Yeah. And in particular, you know, back then the watch was so new, we thought it was a 50.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
I kind of thought maybe the fifth maybe this maybe the watch won't take off.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
But clearly the watch ended up taking off. The VR stuff hasn't. It's still struggling.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
Well, the app, the Apple Watch took off. Right. It's the other watches didn't really take off.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
True, true. And Apple hasn't done anything in the space.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
I'm not I'm not convinced that some form of VR won't take off.

17:50.000 --> 17:57.000
I mean, Disney World has they call it the void or void. And it's like a it's like a big hangar you go into.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
And it's a whole VR experience. I had done it several years ago and it was like a Star Wars themed shootout.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
You're like, you know, you're like a rebel trying to escape. You got to shoot the stormtroopers.

18:06.000 --> 18:20.000
That was really good. I'm wondering if the future of VR is more like that, where it's a place you go right with using the same or similar technology rather than just a headset you put on.

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
Particularly in the gaming space, I could see that, but it just I mean, you did have a headset.

18:26.000 --> 18:37.000
The VR thing, the great thing about it is you can turn your home into that place because you can just put the headset on anywhere and now you are transported to this much awesomer place.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
You know, that's the great part about it. You can do it anywhere.

18:40.000 --> 18:47.000
Yeah. I mean, it's been four years. So right. And we're we're not so much further from where we started.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
No, basically, the Quest is a smartphone. It's just built in.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
According to all leaked metrics, it hasn't sold super well. Right.

18:56.000 --> 19:04.000
And then you've got PC VR, obviously, and there is a solid enthusiast market for that. But it's probably nowhere near like the size of a console.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
I know I'm going to sound like an Apple fanboy, but I feel like we have to see what, if anything, Apple does in this space because they they are good.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
You mentioned the watch. They are good at mainstreaming the weird, you know, kitschy tech stuff.

19:15.000 --> 19:24.000
Yeah, they'll kind of you know, they didn't nail it at first on the watch. If you remember, fitness was kind of one of the things, but they had a lot of other stuff in there like fashion.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah. And like, you know, send send your heartbeat stuff to your to your to your partner or whatever.

19:29.000 --> 19:36.000
Then they realized pretty early into like watch two or three that people were really buying it for the for the fitness stuff.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
And if they focused on the fitness stuff more, they sold more watches.

19:41.000 --> 19:49.000
And so it took Apple a little bit. But I think when they kind of honed in on the Fitbit territory, that's really when the Apple Watch went to the next level.

19:49.000 --> 19:59.000
And I could see them doing that with VR AR. I always have thought that that particular AR VR world does lend itself to a App Store model.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
Unfortunately, and so, again, that's an area where Apple could be really strong.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
And now that they have Apple Arcade. They'd probably have some launch titles.

20:08.000 --> 20:16.000
That at least some people like to play, and so you bring it together with software, a particular use case that they could focus on and good hardware.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
I think that's your best shot. And you're right. I don't know if we've gotten there yet because what we've got is either pretty high end PC gaming stuff.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
Or we've got just more iterations on the smartphone idea.

20:27.000 --> 20:37.000
Obviously, Zuckerberg and the folks over at Metta still think there's something here because that's one of the things that's changed in the last four years is Facebook is now known as Metta.

20:37.000 --> 20:47.000
And I don't even know if back in 2016, I don't even think I don't know if Facebook had bought Oculus. But anyways, clearly, Facebook's very dedicated to it.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
OK, you know, I still think it's going to be more the AR stuff, at least in industry.

20:54.000 --> 21:03.000
I'm kind of surprised the HoloLens hasn't from Microsoft. You're going to have to Google that one. This is another Microsoft product that breaks my heart.

21:03.000 --> 21:14.000
I'm just surprised it hasn't taken off more on an industrial scale for people like manufacturing things or designing physical stuff, like cars, for instance.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
Maybe it's a function of cost and where the technology is. And we did have the COVID disruption.

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
And by the way, how's that crypto mining going, guys? GPU seems to be coming right down. Just throwing that out there.

21:25.000 --> 21:34.000
Hey, man. You know, Ethereum transitioned to proof of stake. They don't need miners anymore. So all those people who invested in hardware and set up mining operations, you just got the middle finger.

21:34.000 --> 21:40.000
Welcome to Web 3. I feel bad. My friend is doing a crypto channel, Black Hat Crypto. You should check it out.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
It seems like it's a little harder now. I don't know what happened. Yeah, I think it's for the best.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
You know, I think it's the best thing that could happen to me because I want to buy a new GPU.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Well, there's that. Although Nvidia doesn't seem to be lowering prices.

21:50.000 --> 21:59.000
First of all, Uncle Tim is right. Just don't buy Nvidia. AMD. Chris, you have to live that pure AMD through and through life.

21:59.000 --> 22:06.000
Well, unless you're on Fedora. If you're on Fedora and you're running all open source drivers now, you can't decode HD 64 video with hardware acceleration.

22:06.000 --> 22:13.000
Oh, my God. You're growing. Oh, by the way, your uniform, is it going to be an RMS style like Jesus white robe?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Thank you for thinking and bringing up the uniform. I wanted to mention.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I hate myself.

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
Now that I'm back, I'm going to start taking this very seriously. And I think I want to try to build something pretty soon.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
I'm going to try to put the order all together and we'll see what you guys think.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
Maybe I'll put a link to I don't know if I can do like a cart. I don't know what I can do.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
Are you like buying it? Are you buying copies of the copies? I don't even know how you'd say units.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
You know what I want to do is I want to have a well, first I got to launch because now that I'm going to have a wardrobe,

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
I got to launch an Instagram account so that way I can announce my capsule of my wardrobe.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
My wardrobe capsule on my on my Instagram. Of course, I'm going to have to film an Instagram story about it.

22:50.000 --> 22:58.000
And I think probably I'm going to get a TikTok account as well, because I think I got to take the Chinese intelligence services are very interested in your uniform choices.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
Yes. Yeah. Well, I got it. I got to have if I'm going to have a clothing capsule, I'm pretty sure I got to be an influence.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
That was a clothing capsule. I don't know. I actually was just my wife is like, do you actually know what that is?

23:09.000 --> 23:18.000
And I'm like, no. And she started to explain it to me. But I got to be honest, I kind of drifted off and I was like a time capsule like you just take it in the ground.

23:18.000 --> 23:26.000
I mean, my rough understanding is it's like it's like a wardrobe of like five or six, seven different things that you can mix and match.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
It all kind of go together to make it look like you have a big I don't know. That's honestly when I started tuning out.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
That's so stupid. I can't even explain it.

23:33.000 --> 23:40.000
So anyway, my question was, are you buying like multiple copies of each item in your uniform at once? Like a bulk order? Oh, I will. Yeah. OK.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
Yeah. I think I'll do is what I'll do is once I get what the uniform is, I'll order a prototype uniform.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
Right. Because you don't want to just like go all in and prototype. Right. You got to have a beta. You got to run a beta.

23:50.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah. OK. Batman Beyond. Calm down. Prototype. Yeah.

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
Yeah. Well, look, sometimes you order your bat suit and it's got real ridiculous nips on that thing and you go, but I shouldn't order 10 of those. Right.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
Damn it. Schumacher should take those nips off and then order another bat suit. So I got to make sure I got the right suit anyway.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
Moving right along. Lino dot com slash coder.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
That's where you go to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
It's a great way to support the show. I get yourself a little something something.

24:21.000 --> 24:29.000
It's Lino dot com slash coder. Now, if you don't know, Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting with the best support in the business.

24:29.000 --> 24:36.000
Real humans every single day. And they've been doing it for nearly 19 years, just making a great product.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
When you're looking at something where you want to host something for yourself, for your family or for your business.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
You need something that's got super great support because maybe you won't need it today.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
Maybe you won't need it tomorrow. But one day when you do need it, it's going to make all of the difference.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
And then you also want something that's not going to break the bank.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
Well, Linode is 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the hyperscalers that just want to charge you more and more and always upsell you

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
while they're locking you into their platform.

25:01.000 --> 25:07.000
And on top of all of that, today Linode has 11 data centers around the world and they're adding another dozen next year.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
That's an insane amount of choice geographically for you to choose from.

25:10.000 --> 25:17.000
And they all have great features like Linode's back end object storage, it's S3 compatible, cloud firewall backups for your rigs,

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
Kubernetes and Terraform support and Ansible, which really makes deploying infrastructure a snap.

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
They have very good comprehensive documentation and a whole suite of distros you'd really ever want.

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
You basically have any distro you'd ever want to run up in the cloud available to you. All on Linode.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
And that's just part of the sauce, right?

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
Those are like the fundamentals that go into making a good Linode sauce.

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
But I think when you're eating that sauce, you want something you can put in the fridge and take out later and it's still good for a while, right?

25:47.000 --> 25:55.000
Other providers, the sauce gets a little funky after a shorter than you'd like amount of time, if you get what I'm saying.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Linode's been in this for the long haul doing it right.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
They were one of the first to figure out what you could even do with virtualization in the Linux kernel before we called it cloud services.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Now they're out there just building the best in the PIS.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I think you're going to be really impressed.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
So go build something, go learn something, go try something and support the show.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
Get that hundred bucks and really kick the tires and see why Linode is where we host everything we deploy in the cloud.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
It's where we go every single time.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
It's where my friends have gone for years.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I think you're going to love it.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
And all the audience does.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
So why not check it out?

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Linode.com slash coder.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
So it's official.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Elon Musk is buying Twitter again.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Lies.

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
Twitter announced that the Musk parties sent them a letter expressing the billionaire's intention to go through with the purchase,

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
provided that the trial that's now going on between the two of them does not take place.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Lies.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
But it looks like Twitter wants that trial to continue to take place.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Because they're right and he's full of shit.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
And they also feel like it's a way to keep pressure on him to keep on with the deal.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
So that way he doesn't let off again.

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
So let's let's clarify a few things before we go down this amazing rabbit hole.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
And we're aware this is called Coder Radio, but this is just way too funny.

27:08.000 --> 27:14.000
So he said he intends to buy it, provided they a drop the case.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
You're right.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
But the B, the B is very important.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
It's quite a big B.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Nothing bad, quote unquote, happens to his funding.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Right.

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
So he still gives himself a wiggle room, a wiggle way up.

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
Isn't his funding like in part using Tesla stock as collateral?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Only in part.

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
But the way he phrased his offer, if any of his funding gets screwed up, he in theory is out.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Well, I could see Tesla stock going down.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I mean, I could see the market going down a bit more.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
I think mortgage rates at seven percent.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
It's definitely going down. Right.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
So if that's his collateral, I think he's going to have a funding source problem.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
Scott Galloway, big fan of Elon Musk, hates him with a fiery passion.

27:59.000 --> 28:09.000
I think his take on this is basically correct that this is Elon asking Twitter to basically stop fighting him because depositions suck.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Right.

28:10.000 --> 28:17.000
You know, they ask you all the questions they know you don't want to answer and they try to get you to lie because yay perjury.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
It's a little strange.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
A couple of things here.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
He comes out with this like two days before he's to be deposed.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
That gets a little sus, as the teens might say.

28:30.000 --> 28:42.000
Also, when that didn't work, the man who wouldn't let his employees take off because of Covid cried Covid risk and refused to go to the deposition.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
Now, I don't know if any of you have been involved in court cases before,

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
but let me tell you what would happen to me or Chris if we just refused to go to a deposition.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
It's called the bench warrant.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
And it's where in Florida, at least, I don't know if you have sheriffs up there or just regular cops.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
We got both.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
You do. You have both. OK.

29:01.000 --> 29:10.000
So in Florida or New Jersey, I can tell you the sheriff's deputy would roll up on you and drag your ass to jail and then compel you to go to court.

29:10.000 --> 29:21.000
And if the judge is feeling in a particularly zesty mood, let's say, he or she might even after you comply, charge you with contempt of court,

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
which is a crime that you can go to jail for or pay a ten thousand dollar fine in most states.

29:27.000 --> 29:34.000
So is this another like being the richest man in the world means certain laws effectively don't apply to you?

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
Yeah. And I think when you use an excuse like Covid, you're kind of letting everyone off the hook.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
But when you're on the record, ironically on Twitter, right?

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
Saying that this Covid is kind of bullshit. I mean, I.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
It's clear that he is a very sporadic individual.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
And I think, you know, he he made this offer to purchase Twitter.

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
Then he realized what a pain in the ass running Twitter would be and then decided to bail on it.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
And now he's in a hard spot.

30:02.000 --> 30:10.000
And also, I could honestly just because of how rich he is and just how his personality, I could see him just not wanting to go to court.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
Not even not even because of discovery, but just simply because, you know, it's a big it's a big waste of time.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
He doesn't have time for that. He's got like SpaceX and Tesla to run.

30:19.000 --> 30:25.000
Yeah. OK. But I mean, I'm just going to argue my own case here because those text messages are spicy.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
I'd love to see a little cross examination on some of those conversations.

30:28.000 --> 30:37.000
And I'm not clear, but these might actually have been Twitter DMS because in the messages, all the all the news agencies have have extracted this and they just print them.

30:37.000 --> 30:45.000
They don't actually like show screenshots. But in the messages, Calacanis, Jason Calacanis says maybe we should stop talking about Twitter on Twitter.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
And then then the end of then that's the end of the messages. So I think these were like DMS.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
So it's a mix. It depends on who it is.

30:52.000 --> 31:01.000
Ah, OK. Oh, sure. That makes sense. Right. OK. Right. Yeah. So what's leaked now, though, which is really quite spicy, is Elon Musk and Calacanis.

31:01.000 --> 31:09.000
We're talking about how to use the return to office mandates as essentially, quote, a gentleman's what they call it.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
Let me get a gentleman's. What would they call it? Is it like a George W Bush gentleman?

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
See, no, it's anyhow. I always got to get Bush either. And I got to find a way to get some in here. I'll get there.

31:19.000 --> 31:29.000
Yeah, you. Oh, well, that was kind of it right there. But they call it like it's basically a gentleman's firing or a gentleman's layoff where the employee quits.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
Well, you don't have to pay severance. Oh, right. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

31:34.000 --> 31:42.000
So it's it's you kind of use these return to office mandates as cover for laying off staff.

31:42.000 --> 31:52.000
And it's funny because they just kind of talk about it openly. It's like you need to get your revenue per employee down if the economy is bad, recession fears are mounting.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
So, you know, just use these mandates as a gentleman's layoff to get rid of like 20 percent of your staff.

31:57.000 --> 32:07.000
And Calacanis actually sends them like some math where he how he expects it would go and must respond something like, yeah, there's an insane potential for improvement or something like he must.

32:07.000 --> 32:16.000
Musk didn't really engage a lot, but Calacanis boy was Jason just all over Elon Sack as soon as the news came out about Twitter.

32:16.000 --> 32:22.000
He's crushing. He's crushing a bit. Oh, it's it's embarrassing. He wants to run Twitter.

32:22.000 --> 32:28.000
So he is just all over Musk. He wants he wants to take care of it. You know, he wants to be.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
You know, let me let me just do it for you. Let me get in there, boss. Let me take care of it.

32:32.000 --> 32:42.000
So he actually writes, Put me in the game, coach. Twitter CEO is my dream job. Board member, advisor, whatever. You have my sword.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
It's so embarrassing. They're ruining Lord of the Rings for me. This is how billionaires talk to each other.

32:47.000 --> 32:55.000
Well, OK, there the comedy is just gold. But, you know, the art and business, he's actually right.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
If you look at these numbers and you compare them to Facebook, I will never call it meta.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
It's Facebook till the day Mark Zuckerberg hopefully gets indicted.

33:04.000 --> 33:13.000
Well, sorry, I just had a little a little excitement flutter there. Twitter is an incredibly company if you compare it to its peers.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
And if we even new numbers for tick tock, I'm pretty sure it's just embarrassing.

33:18.000 --> 33:26.000
Right. This is super bad. Even Facebook, who is having a tough time right now, is doing like seriously like orders of magnitude better.

33:26.000 --> 33:33.000
I think Instagram alone, if you could somehow get it out of the Facebook board cube, might be a better business than Twitter.

33:33.000 --> 33:50.000
Yeah, that's what their math was is basically their their Elon and mostly Calacanis came to the conclusion that you got to cut about 5000 employees at Twitter of its 8000 workers to get it to the profitability range that Google and Apple and Facebook see for workers per worker.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
It makes me wonder what the hell was going on with Twitter for all these years.

33:54.000 --> 34:03.000
First of all, that's a lot of headcount for a company that charges me three bucks a month to have a purple background or whatever blue bought me that I still don't understand.

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
You know, it does strike me that it is the newest of all of these companies and not true.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
Tick tock. Oh, sure. Yeah. But tick tocks a Chinese run operation.

34:13.000 --> 34:20.000
It isn't snap newer, although snaps an awful business to do so. I mean, I'm talking like U.S. V.C. fueled tech companies. Right. Yeah. OK.

34:20.000 --> 34:29.000
And you've probably seen this, but every V.C. company that I was either a contractor for or an employee for or, you know, just saw how it worked.

34:29.000 --> 34:34.000
One of the things that struck me is sort of this insatiable drive to hire.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
And they didn't necessarily always think of it as a good thing.

34:37.000 --> 34:46.000
They almost saw it in all cases as this massive burden that they have to carry, that there is just this monumental amount of hiring that they must do.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
It's bull. They love it because the bigger the more people you have under you, the bigger your kingdom is.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
They love it. Well, it's crazy, right?

34:54.000 --> 35:10.000
So I think a lot of these just straight up V.C. funded companies that especially in the later era of it just hired like mad just just went horizontally wide as fast as possible, consuming as many hires as possible.

35:10.000 --> 35:16.000
I mean, I'm telling you, man, I was at places where it would be common for a dozen people a week to get hired.

35:16.000 --> 35:23.000
And I watched a company go from one hundred people to twelve hundred people in like a year or two.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
Like it was just crazy. And then and then mergers happen and then you add another thousand to others.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
And both sides of the merger are still doing their standard hiring.

35:31.000 --> 35:37.000
It's been insane for a long time. And you just got huge staff numbers.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
Well, I think that's going to have a little break for a while, though.

35:41.000 --> 35:48.000
Yeah. But so there's another kind of big thing that clared at me, was glaring to me in this.

35:48.000 --> 35:59.000
So far, almost every week for about the last four weeks, we have had some I mean, we can make fun of Calacanis is very strange Aragorn reference, but he's not a dummy.

35:59.000 --> 36:05.000
Right. He's a shrewd business dude. And Elon Musk is obviously the richest man in the world.

36:05.000 --> 36:15.000
And I don't know, man, they all seem to agree that things are going to get rocky economy wise.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
And I we've been saying it for for a couple of months at least.

36:19.000 --> 36:28.000
Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know how closely you follow Chris, the housing market, but mortgage rates could possibly hit seven percent.

36:28.000 --> 36:36.000
Do you know how devastating that would be for any like first time homebuyer, the ripple effects on people being unable to sell their homes because mortgages would be too hard to get.

36:36.000 --> 36:44.000
But on top of that, just the house building industry is one of the largest employment sectors of the U.S. economy.

36:44.000 --> 36:50.000
A lot of independent real estate agents, renters are going to get hosed because, you know, it trickles down.

36:50.000 --> 37:06.000
But in the bad way. Yeah, it's an interesting time because what these techs reveal is that some of these layoffs and they just openly talk about they just openly talk about Apple and Google's layoffs as if the Apple policy was actually about thinning the herd.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
They're just like they in their CEO world, that's just foregone conclusion.

37:12.000 --> 37:21.000
And yet in the space that we inhabit, we're still debating, is there actually going to be a pullback in hiring? Is there going to be a slowdown in employment?

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
Are these employees, are these companies doing these return to work mandates to try to thin the herd or not?

37:27.000 --> 37:35.000
Like we're like people at are at the like worker level are like still debating these things amongst each other as if what are they actually doing?

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
Hopefully not anymore. But they are so far removed.

37:38.000 --> 37:48.000
Like they're they've decided like it's obvious to them that they're operating at a different level, but it really does line up with what we've been suspecting.

37:48.000 --> 37:55.000
And I really kind of wanted to just underscore like. This whole work for home debate that's been going on.

37:55.000 --> 38:01.000
I think we now know we now see part of it was about just reducing head counts.

38:01.000 --> 38:08.000
It kind of created this entire debate, this whole like this whole thing. But the reality was the companies were just once again being cold calculated companies.

38:08.000 --> 38:20.000
And what I would like the audience to take away from this is how these CEOs and these individuals speak to each other, how they think about things, the reality that they're living in.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
And so when we have conversations in the future, we can reflect back on this.

38:24.000 --> 38:33.000
Like when we're talking about the state of the economy, they're just openly talking about recession fears and reducing head counts without making it look like we're trying to do that.

38:33.000 --> 38:39.000
So that way we don't spook investors. They're not exactly saying that, but that is what they're doing there.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
They talk about their employees and their, quote, family, right?

38:42.000 --> 38:51.000
The whole family nonsense that they like to say, the way Magic the Gathering players talk about, you know, summoning a different creature or changing their I'm kidding.

38:51.000 --> 38:59.000
I get it, like changing their deck. We're going to slot in a raging goblet instead of, you know, Wallinore elves. Right. There you go.

38:59.000 --> 39:09.000
It's. Is it possible and I'm going to fry some rainbow San Francisco bacon for because I it's the Silicon Valley, right, San Francisco close enough.

39:09.000 --> 39:18.000
Yeah, that's some of this is really the hangover from the insane valuations and kind of overheated V.C. market of the last five to 10 years.

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right. I mean, it's got to be that eight thousand head count number.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
I must have missed it this morning. That is what the hell are those people doing at Twitter?

39:28.000 --> 39:35.000
I love Twitter. I'm on it all the time trying to keep trying to keep a ruby on rails app going.

39:35.000 --> 39:40.000
It's mostly Java now, I think. But yeah. Yeah, I know. I just was a shot. I got it.

39:40.000 --> 39:48.000
I had to get it in there. Do you think maybe it is a transition that these businesses are quietly trying to make from an expansionary?

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
You're expected to grow, grow, grow, grow, grow to now you're expected to be a cash cow.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
You're expected to have a you know, a little bit of a stash and you're going to survive off that.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
You're going to hunker down on your value products and you're going to and you're going to weather a recession.

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
And the market, I think when you look at what the investors are looking to put their money into for a little while,

40:07.000 --> 40:13.000
I think they're transitioning from infinite expansion to cash cow value driven company.

40:13.000 --> 40:20.000
And so I think all these companies want to quietly attempt to make that pivot and they're going to emphasize those aspects of their business.

40:20.000 --> 40:27.000
And thinning the herd and tightening the belt is a signal to investors that you're going to be one of those value based companies.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
I could kind of see that. I mean, I guess I more see it as a trip to the Betty Ford clinic.

40:32.000 --> 40:38.000
Right. They're going to rehab because they got to kick that VC habit and you really don't want to publicly go through withdrawals.

40:38.000 --> 40:46.000
So there's there's an element to that, although I don't think they're going to rehab so much as they've like found some gum they can chew or something to get them through this.

40:46.000 --> 40:52.000
This is their Nicorette. Yeah, man. And as soon as that money tap turns back on, they're right there at the Spigot.

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
They're ready to go. They're they're getting hooked on this stuff. I see. I think that's that's where I don't agree.

40:58.000 --> 41:03.000
I think the Spigot, the water pressure, so to speak, was so high. It was stupid.

41:03.000 --> 41:09.000
Right. In fact, the fact that I didn't raise VC money for Alice when I could have. Yeah, such a jackass.

41:09.000 --> 41:15.000
But I know. Thanks. Chris is like, I've been telling you that for 13 years. I know he's like, I don't know.

41:15.000 --> 41:26.000
I don't think it could ever go back because I mean, people were literally if you weren't in like a major area with lots of VCs like California and New York, you didn't see these meetings too much.

41:26.000 --> 41:34.000
But guys would come in and be like, it's Uber for erasers or whatever the dumbass idea was.

41:34.000 --> 41:40.000
And they'd walk out with a check. Yeah. And a vision that was bold, you know. Oh, yeah. You got it. They were disruptors.

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
The number two pencil market is it would be ridiculous stuff. Uber for erasers.

41:46.000 --> 41:52.000
Yeah, I love it. I love it. You know, what's taken off over here actually is Airbnb for pools.

41:52.000 --> 42:00.000
Do you have that in your neck of the woods? No, because the alligators have an HOA and you have to ask them first. What do you mean Airbnb for pools?

42:00.000 --> 42:08.000
I mean, it is what it sounds like. Like if you got a pool or a hot tub at your house, you can put it on this like swimly app or whatever it's called.

42:08.000 --> 42:15.000
I don't know. Maybe somebody will find it. And you list it on there. And then people come rent out your pool for a couple of hours using this app.

42:15.000 --> 42:23.000
You get a bunch of weirdos swimming in your pool. Okay. And if someone gets hurt at your pool, aren't you super duper liable for that?

42:23.000 --> 42:31.000
I don't know, man. It seems pretty risky. Could you imagine like walking out and finding somebody just floating in your pool and you're like, oh, God, now I got to launch the app and even figure out what their name is.

42:31.000 --> 42:42.000
Well, yeah. Because like when I used to have a pool back in Plant City, I was told very clearly by a very nice inspector that you better keep your gate locked at all times.

42:42.000 --> 42:50.000
Because one, it's illegal not to unless you're physically like there. And two, if someone drowns or gets injured in your pool, like dumbass kids, right?

42:50.000 --> 42:56.000
Go play in your pool when you're not home. You're on the hook. If you didn't have it gated and locked, if they break in, they break in.

42:56.000 --> 43:04.000
Wes Payne coming in with the link. It is Swimply. Rent your own private pool by the hour.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
Please, people, if you're using that service, have very, very good insurance.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
I bet you it must include insurance, right? It's got to.

43:12.000 --> 43:19.000
All right. I will bet you one vintage coater or coaster, because I found a stack of them, that it does not.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Okay. All right.

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
Can you take this action? All right. So for next week, somebody find out.

43:24.000 --> 43:31.000
I don't know if I have another one I can trade. They also apparently they let you list your tennis. You can list a tennis court.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Oh, my God.

43:32.000 --> 43:39.000
With Swimply and you can rent anything. Swimply really wants to know my location for every page I load.

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
But Swimply spaces from sport courts and large backyards to home gyms and music studios.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Oh, studios.

43:46.000 --> 43:51.000
Wait a minute. Is this the Craigslist casual encounter page in a new form?

43:51.000 --> 44:02.000
Yeah. I mean, I'll tell you what, if I could rent a studio when I'm traveling easily through an app, I would.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
You wouldn't believe what we did to that Airbnb.

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
I almost worry about, I almost wonder if I shouldn't say it on air, but we put it all back.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
We restored everything.

44:12.000 --> 44:28.000
So we had an Airbnb with like six bedrooms and 100 pillows, and so we literally took the mattresses out of every single room, every blanket, every pillow, every big comforter, whatever we could find.

44:28.000 --> 44:35.000
And we stuffed it all into the dining room to create a temporary recording space for the episodes we recorded down at the Airbnb.

44:35.000 --> 44:41.000
And I was going through all this and I'm just thinking to myself, maybe I should just rent a studio.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
You know, save myself some effort.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
So if I could have hopped on Swimply.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Jesus Christ.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
Tailscale.com slash coder.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
This is a big deal.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
This is a zero config VPN that you can get up and running in minutes.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
It's going to take care of your firewall rules.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
It's going to navigate your double gnats, even your carrier grade double gnats if you got some.

45:07.000 --> 45:12.000
It makes it possible to feel like you're working in one flat network across all your devices.

45:12.000 --> 45:22.000
Systems on a VPS, VM, hardware boxes, Linux machines, phones, tablets, Android, iOS, you name it man.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
You can put Tailscale on it and then you build out a flat mesh network protected by WireGuard.

45:28.000 --> 45:36.000
It's so slick and you can do really, really handy things if you have a device that you couldn't install Tailscale on for some reason.

45:36.000 --> 45:44.000
For example, I have a solar controller that manages and monitors the incoming wattage from the fireball in the sky.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
And it's just a hardware appliance.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
Maybe it's embedded Linux on there, but I can't get access to it.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
So I can't install Tailscale on that.

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
But Tailscale has this super slick, easy to use feature called subnet routing.

45:56.000 --> 46:01.000
You tell one of your machines on that LAN, hey, I want you to advertise the subnet over here.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Then you enable that feature.

46:03.000 --> 46:08.000
And then your other Tailscale devices, they now know that if they want to talk to a device on that LAN,

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
they can route through that Tailscale machine that you turned on subnet routing.

46:12.000 --> 46:21.000
So it lets me get access to my appliance devices through a Raspberry Pi on my LAN running Tailscale from all of my devices.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
And I've put this on each one of my LANs.

46:23.000 --> 46:30.000
So I have a flat network across my studio, my home, my mobile devices, my kids' computers.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
It's so handy.

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
I even put it in my VMwares, especially in my VMs, you know, when I'm working on a project.

46:36.000 --> 46:41.000
I'll put it in my VMwares, and I'll get access to my VMwares machines remotely.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
It's actually not VMware, but I just thought that was a fun way to say it.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
And then I get it installed in my VM, and I can go home and keep working on my project,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
accessing my VM just like it's a local box.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
It's so powerful.

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
Every device on my network gets a stable IP on every single one of my networks.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
So I just now use that IP, and Tailscale is smart enough that if you're on the same LAN,

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
it'll just transfer over the LAN.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
It doesn't, like, route out to the internet first.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
It's so, so great.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
And you can connect using your existing identity provider.

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
So if you've got single sign-on going, you know, you're big on your single sign-ons,

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Tailscale's all about it.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Here's the best part, though.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
You can use it for free, up to 20 machines.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Yep.

47:21.000 --> 47:26.000
And they got, like, this AirDrop Tailscale send feature, so you can Tailscale send between all your machines.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
They got Tailscale SSH, so you can just take care of SSH logins between all your machines.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
It's so...

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
It's like, I'm telling you, man.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
I'm telling you.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
I'm like Batman right now, telling you about how I'm Bruce Wayne, and this is my secret power,

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
is this Tailscale thing.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Does this make sense?

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
Maybe a Superman analogy would be better here, but what I'm trying to tell you is,

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
I'm revealing just some of my secrets, some of my sauce, if you will.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
So go check it out.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Try it for yourself.

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
Go to tailscale.com slash coder, support the show, and try it for free, up to 20 devices,

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
and you know what?

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
Change that game, because it's a game changer.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
Tailscale.com slash coder.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
All right, well, I thought we'd round out this episode with a little something we know,

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
but it does put a little logic to what we witness from Google.

48:12.000 --> 48:18.000
This is a Reddit comments, in theory, by a Google employee, and he tells us about,

48:18.000 --> 48:24.000
or they tell us about the LPA cycle, launch, promo, and abandon.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
They write, the career progression and promotion at Google is based on move the needle,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
AKA launches.

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
You launch a service or a major overhaul, and you put it in your promo package.

48:34.000 --> 48:41.000
No one ever gets promoted for maintaining or fixing something broken.

48:41.000 --> 48:46.000
No, it's all about launching and then putting the launch in your promo package.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
When something like Stadia or any other service launches,

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
you always see an immediate slowdown in development and features.

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
It's because all experienced and ambitious engineers leave the project very shortly after launch,

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
because there's no promo food to get anymore.

49:02.000 --> 49:08.000
So they leave for the new project or team where they can get more credits towards a promo.

49:08.000 --> 49:13.000
The people that remain are those that can not easily transfer teams,

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
i.e. inexperienced or sometimes just poor engineers.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
You see it all the time with Google products, rapid development and activity until the launch,

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
and then everything grinds to a halt.

49:24.000 --> 49:29.000
So they call it the LPA cycle, launch, promo, abandon,

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
and it's been that way since 2012 since they worked at Google.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
Like it's just the way it's been at Google forever.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000
Doesn't that kind of play out with observations that we have about Google products?

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
Like they launch and there's so much innovation right as they launch,

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
and then they just sort of pedal out. They fade.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
That feels so real.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
That might be like the dopest album of the summer,

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
even though we're already in the fall. That hit me.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
So anyways, and that sounds like a structural issue at Google.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
But you know what? You got to get those OKRs.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
You got to get those key results for your OKRs.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
Oh, God. Go fill out a TPS report. Come on. It's fun.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Boost a gram.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
All right. We did get some boosts, and we got, wow, check out this baller boost

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
that we got from DPG, and this is some great news.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
I'm very excited to read this.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
He says, for 100,000 sats,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
Hey, Mike and Chris, coming in with a big boost to say thank you for the amazing work you

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
and the entirety of the Jupiter Broadcasting and the community do.

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
After seven years of retail, I accepted my first IT job,

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
and I cannot understate how much Jupiter Broadcasting has played a role.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
So here's to many episodes, DPG.

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
And if you're ever in Pittsburgh, I have gin with your name on it.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Whoa.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
We got to get up to Pittsburgh.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Let's go to the airport.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Could you imagine spending all that money just to go get some gin?

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
Although it would be pretty great. And DPG, congratulations.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
That is massive, man.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
Switching from retail to IT is a huge, that's a whole lane change, man.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
And congratulations.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
I'm going to call that, we haven't done it in years,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I'm going to call that a Coderadio success story.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Hey, there you go. There you go.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
I'm not exactly sure how much credit we can take.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Take it all.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
What are you talking about?

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Let's go text Larry Allison.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
He'll give us all the credit.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Yeah, you're right. All of it.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Alex Gates boosted with 10,000 sats.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Wow.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
This is truly the real BSD paradise.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Incorrect because you spelt it wrong.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
You mean OS X and I needed to see a snow leopard.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Yeah, where's the big X?

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
10,000 sats, just a troll.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
That's beautiful.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
You know what? Keep it up.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I agree. I'm all for it. I'm here for the trolls.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Double boost.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Yeah, we got ourselves a double boost.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
10,001 sats.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Regarding our chat about the next Knight Rider,

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Alex is waiting for Dave Jones, who's the pod sage,

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
to boost in about his old truck with no computer.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
And I thought we'd get these notes.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Listeners that got old cars that are just like

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
from the 80s,

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
from the early 90s,

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
maybe before 96,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
before they built in OBD2,

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
that are just totally low tech,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
off the grid cars.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
That's got to be a thing that's going to become more and more popular

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
as these car manufacturers

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
build in these super complex technology stacks

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
that hardly work.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Remember that Mazda story I think it was we heard about?

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
That got stuck on the NPR station?

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Oh yeah, yeah.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Because of the JPEG.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Oh man, could you imagine?

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Just not...

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
And now you're listening to NPR

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
because apparently you're driving a Mazda.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
It's just not happening, man. It's not happening.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
iOS family IT guy

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
boosted in with 2,000 sats.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Boost!

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
My wife got the first of many iOS devices

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
in our family.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
In three days, she will be upgrading iOS devices

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
for the first time.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
From our iPhone 6S Plus

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
to the iPhone 14 Plus.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Tried to show her how my 13 works

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
so she won't immediately hate the shift to no button.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Oh man, that is a tricky move.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
That's a big jump.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
My wife was not looking forward to that either.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
But I actually don't think it was

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
that big of a transition inevitably.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
She doesn't really mention it at all now.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
But I actually don't think it was

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
that big of a transition inevitably.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
And I think she's got the 11

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
and she went from

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
I think the 6S as well.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
You know, the funny thing about the iPhone

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
is I think it has a reputation

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
for being cutting edge and revolutionary.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
But the reality is

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
they're very conservative with that stuff.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
They only make

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
radical change like that

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
every now and then. It's more like

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
slow, iterative, boring

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
with every now and then

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
a big new feature. And that's when

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
they'll change things out. So

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
they'll do that button removal. But they did that

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
in the iPhone X and we're on the 14 now.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
And they're probably not adding the button back any time soon.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
And there won't be probably another radical UI

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
shift for a long time.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
I would imagine.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Until it's glasses.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
We have

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
four legged emo boosted in with a row of

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
ducks. 2222

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
sets.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Loaded with talent.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Chris has got me having second thoughts

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
on Calix. Maybe I should give Graphene OS

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
a go. You should not.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
You know, this is the funny thing, Mike, about Android

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
ROM stuff is there's still

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
all these compromises you have to make.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
That's why you should not.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I'm not totally convinced

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
you're any worse off with an iPhone that you

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
just never log into Google or iCloud

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
backend stuff with. Like to an extent you have to

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
log into iCloud and especially to get the app store.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
So there is

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
data leakage to Apple.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
But in order to make Graphene OS fully

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
usable, I ended up logging

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
into the Play Store. It's sandboxed.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
But I am logged into the Play Store

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
on this device. So I'm not really

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
sure. Have I really

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
improved anything from an iPhone?

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I'm not really clear about that. I think

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
with Calix there is a step up

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
because Calix is using Micro G

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
which does require some forged

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
signatures at least for now and does

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
potentially at least have a

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
really small exploit that people are concerned

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
about and is not sandboxed.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
So that's why Calix didn't really

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
appeal to me where Graphene OS

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
has a better security model and it sandboxes

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
the Play Services and the Play Store.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
But ultimately

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I'm just not really sure if I'm any better off than I would

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
be with an iPhone. And I'd be curious to know what the audience

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
thinks. And then maybe I'll stop talking about

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
it. Because it is, I don't know.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I think I've probably

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
extended my welcome on that topic.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Mr. Quackers boosted

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
with the row of ducks as well.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
And I got to meet

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
S-U-R-C-D at the Portland meetup.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
He also sent in a

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
row of ducks.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
The meetup in Portland was

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
great. Everywhere.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Every single meetup. Coder fans.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
There's not a meetup we went to

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
where there weren't Coder fans.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Everybody wants the robe back.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I think people, there's a lot

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
of people out there looking for the robe.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
But you know the supply chain is still

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
screwed up from when I first did the

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
robes. Like it's not really

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
much. It might be better.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
I got to look into it I suppose. Because it's getting to that

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
season. It's getting into robe season.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
So I think I'll have to look into that

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
again. So you never know.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I mean right now I feel like I got

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
to focus on the uniform. I got to get this figured

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
out. I had to get dressed this morning.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
It was a disaster. I'm still

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
half packed from the road trip.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I mean this is today.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Today was a uniform day.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
I've only been back. I've only been back for like

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
just over 24 hours.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Even in uniform.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Got to get the uniform. Alright Mr.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Dominic is there anywhere you want to send the folks

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
this week? Follow me at Twitter

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
at Dumanuco. Who knows I might buy it.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
And of course you should mention the Mad Botter Inc

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
at the Mad Botter Inc on the Twitters.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Yep. Go to alice.dev if you want to learn more about that.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
I'm on there too.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
I don't tweet much at Chris Elias.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
The podcast is at Coder Radio Show.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
I think the real spot you want to hang out is our Matrix Room.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
We've got a dedicated Coder chat.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
You just go to coder.show

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
slash matrix. They'll take you right to the

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
room. And all the different Matrix details

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
jupiterbroadcasting.com

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
slash matrix. I haven't mentioned this for a few episodes.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
We have a brand new shiny website

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
built by our community and they're

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
adding features almost on the daily.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
So if you haven't checked out the new jupiterbroadcasting.com

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
go give it a little

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
looksies and go get yourself

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Then you support the new podcasting

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
features like the transcripts,

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
the chapters, the host information

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
and of course boosts

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
and a lot more like down the road

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
alternative enclosures, live streams

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
in the podcast app, so much more

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
newpodcastapps.com

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
and it is a new quarter which means

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
we have a Coderly in

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
the works. Our schedules are a little busy

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
but when we kind of figure things out

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
probably in the next week or so we'll get a

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Coderly recorded and published for our

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
members as a thank you for all

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
of you who support us over at coderqa.co

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
or jupiter.party

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
We love doing the Coderly and it's

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
just about time so we'll get that out soon.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
And thank you for being members and supporting the

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
show. We do appreciate that.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Alright that's it. We'd love to have you join us next

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
You can also watch the replay of the

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
unedited raw version

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
for some reason. Maybe you

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
like to see the sausage being made. Weirdo.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
It's over at jupiter.tube

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
