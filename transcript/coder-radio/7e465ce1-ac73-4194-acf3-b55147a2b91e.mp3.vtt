00:00.000 --> 00:15.720
This is KOTORadio, episode 476 for July 25th, 2022.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.240
Hey there good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking

00:19.240 --> 00:25.500
a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development in the world of technology.

00:25.500 --> 00:30.240
My name is Chris and sitting there with a very, very special hat, it's our host, Mr.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.240
Dominic.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.240
Hello, Mike.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.240
Hello.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.240
Hello.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.240
Hello, sir.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.240
I like the whole vibe today.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.440
You feel like, I don't know, in my ears, you just feel closer.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.440
It's intimate.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.160
It's like you're right here whispering into my ear.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.160
Love it.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.000
I think it's this new audio pipeline.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.920
Anyways, I saw the news that you got yourself one of them little baby launches.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.640
Yeah, it's a review unit.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.640
I'm using it right now.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.400
So I don't know if you could hear that.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.040
It's quieter, isn't it?

00:55.040 --> 00:56.040
It's quieter.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.040
It's smaller.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.040
Is it much smaller?

00:58.040 --> 00:59.800
Yeah, I'm going to live in it a little longer.

00:59.800 --> 01:00.800
It's not that much.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
It's weirdly smaller.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
Okay.

01:02.800 --> 01:08.360
I definitely could see who the user for this is, though for my money, I think I prefer

01:08.360 --> 01:13.320
the classic launch, particularly because you know that USB hub is super helpful.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.860
So when it's smaller, what did they sacrifice?

01:15.860 --> 01:19.640
Does it not have the F keys and like, does it not have the home and page up buttons along

01:19.640 --> 01:20.640
the side?

01:20.640 --> 01:21.640
What was, what was?

01:21.640 --> 01:22.840
It has the home and page up.

01:22.840 --> 01:28.320
The arrows are aligned like, so the right arrow is aligned with the end key and there's

01:28.320 --> 01:30.160
no space between them.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.480
The number and function row is one combination row.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.280
I'm looking at mine right now as you talk.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.920
So I'm like, I'm like visualizing it as you.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.920
Okay.

01:38.920 --> 01:39.920
Hmm.

01:39.920 --> 01:40.920
Good experience.

01:40.920 --> 01:44.760
I got, I got the pink switches, the quiet switches, which I, you know, I'm usually more

01:44.760 --> 01:48.680
of a middle of the road kind of clicky guys, but this isn't bad.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.800
I mean, I do type a one L I think I have enough muscle memory for the bigger one.

01:52.800 --> 01:58.080
One that it is something of a change, but I could see people who maybe are just ever

01:58.080 --> 02:01.360
so slightly more desks and strains wanting this.

02:01.360 --> 02:05.940
The only additional thing I think I would want that might make me like this model better

02:05.940 --> 02:09.120
than the classic launch is for its small size.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.880
It really should be wireless.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.080
Oh, wireless would be killer.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.200
Cause then it'd be like a fancy like magic keyboard replacement.

02:16.200 --> 02:20.120
Now I can understand when it's a USB hub, USB hub and whatnot, why you couldn't have

02:20.120 --> 02:21.120
one wireless.

02:21.120 --> 02:28.680
But interesting, maybe that's a launch three, you know, you never know, you never know.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.960
You got to figure too, they got to make it smaller if they're ever going to get it built

02:30.960 --> 02:32.940
into a laptop.

02:32.940 --> 02:36.720
So if they're ever going to get it into a laptop, they got to keep working that down.

02:36.720 --> 02:42.320
Chunky pie wrote into the show and he's feeling the call of the M says, I love listening to

02:42.320 --> 02:45.200
you guys talk about programming in four 75.

02:45.200 --> 02:49.080
Uh, he says your conversation over declarative UI was interesting.

02:49.080 --> 02:56.320
I hate programming UIs and dealing with all the text boxes, buttons and screen sizes.

02:56.320 --> 03:01.360
Now here's the thing, Mike, he says, I love Linux and I love supporting made for Linux

03:01.360 --> 03:07.640
laptops, but guys, those new M one and M two Mac books are sexy.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.800
I can't wait till Asahi Linux is 100% baked.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.520
I think I'm going to have to get an M two or an M three at that point.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.720
Love what you're doing.

03:16.720 --> 03:23.120
Now I think you'll recall that your humble co-host here proclaimed that he was concerned

03:23.120 --> 03:29.380
that over the years, and I think it's been about a year since he made this concern public,

03:29.380 --> 03:34.360
he was concerned that we would see a drainage to the Mac from the Linux community, much

03:34.360 --> 03:40.240
like we did when the whole genome three unity situation happened.

03:40.240 --> 03:44.580
We saw a big exodus to the Intel Mac platform and then that happened to be right around

03:44.580 --> 03:46.720
when Apple did a processor transition.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.960
Here we are again, Apple's doing a processor transition and I feel like we're going to

03:50.960 --> 03:55.860
see a big exodus to the Mac and I think we have, I kind of actually think my prediction

03:55.860 --> 03:59.720
has bared out just based on a lot of anecdotal data.

03:59.720 --> 04:05.600
Yeah, I think it's, it's, uh, in fact we have something to show from a John Grouper, which

04:05.600 --> 04:10.600
I know is super Apple fan person, but you can't, you can't fight the numbers and the

04:10.600 --> 04:15.360
power efficiency on these M1 chips and M2 chips, but more of the M1s.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.240
That's something the industry just needs to catch up to.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.640
I mean, there's really no two ways about it.

04:19.640 --> 04:26.560
The situation with multi monitors and high DPI and high refresh rate, while it's not

04:26.560 --> 04:31.180
like amazing on the Mac, it's so much better than Linux.

04:31.180 --> 04:38.640
Our buddy Brent is down at Alex's house and Alex has a bunch of nice screens and Brent's

04:38.640 --> 04:43.000
kind of experiencing for the first time what it's like when you have an NVIDIA GPU and

04:43.000 --> 04:48.120
you got some high DPI, high refresh rate screens and using the plasma desktop and things sometimes

04:48.120 --> 04:53.080
just don't work, they get rearranged, the monitors get weird refresh issues.

04:53.080 --> 04:57.060
Like there's, he's running into all these problems and I have to tell you, I have heard

04:57.060 --> 05:00.680
from a lot of people in the audience that like, yeah, I got a Mac book, it's just worked

05:00.680 --> 05:04.520
so good with my external monitors, you know, the battery lasts all day.

05:04.520 --> 05:09.680
Funix enough, right, I don't really hear about a lot of people defecting to Windows.

05:09.680 --> 05:14.520
You hear about the WSL stories and how it's great, but those are existing Windows users,

05:14.520 --> 05:15.520
right?

05:15.520 --> 05:20.720
But I hear a lot of Linux users converting to the Mac.

05:20.720 --> 05:24.760
You and I both know a former Linux podcaster who's no longer a Linux podcaster who switched

05:24.760 --> 05:27.760
to the Mac.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.600
I don't know, I think it'll ebb and flow, to be honest with you.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.360
I think the Linux desktop is in kind of this vulnerable transition point right now where

05:34.360 --> 05:38.440
we don't have open source NVIDIA drivers, but in a year or two, that's going to be really

05:38.440 --> 05:39.680
solid.

05:39.680 --> 05:46.120
We're really on, like we're seeing good momentum on the transition to Wayland, but not really

05:46.120 --> 05:47.120
fully there yet.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.120
It doesn't work for everybody.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.640
There's a lot of things like that right now.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.640
We'll see.

05:51.640 --> 05:54.960
Stone writes in, he says, hello, long time listener, first time caller.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.600
I was listening to the latest Coder episode and wanted to drop my two cents on the declarative

05:58.600 --> 06:00.720
UI portion of the show.

06:00.720 --> 06:06.640
For background, I'm a Flutter developer and I have been working in Flutter since sometime

06:06.640 --> 06:08.080
during the V1 release.

06:08.080 --> 06:13.720
I also work in ReactJS and I've tried my hand at Xamarin or I think it's maybe Xamarin,

06:13.720 --> 06:17.880
React Native and even a little bit of UW Piskis.

06:17.880 --> 06:23.280
To the point of write once and it looks great everywhere, I have to say Flutter is the closest

06:23.280 --> 06:28.120
to this dream of all of the alternatives that have been discussed.

06:28.120 --> 06:33.320
Unlike other cross-platform frameworks, Flutter uses its own rendering engine, allowing for

06:33.320 --> 06:38.400
custom UI elements that really do look like the same thing no matter what platform it's

06:38.400 --> 06:39.560
running on.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.840
This is opposed to the way other cross-platform libraries work in which essentially just a

06:42.840 --> 06:47.180
library that translates to a native UI and makes it harder to have consistent look and

06:47.180 --> 06:51.920
feel across platforms like iOS, Android or the desktop.

06:51.920 --> 06:56.920
Now, I'm not saying it's perfect by any stretch of the imagination.

06:56.920 --> 07:01.400
Productive development, while technically officially supported, still runs rather horribly

07:01.400 --> 07:05.640
on mobile browsers and he goes on to say there is still an amount of work needed to make

07:05.640 --> 07:08.640
the UI adaptive based on device size.

07:08.640 --> 07:14.040
However, the overall polish, performance and ease of development outweighs the cons in

07:14.040 --> 07:16.040
my opinion.

07:16.040 --> 07:24.320
I've brought multiple production applications to market using Flutter and I think we'll

07:24.320 --> 07:29.020
only see more examples of this as the platform matures.

07:29.020 --> 07:35.040
One thing though, to warn anyone considering Flutter, at some point you will have to gain

07:35.040 --> 07:37.920
some basic knowledge in Swift and Kotlin.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.520
This is if you want to actually hook into the platform's native function, think like

07:41.520 --> 07:45.560
local authentication, where plugins are not available or you're just going to have to

07:45.560 --> 07:47.280
do something where you write it yourself.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.440
He says, looking forward to the upcoming meetups too.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.800
Yeah, you probably agree with this take.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.800
Yeah, for sure.

07:53.800 --> 07:59.240
This is, I mean, we keep hearing about the Flutter, what we call them, the Flutter birds

07:59.240 --> 08:01.360
keep chirping at us.

08:01.360 --> 08:06.080
I will say, Chris is right, like every other cross-platform framework, you're eventually

08:06.080 --> 08:07.880
going to have to drop under the hood.

08:07.880 --> 08:12.280
It might take a while, you might have to ship a few apps without doing it, but one day you're

08:12.280 --> 08:14.760
going to have to and just be prepared.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.440
Good input and feedback though.

08:17.440 --> 08:18.440
Thank you, Stone.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.440
I like hearing about that.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.480
I just, I got a tingle about Flutter recently.

08:21.480 --> 08:25.040
Just seeing more and more like just things in the community and whatnot of projects people

08:25.040 --> 08:26.120
are working on.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.960
Who knows?

08:27.960 --> 08:32.080
Maybe you can come tell me at some of our upcoming meetups, because holy smokes do we

08:32.080 --> 08:33.480
have some meetups.

08:33.480 --> 08:39.140
Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting, Friday, August 5th, 6pm local time.

08:39.140 --> 08:42.680
There is a meetup in London and I'm trying to think if there's anything else I need to

08:42.680 --> 08:47.120
relate to you about that, but the details are at the meetup.com page.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.080
And then we have all of the dates for our West Coast tour.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.460
Those are also at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

08:54.460 --> 08:55.780
Start signing up for that.

08:55.780 --> 09:03.440
And then last but not least, this is the big one, the tour lottery form.

09:03.440 --> 09:09.900
If you are in the Pasadena area and would like to get a tour of JPL, you can join the

09:09.900 --> 09:15.120
lottery at linuxunplug.com slash JPL.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.920
Really quick little form we have on Nextcloud.

09:16.920 --> 09:21.180
You fill that out and then we're going to run a little script to pick 15 names and probably

09:21.180 --> 09:24.480
five or so backups just in case somebody can't make it.

09:24.480 --> 09:30.640
We just ask that if you sign up that you can definitely be in the area when it is time,

09:30.640 --> 09:37.760
which is September 29th around 12.30pm in the Pasadena area at the JPL offices.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.760
So that's going to be pretty awesome, but it's such a limited availability.

09:40.760 --> 09:48.200
We had to do it as a lottery, so it's linuxunplug.com slash JPL for that.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.400
Linode.com slash coder.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.640
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and of course it's a great way

09:54.640 --> 09:56.280
to support the show.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.880
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.120
You really got to go try it.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.960
That's why they're giving you a hundred bucks to see what I'm talking about, because they

10:02.960 --> 10:05.800
do it so much better than everyone else.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.980
The best way to understand that is to experience it.

10:08.980 --> 10:12.840
And speaking of experience, if you're brand new to deploying a server, they've got a marketplace

10:12.840 --> 10:18.260
where you can deploy all kinds of useful things, like a system ready to go with Docker or Git

10:18.260 --> 10:19.420
lab instance.

10:19.420 --> 10:24.600
Perhaps you want Drupal or one that I just was looking at and I thought, geez, I should

10:24.600 --> 10:26.440
mention this on the show.

10:26.440 --> 10:32.980
They have Easy Panel, which is, well, as it says, it's an easy panel based on Docker that

10:32.980 --> 10:38.800
lets you deploy Node.js, Ruby, Python, PHP, Go, and Java applications in their intuitive

10:38.800 --> 10:39.800
control panel.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.040
It manages the SSL certs.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.600
You can even run commands on the command line through the browser interface.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.740
And of course it integrates with GitHub, so you can push and pull your code down to it.

10:49.740 --> 10:52.260
And that's just a one click deployment on Linode.

10:52.260 --> 10:56.340
And if you're a pro, they got options for you too, including guides that let you build

10:56.340 --> 10:58.720
systems up from the ground up.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.560
They even have bare metal rigs.

11:00.560 --> 11:05.800
And one of the back end features I love on Linode is their S3 compatible object storage.

11:05.800 --> 11:06.860
It's so handy.

11:06.860 --> 11:11.640
We use it for all kinds of storage for systems that are kind of always accumulating data,

11:11.640 --> 11:15.320
like our Nextcloud instance or our PeerTube instance, but it's also just a great way to

11:15.320 --> 11:19.800
distribute certain high availability files, like XML files for an RSS feed and things

11:19.800 --> 11:21.080
like that.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.600
And they've been doing this for nearly 19 years, so they've managed to build the best

11:24.600 --> 11:27.560
way to run applications on Linux in the cloud.

11:27.560 --> 11:31.280
With 11 data centers around the world, they are their own ISP, so their connection is

11:31.280 --> 11:32.400
super fast.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.940
And they're always investing back into the hardware.

11:34.940 --> 11:37.440
They just recently added MVMe PCI storage.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.880
Before that, they upgraded AMD EPYC processors.

11:40.880 --> 11:46.480
They've just launched a database as a service, service.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.800
There's probably a better way I could say that.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.800
But I think you know what I mean.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.720
I mean, I could just go on and on, but I think probably the best thing to do would be to

11:52.720 --> 11:54.860
get that $100 and try it.

11:54.860 --> 11:55.860
Why not get that $100?

11:55.860 --> 11:58.160
Leave it on the table and go support the show.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.240
Go to linode.com slash coder.

12:00.240 --> 12:05.080
Once again, that's linode.com slash coder.

12:05.080 --> 12:09.880
Well, John Gruber was feeling spicy this week.

12:09.880 --> 12:16.280
He's got Apple Silicon is an inconvenient truth as opposed to one of his, I guess, links.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.240
I don't know what he calls them.

12:18.240 --> 12:24.200
But he's calling out a trend that I've noticed and you may have noticed, but recently, certain

12:24.200 --> 12:33.520
review outlets like the Wirecutter and Ars Technica are excluding the MacBooks, the M

12:33.520 --> 12:35.800
series MacBooks from comparison.

12:35.800 --> 12:43.220
So they'll compare, say, the Surface Go 2 and they'll compare it against other X86 laptops,

12:43.220 --> 12:46.520
but they won't put the M series machines in there.

12:46.520 --> 12:53.480
And what's a little sticky about that, when they reviewed the Surface Go 1, they absolutely

12:53.480 --> 12:54.760
compared it against MacBooks.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.400
They were just Intel MacBooks at the time.

12:56.400 --> 13:01.220
But when they made the transition to the M series, they kind of quietly just stopped

13:01.220 --> 13:05.640
comparing the Intel laptops to the MacBooks.

13:05.640 --> 13:11.600
And Gruber writes that he's quite certain that the reviewers are just essentially leaving

13:11.600 --> 13:17.120
it out because they don't want to piss off the PC fans in their audience.

13:17.120 --> 13:21.760
And that he says, quote, Apple Silicon is profoundly an inconvenient truth for many

13:21.760 --> 13:28.000
computer enthusiasts who do not like Macs, so they've gone into denial.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.800
And to appease them, he postulates, Wirecutter, Ars and others are just taking the Macs out

13:34.800 --> 13:38.080
of the comparison altogether.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.240
Is that what's going on, do you think?

13:39.240 --> 13:42.240
Or is there maybe something less dramatic?

13:42.240 --> 13:44.320
I think there's a couple things going on, right?

13:44.320 --> 13:49.080
On the flame side, I would even add that, you know, people like to get review units,

13:49.080 --> 13:50.080
right?

13:50.080 --> 13:54.480
But pissing off the people is usually not done, right?

13:54.480 --> 13:55.480
You're right.

13:55.480 --> 14:00.620
Like if they make the surface book to look like a clown in the battery life department

14:00.620 --> 14:05.000
and in the temperature department, then there might not they might not get access to another

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
one.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Right.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.960
I mean, the reality is, if you're not, for some reason, bound to Windows, and you're

14:11.960 --> 14:17.440
just like, oh, you know, a regular non, let's say non Linux enthusiast.

14:17.440 --> 14:22.320
There's not a real good reason not to buy a Mac other than maybe price.

14:22.320 --> 14:26.220
But even then, those errors are pretty affordable, the M1 errors.

14:26.220 --> 14:32.880
So yeah, I kind of think this is Intel and AMD have to get their shit together.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.760
And the lead is pretty significant for Apple Silicon right now.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.880
I'll play devil's advocate just for fun.

14:38.880 --> 14:45.360
I'll say that perhaps what's going on now is just a realization in the marketplace that

14:45.360 --> 14:50.440
if you're buying a Windows laptop, there is probably a motivator that's putting you into

14:50.440 --> 14:52.520
the Windows ecosystem.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.160
And so you're not really in the market for a Mac.

14:55.160 --> 15:00.400
So it's probably more fair to compare the Macs against Macs and the X86 boxes against

15:00.400 --> 15:02.120
other Wintel systems.

15:02.120 --> 15:05.280
I mean, because you see, you could take this as far as, well, why isn't there an Ubuntu

15:05.280 --> 15:06.280
system in the mix?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.280
And right.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.400
Like, where do you draw the line?

15:08.400 --> 15:12.680
So they have to look at the actual consumer market and go, well, if you're shopping for

15:12.680 --> 15:14.920
a surface go, you're in the Windows ecosystem.

15:14.920 --> 15:19.860
So therefore we'll compare it to other comparable Windows ecosystem laptops.

15:19.860 --> 15:21.600
It's not a complete picture.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.800
It's like a slicing of the market.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.440
But maybe that's what's at play here.

15:25.440 --> 15:26.760
I mean, that does make sense.

15:26.760 --> 15:31.780
I would also say that price range stuff, particularly with the M2s and MacBook Pros, they could

15:31.780 --> 15:35.360
argue that, well, we're looking at a price budget and these are just way out of it.

15:35.360 --> 15:36.360
Yeah.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.920
Although the go, you know, I mean, the goes like the price of an air, right?

15:39.920 --> 15:41.080
I don't, I don't know for sure.

15:41.080 --> 15:46.080
But I so I think the point that Gruber makes in there because he makes this kind of ham

15:46.080 --> 15:48.600
fisted comparison to climate change deniers.

15:48.600 --> 15:53.080
And I think what I take from that comparison is.

15:53.080 --> 15:57.920
If he if they were demonstrating the benchmarks and the comparisons against the MacBook, it

15:57.920 --> 16:06.120
would put pressure on the PC OEMs to do better, to produce computers that consume less power,

16:06.120 --> 16:09.800
that produce less heat, that have faster disk drives.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.360
You know, he would put pressure on them to produce better machines.

16:13.360 --> 16:17.440
And so it'd be long term better for the entire market.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.280
I don't I don't think that's actually how things work.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.280
Right.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.280
Like what is Intel?

16:21.280 --> 16:25.800
OK, well, Intel will just, you know, crank the knob to faster and less power.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.880
Yeah, they're not going to do that.

16:27.880 --> 16:28.880
Right.

16:28.880 --> 16:29.880
Like Intel.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.240
I say AMD has something more of a chance.

16:33.240 --> 16:37.280
But even then, it's Apple really has a winner here with with this Apple.

16:37.280 --> 16:41.640
And I know people aren't going to like to hear that, but it's just the truth.

16:41.640 --> 16:46.240
Yeah, especially when you consider they've been able to scale it from watches to set

16:46.240 --> 16:50.640
top boxes, phones, tablets and something like the Mac Studio.

16:50.640 --> 16:51.960
Yeah, that's pretty impressive.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.160
I have to give it to them.

16:53.160 --> 16:56.160
OK, but let's talk about where they're not so impressive.

16:56.160 --> 17:04.800
This is both the most ridiculous small change ever and a monumental moment that took a decade

17:04.800 --> 17:08.120
to actually make happen.

17:08.120 --> 17:13.920
Netflix is rolling out an external subscription button for iOS users.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.520
Just to kind of give you some history here.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.700
This has been a back and forth for a long time.

17:18.700 --> 17:25.960
And back in 2018, Netflix just removed the ability to subscribe within Apple's ecosystem

17:25.960 --> 17:29.560
altogether because of Apple's 30 percent cut.

17:29.560 --> 17:33.320
So now there's a button in the app to subscribe.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.960
We hit that a message comes up that says, quote, you're about to leave the app and go

17:36.960 --> 17:39.000
to an external website.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.520
And then it also tells you that the transaction will have Apple have no responsibility if

17:44.520 --> 17:49.440
things go sideways and that subscription management will have to be done independently.

17:49.440 --> 17:50.440
You're not going to get that.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.280
You got to do that on Netflix's site.

17:52.280 --> 17:57.000
And once they once you clear that message, their page comes up and it's a pretty big

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
message, too.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.760
It's like a full screen modal dialog that comes up with big, bold text that tells you

18:03.760 --> 18:07.360
you're going somewhere dangerous, basically.

18:07.360 --> 18:11.560
But you get to do it and then you get to subscribe outside of the Apple ecosystem via the Web

18:11.560 --> 18:12.560
browser.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.560
Right.

18:13.560 --> 18:18.880
And the app developer in this case, Netflix gets to basically have that customer relationship,

18:18.880 --> 18:21.080
which is what they always wanted.

18:21.080 --> 18:24.640
Netflix just wants to be in a relationship with you, Chris.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.920
Yeah, directly.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.420
They don't want they don't want it to be a three way.

18:28.420 --> 18:30.360
They just want it to be a one on one thing.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.360
Nomination to.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.360
Yeah.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.400
This, though.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.400
It's so funny.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.400
Right.

18:35.400 --> 18:39.720
What we're talking about is ostensibly Netflix is now allowed to put a link that opens up

18:39.720 --> 18:43.600
the Web browser and shows a page where you can subscribe.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.100
That's all that's happened.

18:46.100 --> 18:51.280
And it's taken almost quite literally the run of this entire show to materialize.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.280
Yeah.

18:52.280 --> 18:53.280
So far.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.280
Yeah.

18:54.280 --> 18:55.280
That's where we're at right now.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.000
That's where things are at these days.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.120
But there's small little things like I've noticed, too, that Google, I think it's in

19:01.120 --> 19:02.120
the EU.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.120
I could be wrong.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.120
I apologize.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.840
I didn't grab this before the show.

19:05.840 --> 19:11.680
But Google is now also allowing another payment processor in a rather large Western market

19:11.680 --> 19:13.400
that isn't Google.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.280
They're allowing a third party payment system.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.360
And now Apple is expected to do the same.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.920
But we don't have details on that yet.

19:19.920 --> 19:25.000
After a dozen years, I don't know how long the app store has been around 10 years more.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.200
And this we've gotten this far.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.200
Apple held the line.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.840
The other watches on the wall.

19:29.840 --> 19:38.120
Yeah, I think Apple rightly recognized several years ago that the app store is a 20 year

19:38.120 --> 19:39.360
moneymaker for them.

19:39.360 --> 19:40.360
Right.

19:40.360 --> 19:44.040
You can buy a device once every couple of years, but you hopefully are going to get

19:44.040 --> 19:49.240
to the point where you're subscribed to Apple Arcade and you're buying an app every couple

19:49.240 --> 19:50.240
apps a month.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.600
You got a couple of subscriptions going right.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.880
They don't need it to be a lot.

19:53.880 --> 19:54.880
Right.

19:54.880 --> 19:59.520
And if they could get 15 bucks, 20 bucks out of you a month, they're happy, right?

19:59.520 --> 20:01.720
And the app store is a huge player in that.

20:01.720 --> 20:05.680
And I think that's why they just fight it so relentlessly, because long term, I think

20:05.680 --> 20:09.360
they see it as kind of how they're going to get rent.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.500
Sweet, sweet recurring revenue.

20:11.500 --> 20:15.120
Everybody loves it, man.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.400
Talescale.com slash coder.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.240
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.080
And of course, it's a great way to support the show.

20:23.080 --> 20:26.120
Tale is my favorite VPN solution by a mile.

20:26.120 --> 20:31.320
It's a zero config VPN that installs on any device in minutes, manages your firewall rules

20:31.320 --> 20:35.200
and it works from anywhere, even in double carrier net situations.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.000
I can attest to that.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.800
Devices connect directly to each other using wire guards, noise protocol, building you

20:41.800 --> 20:46.200
a mesh network with the best VPN security in the business.

20:46.200 --> 20:51.080
And you'd be surprised how quickly and easily you can create a network between your servers,

20:51.080 --> 20:55.480
your computers and your cloud instances and create one flat network where everything has

20:55.480 --> 20:56.720
a static IP.

20:56.720 --> 21:01.200
And yeah, you could even put a pie hole system in that network or any DNS server and you

21:01.200 --> 21:04.560
can start doing name resolution in your Talescale network.

21:04.560 --> 21:08.400
I use it to keep all of my family computers connected, all of the studios computers connected.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.400
It's how I do tech support.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.400
It's how I do work.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.240
It's a major component to be able to get to.

21:13.240 --> 21:16.220
Well, they're not even like super secure resources.

21:16.220 --> 21:19.240
Actually the resources that are just not secure enough.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.960
And so I don't want to put them on the public web.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.400
I don't even want to open up ports on my firewall.

21:23.400 --> 21:28.300
And now with Talescale, I don't have any inbound ports on any of my firewalls.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.300
That's huge for me.

21:29.300 --> 21:34.560
And I have it running on x86 arch servers, Raspberry Pi is running open, suits a tumbleweed.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.120
I have it on my iPhone, my iPad, my next box.

21:37.120 --> 21:40.480
I mean, everything you get up and running in just minutes, they have it for Windows

21:40.480 --> 21:41.480
and Mac, of course.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.460
I should probably make that statement, but it's obvious.

21:43.460 --> 21:45.840
And they even have like binaries available for a Linux system.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.960
Say you're on silver blue like I was and just want the binary.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.160
They got that to devices.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.160
Keep going.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.800
And you know, the work with your existing identity provider as well.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.880
So you can easily enforce multi-factor authentication.

21:56.880 --> 22:02.380
Say if you're in a business and the fact that Talescale VPN is always on on every OS I use

22:02.380 --> 22:06.600
and has a slick little GUI, including there's even a really nice gnome extension out there

22:06.600 --> 22:08.560
to get the GUI in the gnome menu.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.560
It's just dead simple.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.020
It works every time.

22:11.020 --> 22:16.600
It's super reliable and you're protected by WireGuard to go try it yourself for free and

22:16.600 --> 22:17.600
support the show.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.480
Go to talescale.com slash coder again.

22:21.480 --> 22:26.960
That's talescale.com slash coder.

22:26.960 --> 22:29.560
Well, I hate to say it, and I truly do mean this.

22:29.560 --> 22:34.120
I really hate to say it, but it does seem like the tech hiring slowdown is starting.

22:34.120 --> 22:39.840
Big tech layoffs and hiring freezes are prompting recession fears that are actually trickling

22:39.840 --> 22:44.520
into other parts of the industry, according to an article at the Washington Post that

22:44.520 --> 22:48.360
was I think it went live like on Friday or something of that extent.

22:48.360 --> 22:51.600
And it captures a lot of the moves by the big tech industry.

22:51.600 --> 22:56.640
Last week we found out that Microsoft has laid off a thousand staff.

22:56.640 --> 23:01.360
Microsoft has also halted hiring in the Windows team and the office divisions for May at least

23:01.360 --> 23:02.360
and perhaps beyond.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.360
We just don't know.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.920
This is old information that just came out.

23:04.920 --> 23:08.660
Intel has told employees it would not hire more staff in the PC chip division and it's

23:08.660 --> 23:11.480
reevaluating company priorities.

23:11.480 --> 23:16.320
Google has announced it is hiring more cautiously, saying, quote, it is time to be prudent.

23:16.320 --> 23:23.240
Apple has announced that it is doing a hiring pause amongst, quote, economic uncertainty,

23:23.240 --> 23:25.480
saying it's tapping the brakes.

23:25.480 --> 23:32.080
Google is switching from a hiring slowdown to a complete hiring halt for at least two

23:32.080 --> 23:38.280
weeks with a reevaluation how they're going to proceed for the rest of the year.

23:38.280 --> 23:41.840
It's kind of all happening and I hate it.

23:41.840 --> 23:45.200
I hate to see this and it's not it's not an emergency.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.040
It's not like everything's crumbling.

23:48.040 --> 23:51.820
But I think the analogy that people are hitting the brakes now, they're tapping the brakes

23:51.820 --> 23:52.820
are still on the freeway.

23:52.820 --> 23:55.680
We're still going down the freeway, but they're tapping the brakes and we're starting to see

23:55.680 --> 23:56.680
a backup.

23:56.680 --> 23:57.680
That's a bad analogy.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.680
But you know what I mean?

23:58.680 --> 24:00.600
So I think there's a couple of things going on here.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.600
I apologize.

24:01.600 --> 24:06.600
I forgot the name of the podcast I was listening to, but they had a pretty prominent VC on

24:06.600 --> 24:07.600
there.

24:07.600 --> 24:12.960
I think it was something and it was hilarious listening to this guy, Chris.

24:12.960 --> 24:18.560
He could barely like withhold his glee because really the valuations were too high.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.280
The salaries were too high, especially.

24:20.280 --> 24:23.080
I'm talking your startups, right?

24:23.080 --> 24:30.520
And you know, a lot of these companies don't make money, not even just the big boys, but

24:30.520 --> 24:32.760
I think we're going to feel this first in the startups.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.320
We're going to see a lot of calling there.

24:35.320 --> 24:38.760
We're going to see far less generous compensation offers.

24:38.760 --> 24:42.760
And I wouldn't be surprised if some of the bigger firms use these where you have to come

24:42.760 --> 24:49.040
into the office as a way to get people to self basically sell fire right to quit.

24:49.040 --> 24:52.880
And then they'll start reevaluating salaries, basically pulling them down at the higher

24:52.880 --> 24:56.660
end, which is an interesting kind of dichotomy we have.

24:56.660 --> 25:01.360
We have like service industry workers, hospitality workers, their salaries are generally going

25:01.360 --> 25:02.360
up.

25:02.360 --> 25:08.560
And I just saw, you know, my buddy owns a pub and 17 bucks an hour for a dishwasher,

25:08.560 --> 25:09.560
which was like crazy.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.400
God, I almost want to do that.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.400
Right.

25:12.400 --> 25:16.160
But the high end is going to go down because honestly it was overheated, right?

25:16.160 --> 25:22.760
These startups were throwing money like they're like it's going out of style and I can't get

25:22.760 --> 25:23.760
over it.

25:23.760 --> 25:24.760
Stress it enough.

25:24.760 --> 25:28.440
They don't make money and they're not as honorable as Sun Microsystems.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.300
So you know, we can't tolerate them not making money.

25:31.300 --> 25:32.520
They have to fail.

25:32.520 --> 25:36.400
I agree with your thesis to a degree.

25:36.400 --> 25:43.680
I think if we were to continue to see an economic tightening, we were continued to see a hawkish

25:43.680 --> 25:44.920
fed policy.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.680
Yes, I think you're right.

25:46.680 --> 25:53.280
You would see kind of this reckoning, a return to the mean, an actual return to values and

25:53.280 --> 25:56.680
fundamentals that, you know, drive profits and revenue.

25:56.680 --> 26:03.600
And I have worked for a couple of VC funded companies, you know, in the mid hundreds to

26:03.600 --> 26:06.360
few hundred to 700 employee range.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.960
I bet anybody listening that has to knows exactly what I'm about to say is 100% true.

26:09.960 --> 26:14.520
I saw so much money wasted, like it like stuff that when I ran my business, we would never

26:14.520 --> 26:19.800
even consider because, you know, everything we bought was really carefully calculated.

26:19.800 --> 26:25.360
But I mean, I just saw unbelievable expenses on all kinds of stuff, travel stuff and office

26:25.360 --> 26:30.440
stuff and just things that they had groups of people working on that would never produced

26:30.440 --> 26:31.440
a penny.

26:31.440 --> 26:35.360
They just were complete 100% cost center and that kind of stuff.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.600
We've just seen that.

26:36.600 --> 26:41.880
We've seen that as like a like a sickness spread throughout American business culture.

26:41.880 --> 26:47.560
I think anybody listening who works at a company with more than 100 people probably has something

26:47.560 --> 26:52.280
that goes on at their business that is a 100% total cost center that doesn't produce anything

26:52.280 --> 26:57.000
beneficial for the company, the kind of stuff that if you are life and death, you know,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.560
just survive by every paycheck kind of thing you would never allow.

26:59.560 --> 27:04.840
But when you've got money coming in, it sort of makes it easy to just kind of ignore that

27:04.840 --> 27:09.560
stuff like the saying is that, you know, when the when the when the when the tide is in

27:09.560 --> 27:12.760
and everybody's out swimming and having a great time, everybody looks like they're having

27:12.760 --> 27:13.760
a party.

27:13.760 --> 27:17.340
But when the tide goes out, when the when the money slows down, when the tide goes out,

27:17.340 --> 27:19.800
you see who's been swimming without their shorts on.

27:19.800 --> 27:23.000
And so I would agree with your thesis if we got that far.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.640
I don't think we'll get that far.

27:24.640 --> 27:28.720
I think the money printer will turn back on probably in November, somewhere between now

27:28.720 --> 27:31.380
and November, but probably not right yet.

27:31.380 --> 27:34.540
And when that happens, the money will get dumped back into the tech sector just like

27:34.540 --> 27:35.540
it always has.

27:35.540 --> 27:38.480
Oh, oh, I hope not.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.840
It'll be mega bubble time, buddy.

27:39.840 --> 27:40.840
We've been printing money.

27:40.840 --> 27:46.840
We have been on a financial bender since 2008 with maybe one or two moments of clarity in

27:46.840 --> 27:47.840
there.

27:47.840 --> 27:52.400
And fortunately, right, if you're an addict, you eventually have to go through the withdrawals.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.160
It's it's time to go through the withdrawals.

27:54.160 --> 28:00.600
It's time to I mean, come on, look at these dumb businesses that were being started.

28:00.600 --> 28:05.600
Look at how these companies that make no money have effectively D I would argue they devalue

28:05.600 --> 28:11.760
actual like modestly profitable, you know, what could grow into from small to like medium

28:11.760 --> 28:18.120
sized firms, because it's all growth, growth, growth, you know, IPO, whatever, turning a

28:18.120 --> 28:19.120
profit.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.120
What's the product?

28:20.120 --> 28:23.560
Remember Silicon Valley action, Jack Barker talking to Richard Hendricks, I will never

28:23.560 --> 28:25.160
compromise the product, Richard.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.720
And he's like, Oh, the algorithm?

28:26.720 --> 28:27.720
No, you idiot.

28:27.720 --> 28:28.720
The stock.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.680
It's like, it's crazy.

28:31.680 --> 28:32.720
It's all effectively.

28:32.720 --> 28:36.220
And I know you love crypto, but it's all effectively like a securities.

28:36.220 --> 28:37.220
It's a casino.

28:37.220 --> 28:38.220
Basically.

28:38.220 --> 28:39.220
Oh, crypto securities?

28:39.220 --> 28:40.220
Yeah, absolutely.

28:40.220 --> 28:41.220
Well, not just crypto.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.280
The stock in these startups.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.640
What's is what's the difference?

28:44.640 --> 28:45.640
Why not call it?

28:45.640 --> 28:46.640
You know,

28:46.640 --> 28:47.860
well, the two are related, right?

28:47.860 --> 28:52.860
The reason why you've seen crypto and NFTs just go crazy is because they're securities

28:52.860 --> 28:54.820
that Wall Street guys are playing around with that.

28:54.820 --> 28:59.400
The money that's been pouring into crypto isn't coming from Wall Street bets, a sub

28:59.400 --> 29:00.400
Reddit, right?

29:00.400 --> 29:01.400
Like, yeah, a handful of it is.

29:01.400 --> 29:05.620
But they're a drop in the bucket compared to the billions on Wall Street that are screwing

29:05.620 --> 29:07.700
around with off the book securities.

29:07.700 --> 29:08.700
I completely agree.

29:08.700 --> 29:11.280
Have you ever hang out at Wall Street bets?

29:11.280 --> 29:13.160
Yeah, I've been in there a couple of times.

29:13.160 --> 29:14.920
I mean, like literally twice.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.440
Have you noticed over the last month?

29:16.440 --> 29:19.520
I read my some my Reddit feed now and I tend to read.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.520
I don't know.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.200
I've somehow been drawn to read it again.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.240
But I never comment because Oh my god.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.600
Yeah, good call.

29:25.600 --> 29:31.160
A lot of it is like less, you know, diamond hands to the moon, bake this, you know, we're

29:31.160 --> 29:33.600
the apes, whatever the hell that means.

29:33.600 --> 29:37.640
And now it's like, I just lost $20,000 and my wife is divorcing me.

29:37.640 --> 29:38.640
Yeah.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.640
Yeah.

29:39.640 --> 29:40.640
There's a lot of that right now.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.640
A lot of that going on.

29:41.640 --> 29:46.560
It's like, yeah, well, do you like you were only doing well, because, again, I'm gonna

29:46.560 --> 29:47.880
say it.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.220
The Fed had everybody on a frickin bender.

29:50.220 --> 29:54.200
And I think right now people just haven't really fully realized it yet, because it's

29:54.200 --> 29:59.240
been so normalized, because it's been happening in the background for so long.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.580
I don't think it's totally clicked yet.

30:01.580 --> 30:06.480
I don't think people have made the connection to the state of employment, the state of the

30:06.480 --> 30:09.120
tech industry and the money printer.

30:09.120 --> 30:11.320
I think they're just too distant for most people.

30:11.320 --> 30:13.680
See, this is the problem.

30:13.680 --> 30:20.200
The tech industry, I feel like in a lot of ways is going through some sort of transition.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.360
I know this is welcome to old man radio.

30:22.360 --> 30:28.480
When we started the show, it was all about like, crazy ideas, you know, mobile, mobile,

30:28.480 --> 30:32.680
mobile, rapid product of rapid, you know, MVP is we talked a lot quick break things

30:32.680 --> 30:36.280
a lot about agile, right in different forms of that.

30:36.280 --> 30:43.760
And now it seems like tech and media are like in this weird or serpentine, polyamorous orgy

30:43.760 --> 30:45.240
with politics.

30:45.240 --> 30:50.200
Well, all of the tech companies wanted to become media stars and media platforms.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.040
All the media companies want to become tech companies.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.040
It's great.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.040
Yeah, everybody.

30:54.040 --> 30:58.920
They all want to be streaming platforms, or they all want to be media.

30:58.920 --> 31:03.280
Nobody realized that the only reason they're at this crazy college party at the scrap party

31:03.280 --> 31:07.360
is because, you know, Pledgemaster Fed was just bringing the kegs in.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.360
Let's go.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.360
Let me tell you something.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.400
As a man, I think you can.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.680
I think Chris will go with this, Chris.

31:13.680 --> 31:17.480
If you had to ask me to identify a bender, if you had to pick of all the hosts, who could

31:17.480 --> 31:19.480
identify a bender when he sees one?

31:19.480 --> 31:20.480
It's got to be me.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.480
Oh, I think so.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.480
Yeah, I would.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.480
I would agree.

31:23.480 --> 31:26.400
I think we've been on a what is it, 14 year bender.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.720
It's time to stop.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.880
It's time to you know, there's going to be some vomiting.

31:30.880 --> 31:35.800
There's definitely going to be some tragic cases of startup founders losing everything,

31:35.800 --> 31:37.880
but you never had it.

31:37.880 --> 31:38.880
It was a lie.

31:38.880 --> 31:42.040
So yeah, but it's a yeah, but it's a little bit different when it's like, say, you and

31:42.040 --> 31:43.040
me.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.040
Right.

31:44.040 --> 31:47.060
If like, if this thing, if this thing gets really rolling, it's probably going to wipe

31:47.060 --> 31:51.440
out the advertising market and it may wipe out people's appetite for development projects

31:51.440 --> 31:52.440
as well.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.800
Well, it's going to yeah, everybody's going to get hit.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.420
It's but what's the alternative?

31:56.420 --> 31:57.820
We just keep going.

31:57.820 --> 31:59.080
That's exactly what they're going to do.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.080
Yeah.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.800
I mean, you can't do this forever.

32:01.800 --> 32:02.800
Nope.

32:02.800 --> 32:06.840
But, you know, he could probably do it for another cycle.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.160
Our sons will get to fix it, right?

32:08.160 --> 32:09.160
Our kids will get.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.680
Oh, I think it's going to bite us.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.440
Oh, I think we'll be around for it.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.680
There's a lot of moving pieces to something like this.

32:16.680 --> 32:24.200
But at the end of the day, the Fed policy is to make changes to their policy that increase

32:24.200 --> 32:25.200
unemployment.

32:25.200 --> 32:29.240
The idea being that if you increase unemployment, you'll reduce demand.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.160
You'll cool the market.

32:31.160 --> 32:34.680
That should have a lowering effect on inflation.

32:34.680 --> 32:39.360
I know this is this is this is a long way removed from development.

32:39.360 --> 32:42.460
And you're probably wondering how it all kind of connects together.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.240
The way it all connects together, what Mike and I are trying to tell you with this entire

32:45.240 --> 32:51.480
discussion has been about is this is directly connected to the health of the tech industry.

32:51.480 --> 32:54.400
It is directly connected to the employment market.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.960
It is directly connected to the indie business market.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.080
It is a one for one thing.

33:00.080 --> 33:04.240
Whatever the Fed policy changes, it directly impacts the tech market directly because this

33:04.240 --> 33:12.720
tech market has thrived during a period of loose economic policy, loose money, easy money,

33:12.720 --> 33:14.440
better than free money, really.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.760
So that's changed for now.

33:17.760 --> 33:22.560
And as long as it stays in this state, the tech industry will take more and more hits.

33:22.560 --> 33:24.320
The health will deteriorate.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.260
I imagine it's not forever, though.

33:26.260 --> 33:31.500
But that's how this all kind of comes back together is it is directly correlated.

33:31.500 --> 33:36.320
When you hear about the Fed hiking rates, that makes money more expensive for these

33:36.320 --> 33:38.320
companies that operate off of loans.

33:38.320 --> 33:42.160
I mean, you hear about how Apple has so much money in the bank, right?

33:42.160 --> 33:44.780
They just sitting on tons of money, like two trillion dollars.

33:44.780 --> 33:48.520
They legit they decided to become a credit card company because they didn't know what

33:48.520 --> 33:49.520
to do with it.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.200
And now they're a buy now pay later.

33:51.200 --> 33:56.560
How did Apple manage to run operating expenses while putting all of their money in an offshore

33:56.560 --> 33:57.980
savings account?

33:57.980 --> 33:59.280
How do they do that?

33:59.280 --> 34:02.500
They take loans because they have a guaranteed collateral.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.120
They have that balance.

34:04.120 --> 34:07.060
They can take out loans like crazy against it.

34:07.060 --> 34:12.480
They get access to loans in a way that average people like us just can't even comprehend.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.640
You know, you want a few bill.

34:13.640 --> 34:14.640
Here you go.

34:14.640 --> 34:15.640
Here's a line of credit.

34:15.640 --> 34:16.640
Apple, here's a few billion line of credit.

34:16.640 --> 34:18.000
No problem at all.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.960
And when the interest rates are lower than inflation, it tends to work out better for

34:23.960 --> 34:25.800
a company like Apple to take a loan out.

34:25.800 --> 34:26.800
And that's what they've been doing.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.840
They've been getting access to easy money like that.

34:28.840 --> 34:30.960
And that easy money is going away.

34:30.960 --> 34:32.960
That's just it right there.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.680
The loans cost more now because the base rates are going up.

34:35.680 --> 34:36.680
Yeah.

34:36.680 --> 34:41.600
But on a positive note, if you are a you know, someone looking to be an entrepreneur, I hate

34:41.600 --> 34:45.040
to say it, but particularly if you're young and don't have things like kids, dogs and

34:45.040 --> 34:51.520
mortgages, this type of environment, a crash is always a great time to start up.

34:51.520 --> 34:56.760
Not like in the VC way, but it's it still will be possible, of course.

34:56.760 --> 35:02.140
But there will be opportunities coming from don't forget, we are still experiencing changing

35:02.140 --> 35:03.880
dynamics of remote work.

35:03.880 --> 35:07.280
Covid apparently decides it wants to visit again.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.400
And something about somebody slept with a monkey.

35:09.400 --> 35:14.640
I don't know what the hell happened there, but probably a BSD user.

35:14.640 --> 35:19.200
So if you want to create, you know, the next.

35:19.200 --> 35:24.320
Just please don't create Uber for something right, but some interesting technology product

35:24.320 --> 35:29.480
that maybe works with these trends that you can bootstrap.

35:29.480 --> 35:32.000
This is still a pretty good time.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.240
If you focus on where things are transitioning to, because I don't I don't know what Chris

35:36.240 --> 35:38.720
thinks, but I don't think we're done with our Covid hangover.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.640
Yeah, seemingly not.

35:40.640 --> 35:46.160
At least we have the Provo lax or whatever it is that the plies are elected.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.720
At least we have that now.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.440
So hopefully that's helping people.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.080
But I think you're totes right.

35:51.080 --> 35:56.200
Like these types of markets are a time to build and invest.

35:56.200 --> 36:00.480
And then when the market turns around, you want to be in a position to catch that wave.

36:00.480 --> 36:04.440
And the only way you're going to be ready is if you've been building something, creating

36:04.440 --> 36:08.720
a bit of credibility, creating a bit of network effect around it.

36:08.720 --> 36:12.960
And then when things pick back up and there's market demand again and people are looking

36:12.960 --> 36:16.360
for the solution that you've created, you're there for it.

36:16.360 --> 36:21.800
These types of downturns that we're in right now can be beneficially life changing for

36:21.800 --> 36:25.620
a career trajectory or for somebody that wants to start an independent business and has the

36:25.620 --> 36:30.000
ability to hunker down, survive and weather the storm.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
The next wave.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Yeah.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Yeah.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Right.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.520
And also when these things tend to happen, there's still markets amazingly that do all

36:36.520 --> 36:38.760
right and are still hiring.

36:38.760 --> 36:42.860
And so it's just a matter about finding those places and even some regions still end up

36:42.860 --> 36:44.960
doing better than other regions as well.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.160
So it's not all a bad thing.

36:47.160 --> 36:51.200
And I think maybe that's the part we could focus on a bit more is these are actually

36:51.200 --> 36:52.920
great valleys of opportunity.

36:52.920 --> 36:56.920
And when you start to look at it as a moment of opportunity.

36:56.920 --> 37:00.160
You start to think, God, I hope I hope the down market lasts long enough.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.160
I hope I have enough time.

37:01.160 --> 37:02.160
Right.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.160
You start to.

37:03.160 --> 37:06.680
It changes your mindset about it instead of like, oh, God, here we go.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.480
How long is this going to take?

37:08.480 --> 37:11.400
Oh, I'm bracing myself instead of that.

37:11.400 --> 37:14.000
It's a oh, I hope it's a down market the last while.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.320
I hope I hope I have enough time to build this thing.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.320
Right.

37:17.320 --> 37:20.440
That's actually, you know, a nice mindset shift.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.600
It helps you get through it.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.560
But Chris is probably right because we live in a cynical world and there's an election

37:25.560 --> 37:26.560
coming up.

37:26.560 --> 37:32.200
So the Fed will probably start putting money again here.

37:32.200 --> 37:36.120
Just not what your podcast can boost for you.

37:36.120 --> 37:39.400
But what you can boost for your podcast.

37:39.400 --> 37:40.400
Boostagray.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.400
All right.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.800
Well, we got some boost this week.

37:42.800 --> 37:46.480
Optimus Gray boosted in with a big one.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.240
He is coming in with a big row of ducks.

37:49.240 --> 37:52.400
Twenty two thousand two hundred and twenty two sets.

37:52.400 --> 37:59.980
Now, he was listening live and was just enjoying the show.

37:59.980 --> 38:04.680
We stream over at Jupiter Dot Tube on Mondays at noon, Pacific three p.m.

38:04.680 --> 38:05.680
Eastern.

38:05.680 --> 38:11.680
We're not yet live in the podcast apps, but that is part of the podcasting to do spec

38:11.680 --> 38:14.560
is the ability to actually live stream in the podcast app.

38:14.560 --> 38:19.920
So you just subscribe to Kota Radio and when we're live, it'll just show up in your podcast

38:19.920 --> 38:24.520
player as a live item that you could just listen to, tap it and just tune into the stream.

38:24.520 --> 38:29.040
And then when the stream is over, it goes away and then the actual edited version takes

38:29.040 --> 38:30.040
over and replaces it.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.440
It's a pretty neat system.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.280
So we'll be there one day.

38:34.280 --> 38:38.760
But we're not there yet because step one is getting to the point where we're satisfied

38:38.760 --> 38:44.800
with creating and generating our own RSS feeds, which we're just kind of at the beginning

38:44.800 --> 38:46.600
of that.

38:46.600 --> 38:52.400
Next boost comes in from Yukon Cornelius with two thousand sets.

38:52.400 --> 38:57.080
I'm curious to know if the GitHub Copilot models make their way individual studios,

38:57.080 --> 39:00.120
A.I. autocomplete, what do they call that, Intellisense?

39:00.120 --> 39:02.600
I've used V.S. one at work.

39:02.600 --> 39:06.520
It supposedly scans my code base to provide the recommendations.

39:06.520 --> 39:10.080
No mention of scanning GitHub, though it seems to be true.

39:10.080 --> 39:14.440
The Visual Studio recommendations often seem like they were coded by me.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.920
I found the feature actually saves me a ton of time.

39:17.920 --> 39:24.800
Visual Studio offers a custom version of Copilot that scans your own code for the training

39:24.800 --> 39:25.800
model.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.600
Saves him a ton of time, he says.

39:27.600 --> 39:34.400
The Copilot and V.S. code also does that in addition to whatever external sources it scans.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.880
Have you found that useful?

39:35.880 --> 39:36.880
As a form of autocomplete?

39:36.880 --> 39:37.880
Yeah.

39:37.880 --> 39:41.240
I mean, I tend to use the same patterns over and over again because I'm old and you will

39:41.240 --> 39:44.640
pry my delegate pattern out of my cold dead hands.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.120
I use what works.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.840
Me and Deckard Cain were there.

39:47.840 --> 39:48.840
No, it's useful.

39:48.840 --> 39:55.720
I mean, the thing about Copilot is it's basically better Intellisense, but when it's wrong,

39:55.720 --> 39:57.760
it's freaking hilarious.

39:57.760 --> 40:02.760
The Golden Dragon boosted in with a gigabyte of sats, 1024.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.440
Holy crap, that's too much sats.

40:05.440 --> 40:12.680
He says, Mike, you need to go grab yourself some Microsoft tactical wear.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.240
I don't know if you saw this.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.240
Tactical?

40:15.240 --> 40:21.920
Yeah, they've launched the hardware division designed by one of Microsoft's creative directors,

40:21.920 --> 40:29.720
and it's like super retro cheesy Microsoft swag, including pants that cost like $150

40:29.720 --> 40:30.720
cargo pants.

40:30.720 --> 40:31.720
No, that's not going to happen.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.080
I mean, they've got a little Microsoft logo on there, man.

40:34.080 --> 40:35.080
Don't you want it?

40:35.080 --> 40:36.080
Come on.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.560
Actually, they look really comfortable.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.560
I'm not going to lie.

40:38.560 --> 40:41.040
They're not like standard CACULA, like a different material.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.920
They're $150 pants, Chris.

40:42.920 --> 40:43.920
I know.

40:43.920 --> 40:44.920
I know.

40:44.920 --> 40:45.920
I know.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.080
But they're tactical pants, man.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.080
They're tactical pants.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.480
Don't you go spending our rope budget.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.320
All right.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.320
You're right.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.320
No, you're right.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.320
You're right.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.320
You're right.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.320
All right.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.320
I'll simmer down.

40:58.320 --> 40:59.320
I'll simmer down.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.320
We got a double boost from the Golden Dragon.

41:00.320 --> 41:03.740
He sent us in a little small row of ducks saying that things had him feel a little awkward

41:03.740 --> 41:08.160
at episode 475, like maybe we were getting a little Linux betrayal-y when we were talking

41:08.160 --> 41:10.720
about how you could use Windows, Mac, or Linux these days.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.200
He didn't like it too much.

41:12.200 --> 41:17.000
So to make up for it, he sent us a triple boost with another row of small ducks.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.120
Honestly and truly, I am Robin Hood.

41:21.120 --> 41:27.320
Now he's bringing up the whole east and north and south, the Carolina thing.

41:27.320 --> 41:30.920
I hate to get into the Carolina barbecue thing again, but he's doing it, so we're going in

41:30.920 --> 41:31.920
there.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.120
I feel like we don't have a choice.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.760
It's vinegar-based sauce, guys.

41:35.760 --> 41:39.320
It's a kind of waste nothing but the squeal type approach.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.320
It was trendy.

41:40.320 --> 41:44.400
Oh, when you add it to your meat, it can make it super tender and juicy.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.680
All right.

41:45.680 --> 41:46.680
I don't know, man.

41:46.680 --> 41:50.680
If I'm going to rely on a sauce, I feel like it's maybe not great barbecue.

41:50.680 --> 41:51.680
That's just my thing.

41:51.680 --> 41:56.560
Like the barbecue, you should be able to eat it without sauce, and then if you add sauce,

41:56.560 --> 41:57.560
it makes it better.

41:57.560 --> 42:00.160
You're just throwing down like that?

42:00.160 --> 42:05.840
Dude, send your feedback to chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.000
I'm just saying.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
I'm just saying.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.160
If you disagree, boost in.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.160
We'll make it work out.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.160
We'll figure it out.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.160
You're a bad man.

42:12.160 --> 42:14.640
That's some bold stuff you've got going there.

42:14.640 --> 42:15.640
I know.

42:15.640 --> 42:16.640
It offends people.

42:16.640 --> 42:21.560
Oh, a guy sent us in a multi-part boost, 444 cents.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.720
I think you guys should check this out.

42:23.720 --> 42:29.200
It's an article by the New Yorker, Mario not so super at 40.

42:29.200 --> 42:32.320
It's probably, he says in the second part boost, best read in Mario's voice.

42:32.320 --> 42:33.960
It's a me, a Mario.

42:33.960 --> 42:38.560
And the whole thing is an article written in Mario's voice.

42:38.560 --> 42:43.160
And it hits a little close to home about how life's harder for Mario at 40.

42:43.160 --> 42:48.880
Like things like, so basically I wake up and it's like, I can't move my back, like at all.

42:48.880 --> 42:53.880
So I go to Dr. Mario, no relation, and he's like, Mario, when's the last time you had

42:53.880 --> 42:54.880
a physical?

42:54.880 --> 42:58.420
And I'm like, can't you just look at my back like a normal?

42:58.420 --> 43:00.280
And he's like, no, no.

43:00.280 --> 43:03.180
I'm starting to think there might be an underlying problem.

43:03.180 --> 43:06.160
And it just, the whole thing goes on.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.040
It's about life at 40.

43:08.040 --> 43:10.880
And I'll leave it for you to read.

43:10.880 --> 43:14.600
I'll have it linked in the show notes, thanks OA guy.

43:14.600 --> 43:17.000
Nothing like that to make me feel old.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.600
He did send us a double boost though.

43:18.600 --> 43:21.520
Another row of duckos, boost.

43:21.520 --> 43:25.280
He says, still prefers Vim over TextMate and BB Edit.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.280
Very good.

43:26.280 --> 43:32.920
We got 3,737 stats from TrevDev, and he says, in regards to comments last week we made about

43:32.920 --> 43:36.320
using Windows, Mac and Linux being fairly interchangeable, he says, I'd like to gently

43:36.320 --> 43:41.840
remind you both that the three distros, Windows, Mac and Linux, are not really on equal footing.

43:41.840 --> 43:45.800
Linux is clearly superior, and it doesn't come with the bloat of Windows.

43:45.800 --> 43:48.200
Embrace, extend, and extinguish.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.440
We are currently at the extend phase.

43:50.440 --> 43:53.000
WSL is the extend phase.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.260
Does that mean extinguish is like the next phase that Linux is gonna die?

43:56.260 --> 43:57.260
Is that what you mean?

43:57.260 --> 43:59.560
I'm pretty sure Linode is like, eh, I don't think so.

43:59.560 --> 44:06.000
Yeah, TrevDev, I'm curious if you think that Windows could actually extinguish Linux, because

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
it just doesn't seem possible.

44:07.000 --> 44:13.440
As long as you're gonna have any kind of substantial server market, it's gonna be beneficial to

44:13.440 --> 44:16.240
have the desktop around in some capacity, right?

44:16.240 --> 44:20.800
I mean, you gotta have a dev platform, you gotta have a test platform, so I think as

44:20.800 --> 44:25.200
long as you have a substantial server deployment, I think you're always gonna have a Linux desktop

44:25.200 --> 44:26.320
of some form.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.880
I don't know if it'll be the king desktop, but I think it'll always be around, but I'm

44:28.880 --> 44:34.320
curious to know, TrevDev, if you think they actually could extinguish Linux altogether.

44:34.320 --> 44:38.120
LRAI 7.41 boosted in with 2,245 SATs.

44:38.120 --> 44:39.120
Boost!

44:39.120 --> 44:42.880
He actually has a correction on my comment about how JB is using Cloudflare.

44:42.880 --> 44:47.520
He says, I only know because I've been helping with the new website that's under development,

44:47.520 --> 44:50.760
and he says, you're not really using any of the fancy features of Cloudflare like Mike

44:50.760 --> 44:51.760
was actually talking about.

44:51.760 --> 44:53.200
You're just using it for DNS.

44:53.200 --> 44:57.200
Yeah, I know, but we could turn that stuff on.

44:57.200 --> 44:59.840
But it's a hell of a DNS provider.

44:59.840 --> 45:00.840
It sure is.

45:00.840 --> 45:01.840
It sure is.

45:01.840 --> 45:03.080
I actually have liked it.

45:03.080 --> 45:04.560
I didn't want to.

45:04.560 --> 45:05.560
I was very resistive.

45:05.560 --> 45:06.560
Why?

45:06.560 --> 45:08.040
What's your beef with Cloudflare?

45:08.040 --> 45:11.440
I think they want to be like the Walmart of network services.

45:11.440 --> 45:15.400
I mean, I don't mean that in a bad way, but I just mean that like in a huge market dominator

45:15.400 --> 45:16.400
way.

45:16.400 --> 45:21.320
Well, yeah, we need to get to where there's only one company named Mom, right?

45:21.320 --> 45:22.320
That's exactly it.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.320
Isn't that what we're doing here?

45:23.320 --> 45:24.320
We are.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.320
That is exactly what's happening.

45:25.320 --> 45:26.320
That was my only hesitation.

45:26.320 --> 45:29.200
I think you get it, right?

45:29.200 --> 45:30.200
It's just a little concerning.

45:30.200 --> 45:31.680
I feel like I've seen this before.

45:31.680 --> 45:33.840
Yeah, you're probably right.

45:33.840 --> 45:38.240
That's a future rival reference for for the Gen Z-ers in the crowd.

45:38.240 --> 45:39.240
It's good.

45:39.240 --> 45:40.240
We watch holds up.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.240
It does hold up.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.300
It's a little too close to home on certain episodes, though.

45:43.300 --> 45:44.300
No kidding.

45:44.300 --> 45:45.300
You should.

45:45.300 --> 45:46.300
You should.

45:46.300 --> 45:48.960
You should watch it with a post covid eye.

45:48.960 --> 45:52.440
Double boost from Ellery 741.

45:52.440 --> 45:54.360
Just checking out Podverse.

45:54.360 --> 45:55.640
Thanks for the awesome show.

45:55.640 --> 46:00.360
So Podverse, just a quick tangent here, Podverse is one of these new apps, these new podcasting

46:00.360 --> 46:01.360
apps that are pretty great.

46:01.360 --> 46:06.200
They've got an iOS, an Android and a Web version, and it's all open source.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.360
But here's what's really cool.

46:08.360 --> 46:13.160
So I interviewed the developer, one of the developers, the co-founder for office hours.

46:13.160 --> 46:18.020
And then after he came on office hours, he agreed to help us out with the new website

46:18.020 --> 46:19.360
that we're working on.

46:19.360 --> 46:26.320
And so now our embedded player on our new website is the Podverse MP3 player.

46:26.320 --> 46:31.560
We've gotten they worked with us to make their web player that they have embeddable and that

46:31.560 --> 46:33.480
it can point at our own files.

46:33.480 --> 46:37.960
And so when the new website launches, we're going to have a Podverse player that has like

46:37.960 --> 46:44.240
chapter support and playback speed support, boost support all right there built into the

46:44.240 --> 46:46.840
web player, open source, GPL, baby.

46:46.840 --> 46:51.440
And Mitch at Podverse has been helping us out with a new website to make it all possible.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.280
And he loves Coderio so much.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.200
He included it twice in his directory.

46:55.200 --> 46:56.880
There you go.

46:56.880 --> 46:57.880
You know what?

46:57.880 --> 46:58.880
Let's get it in there a third time.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.120
Oh, you know what that is?

47:01.120 --> 47:03.480
I know that beautiful old artwork.

47:03.480 --> 47:04.480
What is it?

47:04.480 --> 47:05.480
What did you find?

47:05.480 --> 47:06.480
That's the old member.

47:06.480 --> 47:08.200
We have changed feeds way back when.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

47:09.200 --> 47:10.200
That's what that is.

47:10.200 --> 47:11.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.200
Because it is.

47:12.200 --> 47:13.200
Yeah.

47:13.200 --> 47:14.200
2017 feed update.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.200
That's what that is.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.200
Good old days.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.200
The old feed.

47:17.200 --> 47:18.200
The old logo.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.200
You know, I don't mind the old logo.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.200
I like the old logo.

47:20.200 --> 47:22.120
We never did new coasters for the new logo.

47:22.120 --> 47:23.120
We should.

47:23.120 --> 47:26.720
We should do it, too, but I just, you know, the old logo I remember thinking when we were

47:26.720 --> 47:30.440
trying to figure out looks like how the hell do you even the show had launched yet?

47:30.440 --> 47:36.120
Like, how the hell do you even visualize the show like we can't just have like HTML code

47:36.120 --> 47:37.120
or something.

47:37.120 --> 47:42.280
And now if we did a logo, it would just be a MacBook with a bottle of gin poured into

47:42.280 --> 47:43.280
it.

47:43.280 --> 47:44.280
Amazing.

47:44.280 --> 47:46.880
If you want to check out Podverse, it's like Podverse dot FM.

47:46.880 --> 47:49.040
It's one of the apps at new podcast apps dot com.

47:49.040 --> 47:54.000
And it's neat because it's because it's GPL, it's also an asteroid if that's how you roll.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.480
And then we did get a series of thank you boosts.

47:57.480 --> 47:59.040
Five thousand sats from L.T.

47:59.040 --> 48:02.840
Guy for episode four seventy five and then an additional five thousand sats from L.T.

48:02.840 --> 48:06.400
Guy of double five for episode four seventy four.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.040
We got some lead sats from A.V.

48:08.040 --> 48:12.040
Parker and we got some future sats for seventy six from K.P.

48:12.040 --> 48:13.040
Vuck.

48:13.040 --> 48:15.320
Thank you, K.P. for boosting the future.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.920
If you'd like to send us a boost, you could try out Fountain FM.

48:17.920 --> 48:21.320
I'll have a link in the show notes, which is like my link.

48:21.320 --> 48:26.200
I think it connects you to my account so you can see my clips and that kind of stuff.

48:26.200 --> 48:30.620
But you can just also grab any any of the new podcast apps that look interesting to

48:30.620 --> 48:32.700
you at new podcast apps dot com.

48:32.700 --> 48:34.040
And one more note.

48:34.040 --> 48:37.840
I was on the podcasting two dot o podcast.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.860
I think it's episode ninety four.

48:39.860 --> 48:41.600
And we talked about the podcast biz.

48:41.600 --> 48:42.780
We talked about advertising.

48:42.780 --> 48:43.940
We talked about memberships.

48:43.940 --> 48:47.840
We talked about standards and Spotify and all kinds of things.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.480
Those are actually a really fun chat.

48:49.480 --> 48:54.760
So if you're interested in that kind of stuff, go check out the podcasting two dot o podcast.

48:54.760 --> 49:00.080
I think it's episode ninety four titled Bell's out is the episode I'm on.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.720
I got good news for our members.

49:01.720 --> 49:06.360
The new Coderly report is out to do to do to do.

49:06.360 --> 49:11.700
It took me a little bit longer than normal because I was slammed recently, but it turned

49:11.700 --> 49:12.700
out really good.

49:12.700 --> 49:15.820
This is one I think it's worth becoming a member for if you're not already.

49:15.820 --> 49:20.460
We did a little look back at like twenty fourteen, twenty fifteen early days of the show and

49:20.460 --> 49:24.120
replayed some moments where we kind of talked about issues at the time and then we reflect

49:24.120 --> 49:28.720
on them now or some predictions we made, one that I got massively wrong and a couple that

49:28.720 --> 49:29.720
we got right.

49:29.720 --> 49:32.680
But we it was just it was more fun than I was expecting.

49:32.680 --> 49:36.840
Thanks to Alex, too, for for clipping a lot of those and tweeting them at us.

49:36.840 --> 49:39.680
So we had a good batch to go through from the past because he's been going through the

49:39.680 --> 49:40.960
back archive.

49:40.960 --> 49:44.740
So the timing just worked out good and I thought it turned out really well.

49:44.740 --> 49:45.860
So it's a new Coderly.

49:45.860 --> 49:48.400
It is live now in your members feed.

49:48.400 --> 49:53.280
