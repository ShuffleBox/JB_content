1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Now, before we start, we have a listener in the virtual lug

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,520
who's joined us in the metaverse.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,960
Is it the metaverse that you're in right now?

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,800
Where are you?

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,920
Not quite, I'm just apparently hovering above the ground

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,320
in Oculus Home.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
But you got Tmux.

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,720
Yes, I have Tmux on one side

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,120
and I've got Mummla in the middle.

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,880
Tmux, so to explain this, what is this that you're seeing?

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,240
Is this some sort of, how are you doing this?

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,600
If you've ever used a Quest 2 and you've opened the store,

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,640
it's up in that little window down at the bottom

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,600
and you can set it on each side.

15
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,040
You can have multiple windows.

16
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,040
It's pretty neat.

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,200
So on my right, I've got my settings panel.

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,200
In the middle, I've got basically just a standard window

19
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,040
with Mummla in it.

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,240
And then on my left, I've got Tmux.

21
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,280
And these are floating in like a virtual lounge

22
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,120
or something?

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,880
Yes, I'm just in the little cabin in the woods studio

24
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,080
and they're just floating midair.

25
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,880
How many NFTs did you have to trade in

26
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,920
to experience this view of the internet?

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,640
None other than just threatened Facebook

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,120
to give me ADB access.

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,160
Just your soul to Facebook.

30
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,680
That's all you have to trade.

31
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,360
They had it anyway.

32
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,400
But you know what?

33
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,000
It's pretty cool.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My name is Chris.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My name is Wes.

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
My name is Brent.

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And my name is Alex.

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hello gentlemen, coming up on the show today,

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,520
I have hit my first major snag in the Nyx OS challenge.

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
Oh no.

42
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,640
We'll check in with the other boys

43
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,640
and see how their Nyx OS challenge is going.

44
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,120
Plus, we've got a fair amount of follow-up on 2204

45
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,560
and a look at the mate flavor of 2204.

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,280
Then we'll round out the show with some great booze,

47
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,360
some pics and more.

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,320
So before I go any further,

49
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,080
let's say time appropriate greetings to that virtual log.

50
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,280
Hello Mummleroom.

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,520
Time appropriate greetings.

52
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,840
Hello, hello, hello JB1.

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,800
And for extra fun today, listener Eric is joining us in studio.

54
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,080
He's here for the virtual Linux fest.

55
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Hello Eric.

56
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Hi guys.

57
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Hey, hey there.

58
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Thanks for joining us.

59
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,960
So, you know, we have a few things to talk about today on the show.

60
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,840
There's like a whole lot to cover.

61
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,000
Brent, you're still over at Alex's place doing projects.

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sitting in his desk chair right now.

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,520
I think at this point you've proved too useful

64
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,000
to be allowed to leave, right?

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's true.

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,560
These handcuffs are starting to get a little uncomfortable.

67
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
I knew we should have checked on them.

68
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Rescue me?

69
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
The other problem is,

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200
the handcuffs gives you slivers.

71
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Not that I would know,

72
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,600
but I'm just saying they give you the slivers.

73
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
It's true.

74
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,560
And Wes, today you brought steaks to the studio.

75
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,520
So we're gonna do a little barbecue and after the show.

76
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,720
Yes, on a beautiful Pacific Northwest day like this,

77
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
I think we have to.

78
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,200
A little grilling, really, let's be honest.

79
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
I brought some chicken.

80
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,720
So we've got some marinated chicken.

81
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,140
We've got some steaks.

82
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,320
It's gonna be a hell of an after party after the show today.

83
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,320
And I've launched a new show this week.

84
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
Pretty excited about that,

85
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,560
office hours.hair if you want to check that out.

86
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,160
I'm gonna do another live stream on Tuesday,

87
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
this coming Tuesday as we release this.

88
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,640
We'll be doing some sack giveaways to help people charge up their wallets for the podcasting

89
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
2.0 boost.

90
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
What time are you doing that?

91
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,400
Noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern Westpane.

92
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,860
You know what I want to do after today too is I want to sit down and have a little record

93
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:15,000
sesh with you and Brent and Alex and chat about our JB summer project plans that we

94
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
have.

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,440
So that kind of stuff I'm gonna feature in office hours.

96
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,900
And I'll have the mobile room going too so if you got any questions for me, pop in there

97
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,280
and ask them.

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,800
Personal Matrix stuff, I don't know, JB stuff, show stuff, go ahead and put it in there.

99
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,040
And we'd love to chat.

100
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:40,360
Also FYI, you got like a few days after this here podcast comes out to register at the

101
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,860
JB Matrix server.

102
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,640
After that we're gonna shut down registration for a while.

103
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
And it doesn't mean you can't participate.

104
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,860
You can go still create a free account at matrix.org.

105
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:57,560
But if you want a Matrix account with a jupyterbroadcasting.com domain, you have got until let's say Wednesday,

106
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,840
Wednesday of April, which would be the 27th, 2022.

107
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,640
If you'd like to have an at Jupiter Broadcasting domain name for your Matrix account, sign

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,440
up now because after that we're gonna shut it down because of spam or problems while

109
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,920
we reengineer a few things.

110
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,920
We'll probably eventually open it up one day, maybe, but I'm not guaranteeing that and we

111
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,120
may not either.

112
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,800
So if you want to get in while you still can, we have linuxunplug.com slash matrix and our

113
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,320
Matrix server is colony.jupyterbroadcasting.com.

114
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Limited time only.

115
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
I gotta go fast.

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
That's right.

117
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,340
All right, so let's get into the Ubuntu 2204 leftovers that we have.

118
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,160
There's some really interesting things that landed in this release and everybody's now

119
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,840
finally gotten their hands on it that wants it in that first kind of early window.

120
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,160
And I think this is the one where we're seeing a lot of the work land in GNOME 42 for the

121
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,360
new dark style changes.

122
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,700
And there is a post over at discourse.ubuntu.com that really digs into all of the changes they

123
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,720
had to do and the different implementation details to get this working in 2204.

124
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,280
And so if you're just interested in the kind of plumbing stuff, I want to put that in the

125
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,840
show notes so you can check it out.

126
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,180
But a couple of other things that are in this release that I think are worth mentioning

127
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,360
that we didn't cover last week.

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,520
And I think number one for us here on the show, because we've talked about that Mars

129
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,600
copter, that Linux copter so much.

130
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Yeah, we have.

131
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Still going strong, by the way.

132
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Still going strong.

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,200
They just hit their one year anniversary.

134
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,320
I sent Tim a congratulations email about it because they're super excited.

135
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
It's so great.

136
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,160
And you know, one of the things that Tim told us to make Linux work on that helicopter on

137
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,600
Mars is they had to patch the kernel for real time support.

138
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,980
It's just something they absolutely need.

139
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:44,040
And so 2204 LTS is actually offering a real time kernel beta that users can install.

140
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,240
Designed to quote, meet telco network transformation needs for 5G.

141
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,440
Hopefully it's also useful for our little Mars copter.

142
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,280
Yeah, you know, maybe not surprising, but real time kernel patches and the preempt RT

143
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,800
stuff can actually be a little controversial in our community.

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Surprise, surprise.

145
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,360
It's come a long way.

146
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,120
It's kind of wild to see it get to this level and, you know, finally reach some real integration,

147
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,260
some ongoing maintenance, more widespread use, perhaps.

148
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,640
It was a topic that was discussed within Canonical for many years prior to, you know, actually

149
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,680
shipping as a thing.

150
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,360
What was the big holdup, Wimpy?

151
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,920
The fact that there's a large misconception in the wider world as to what real time actually

152
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:36,540
means, what the definition of real time means, and, you know, an oversimplistic summary of

153
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:45,640
that is real time does not mean now, it means within a reproducible latency window.

154
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:52,960
That's what real time actually means, you know, does it happen within a determinable

155
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
window of latency?

156
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,240
Right, you don't want those unbounded spikes that mean your machine didn't respond in time

157
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,040
for some safety critical features, say.

158
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Right.

159
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,640
And, you know, lots of people have, I think there's a lot of placebo effect among enthusiasts

160
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:12,680
have been using real time kernels for in conjunction with things like Jack, for example, for audio

161
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
processing.

162
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,240
And, you know, when well implemented, you know, a real time kernel can play a role there

163
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
for sure.

164
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,200
But I think some of it was actually making sure that there were some measurable assurances

165
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,400
around what a real time kernel can deliver.

166
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Fair.

167
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,680
I also wondered if perhaps we're seeing it land now just because in February Intel acquired

168
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,640
the folks behind the real time preempt RT kernel patch stuff.

169
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Linutronics.

170
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Yeah, Linutronics.

171
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,000
And now it's an Intel outfit.

172
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,920
Maybe Canonical already has a better relationship there.

173
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,600
I mean, maybe that made things a little easier.

174
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Is that just wild speculation you think Wimpy?

175
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:55,000
I've not been part of those discussions, so it would be wild speculation on my part.

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I got I got a real spicy matrix message this morning that was quite upset because the user

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,160
had just finally made the leap to the 2204 LTS and they discovered that the Firefox package

178
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,920
has been replaced as a snap now.

179
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,040
And they also discovered that when they install certain things from the command line, even

180
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,320
though they did an apt install for a dead package, they end up getting the snap.

181
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,520
And they were they were quite upset about this.

182
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,900
And this is something that we've talked about before on the show, but just to remind people

183
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,040
that, yes, there are certain packages now that are snap packages in here.

184
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,560
And that is not necessarily because Canonical just wants to make everything a snap.

185
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,640
In the case of Firefox, this is something that Canonical and Mozilla had to work out

186
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,240
at Mozilla's request.

187
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,880
There's other things in here that are snaps that you wouldn't expect, like the UFW firewall

188
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,440
is also a snap in 2204, which is pretty surprising, but it makes you wonder if maybe that means

189
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,860
they could update individual sub components of the Ubuntu 2204 system without having to

190
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,520
update all of the packages on the system.

191
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,460
So it'll be interesting to see where that goes.

192
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,200
But our buddy Popeye has released unsnap, which I will mention on the show, which is

193
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,400
essentially a fancy script to help you migrate from snaps to something else.

194
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,240
And I mention this because I think this is this is probably the way it's going to be

195
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,600
for a while, is there's going to be more and more things that are snaps just simply because

196
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,160
that makes it simpler to maintain across multiple versions of Ubuntu.

197
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,640
In some cases, it means it can be maintained directly by the software creator themselves.

198
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,840
And for most users out there, the quote unquote average users that are using Ubuntu, they're

199
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,760
not really going to care much.

200
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,320
But for the people that understand what a snap is or have an opinion, there's going

201
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,080
to be community solutions like this unsnap script that Popeye has created.

202
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,160
UFW is not exclusively a snap.

203
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:49,320
Like it is available as a snap, but it's not shipped as a snap by default in Ubuntu 22.04.

204
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,080
It's still a deb that's in the standard base system.

205
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,400
So I'm curious where that commentary comes from.

206
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,300
And yes, Popeye did make unsnap.

207
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:11,400
And if I may be so bold, I have a project called get deb, which is apt get functionality

208
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:19,800
for installing deb packages that reside outside of the Ubuntu app repository ecosystem.

209
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,320
I will paste a link to that.

210
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
It's brand new.

211
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
It's super fresh.

212
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,840
I've only I've only published it like a couple of days ago.

213
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,240
But it means that you can install things, for example, that only exist in GitHub releases

214
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,700
pages, for example, and other third party app repositories.

215
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:46,240
So it's a very handy way to get software that is only available via deb from other means.

216
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Yeah, that's great.

217
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,680
Because I imagine a lot of people that are moving away from snaps probably would prefer

218
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
the deb.

219
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,680
As far as UFW, I didn't mean to imply that it was the default way it's configured.

220
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,120
I just mean that there's a lot there's a lot of components you wouldn't expect can actually

221
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
be snaps.

222
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,280
In fact, very core components of the OS can actually be snaps.

223
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,520
And I think Mark Shuttleworth recently made comments about flat packs and snaps.

224
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,960
And I think when you parse what Shuttleworth was saying, he's implying that snaps have

225
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,000
functionality that flat packs do not have.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,440
And I think this is kind of one of the things he's talking about is these individual sub

227
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,840
components of the Ubuntu operating system, or distribution can be replaced with snaps

228
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,840
that traditionally flat packs I don't think could replace, which is an interesting idea,

229
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
right?

230
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,440
You could have a 2204 LTS, and then have these individual sub components of the distribution

231
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,960
updated independently of all of the other deb packages on the system, which I could

232
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,960
see being compelling for some people that are into that.

233
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Yeah.

234
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
And I think that's accurate.

235
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:46,040
And that's been accurate for a couple of Ubuntu releases now that, you know, you can get applications

236
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:55,160
as snaps, and they basically they're rolling applications on top of a stable Ubuntu base.

237
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,360
And that's been the case since, well, it was first introduced in 1604, but it wasn't fully

238
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,920
baked then, I think it's fair to say, but certainly by 1804, it was, and that's a means

239
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,320
by which, you know, you can get those applications.

240
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,480
And I think, you know, Mark's comments about the security, particularly the security capabilities

241
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:25,360
around snaps stands up, like, you know, there are particularly that story resonates with

242
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
IoT vendors.

243
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,040
Yeah, if you have app armor, it stands up, I agree.

244
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Yeah.

245
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,600
Yeah, that's the kind of the critical piece is the the snap security stories best with

246
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,120
a system that is fully app armor compatible, right?

247
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,600
And so it's a nuanced thing, really, I mean, I'm splitting hairs at that point.

248
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,060
But you know, the feedback I got this morning, that kind of brought this whole conversation

249
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:50,080
up was sort of the shock that there had been this transition to the snaps.

250
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,600
And I think it really underscores that a huge majority of the Ubuntu user base is on these

251
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
LTSs.

252
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,960
And they don't even bother with the interns, because if they've been trying the interns,

253
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,880
they would have known this was coming.

254
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,320
Because we talked about it in our reviews of the interim releases.

255
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,280
And it's not even that they're not on the interims, but they are not actively engaged

256
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,160
in the news around Ubuntu itself.

257
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,840
Because otherwise, they would have been well aware that this change was coming because

258
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,800
it was made in the last release.

259
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,080
And we did notice there's a couple of after release things to adjust.

260
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,640
I think probably the most well important, not surprising, surprising would be the wrong

261
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,920
descriptor.

262
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,080
But Nvidia has requested the canonical roll back to using Xorg rather than Wayland when

263
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,400
the proprietary driver is loaded.

264
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,580
So hybrid users are still fine, Intel users, AMD users, you're all getting Wayland.

265
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,680
But if you have the proprietary Nvidia driver, and that's your primary video card, Nvidia

266
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,240
asked them to roll that back.

267
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Hmm.

268
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
Yeah.

269
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
What is that about?

270
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,760
You and I have been, Wes and I have been following a lot of interesting Nvidia Linux related

271
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,920
trends on Linux Action News.

272
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,880
This almost feels like it's fitting into that.

273
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,360
I mean, I don't buy that Nvidia downloaded the beta and did some testing beyond maybe

274
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,600
a couple of people doing it.

275
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Maybe it happens.

276
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,600
And if anybody was going to do it, it would probably be Nvidia.

277
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,760
But most of these companies, most of these commercial companies, despite how much it

278
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,540
would benefit them and how much hassle it would save them and how much user frustration

279
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,720
it would save them, most of them can't be bothered to even begin the testing phase until

280
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,720
sometimes multiple months after the primary release is out.

281
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,160
And so I find it odd that Nvidia has made this request of canonical.

282
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,240
And I wonder if there isn't another shoe to drop, like perhaps some other explanation

283
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,480
for this is yet forthcoming.

284
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
We shall see.

285
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,720
But that's a bit interesting.

286
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,360
And also 3D acceleration for guests in VMs with GNOME boxes has been and vert manager

287
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,380
has been disabled, which is a shame.

288
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,380
That's a bit of a bummer.

289
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,880
But it is what it is.

290
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,960
And it really probably deserves to be tested on hardware anyways.

291
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,640
And you know, when you've got an LTS coming out, I get it like these things are going

292
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,440
to perhaps stick around for a while.

293
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,680
So you do want to be a little bit careful.

294
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
Yeah.

295
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,920
I mean, I wonder if that's sort of commercially motivated that there are solutions that, you

296
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,840
know, provide those capabilities outside of open source solutions and that, you know,

297
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:24,280
Nvidia may be supporting their partners in in their endeavors on that front is wild speculation.

298
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
I do not know.

299
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,280
It is wild speculation.

300
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,760
I'm bringing that proper British bacon to us.

301
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
I love it.

302
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Tasty bacon.

303
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,640
So let's talk about Ubuntu Mate Wimpy because I'm running it right here on the live stream.

304
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,440
And I'm showing it to the people that are here live today.

305
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,440
And this feels like a real refined release.

306
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,120
The theming is just on absolute point.

307
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,460
Of course, it's based on the 2204 base.

308
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,160
This is like a one of the feels like one of those Mate releases that you could install

309
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
on a machine and just use it for three years.

310
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Yeah.

311
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Well, thank you.

312
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,080
That's kind of kind of where I was headed with this and and the rest of the team of,

313
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,960
you know, been supporting the development of Ubuntu Mate over the last two years.

314
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:14,360
But yes, you know, I consider myself now an intrinsic part of the Yuru team.

315
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,640
I was first acquainted with them as a result of putting together, you know, a sprint when

316
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:28,440
I worked at Canonical when I was leading the Ubuntu desktop team, and we sort of reinvigorated

317
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,760
the significance of Yuru within the Ubuntu project.

318
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:39,480
And ever since then, I've been, you know, a contributing member of that team, and I've

319
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,680
worked very hard to make sure that all of the good work they've been doing for Ubuntu

320
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,000
and GNOME was reflected in Ubuntu Mate in this release.

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,360
And so that's why there's a very firm commitment behind making the Yuru themes front and

322
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,680
center in this release.

323
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:07,040
So I've been thinking about loading this on my Pi 400 as sort of my standby, always ready

324
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,600
workstation machine.

325
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,360
And I'm wondering if with 2204, is it the case that we're refining the experience and

326
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,280
we're eking more and more performance out of these types of devices, or have we kind

327
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,400
of hit the wall and it's going to be kind of the same as it was for the last couple

328
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
of releases?

329
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
What are your thoughts?

330
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,520
Again, my information is a little bit out of date, but I can tell you what I know of

331
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,760
the relationship as was between the Raspberry Pi Foundation, or specifically the Raspberry

332
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:43,240
Pi trading organization and Canonical, which was Raspberry Pi trading and their engineers

333
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:52,320
were working towards supporting what we would consider the contemporary APIs in the Linux

334
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:59,640
ecosystem for exposing GPUs, GPU acceleration and cameras.

335
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:07,080
So you know, traditionally, those are exposed through proprietary APIs and wrappers and

336
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
shims.

337
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,840
And they've been moving ever closer to using, you know, the things that we recognize, you

338
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,240
know, drive three, video for Linux, and so on and so forth.

339
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,600
And I think what you're seeing with this release is not just that relationship between Canonical

340
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,280
and the Raspberry Pi Foundation bearing fruit, but the Raspberry Pi Foundation, you know,

341
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,520
following through on their commitment to support those open standards.

342
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
I like it, though.

343
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,320
It is nice to see it slowly but steadily get better there.

344
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Absolutely.

345
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,800
So we talked about the artwork.

346
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,880
The AI generated wallpapers have been getting a lot of attention in our audience.

347
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,040
That's what I've been seeing people talk about in our chat rooms.

348
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,920
But I think also the significant thing in here is a pretty solid version of MATE itself,

349
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
right?

350
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
Yeah.

351
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,080
You know, it's interesting what's happening upstream in MATE Desktop itself, in that the

352
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,400
last sort of two releases, and I can see this when I go and look in.

353
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,880
So there's a service in Ubuntu called errors.ubuntu.com.

354
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,520
You know, when you get those pop ups that says something crashed, blah, blah, blah,

355
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,440
do you want to submit these results?

356
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
That's where they go.

357
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:25,240
And what I'm seeing is the good work that's happening in upstream MATE Desktop to find

358
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:35,660
and resolve use after free bugs or memory leaks and things of that nature, a number

359
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:42,960
of those bugs you just see drop off a cliff as you move between like 1804 to where we

360
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,440
are now.

361
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:52,720
So yes, MATE Desktop in of itself is now looking extremely robust.

362
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,360
And that's not to say the code base that we inherited when it was forked from GNOME 2

363
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,480
was in some way substandard.

364
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:11,800
You need to remember that that code base was refactored from GTK2 to GTK3 and a whole bunch

365
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:20,800
of different underlying technologies in order to keep it contemporary and up to date.

366
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,640
And those initial ports were functional, but maybe a little bit rough.

367
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,600
And now we're seeing a refinement of that work.

368
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
We sure are.

369
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,440
And it is really noticeable just almost immediately when you fire it up.

370
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,880
So I also kind of want to talk about something that touches on a previous conversation we

371
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,920
just had in the show.

372
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,720
And I want to talk about this from a couple of angles, but it seems like you're cautiously

373
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,320
setting up Ubuntu MATE to be a bit of Switzerland when it comes to packaging.

374
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,880
If users want to use DEBS, fine.

375
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,600
If you want to use a SNAP, fine.

376
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,080
If you want to use a flat pack, fine.

377
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,640
And I feel like that part's a little bit new.

378
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,480
Is that controversial for a flavor to do?

379
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,320
And could you just share some of your thoughts there?

380
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Yeah, sure.

381
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:09,900
So I will say, I'll prefix this by saying your friend of mine, Joe Ressington, I record

382
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:16,360
it a podcast with him and Adam earlier this week, which is out now called Linux Downtime.

383
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,760
It's episode 45.

384
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,800
And we dig into the whole, how do you make a distro?

385
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,560
What is involved in making a distribution?

386
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
All about.

387
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,340
And we dig into that in more detail.

388
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:35,600
So that's definitely sort of, you know, homework for listeners to go and have a listen to that.

389
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:44,360
But on that particular point, this wasn't my individual decision to include flat pack

390
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
support in Ubuntu MATE.

391
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:53,840
In fact, I sent out a tweet earlier today from the Ubuntu MATE account, sort of poking

392
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,240
fun at the very idea.

393
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,280
But it came from the core team, the rest of the team that helped support and make Ubuntu

394
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:09,360
MATE said to me some weeks ago, well, months ago, in fact, we should include flat pack

395
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,400
support in Ubuntu MATE.

396
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,200
My initial response was, well, I think that's going to be complicated.

397
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,360
It's going to have all sorts of, you know, dependency collisions.

398
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm not sure that's viable.

399
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,160
But when I actually looked into it, it was, as I said in the tweet earlier, it was super

400
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,840
simple, barely an inconvenience.

401
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:37,440
So, you know, steered by that impetus from the team around me, I implemented it, you

402
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,920
know, I did the due diligence around it, made sure that that was a safe technical decision.

403
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,240
And we delivered that.

404
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:54,720
But that's kind of the expression of Ubuntu MATE as what it's always been, which is really

405
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:02,920
Ubuntu MATE is a utilitarian distribution, you know, you can make it into the thing you

406
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:10,880
want it to be, we don't want to overly constrain the options that are available to the people

407
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
that use it.

408
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,240
And by making every contemporary packaging format available in Ubuntu, an option for

409
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:27,320
our users was, you know, in keeping with that, you know, original goal of the project that

410
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,160
we outlined eight or nine years ago.

411
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:36,300
I like that way of thinking about it, because it often was you turn to a flavor or a derivative

412
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,480
that maybe wasn't an official flavor to get some of the things that maybe Canonical couldn't

413
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
bundle, right?

414
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,020
Maybe it used to be codecs, or maybe it was even a kernel with CFS by default.

415
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,280
And that's always been a role out there that these other distributions have served for

416
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,520
the audience that wants that.

417
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,120
And you're right, it is just that only now instead of the MP3 codec, it's Flatpak.

418
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
Right.

419
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:06,240
And you know, you need to understand that, you know, the Ubuntu project is made up of

420
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,560
the significant effort that Canonical put into it.

421
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:16,280
And again, this is something that I outline in Linux downtime, definitely have a listen.

422
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:26,000
But more so the different flavors of Ubuntu, we all agree that Ubuntu is a fantastic platform

423
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,320
to develop on and innovate on.

424
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:40,720
And where we respectfully disagree is how that Linux desktop experience should be presented.

425
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:48,960
But we are all working together in order to deliver that Linux desktop experience, regardless

426
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,980
of our differences of opinions about how we think that that should be done.

427
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,040
And there's an enormous amount of crossover, you know, especially now, you know, you look

428
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:05,520
at Ubuntu MATE and Xubuntu, there's a significant proportion of Ubuntu MATE that's delivered

429
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,760
via the Xubuntu desktop.

430
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,600
You look at Ubuntu Chilin, and again, a lot of the underpinnings of Ubuntu Chilin come

431
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,320
from Ubuntu MATE.

432
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:23,080
And that kind of reciprocal collaboration exists throughout the flavors.

433
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:30,220
And it's not competition, it's very much a collaborative, you know, feel that happens

434
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:37,400
between the developers and the development communities around those flavors.

435
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,200
Linode.com slash unplugged.

436
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,600
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

437
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
show.

438
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
I mean, that's really how this works, right?

439
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,080
It lets you know, it lets the sponsor know that you heard about it here.

440
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,960
So that's what the URL is for, it's linode.com slash unplugged.

441
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,840
And it's one we can enthusiastically endorse.

442
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,080
Linode started in 2003, it's one of the very first companies in cloud computing because

443
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,320
they just saw what Linux could do.

444
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,040
And then they built a business around that.

445
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,440
19 years later, they have the absolute best business in the space.

446
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,880
They make cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible to all.

447
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,140
And they've just rolled out Ubuntu 2204 support.

448
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
So they have that up there.

449
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,440
Now if you want to go try it out and play with it, go create a go create a system.

450
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,520
That sounds like a great new server to play with.

451
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,520
Absolutely.

452
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
Right.

453
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,520
And you get $100 to do it when you go to linode.com slash unplugged.

454
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,320
You know, they also have all the other districts you probably want to try.

455
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,280
It's pretty impressive, actually.

456
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,680
But I mean, now is the season of Ubuntu 2204, right?

457
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,160
So go experiment with one of their one click deployments, get an entire server in one stack

458
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,200
or go build something up yourself.

459
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,680
And if you ever get stuck, the audience tells me I've never actually had to use the support

460
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,700
as far as oh, no, that's not true.

461
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Just once recently.

462
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,700
That's right.

463
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,520
I know it actually was a great experience.

464
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,020
I had my first after a couple like two and a half years, I finally had like my first

465
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,420
Linode support experience.

466
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,920
And it was as good as all of the audience is always telling me.

467
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,480
Now we use the heck out of things like their S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls,

468
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,760
DDoS protection and VLAN support for some fanciness that Westpain gets into every now

469
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
and then.

470
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,640
Most of the time, though, I'm just muddling my way through trying to keep the DNS working.

471
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,680
And thankfully, they have a powerful DNS manager that lets you do all of that.

472
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,000
And with pricing 30 to 50 percent cheaper than those major hyperscalers, they have these

473
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,880
esoteric platforms and these crazy UIs where they just want to lock you in forever.

474
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,520
Unlike them, they got great pricing and they'll scale for something you want for yourself.

475
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,600
Like maybe maybe you want to go set yourself up a GitLab instance now that they're getting

476
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,800
a little bit grabsy with the user count there.

477
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Could be a good opportunity.

478
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Yeah, right.

479
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
It really does.

480
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
You can use it for personal things.

481
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
You can use it for your small business things.

482
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,240
Or I mean, if you get more successful than that, Linode will be there right there with

483
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
you.

484
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Scales right up.

485
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
And it does just a great job.

486
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,360
And they're always there to help you out if you ever need it.

487

494
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,820
All right.

495
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,800
Now that we've talked about Ubuntu, we're going to talk about NixOS, which is actually

496
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Wimpy's fault.

497
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,560
I think it was when Wimpy came on here weeks ago, a couple of months ago, and he's like,

498
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,760
you got to look at NixOS.

499
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
It's the future.

500
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
You're welcome.

501
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
And made me think about it again.

502
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Really?

503
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
I know I respect your opinion, Wimpy.

504
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,320
When you say like, this is really something I'm noticing.

505
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,560
I thought, you know, I've had a lot of people tell me it, but Wimpy's on here and he really

506
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,000
sounds convinced.

507
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,080
That's why you keep handing me that Mate ISO.

508
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
I was wondering.

509
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,480
I should have tried Nix packaging on Mate.

510
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,040
If I wasn't making Ubuntu Mate, I'd be building a desktop around this NixOS.

511
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Really?

512
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
A desktop?

513
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Oh, for sure.

514
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
Yeah.

515
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Why?

516
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:58,360
Because NixOS is the best expression of where the Linux desktop and that intersection of

517
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,120
the desktop and container technologies exist right now.

518
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,800
I can see where you're coming from.

519
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,320
I've been very impressed.

520
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,520
However, I did hit my first like, oh, maybe Nix isn't the right choice for this snag.

521
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,400
And I kind of am a little demotivated and discouraged.

522
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,520
I'll tell you guys about that.

523
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,880
But Wes, I'm curious, I know you've been doing a lot of reading recently about Nix, kind

524
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,400
of getting into the backstory about Nix.

525
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,320
Like, where are you at right now with the challenge?

526
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,840
Yeah, you know, I haven't switched everything over to Nix, let's say, but I've been having

527
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,080
fun just kind of poking around the various places because there's a lot to play with.

528
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,680
I was looking at like trying to understand where flakes are going to fit in a little

529
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
bit better.

530
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,780
I was also playing with Home Manager a little bit.

531
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,440
And then I've also been poking around just in my dev side of my life, like, well, yeah,

532
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,160
because, you know, Nix is a build system.

533
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,420
So where does it fit there?

534
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,780
So I was playing with Poetry to Nix, which Poetry is a cool new dependency manager for

535
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:55,020
Python to help you set up and build and maintain Python projects.

536
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,100
And because it's quite declarative itself, there's some neat wrappers that can help you

537
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,960
just like take your Python project, get it all building with Nix.

538
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,520
And then once you've got it into Nix, you kind of like lift it up and then all the facilities

539
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,960
that Nix has for building you a VM image or just building a nice, really clean little

540
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,380
Python Docker image for you, it can just take that.

541
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,380
So that's been fun.

542
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:20,480
And just recently, someone made CLJ Nix, which is some Nix helpers for Clojure projects,

543
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,240
which is really in the same vein, but even more niche.

544
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,560
So it was right up my alley, I had to dive right in.

545
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,360
And then just to keep down that track, I don't know how you say it, but there's a version

546
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:40,160
OS inspired by Nix, Geeks, I think, GNU Geeks, it's quite similar to Nix, except the syntax

547
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
is Lisp.

548
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
So it's even better somehow.

549
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,520
Now, it's a GNU project, so it's a little more limited.

550
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,800
It's in the GNU ecosystem.

551
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,900
The packages that it has are all free software.

552
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,280
So I don't think I would actually, even though I love anything Lisp, really, I don't think

553
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,520
that I would do it.

554
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,600
But they have been celebrating like 10 years, I think, of the project recently.

555
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,760
So we've got a link in the show notes if you want to hear about some of the stories behind

556
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,680
what it takes to make a project like that.

557
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,400
Yeah, that is really neat.

558
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,240
Okay, so this poetry stuff looks absolutely fantastic.

559
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,760
Link to all of that in the notes.

560
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
That's great.

561
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:19,080
Now, I know, Brent, I know that you had some time recently to play around with Nix on a

562
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,560
Raspberry Pi, which is the direction I want to take this.

563
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,720
I'm curious how your Nix OS challenge is going so far and what your experience has been.

564
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,920
Yeah, I was able to, if you remember last time, use a VM to run a desktop and such.

565
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,460
So I had a good time there.

566
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:39,140
But I figured I would try, this entire month has been trying to convince Alex that maybe

567
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:45,720
there's something to Nix, so recently he and I both jumped on a Raspberry Pi to get things

568
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
going.

569
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,400
That was a nice opportunity to get me working on a Raspberry Pi for the very first time.

570
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,920
So wait, wait, so this is your first Pi and I think you said you guys are tag teaming

571
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
that?

572
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
How did this work?

573
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,080
Let's hear a little bit more about that.

574
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,720
Well, we had to cut the Pi in half, you see.

575
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,800
No, Alex has a drawer of trinkets here and there are many Pis there.

576
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,960
So we figured we would get one set up.

577
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,000
He's got a nice corner here that's like dedicated to Pi playing with.

578
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,680
So he let me sort of wipe the system on there and just have a go at it.

579
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,460
And I thought that would be a great way to experience the Pi for the first time.

580
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,400
We ended up sharing a team up session for a little while too.

581
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,680
So we could both SSH in from our laptops and sit comfortably rather than hunching over

582
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
the same screen.

583
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Nice.

584
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Which was a nice trick.

585
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
That is a good way to do it.

586
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Like gentlemen.

587
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,160
I assume Brent was already in the recliner and just didn't want to get up.

588
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
That was your solution.

589
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
That was my spot.

590
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,320
That's exactly where he's sitting now.

591
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,760
So what was the experience like on Raspberry Pi?

592
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Is the performance OK?

593
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,840
How did all of that operate?

594
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,280
I was very impressed.

595
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:54,440
The memory footprint of a freshly booted Raspberry Pi is 100 meg or so on Nixos.

596
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
127.

597
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,080
That was with Tailscale and Docker services running.

598
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,760
So I'm subtracting a little just for those as a guess.

599
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,360
But we got to the end of the evenings messing about and I said to Brent, which USB stick

600
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
did you use?

601
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,240
And he was like, I didn't.

602
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,240
I used an SD card.

603
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
I didn't know better.

604
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,160
Oh, so the performance was better than you expected, I take it, if you didn't notice.

605
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,440
Compared to what I'm used to with like apt install, whatever, and how long apt takes

606
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,640
to do what it does on Raspberry Pi OS and Ubuntu, which is what I'm familiar with.

607
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:36,640
The Nixos rebuild switch command took about, I don't know, 20 seconds, 25 seconds each

608
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
time.

609
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Yeah.

610
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,840
Which gets a little laborious when you're making a one line config change.

611
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,960
But overall, we were left with what a 40 line configuration file which declared the entire

612
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,960
system.

613
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,280
It's very elegant, I've got to say.

614
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,360
And I know Brent said a few minutes ago, he's been trying to convince me.

615
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,220
And there was a few light bulbs went on last night.

616
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,160
And I remember feeling that way about Docker about eight years ago.

617
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:06,920
I remember a specific moment, Alex, where you got quite excited while we defined Docker

618
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
virtualization.

619
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,240
Yes, I did.

620
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,600
Because they spell virtualization correctly.

621
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,720
We tried to spell virtualization with a Z, and it didn't work.

622
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,800
And then I read the documentation properly, and it spelled it with an S. And I was like,

623
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
hey, British.

624
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,280
Well, Europeans is what they are.

625
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:31,120
I think that's a really astute observation, though, about the Docker experience on Nix.

626
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:39,840
Because in my experience, what I do now is very much entrenched in the container ecosystem.

627
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:46,920
And I am increasingly finding industries, people, and organizations that are deeply

628
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:55,800
invested in producing, developing, working on containers on a daily basis that are not

629
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:05,160
desktop Linux nerds, but that are absolute advocates for Nix and NixOS as the platform

630
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,240
where they curate, develop, and produce their production containers.

631
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,000
It's not perfect, though.

632
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,120
For example, why are there three manuals for NixOS?

633
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,200
I found that as well.

634
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,360
The documentation can be a bit almost too complete, but spread out in a bunch of different

635
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
places.

636
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,160
So that can, I don't know, eat up a little bit of time and frustration, but once you

637
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
get it.

638
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,960
And quite contradictory, sometimes even the same Wiki page contradicts itself with a little

639
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,440
headline saying, this bit's out of date, when three lines above is the actual correct answer.

640
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,620
That can be quite confusing.

641
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,040
I think that's fair observation, right?

642
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:49,560
And for everything that I see as potential with NixOS, I'm going to try and frame this

643
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,280
in a way that isn't too incendiary.

644
00:35:52,280 --> 00:36:01,840
But if you think about Debian as being a project, Ubuntu was very much the product, right?

645
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:09,460
So it took all of the best bits of Debian and productized it, which is why Ubuntu sort

646
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,920
of soared to success.

647
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:22,560
And I'm not advocating for somebody to create a derivative of NixOS in order to turn what

648
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:30,120
is an extremely interesting and high potential project into a product.

649
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:39,120
But I would absolutely love to see the shoulder of the community behind NixOS as it is now

650
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:46,000
to turn it from exciting project to viable product.

651
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,380
Wimby, what you just said, you put exact words to my thought process here.

652
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:55,960
In my experience of using Linux distributions, this is very much in like the proto-Debian

653
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
stage.

654
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,920
I recognize it's been around for a decade, but it clearly would benefit from a canonical

655
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,960
type organization coming along and making a product out of this thing.

656
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Maybe it's not for that.

657
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,640
It's for people who want to build infrastructure, and maybe that makes sense.

658
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,040
But I am honestly surprised nobody's given a go at it, or if they have, I just haven't

659
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
found it yet.

660
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:24,880
And I agree, but I would dearly love for us to learn from our Linux past and not be the

661
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:36,360
Manjaro to Arch or the Ubuntu to Debian and just invest in what is NixOS now and get buy-in

662
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:42,240
and help that existing vibrant community to be more successful.

663
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,600
Yeah, right.

664
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
That is the way to do it now.

665
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,500
In 2022, that's the way to do it.

666
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,600
That's the way you got to do it now.

667
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
And there is that.

668
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,960
I mean, I have been impressed with the community just on our own matrix and just around, you

669
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,680
know, I think it's true that it's at the stage where the docs don't necessarily always match

670
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,360
and it's kind of living and you really have to be able to figure out the next Nix expression

671
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,080
language to be able to debug what's going on.

672
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,760
But there are a lot of people who are willing to help get you on board if you're willing

673
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,280
to take the step to step over the line and start asking those questions in one of those

674
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
spaces.

675
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,680
We had another little odd experience where we were trying to create a user for the first

676
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,680
time.

677
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,440
We actually, funnily enough, managed to lock ourselves completely out of the OS three,

678
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
four times.

679
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
Well done, gentlemen.

680
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Well done.

681
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,080
This is an essential experience for Brent, I think, on his journey to being an admin.

682
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,000
We deleted the NixOS user, of course, without realizing it, without reading what was right

683
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,400
in front of us, rebooted and went, actually, no, we couldn't reboot.

684
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,800
Because suddenly I typed sudo and it said this user account is disabled or whatever.

685
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,440
So then we had to hard power off the Pi.

686
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,800
Eventually we ended up getting to the point where we created the user of, you know, Alex

687
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
or whatever.

688
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
But we couldn't log in.

689
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,320
It said this account is disabled.

690
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:57,200
So we could log in as root and we looked and the default shell was set to Sbin no login.

691
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,780
So we thought, OK, cool, we'll just set the default shell to bash and call it good.

692
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:07,040
For some reason, setting the default shell for all the users did nothing.

693
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,960
And we had to explicitly specify per user the shell.

694
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
And that was quite frustrating.

695
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
Oh, yeah, sure.

696
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,840
Couldn't log in because there's no shell to log into.

697
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:23,360
Yeah, my my discourageness, I guess, discouragement that I've been feeling recently is because

698
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,320
I think I picked the absolute worst project.

699
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,840
It does kind of seem that way, unfortunately.

700
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,440
Yeah, I mean, you guys know that I kind of came into this thinking what I would ultimately

701
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:41,000
like to do is either rebuild my Raspberry Pi Pi's in my home set up in lady tubes with

702
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:49,600
Nix or kind of like Moonshot was maybe take a Mac Mini M1 and get Nix OS running on that

703
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,800
and replace three Raspberry Pi's with one M1 Mini running Nix OS.

704
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,520
However, the primary job, I mean, there's a lot of there's a lot of jobs that this thing

705
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,840
would have to do, but the one that actually automates and runs the RV is Home Assistant,

706
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,280
like the absolute mission critical application is Home Assistant.

707
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,040
And it seems like maybe I picked the absolute worst candidate for a Nix install.

708
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Maybe that's good.

709
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
I don't know.

710
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
And there's more I need to solve.

711
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,640
But I'm kind of disappointed right now in my options.

712
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,560
And not all of it is really Nix's fault.

713
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,080
Some of it is actually the Home Assistant project's fault.

714
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:29,240
For an example, on an ARM platform, I can install Home Assistant as a Nix module, but

715
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,160
I get less than everything I need.

716
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,600
And what I do need, it's a manual process to add things, even things that like just

717
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,480
are small tweaks to add a component to the Lovelace dashboard.

718
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,360
I have to manually define and configure all of it in Nix configuration files.

719
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:50,040
And so that means like I can't just do that sort of like I'm in the UI, I'm browsing,

720
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,480
I get inspiration, and I just want to add a module and just try it.

721
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,040
It means no, I have to stop what I'm doing.

722
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,060
I have to SSH and I have to find the right syntax, which I have to find somebody else

723
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,200
who's done an example of this for me.

724
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,560
I think you are running into one of the sort of inherent pain points of taking this approach

725
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,600
of the plus side is it means you've totally specified it and you can make it happen again

726
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
instantly.

727
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Right.

728
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,680
But it is not the same.

729
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,640
Now, sometimes you can get the best of both worlds there.

730
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,360
But you're right in this case, like you got to you got to get there quite painstakingly.

731
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:24,960
And if this was Samba, if this was Nginx, if this was sync thing, this wouldn't be a

732
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
total non-issue.

733
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Right.

734
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,960
But the Home Assistant project has what really makes it great.

735
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,140
Our community add ons are these additional add ons that have been created that are easy

736
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,960
to add when you have the entire Home Assistant experience.

737
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:46,080
I could install Home Assistant as an OCI container, which is probably ultimately what I'll do.

738
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,720
But that uses Podman, which is great, but not my core skill set at the moment when it

739
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,800
comes to container management.

740
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:00,880
And when it is this home system that actually runs my RV, I'm not super thrilled about that.

741
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,320
You know, I went down a path that went a little closer to more of the Docker compose path

742
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
that you're familiar with.

743
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,680
So there might be something to play with there.

744
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,360
But you're right, it is it is different.

745
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,520
And as you say, right, like anything but running the whole sort of expected Home Assistant

746
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,900
experience is a little bit outside the mainstream and limits you on what exactly you can do.

747
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,680
And in that configuration, we're just talking about Home Assistant core.

748
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,800
We're not talking about all the community bits and the supervisor management to get

749
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
that.

750
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
I basically have to go with a whole VM.

751
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Right.

752
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,160
Is Podman a requirement or, you know, because we got Docker running in a couple of minutes.

753
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,660
Oh, no, you absolutely can do.

754
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,420
It's like the version that's packaged by the community that uses this whole OCI container

755
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,600
process that set up to use Podman.

756
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,960
I think Wes is probably right is I probably could just go the Docker compose route and

757
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,960
go that way.

758
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,880
But, you know, that's me kind of coming to like a new goalpost because the goalpost originally

759
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,420
was a totally orchestrated home automation system that is 100% reproducible and only

760
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,560
changes when I mandate it to change.

761
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,760
That was the goal.

762
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,880
And now I'm kind of basically just getting back to exactly where I'm at now.

763
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,400
I tell you, when you started this NixOS challenge and you set those goals about having like

764
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:14,080
a standardized JB build for our VPSs and, you know, maybe some of your pies and stuff,

765
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,560
I thought you were mad.

766
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:21,080
But after doing this last night, genuinely, some light bulbs went on for me and I there's

767
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,140
a real elegance to doing it this way.

768
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:28,960
You declare everything and you solve a problem one time and then it's solved forever.

769
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
Yeah.

770
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,440
And you could see how for a guy like me who like every now and then I get these bursts

771
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,520
of inspiration where I've got project time and I create some great stuff.

772
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,000
It's the one time you can focus, you get really deep in, you'll learn all the stuff, you get

773
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
that in your head.

774
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,160
And it's becoming more and more rare because I got, you know, I got young kids and they're

775
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
getting older.

776
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
I got limited time.

777
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,320
That's where some of my extra time goes now.

778
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,480
So you also have to run a business.

779
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,800
Like Alex says, it's like now that I can solve it once and it also self-documents.

780
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,240
It's self-documenting in how it works too, which is for a guy who never gets around to

781
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,960
the documentation, just beautiful.

782
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,840
So I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to find some sort of like middle ground here.

783
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:15,200
Part of what makes this tricky is home assistant, the project and many projects do this.

784
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,400
They don't release just a generic arm 64 image.

785
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,800
They have raspberry PI images.

786
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,040
They have maybe, you know, like a Synology image or a pine image, right?

787
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:33,960
But they don't, for most projects, they don't just offer an effing arm 64 image.

788
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,960
Even though there's more and more just arm 64 systems out there and the Mac M1 systems

789
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,200
are a great example of this.

790
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,760
And not only that, but there's more and more of us out there that might have a Mac with

791
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,340
virtualization and we want to run Linux and we need arm 64 images.

792
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:55,400
But our community still has it in their little heads that the only people that are using

793
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,400
arm are on raspberry PI's and the home assistant project is included in this group.

794
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,600
And so I can't just download a home assistant arm VM image that I can run on arm 64.

795
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,720
I can get a raspberry PI image.

796
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,080
I can get a raspberry PI three image.

797
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,760
I can get a Synology arm image, but I can't get an arm 64 image and it's so frustrating,

798
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,920
but that's what it is.

799
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,240
So the next stuff has been really great and like my Bitcoin node.

800
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,240
Oh man, I could totally see why I'd want to run Nix on that.

801
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,000
But for my home assistant system, I have to just live with the fact that I'm not getting

802
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,640
all the benefits that Nix and NixOS offer.

803
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,240
It's really the next package manager that offers and it's just going to be the way it

804
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,360
is because that's how the upstream project decided to operate.

805
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,780
And I realize it's not their target, right?

806
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,420
They want people running their own via.

807
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:51,240
But what I have discovered is some of the absolute best conversations I've had in Linux

808
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,320
recently and just geeking out about Linux stuff have been with other NixOS users.

809
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,280
They're really a clever bunch.

810
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,800
They're solving problems in really cool ways.

811
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,360
And kind of once you start working your way through using Nix, you start thinking about

812
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,480
how you could build systems differently.

813
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,560
And I think it changes the way you think about stuff.

814
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,280
I've been impressed too that, you know, especially for some, you know, a purely functional, you

815
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,480
know, declarative environment, you'd think it might be kind of a little, a little hardcore

816
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,320
or everyone's like really focused.

817
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,520
Kind of like sometimes we see with some of the dogmatism on the free software side of

818
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,520
things.

819
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,520
That's really not, not been my experience.

820
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,200
You know, I think they, they recognize it's a weird way to do things.

821
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,640
It's not what you're used to.

822
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,640
It's not perfect.

823
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,600
There's lots of areas that don't quite work as well as you'd like or have areas that are

824
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,280
lacking polish, but it seems like that's, that's pretty upfront to people like, oh yeah,

825
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,260
that's not perfect, but here's how I might solve that or here's a workaround that could,

826
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,260
that could work for you.

827
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:44,140
That's exactly been my experience and it's been very positive and it has, it has made

828
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,500
the community, even though it's probably just a portion of the community, right?

829
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,740
But it has made that portion of the community who is on matrix just seem very welcoming

830
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,600
and it has not made me afraid to ask silly questions.

831
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,520
I've not once been told like RTFM you noob, right?

832
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,440
That people have walked me through it and it's been, it's been a good experience and

833
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,440
not just myself.

834
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,440
Okay.

835
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,760
So one of the things that came up in these discussions when we launched the whole next

836
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,940
challenge is should we just be doing this with Ansible?

837
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,020
And I know that was a, that was a position that Alex felt pretty strongly.

838
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,480
So now that you've played with a little bit Alex and had some time, what are your thoughts

839
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,940
now where, where we started this with NixOS or Ansible, is this similar?

840
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,460
Are they solving the same problem?

841
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,460
What's your takeaway?

842
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:28,140
Both are declarative configuration mechanisms and Ansible requires a reasonable amount of

843
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:32,580
learning, a couple of days worth of learning, I would say to be proficient in the basics.

844
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:37,060
And I kind of wanted to equate that to what Brent and I spent last night doing of maybe

845
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,500
what, three or four hours of hacking around.

846
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,780
And we had a fully functional declarative system.

847
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:49,860
One thing we don't have with the NixOS config file as it stands right now is a way to automate

848
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:54,340
that with, you know, a Git repository, which Ansible kind of automatically pushes you towards

849
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,140
because there's so many different files to manage, but essentially they're solving the

850
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,140
same problem.

851
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:05,220
And the learning curve between the two is, I'd say Ansible is probably a bit easier and

852
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:09,300
using my experience and Brent's experience between the two of us, we could actually solve

853
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:13,300
quite a lot of problems more quickly than either of us individually, which I thought

854
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,300
was interesting.

855
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:21,700
But, you know, Nix does take a bit of a, you've got to, I think what you said Brent was forget

856
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,060
everything you've learned about Linux in the last decade.

857
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,060
Yeah.

858
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,740
I wonder if it'd be easier to teach a newbie, someone who hadn't already, you know, dealt

859
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,540
with the standard Linux distros.

860
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,700
Sometimes it is when you don't have all the bias of the past.

861
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,660
Well often we did run into issues that were like, well, I can't, I can't log in because

862
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,660
there's no user.

863
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:41,220
This is such a strange thing, but it's only because we've assumed that that stuff was

864
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,220
defined.

865
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,180
You know, and once you do it, it's very, very, very, very, very, very easy.

866
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:49,900
But it took us, you know, a few moments to be like, oh yeah, that is what's happening.

867
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,740
We have to actually tell it that we want it to exist.

868
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,500
So you just kind of have to forget about the assumed defaults.

869
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,380
And you found the GitHub community about NixOS pretty interesting too, right?

870
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:07,860
Well, we did set up a little GitHub Jupiter broadcasting GitHub discussions where we encouraged

871
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:14,140
everyone who, you know, thank you for joining us on this NixOS challenge this month.

872
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:19,260
And we were able to gather a whole bunch of screenshots from the community.

873
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:26,180
And also there are some amazing discussions on different configurations that people used

874
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,420
and different ways they solve problems.

875
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:33,620
There's a whole bunch of like additional bonus goals if you want extra meaningless points

876
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,740
on like manager and things like that.

877
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,740
Exactly.

878
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:42,900
So I would encourage, you know, even if we're sort of softly celebrating the end of the

879
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,320
challenge here today, I think there's a lot of great resources there.

880
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,020
It's worth diving in and reading what the community has shared there.

881
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:57,420
I was blown away by the knowledge of and, and the knowledge and also the willingness

882
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:00,460
of our listeners to jump in on this experience with us.

883
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,460
So thank you.

884
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,460
Yeah.

885
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,460
I want to just echo that.

886
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,980
I am very thrilled that so many people were willing to just play along with us on this

887
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,500
just to have fun and that so many people that didn't necessarily engage, they're just willing

888
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,660
to listen to see how our experience went.

889
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:18,820
And I think we should keep it going because this is going to be something that is ongoing.

890
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:23,940
And I think the NixOS challenge matrix room should keep going too, because I'm going to

891
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,940
have more questions.

892
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:31,020
I think what is now sort of the awkward elephant in the room is what do we do about these new

893
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,080
physical servers we have here in the studio that we haven't fully deployed yet?

894
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,260
Do we pause and go with Nix on them?

895
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,260
Like it's-

896
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:45,140
I think we would do a new poll for the community, but it just has one option.

897
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,140
That makes it legitimate, right?

898
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,140
Right.

899
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,140
Yeah, totally.

900
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,140
You want to hear, let's do that.

901
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,140
That's a dictatorship.

902
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,140
Not democracy.

903
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,140
Let's see.

904
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,140
We'll put it together.

905
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,700
Maybe we'll let the people decide.

906
00:50:54,700 --> 00:51:00,580
May I just add a little summary to what you were just saying about like the GitHub community?

907
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,580
Please.

908
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:06,380
I think it makes perfect sense that you've got good support and information from the

909
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:13,140
GitHub community surrounding NixOS, because the people that are using NixOS to get stuff

910
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:18,860
done are professionals that are using NixOS to get stuff done.

911
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:23,380
And they're not partisan Linux desktop users.

912
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:31,740
By and large, they're industry professionals that want great tooling to solve problems

913
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:38,340
and you get that stack overflow experience from that community.

914
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:46,380
And it's a bit sad that after all of these years, the partisanship that exists within

915
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:52,260
the Linux desktop community is still so toxic and unhelpful.

916
00:51:52,260 --> 00:52:00,100
And yet when you look at where work happens and, you know, effective deployments need

917
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:07,220
to be, you know, illustrated, maintained, documented and helpful support exists, that

918
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:12,100
exists outside of what we would call mainstream desktop Linux.

919
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,980
Yeah, I think it could make a lot of sense for us.

920
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,980
So here's what I'm going to do.

921
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,860
I'm going to make a poll and I'll put a link in the show notes.

922
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:20,100
Should we use NixOS as our cloud and local server OS?

923
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,540
There's two options.

924
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,540
Yes.

925
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,020
And stick with Seuss, you lizard haters.

926
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:28,700
We'll put a link in the show notes at linuxunplug.com slash four five five.

927
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,200
And keep in mind, a vote for yes means that a lot of times we're going to have to come

928
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,300
up with some way to get NixOS running on a VPS because we've managed to do it on Linode.

929
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,740
But I don't know if other VPS providers are going to let us replace their images with

930
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,740
NixOS.

931
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,740
So keep in mind.

932
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:51,100
But for our local systems and for all of that going forward, I can see a real healthy setup

933
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,100
here.

934
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:57,340
I'm not trying to backtrack on the tumbleweed, but I could see a healthy setup here of Proxmox,

935
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,460
which has maybe some tumbleweed systems and has some Nix systems.

936
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,980
And we have all of these systems working together.

937
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:08,980
And what I would possibly see us doing is just moving more and more and more infrastructure

938
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,100
over to these three boxes.

939
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:15,020
And as we do that, some of them are going to have audience critical facing features

940
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:20,220
because word has it they are deploying fiber in this neighborhood.

941
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,540
And if they start deploying fiber here, I'm probably going to start spinning up more and

942
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,540
more services.

943
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,540
JBDC becomes a real thing.

944
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,540
Yeah.

945
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,740
So we better get that cooling installed because we're going to have brand.

946
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,740
I heard you.

947
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,740
I heard you.

948
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:40,580
Totally plus one to Proxmox and also putting the JB community shoulder behind popularizing

949
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:50,100
Nix OS so that it might become more widespread and a supported option in the, you know, the

950
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,060
VPS and cloud providers.

951
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,580
We may create a little market demand.

952
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:58,760
I've been quite impressed with the whole Nix OS lustrate and just the ability to get Nix

953
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,300
running just about anywhere and then further Nix OS to take over a box.

954
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,100
There's a lot of potential there too.

955
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:09,700
Also it feels as bare minimum as an Arch install or a Gen 2 install, but is a fraction of the

956
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,760
time to get it up and running.

957
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,220
You basically got to partition your disk, add a couple of config options, and then you're

958
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,420
good to go and mount a few things, right?

959
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:22,620
Like it's, Wes and I now on multiple occasions have just stood up a quick Nix OS box to try

960
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,180
something just after a show or something like it's not a big deal to get it going.

961
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:31,020
I'd just like to add that, you know, working with the Nix community, we invited them to

962
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,500
a snap cross summit.

963
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,500
What's this now?

964
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,640
Three years ago.

965
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,780
And the quickest, easiest way to make a snap is to use Nix, the packaging platform.

966
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,340
I hadn't even thought, but of course.

967
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,340
Yeah.

968
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,340
Wow.

969
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,340
Yeah.

970
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,540
They added it as just a can, another container platform to, you know, create your apps and

971
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,780
it works extraordinarily well.

972
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,780
I like it.

973
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,780
Thank you, Wimpy.

974
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,220
See, this is a perfect episode to have Wimpy with us for this, right?

975
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,220
All right.

976
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,600
Well, so we'll have links to the GitHub if you'd like to still participate.

977
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,600
It's going to go on.

978
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
We're going to keep it up.

979
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,600
We're still, we're still going.

980
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600
We're still learning.

981
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,340
The whole process is really just beginning with this challenge, but I hope that the month

982
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,860
of April was an opportunity for us to get rolling.

983
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,900
This is our last episode in the month of April, if you can believe it.

984
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,100
So let us know what you think and find that Nix challenge room in the matrix.

985
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,800
If you want to chat with other folks and find that GitHub link at linuxonplug.com slash

986
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:30,780
four 55 bitwarden.com slash Linux, get started with a free trial of teams or an enterprise

987
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:36,100
plan at bitwarden.com slash Linux, or go try it for free as an individual user.

988
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:41,220
I am so stoked to have Bitwarden here as a sponsor, you know, like this is way better

989
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,580
than telling you about a mattress, right?

990
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,620
This is telling you about a way to keep your online accounts secure.

991
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:50,220
And if you're in the enterprise, there's a lot of great options here now too, as well.

992
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:54,500
You know, you can share and sync your sensitive data, of course, but Bitwarden is fully customizable.

993
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:59,280
You can turn features on and off with enterprise policies and it's open source.

994
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,220
They have had their core code audited.

995
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,940
They've had people look at it, you know, Bitwarden started in 2016 and they've just been iterating

996
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,060
on this idea to make it better and better and better.

997
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:13,100
A few years ago, I decided to switch to Bitwarden and I have been absolutely happy with the

998
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,100
choice.

999
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,220
I like the command line option to tell you the truth.

1000
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:20,260
That's been really handy on my SSH boxes, but also I have it installed in my browser

1001
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,780
as an extension and on my mobile devices.

1002
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,580
So when I bring up something on my mobile device, I can log in with a really long, complicated

1003
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:32,100
password and it supports two-factor authentication on the internet phones from the Apple Corporation.

1004
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:36,300
It supports the face ID for unlocking, like all of that, and of course other biometrics

1005
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,300
as well.

1006
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,900
And one of the things that gives me confidence in Bitwarden is that they do have a self-hosted

1007
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,900
option.

1008
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,340
So if I ever get to the point where I'm like, you know what, time to go this way, I can.

1009
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:50,220
But if you also just want to get up and running in minutes, Bitwarden Cloud is a fantastic

1010
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:54,360
option and they have a large active community that's always available on their forums and

1011
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,820
Reddit plus support as well.

1012
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:00,580
And I think one of the things that I didn't really understand, but now I can kind of grok

1013
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,420
as just maybe a game changer for a lot of you out there, is Bitwarden has introduced

1014
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:09,100
account switching for your personal stuff, your work stuff, your open source project

1015
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,300
stuff, you know, all that kind of thing.

1016
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:15,740
You can now isolate it out, you know, separate it out between the different jobs, which is

1017
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,740
really a nice feature.

1018
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:17,740
That's perfect.

1019
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,740
Yeah.

1020
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:19,740
Right.

1021
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,740
You move on from one place.

1022
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,740
I don't need, I mean, they're going to change the passwords anyway, right?

1023
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,740
Those don't work.

1024
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,740
I don't need them cluttering things up.

1025
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,740
That's what I used to do.

1026
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,740
I used to have it all.

1027
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,740
Like that database.

1028
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,340
One, that's not a great practice to start with and two, yeah, it's bad for you as well.

1029
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,340
It's not good.

1030
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,340
It's not good.

1031
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,940
And really, let's be honest, you may already know all this.

1032
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:38,540
You might be already using Bitwarden even, but maybe friends, maybe family, maybe others

1033
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,140
out there aren't.

1034
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,980
Maybe the place you work at hasn't really figured out their password management strategy

1035
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:44,980
yet.

1036
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:45,980
Yikes.

1037
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:50,100
Well, tell them to go to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1038
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:54,380
Go try it out for yourself or your business and you'll support the show and you're going

1039
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,380
to do something.

1040
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,180
Just this one thing could really help protect you online.

1041
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:03,380
You know, there's a lot of stuff, but good passwords that are individual for each website,

1042
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,380
that's key.

1043
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,460
That really makes a big difference and support the show and do that at bitwarden.com slash

1044
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,460
Linux.

1045
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:10,460
It's easy to get started.

1046
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:17,020
You just go to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1047
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,980
As usual, we received some great feedback this week.

1048
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:25,060
One of which David wanted us to play with a welder that he works on.

1049
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,340
Now normally we don't kind of consider that kind of adult request on the show, but this

1050
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,340
one time.

1051
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,340
It's true.

1052
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,340
Thank you, Wes.

1053
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:36,700
He writes, David writes, if you want to weld with a full feature state of the art welder

1054
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,660
running Linux, I can make that happen.

1055
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,040
I work as a professional on the equipment in tech support.

1056
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:49,260
The front panel, which is a seven inch touchscreen and many of the boards run Linux.

1057
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:54,580
The front panel is nearly a full Linux stack, including Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth support.

1058
00:58:54,580 --> 00:59:01,740
It also hosts a website to manage the hardware, OPC UA server and MQTT for generating metrics.

1059
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,740
No way.

1060
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,740
I know.

1061
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,740
This thing's amazing.

1062
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:10,820
It runs a fairly modern kernel and the R&D guys call the distribution Weld OS internally.

1063
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,140
Oh my gosh.

1064
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,180
How cool is that?

1065
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,180
Weld OS.

1066
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,180
What?

1067
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:19,900
I mean, you know, for Linux action show, I used to have this bit at the beginning of

1068
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,260
every show where I'd say, this runs Linux.

1069
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:28,860
I never once ever in hundreds of episodes had a welder there, but I mean, is there another

1070
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,340
operating system you trust in that kind of environment?

1071
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,780
You know, back in the day it would have been Windows CE.

1072
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,420
Remember that period of time when CE was just like all kinds of horrible stuff.

1073
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:41,140
They're building a new light rail stop near my house and I can see like it's not operational

1074
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,140
yet.

1075
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,140
I can see one of the TVs.

1076
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,140
It's running Windows.

1077
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,140
Oh God.

1078
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,140
I know.

1079
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,140
I know what you're saying, but.

1080
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,140
They need an intervention.

1081
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:52,540
He mentions that licenses and source code are available if you look hard enough or ask

1082
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,140
kindly enough.

1083
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,040
And Chris, did you do any image searches of this thing?

1084
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,500
It's the Fronius TPSI to get a sense of sort of what it looked like.

1085
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,500
I had to go take a look.

1086
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,840
I'll put a link in the show notes.

1087
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:09,120
It does have what it kind of just looks like a tablet behind a piece of plexiglass installed

1088
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,420
at the top of this thing.

1089
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:19,540
I grew up with a family member who was a welder by trade, and these things they they sit out

1090
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,540
in the rain.

1091
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,940
I mean, they try not to, but it happens.

1092
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,140
It's like on the back of their truck.

1093
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:26,540
It gets rained on or they're at a job site and the weather changes.

1094
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,220
They get cement on them.

1095
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,540
They get dust on them.

1096
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,860
They get sawdust like they this is.

1097
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:39,460
You really got to appreciate like this is a computer that is going to live through hell.

1098
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,900
Hell doesn't do it justice when you talk about the kind of thing it's going to go through.

1099
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,060
So David, thank you.

1100
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:48,620
I think also worth mentioning is that downtime is darn expensive if you're running one of

1101
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:49,620
these.

1102
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,380
So I would imagine they put a lot of effort into that.

1103
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,380
Also, I appreciate that.

1104
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:58,380
David said that if we're ever in the Chicago area, that he'd totally give us a tour of

1105
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,380
the lab that he works at.

1106
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,460
Well, you were just talking about that Chicago meetup.

1107
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,460
Right?

1108
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,460
Yeah, let's do it.

1109
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,460
Yeah, let's do it.

1110
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,460
All right.

1111
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:09,420
Well, this next bit of feedback wasn't directly sent into the show.

1112
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:14,600
I was listening to the podcasting 2.0 show, which is a fantastic production by Adam Curry

1113
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,600
and Dave Jones.

1114
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,300
Dave Jones has been on the show before.

1115
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,340
And they talk about all of the developments and happenings in the podcast world, which

1116
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,420
of course I'm always fascinated by.

1117
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,020
And Adam Curry, the pod father was listed.

1118
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:29,740
He now listens to Linux Unplugged, which welcome into the show, Adam.

1119
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,740
Thank you for listening.

1120
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:33,020
Glad to have you as one of our audience members.

1121
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,020
Absolutely.

1122
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:38,940
I had what I would imagine is a very legitimate question that most new listeners have when

1123
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:39,940
they tune into the show.

1124
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:44,220
And that is, how the hell do you guys try out so many Linux distributions?

1125
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:48,800
They're always testing out new Linux installs.

1126
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,580
That's a lot of what they do, or Linux upgrades and distros.

1127
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:58,580
And I'm wondering, does anyone have, you know, so I have, I'm running Linux Mint as my daily

1128
01:01:58,580 --> 01:01:59,580
driver.

1129
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,980
Now, if I wanted to migrate, I'd be in trouble.

1130
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:04,260
I mean, I have stuff installed.

1131
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:07,420
I sure have some PHP version.

1132
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,420
What do these guys do?

1133
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,620
They have one laptop that is really their laptop and they use it and they don't mess

1134
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:12,620
with it.

1135
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:16,540
And they have another junker that they change all the time, or is there a simple way to

1136
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:25,260
move your environment over in the Linux environment where you move a lot of stuff over or just

1137
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,820
wind up reinstalling everything?

1138
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:31,940
Well, if you use on next shell, you'll see, next shell, you can just load it and go.

1139
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,660
No, this is a fair question.

1140
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:37,500
And Adam has it close, but just slightly backwards.

1141
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:42,700
Like one of my nicest machines, which is a ThinkPad, is my distro hopping box most of

1142
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:43,700
the time.

1143
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:49,180
And my workstation that I never really reinstall very often, maybe once every four or five

1144
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:52,460
years, that's an old clunker.

1145
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:54,580
That's the one that doesn't get any love.

1146
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,260
And that's my way of doing it.

1147
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:59,740
It's just, I have a separate machine, but each of us has our own approach.

1148
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,940
Wes has some crazy approaches that he uses.

1149
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:06,900
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm an animal, so I use QEMU on the command line powered by Kexec

1150
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,060
to install things and then reboot to, you know, because sometimes you want to try like

1151
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:15,000
native graphics drivers, but if you don't want to be crazy, I mean, Wimpy has a wonderful

1152
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,820
project out there, Quick EMU that, you know, that'll do all the work for you.

1153
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:24,740
Yeah, that's actually my method of choice is, you know, I don't have 27 machines laying

1154
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:27,740
around like most of you do or seem to.

1155
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,220
And thus, Wimpy, thank you, thank you.

1156
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:34,760
I've been using Quick EMU a ton, been loving it to do a bunch of, you know, participate

1157
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:39,300
in some testing weeks for the new Ubuntu release and things like that.

1158
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,500
So it's been a wild ride and I've loved it.

1159
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,500
You're welcome.

1160
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,060
And it wasn't invented by accident.

1161
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:50,140
It is the non-animal approach to what, you know, Wes does.

1162
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:52,620
I wouldn't want my experience to be had by anyone else.

1163
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,620
So I'm glad that you've sanitized it for the civilized world.

1164
01:03:56,620 --> 01:04:01,900
We'll put a link to Quick EMU in the show notes, but it's basically just a project that

1165
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:05,300
is absolutely something we've all wanted forever.

1166
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,360
And now it also has a GUI component as well.

1167
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,900
So it's not just a command line thing you got to do, but it lets you quickly create

1168
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,220
really optimized VMs on a Linux box.

1169
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,840
And what Wimpy has done and the people that are working now on the GUI have done is made

1170
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,860
it super simple to just say, I want to run this distribution or Windows or whatever it

1171
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:27,060
might be, and then it sets up all the back end, like fiddly stuff for the virtual machine

1172
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:32,020
to make it run at absolute best possible speed and graphics and all that kind of stuff.

1173
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:34,940
Yeah, we just tried it out for the first time the other week and it was nice.

1174
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:35,940
It's great.

1175
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,940
Yeah.

1176
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:42,580
There's even a sister project that sets up a GPU pass through and what was I going to

1177
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:43,580
say?

1178
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,580
I've forgotten.

1179
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:48,180
But there's, you can do GPU pass through now through a sister project.

1180
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,780
Very nice.

1181
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:53,820
And now it is time for the boost.

1182
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,580
We got some amazing boosts this week.

1183
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,140
Thank you very much.

1184
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:00,860
Tomato deer writes in with 5000 sats.

1185
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,100
Thanks for RSS hub recommendation.

1186
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:09,860
I wanted to give honorable mentions to Mini Flux for articles, Wallabag for archival.

1187
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,460
So those I think would be considered two picks.

1188
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,460
Yeah.

1189
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,460
Right.

1190
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,460
I think Alex uses Mini Flux, right?

1191
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:19,660
I did for a little while, but the requirements to get it set up were a little bit onerous

1192
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:23,780
and like a compose, like there's a lot of database stuff to futz around with and.

1193
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,780
Gotcha.

1194
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,180
It works, but it's not for the faint of heart.

1195
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:31,540
It does seem really sweet as far as like if you were somebody who consumes a lot of news

1196
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:36,820
and you bring a lot of different feeds in and you want something that's clean and manageable,

1197
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,100
Mini Flux looks great for that.

1198
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:42,260
But he also linked in here Wallabag, which is a web application that lets you save web

1199
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,260
pages for reading later.

1200
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:46,460
So it's sort of like an Instapaper or pocket, but one you can self host.

1201
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:49,500
Oh, now that looks handy and what a fun name.

1202
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:53,420
We also covered Wallabag in LUP 378 if you're interested.

1203
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,420
Very good.

1204
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:58,540
We got a boost from DFJ 225 four days ago with 4000 SATs.

1205
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:02,840
I was inspired by the show to give the value for value model a try using decentralized

1206
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,620
technologies right on, brother.

1207
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,700
Thanks for putting out the interesting show to the world.

1208
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:13,060
And you know, something else I've noticed is we're not getting as many boosts, but we're

1209
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:16,940
getting more people who are just streaming SATs as they listen.

1210
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:20,780
And so this has us talking internally about ways that maybe we could expose some of the

1211
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:25,520
membership features to people who are doing this because that's incredible.

1212
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,360
It's such a neat thing to open up helipad and see people there as they listen, some

1213
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,100
SATs are coming in.

1214
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:35,060
And as part of the value that I want to return to the audience who is sending this boost,

1215
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:39,060
I have set up an old monitor in my office that I've turned on its side with a Raspberry

1216
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:44,120
Pi and I just have the boost up on that screen all the time when I'm in my office.

1217
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:48,620
So it has now become like the fastest way to get a message in front of my face and make

1218
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:49,620
me smile.

1219
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:53,260
These, they come in pew pew and you know, I have it up all the time.

1220
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:57,660
I came in, I came in my office today before I even sat down at my desk.

1221
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:02,100
I heard a pew as a, as a boost came in and it's just so awesome because I actually turned

1222
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,620
out, it turned out to be kind of a rough morning.

1223
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,580
And so as I was sitting down at my desk, I got a boost and it just, I don't know, it

1224
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:08,580
makes me smile.

1225
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:09,580
Yeah.

1226
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:10,580
Chris smile button.

1227
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,580
We could all use one of those.

1228
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:16,380
I have been chatting about ways to maybe automate tooling around those boosts, like capturing

1229
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:19,660
them from the backend of helipads and perhaps putting them into the chat rooms of various

1230
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,660
shows and stuff.

1231
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,660
Right.

1232
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:22,660
I mean, we like seeing them.

1233
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:23,660
Why not make it easier?

1234
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:24,660
Yeah.

1235
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:27,220
Well, what's cool is when you put all of this stuff behind open source software, right?

1236
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:31,140
You build it with open source software and you put it on an open decentralized network.

1237
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,020
Well, guess what we can do?

1238
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:36,640
We can build tools around that because anyone can participate.

1239
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,640
So we could build tools that bring all the different boosts into the individual show

1240
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,820
docs automatically or put them in front of the host in a way that you could never really

1241
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:49,240
do with email without some sort of really crappy rickety filtering.

1242
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,460
And that's why I think boosts are an important part of value for value going forward.

1243
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:57,220
Now value for value is a separate thing that could be any payment system or it could be

1244
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,220
your time.

1245
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,220
It could be effort.

1246
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,380
It is a concept where listeners are asked to share their value.

1247
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:05,020
They get from listening to the podcast and its producers.

1248
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:08,860
In most cases, that means like a dollar amount because that's just what we all have available.

1249
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:12,480
We don't have a lot of time, but it could be other things, too.

1250
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,980
It could be one off help.

1251
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:19,940
It could be maybe participating in our mumble room on a Sunday and helping people get their

1252
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:20,940
mic working.

1253
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:23,740
It could, it could be coming up to the RV and helping with your time.

1254
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:26,660
It could be creating a piece of artwork that we use for something.

1255
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:29,780
It could be participating in a show and adding a bit of information.

1256
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:32,360
Like there's so many ways to contribute value back.

1257
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:37,300
It could be giving us a ride in your Tesla or just showing up to our meetup.

1258
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,300
I mean, gosh.

1259
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:39,300
Yeah.

1260
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,980
All these guys got to think they had a listener come give them a ride this week in their Tesla.

1261
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:42,980
Well, that's extra special.

1262
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:43,980
I'm jealous.

1263
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:49,180
He showed us the full self-driving mode and it was an experience, hey Brent?

1264
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:50,180
It was.

1265
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,260
Anyways, it was interesting.

1266
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,340
Thank you, Lucas, for giving us the best coffee of the week.

1267
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,340
Yes, very much.

1268
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,340
Ah, very nice.

1269
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,340
Yeah.

1270
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:02,700
So if you'd like to send us a boost, go grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

1271
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:08,180
If you don't want to switch podcast apps, I have been experimenting this week with the

1272
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,180
Breeze wallet, B-R-E-E-Z.

1273
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:16,220
It is a, it's a lightning destination is essentially what they're trying to create.

1274
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:20,240
It's worth checking out for you antenna pod users out there because I don't know if the

1275
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:25,220
antenna pod project is going to integrate boost directly right now, but they are investigating

1276
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,260
integrating with the Breeze wallet.

1277
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,900
So you could kind of get ahead of the curve there.

1278
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:32,820
If you're on antenna pod and grab Breeze, you listen in antenna pod, you add one of

1279
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,180
our shows to Breeze, and then you just send the boost that way.

1280
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:36,740
It's a pretty great way to do it.

1281
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:39,020
And then, um, breeze itself is open source.

1282
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:42,760
In fact, most of it's GPLed, so it's pretty great.

1283
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,940
And what I'm going to do, and Wes let's remember to, let's remember to put this like in the

1284
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,940
description.

1285
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:51,260
I'm going to add our lightning node address directly.

1286
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:55,900
So if you want to use something like the boost CLI or some other tool that isn't necessarily

1287
01:09:55,900 --> 01:10:00,260
a podcast app, you can, or if you want to open up a channel to us, you absolutely can.

1288
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:04,620
We'll have a link to that, but we'll also put our lightning node address in the description.

1289
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,620
And you know what?

1290
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:10,260
Let's build out that peer to peer network because I believe after having done this for

1291
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:16,200
15 years, this is probably going to be a component of the next 15 years of content creation.

1292
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:20,540
And when you combine what Adam and Dave and the team are working on with podcasting 2.0,

1293
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:21,860
you're getting incredible features.

1294
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:27,040
We're going to add real actual new things to podcasting that is needed for a decade.

1295
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,340
We're not there just yet for everyone, but we are there for early adopters and it's very,

1296
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,340
very exciting.

1297
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:38,340
So if you'd like to participate in that, we'll have all of that information in the show notes.

1298
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:44,060
But we do have an interesting, perhaps risque pick before we get out of here.

1299
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:45,140
I chose this one again.

1300
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:48,680
I guess this is the second week in a row where I have the pick, but really abusing your show

1301
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,680
runner privileges.

1302
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:53,460
So I just came across this and I haven't tried it yet, but this is more like a hasn't even

1303
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,460
tried it.

1304
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:55,460
I know.

1305
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,460
I normally don't do that.

1306
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,460
I normally don't.

1307
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,660
But I wanted to get the word out there and collect feedback.

1308
01:10:58,660 --> 01:10:59,660
So send us a boost.

1309
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:05,500
And if you've tried this, it's Proxmox V7 or the Raspberry Pi, of course.

1310
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,560
So it converts.

1311
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,240
This isn't something they release as a project.

1312
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,500
You can't go get Proxmox for arm boxes.

1313
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:18,520
See my earlier rant in the show, but you can install Raspbian and then use this script

1314
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:25,960
called Pymox to convert that Raspbian install into a full Proxmox node, which can be fun

1315
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,820
for like backup testing or maybe you just want to run a couple of things like the gosh

1316
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,300
darn Home Assistant VM on your Raspberry Pi.

1317
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,300
I know.

1318
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:39,720
Or maybe you want to build more of that arm 64 software goodness that you were missing

1319
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,720
out on earlier.

1320
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,160
I love to see that, too.

1321
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,460
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

1322
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:47,160
Pymox 7 is the project name.

1323
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:51,480
And if you've tried this or if you do try it, please let me know what you think, because

1324
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,400
I almost did it to one of my production pies this weekend so I could report it on the show.

1325
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,400
But I chickened out.

1326
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,200
I totally chickened out.

1327
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,160
I just didn't want to break the Internet.

1328
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,500
I was doing I was doing a lot of projects this weekend, and it was one of those where

1329
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:09,740
like, OK, I got 10 minutes in and I got to go look up like the next step on YouTube.

1330
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,000
You know what I'm talking about?

1331
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,920
However, I am happy to report that I think I have figured out what has been causing me

1332
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,960
some issues in Lady Jups' water system.

1333
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,960
Whoa.

1334
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,480
I'm feeling like, you know, empowered and shit.

1335
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,360
So there's that.

1336
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:26,640
And I got my tires filled up and I got my solar panels clean like I got some work done,

1337
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:27,640
but I just didn't get this.

1338
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:31,440
So your tech life is in disarray, but your physical life looks pretty decent.

1339
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,640
But maybe this could be a solution for me.

1340
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,880
Maybe this could be a solution.

1341
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,420
Maybe I could have my home assistant cake and eat it, too.

1342
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:43,220
And I could have a Proxmox Raspberry Pi 4 compute module that has a Nix OS system that

1343
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:47,360
runs like all of my services except for home assistant and then a separate home assistant

1344
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,360
VM.

1345
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,360
I just want two VMs.

1346
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,400
Let me know if you've tried Pymox.

1347
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,720
Send us a booster and email Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

1348
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,840
Well, let's see.

1349
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,840
Let's wrap it up.

1350
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,960
Wimpy, it's been forever since you've joined us.

1351
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,200
Is there anywhere you want to send folks any websites or, you know, social accounts you

1352
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,200
want people to check out?

1353
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,200
Two places.

1354
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:12,040
I would like to encourage people to have a listen to Linux Downtime Episode 45 where Joe

1355
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:19,000
and Adam and I have a discussion about what goes into making a Linux desktop distribution.

1356
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,160
And if you want to learn more about making Linux desktop distributions and the other

1357
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:29,040
projects I work on, I mentioned DebGET earlier, then head to Wimpy's World and you can find

1358
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:34,920
the places where I stream and you can join me live as I cut some code and work on this

1359
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,920
stuff.

1360
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,920
Cut some code.

1361
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:37,920
I like that idea.

1362
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:38,920
Thanks, Wimpy.

1363
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,840
Alex, should we send people to self-hosted show?

1364
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,680
I think that's a pretty good place to send people.

1365
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,680
All right.

1366
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,400
And Brent, I'm going to tell people what?

1367
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,320
Check us out right here.

1368
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,320
Okay.

1369
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,360
I think is, uh, no, no, no, no.

1370
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,360
You should plug now, Brent.

1371
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,520
You should go into like, you should go into plug mode and be like, oh, check me out on

1372
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,520
Office Hours.

1373
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,000
I was on the recent Office Hours episode.

1374
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Yeah.

1375
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Yeah.

1376
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Office Hours number.

1377
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Is it one?

1378
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
No, it's two.

1379
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It's two.

1380
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,440
Check Chris and I out on Office Hours episode two.

1381
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,120
And what's that domain, Brent?

1382
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,120
Office dot hair.

1383
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,120
Office Hours dot hair.

1384
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,120
Oh!

1385
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,120
All right.

1386
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,120
We're going to have.

1387
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,120
Office dot hair is surprisingly taken.

1388
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,120
We're going to, yeah.

1389
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,120
We're going to.

1390
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:21,240
We obviously need to have a production meeting here because clearly we got to get our plugs

1391
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,240
down.

1392
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,240
All right.

1393
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:27,200
Well, you can find this here podcast at Linux Unplugged on the Twitters.

1394
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,840
We do this show live and we'd love to have you join our mumble room or chat room or just

1395
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,640
watch, watch and enjoy.

1396
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,320
We do it on Sundays at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

1397
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,320
See you next week.

1398
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:40,120
Same bat time, same bat station.

1399
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,280
And of course, don't miss Linux Action News.

1400
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:48,440
If you're not catching Linux, you're not getting everything, which I'm so, I'm so frustrated

1401
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,440
with them, Wes.

1402
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,440
Yeah.

1403
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,440
Cause we saved the best stuff.

1404
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,440
We save it for land.

1405
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,440
We don't put it in this show.

1406
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,440
No.

1407
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,080
Anyways, linuxactionnews.com for that.

1408
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,280
And uh, you know, go get a little more stuff, Linux stuff.

1409
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,480
And of course we always encourage you to keep the conversation rolling.

1410
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:07,660
We've got the contact page, we've got the matrix info, the mumble info, all of it.

1411
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:11,640
Even the links, even the RSS feeds, that's over at linuxunplugged.com.

1412
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,760
It's real simple.

1413
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,120
It's just linuxunplugged.com.

1414
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,340
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1415
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:43,160
We'll be right back here next Sunday.

1416
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,560
All right.

1417
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,560
Let's go boat.

1418
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,560
JBtitles.com.

1419
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,600
These are the final days of the IRC before we all switched to discord.

1420
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,600
So let's go.

1421
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,600
Let's go.

1422
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,600
Yeah.

1423
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,600
It's a wise decision that I fully endorse.

1424
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,040
And also I'll offer my professional services to help you make that transition.

1425
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,440
You should launch Wimpy's matrix to discord conversion services.

1426
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:15,480
No, I've been asked to do that and I've shot that down from the sky every time it's come

1427
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,480
up.

1428
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:21,840
I don't need those three extra users on the top of the two and a half thousand users we

1429
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,080
already have in the Wimpy's world discord.

1430
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,480
What we need is a, we need a good old classic race and whichever title bot gets finished

1431
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,280
first for the matrix of the discord.

1432
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,280
That's the way we go.

1433
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,280
Right?

1434
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,320
Oh, well, I mean, Gamma's got a pretty sweet bot going.

1435
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:50,440
Well, the race is on.
