1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
Are you all packed up for our trip?

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:01,960
No, not at all.

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,520
But that's going to happen tonight.

4
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,020
Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,760
So I can say it, too.

6
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,440
Well, I've got to do laundry first.

7
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,280
That's right.

8
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,480
I'm totally going to do it after the show.

9
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,160
Wes and I tomorrow fly out to San Antonio, San Antonio,

10
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,000
Texas for the Texas Cyber Summit.

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,680
Before the show, we were both checking in

12
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,840
and realizing neither of us is prepared for this.

13
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,400
What about you, Cheesy, are you packed?

14
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,780
Yeah, I'm pretty much packed up.

15
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,320
I've got a few things to add, some swag to throw

16
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,760
into the back of the vehicle.

17
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,640
But other than that, yeah, I'm ready to go.

18
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,680
Looking forward to hanging out with you guys, obviously.

19
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,160
I know.

20
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,720
That is going to be a lot of fun.

21
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,240
Well, L set us all up with an Airbnb,

22
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,560
so we'll be hanging out at the Airbnb, doing stuff.

23
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,520
That'll be really good.

24
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,880
Feel like it's going to be kind of like Red Hat Summit was,

25
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,080
where we all get to decompress at the end of the day

26
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,320
and kind of rap out for a few.

27
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,400
And like last time, we always get

28
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,940
geeky sitting around talking about Linux

29
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,000
when we get an Airbnb.

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,440
That's the greatest thing, to get the geek out in person.

31
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:00,680
Oh, hey.

32
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,040
Welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show.

33
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,800
My name is Chris.

34
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,520
My name is Wes.

35
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,600
Hello, Wes.

36
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,360
This is one of those episodes where we got together last week

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,080
and we thought, well, let's chat about next week's episode.

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,620
And about 10 hours later, we've got something really cool,

39
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,720
but we went down a few rabbit holes.

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,160
So hopefully, we'll save you some time

41
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,560
when you're trying to set up an ultimate LAN mesh powered

42
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,320
by WireGuard.

43
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
WireGuard, WireGuard.

44
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,080
In fact, we'll talk a little bit about that,

45
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,720
because I think soon you'll be hearing

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,160
much more about WireGuard.

47
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,040
Let's hope so.

48
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,440
Yeah, it seems like there's some pieces that

49
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,680
are moving that are going to kick things into high gear.

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,320
And it turns out things are a bit more

51
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
complex than maybe you might appreciate,

52
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,740
but some things are a little easier.

53
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,480
So we'll get into how I bridged a mobile network with a LAN

54
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,600
network using WireGuard and making

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,560
all the devices on each end of the LAN

56
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,280
accessible to each other.

57
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,200
It's really neat, and it's essentially

58
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,720
enterprise-grade networking tech,

59
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,080
like stuff that you used to have to pay Cisco tens of thousands

60
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,040
of dollars to do, and now it's baked right into Linux.

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,600
And I don't know, maybe people haven't seen your RV,

62
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,680
but you don't have room for a network rack in there.

63
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,760
So we'll talk so much more about that in a little bit.

64
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,140
Of course, we've got the community news.

65
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,200
There's some good stuff in there to get to.

66
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,880
As well as our virtual log.

67
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,800
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

68
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,520
Hello.

69
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,400
Hello.

70
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,320
Hi, good to see you, Wimpy, and Minimac, and Bitten,

71
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,440
and Carl, and Bruce.

72
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
And I'm going to say, Aknomad?

73
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,020
I can't quite see from across the room.

74
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,440
What is it there?

75
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,520
Read it for me there, Wes.

76
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Wes is closer.

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,800
Ace Nomad.

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,720
There you go.

79
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,280
That's it.

80
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,040
Hey, you got it.

81
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,520
You got it.

82
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:39,840
Nice.

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,360
Ace Nomad.

84
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,960
Well, welcome in.

85
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,840
Glad to have you here.

86
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,560
And of course, Mr. Bacon's there too.

87
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,200
Hey, Cheesy.

88
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,260
Hey, hey, hey.

89
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,360
What's up, everybody?

90
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,200
Oh, you know, getting ready to fly down to San Antonio.

91
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,480
Looking forward to seeing you.

92
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,360
Hell yeah.

93
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Yeah, I think it's going to be nice to get

94
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
a little shift in weather, too, from the Pacific Northwest.

95
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,600
More than a little shift.

96
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,440
Well, let's talk about some community news.

97
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,080
And Linus kicks it off this week after, well,

98
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,080
some not-so-surprising comments about Microsoft, I suppose.

99
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,240
I was going to say somewhat surprising, but if you know

100
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,160
Linus, he's very pragmatic about these kinds of things.

101
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,000
So SVJN from ZDNet was at the Linux Plumbers Conference

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,840
and put the question to Linus about how

103
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,720
he feels about Microsoft.

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,360
Linus is then quoted as saying, the whole anti-Microsoft thing

105
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,360
was sometimes funny as a joke, but not really.

106
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,640
Today, they're actually much friendlier.

107
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,920
I talk to Microsoft engineers at various conferences,

108
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,180
and I feel like, yes, they have changed.

109
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,920
And the engineers are happy.

110
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,720
They're, like, really happy working on Linux.

111
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,400
So I completely dismiss all this anti-Microsoft stuff.

112
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,680
If you want more context, you can read the full article

113
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,440
over at OMG Ubuntu.

114
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,920
We'll have that linked in the show notes.

115
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,600
This, to me, sounds like an individual, Linus,

116
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,360
that has to interact with other individuals, Microsoft

117
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,160
developers, on an ongoing basis and has

118
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,480
formed what is pretty much considered a cordial working

119
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,160
relationship.

120
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,440
Right.

121
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,400
I mean, I think it's very different from our perspective

122
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,900
watching development happen and different parties interested.

123
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,640
Linus is right there in the mix of it all.

124
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,560
And yeah, there are probably things

125
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,980
about kernel development, in terms

126
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,840
of people, less so than as an abstraction a far away.

127
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,800
You recall he had a very pragmatic stance

128
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,960
about Android and the use of the Linux kernel

129
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,900
and having really zero issue that people don't know

130
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,760
they're using Linux.

131
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,520
He was fine with that.

132
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,560
That's not what we created Linux for.

133
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,160
So the whole anti-Microsoft thing

134
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,640
was sometimes funny as a joke, but not really.

135
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,560
That's the line that stuck out to me the most.

136
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,920
Because he's kind of like saying the whole MS dollar sign thing,

137
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,400
it never really was all that funny.

138
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,720
And it feels like, in a couple of big ways,

139
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,880
the community is being told, move on.

140
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,540
Move on with the Microsoft stuff.

141
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,480
Move on with Richard Stallman.

142
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's just move on.

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,760
And it's a big ask, both of those things.

144
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,400
And they both represent a massive sea change.

145
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,640
And I think that's why it's taking so much processing

146
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,200
by everyone.

147
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,000
It kind of makes me think we need

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,720
to be more nimble in general, right?

149
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,040
It's not to say that Microsoft's going to be a great Linux

150
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,800
ally forever.

151
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,160
We just need to judge it based on what's happening now.

152
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,800
And I don't mean to say forget the past,

153
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,040
but also remember the present.

154
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,760
By the time we get it figured out, things will have changed.

155
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,880
Exactly.

156
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,860
Well then, moving on from that, let's

157
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,360
talk about the future of OpenPGB in Thunderbird.

158
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
I love Enigma.

159
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,800
It's my go-to first thing I install when

160
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,560
I have a new Thunderbird installation.

161
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,620
And it makes using GPG encryption really straightforward.

162
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,480
I can sign my messages really simply.

163
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,960
I can decrypt and encrypt them.

164
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,280
It's a great piece of software.

165
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,080
Yeah, something tells me if you had

166
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,400
to go do this in the command line,

167
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
you just wouldn't do it.

168
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,440
I mean, maybe make my keys and stuff.

169
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,240
It's actually not so bad, like I suppose,

170
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,880
if you're just going to encrypt a text file

171
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,640
and then attach a text file to an email.

172
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,720
It's not that bad to do it from the command line,

173
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
but a whole email?

174
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,540
It's really crazy, that workflow.

175
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,000
That's why I was a little surprised to see

176
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,200
that Enigma is essentially, for Thunderbird,

177
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,880
going away with the new releases of Thunderbird.

178
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,600
This is interesting, right?

179
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,800
Because people use it a lot.

180
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
It's kind of being depended on.

181
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,160
It has a pretty substantial feature set.

182
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,440
It is a really full-featured, and sometimes

183
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,440
maybe overly complicated, piece of software.

184
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,600
But it appears that the Mozilla developers are actively

185
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,840
working on not just improving the old code

186
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,240
base of Thunderbird, but integrating encryption support

187
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,040
for OpenPGP directly into Thunderbird as a core feature.

188
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,080
Yeah, this is kind of huge.

189
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,920
I'm excited about it.

190
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,640
Yeah, I am too.

191
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
I think it's good.

192
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,960
I think it means more people have access to encryption.

193
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,560
And having it built in means that perhaps more people will

194
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,480
use it, so using encryption becomes

195
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,920
more of a norm, which I think is tremendously important.

196
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,760
But the Mozilla developers, the Thunderbird developers,

197
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,860
and the Enigma developer are very upfront about the fact

198
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,160
that the stuff that's going to be built into Thunderbird

199
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,320
will be nowhere as feature-complete as to what

200
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Enigma could do.

201
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,840
Yeah, although Patrick Brunschwig,

202
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,920
the maintainer of Enigma, makes a good point here.

203
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,000
But in my eyes, this is by far outweighed by the fact

204
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,480
that OpenPGP will be part of Thunderbird,

205
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,060
and no add-on and no third-party tool will be required.

206
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,520
And that's probably worth it, right?

207
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,880
If you need more features, I'm sure new add-ons

208
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
will spring into existence.

209
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,880
And well, go make a PR against future Thunderbird.

210
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,840
Yeah, Enigma itself won't be moving forward.

211
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,160
They write that the new API is just nowhere as feature-rich

212
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,720
as the old web extensions API that they

213
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
could use to create extensions, and there's just

214
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
less stuff they can do now.

215
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,220
But overall, it makes Thunderbird

216
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,360
a more secure product.

217
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,760
Yeah.

218
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,720
Patrick's going to continue to support and maintain

219
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,200
Enigma for Thunderbird 68 until six months after Thunderbird

220
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,120
78 comes out, and will also continue

221
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,280
to support Enigma for Postbox, which is running

222
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,000
on a different release schedule.

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
What do you think, Wimpy?

224
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,720
Could the team pull it off?

225
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,760
Could they get you to switch back to Thunderbird?

226
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,440
No.

227
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,960
Never?

228
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,200
Interestingly, there was a period

229
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,820
at which I had Thunderbird and Evolution installed

230
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,600
on my machine whilst I was evaluating Evolution.

231
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,720
And I had a need to send a signed and also

232
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,880
an encrypted email.

233
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,680
And I chose to do it with Evolution

234
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,440
because that encryption integration is just better.

235
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,320
It's simpler, too.

236
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,480
Yeah, it's simpler to use.

237
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,960
Yeah.

238
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,800
So I chose to use Evolution to send

239
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,120
my signed and encrypted emails.

240
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,760
So consequently, no.

241
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,440
Thunderbird has served me very well for a very, very long time.

242
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,240
And it has been for me, and is for many people,

243
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,760
a staple of the Linux desktop.

244
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,600
But I've found a new place to manage my email,

245
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,960
and I'm very happy with where I've landed.

246
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,680
Yeah.

247
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,320
It is particularly straightforward and easy

248
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,920
to use in Evolution.

249
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,000
I say good on the Thunderbird project,

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,880
though, for baking this feature in.

251
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,880
I think your points are well taken, Wes.

252
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,560
We should probably just step away from the old show

253
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,240
here for a second.

254
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,740
Come here.

255
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,800
The cone of silence.

256
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,760
Don't tell anybody this.

257
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
It's so cozy in here.

258
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,320
I love the cone.

259
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,680
OK, I think we've got a problem.

260
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,080
I don't know if this Atari VCS is going to work out.

261
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,040
Do we have a problem, or do you have a problem?

262
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah, I have a problem.

263
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,560
Well, I mean, as the royal we as a show,

264
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,400
because I backed this thing for the show.

265
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,040
Oh, yeah, right.

266
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,920
I mean, not for myself.

267
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,160
I backed it for the show, Wes.

268
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,840
Oh, here we go.

269
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,120
Oh, Wimpy's in the cone of silence.

270
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,840
Yeah, so this is bad.

271
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,040
It looks like a designer who was contracted

272
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,040
to work with Atari on the VCS has told the register

273
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,120
that they haven't been paid going back over six months.

274
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,080
The consultancy has not been paid by Atari.

275
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,800
And he says, as a small company, they're

276
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,640
lucky to have survived this long.

277
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,880
Because it's been rough, Wes.

278
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,320
Yeah, I mean, if you don't have dollars coming in,

279
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,920
how are you supposed to keep working?

280
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,840
Here's the concern I have.

281
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,720
This launch of this retro console

282
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,520
that looks like the old Atari running Linux that's supposedly

283
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,920
going to have the ability to run other operating

284
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,200
systems on it as well, it's already late at this point.

285
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,160
And it's also listed as one of the three operational goals

286
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,000
for Atari in 2019, 20, and 2020, along adding more games

287
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,800
to their portfolio.

288
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,160
But it's not here.

289
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,240
And they're not paying their bills.

290
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,000
And it's running super late.

291
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And the more delayed it gets, the more Raspberry Pi can do.

292
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,280
And it's just getting more and more embarrassing in all

293
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,200
of the ways.

294
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,560
So what's your bet?

295
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,040
Am I getting my Atari VCS ever, do you think?

296
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,600
I don't think so.

297
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,200
No, never.

298
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,760
No, never.

299
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,560
It's not evident.

300
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,200
You think never?

301
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,800
Never.

302
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,040
Yeah, I agree with Wes.

303
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,400
Now, the next question is, will you be refunded?

304
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,160
No.

305
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,360
You don't think I'm even going to get

306
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,840
a piece of crap hardware?

307
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,040
No, I didn't think this three years ago.

308
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,280
I thought it would be delayed.

309
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,920
I mean, I thought it would be.

310
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,160
I'm like, actually, one of the reasons I backed this,

311
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,880
I'm like, well, this is going to be a story.

312
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,320
So that part has been working out.

313
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
Yeah, it's definitely become a story, that's for sure.

314
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,920
But I think it's interesting, too,

315
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,320
where some people that have worked on the project that

316
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,000
have chosen to remain anonymous have basically

317
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,680
said that the executives have no clue what's

318
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,560
going on, that they wanted to build a Linux-based OS,

319
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,960
but it may not be, that they were trying

320
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,280
to sign a deal with Walmart.

321
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,360
But Walmart wanted them to be under the $250 price point,

322
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,640
so they just pull four gigs of RAM out of the machine,

323
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,080
that they show up to a game conference with empty shells

324
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
with no hardware in them.

325
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,600
I don't know.

326
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,520
I mean, it's all adding up to be pretty sketchy.

327
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,120
Yeah, that is sketch.

328
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,400
Well, I congratulate them.

329
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,800
Congratulations, Atari.

330
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,760
You are continuing on in a long tradition of hardware

331
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,880
fundraisers, and we appreciate you

332
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,920
keeping that culture alive, keeping it strong.

333
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,000
And I would love to be proved wrong.

334
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,640
I would also love to be proved wrong.

335
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,640
I would love at least a little piece of hardware,

336
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,800
a little something, a little retro-looking piece

337
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,280
of hardware that I could play video games on.

338
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,440
Godspeed.

339
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,160
Godspeed to you.

340
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,200
I hope you guys are wrong.

341
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,680
Jeez.

342
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,200
All right, let's change gears, do a little housekeeping here.

343
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,800
We just released a, I don't know,

344
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,440
I wouldn't call it a breakdown so much,

345
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,320
but maybe like a guide to reverse proxy.

346
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,560
I was going to say just like a nerd out,

347
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,460
because we were all pretty excited to talk about it.

348
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,160
Yeah, that's true.

349
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,560
Yeah, thank you for joining us.

350
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,280
So Wes, Alex, and myself got together for a Jupiter Extras

351
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,200
on how we do reverse proxy, when we use NGINX,

352
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,320
when we use traffic, and how it all works with containers.

353
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,680
Yeah, why you might need a reverse proxy at all.

354
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,720
Plus, we talk about a bunch of really great applications

355
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,560
and little tricks and tools for updating your Let's Encrypt

356
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,200
certificates and your dynamic domain, or your IP

357
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,320
if you've got a domain name, and all these little tools

358
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,200
we use to do our own sort of fundamental hosting

359
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,280
of reverse proxy.

360
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,480
So go check out xers.show slash 19 for that.

361
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,500
It's 28 minutes long, and hopefully you

362
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,000
kind of will walk away with a pretty good concept of how

363
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,360
it all works.

364
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,920
And something we use quite a bit in production.

365
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,040
We have traffic now on two different systems

366
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,320
in production, and Wes Payne's making me a convert.

367
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,480
I was an NGINX man.

368
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,720
Yeah, I mean, I'm looking forward

369
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
to playing with version two a little bit more,

370
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,760
so I'm sure we'll be talking about it again.

371
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,120
I should mention as well, with that xers.show release

372
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,280
we did of reverse proxies, we have another one coming out

373
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,000
that is all about the basics of containers, what

374
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,400
it is at a fundamental level, and some things

375
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,560
you need to know about them.

376
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
No hype, no sales, it's just Alex and I doing a breakdown

377
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,040
of how containers work.

378
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,440
That'll be coming out in the xers feed as well.

379
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,320
And then later this week, selfhosted.show,

380
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,480
my home network for under $200.

381
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,960
How I set up my whole home network for under $200.

382
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,720
That's in there.

383
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,440
That's coming out in self-hosted this week.

384
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,520
And then, of course, I should mention

385
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,840
we're going to be in Texas.

386
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,360
Tomorrow.

387
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,640
Tomorrow, and this weekend as the show comes out.

388
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,240
So if you're in San Antonio, going

389
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,680
to make it to Texas Cyber Summit, or just in that area.

390
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,440
Come say hi to us.

391
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,360
Come say hi.

392
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,160
There will be a barbecue Thursday night,

393
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,960
or Wednesday night?

394
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,520
Wednesday night.

395
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,240
Wednesday night.

396
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,720
Which?

397
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,040
6 PM local time, I believe.

398
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,600
Yeah, you and I will just be landing around then.

399
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,320
So we may not make it to the very end

400
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,560
if we make it.

401
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,360
But there will be a barbecue going.

402
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,880
Cheesy.

403
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,400
You'll probably try to make it to most of that,

404
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:53,840
I would imagine.

405
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,320
Oh, yeah.

406
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
I'll be there for sure.

407
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,320
I hear that the cake is not a lie.

408
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,440
It will, in fact, be there.

409
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,240
So come help us celebrate the un-birthday for Elle and Allie

410
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,080
and just kind of get together and hang out.

411
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,560
I think we have something like 30,

412
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,960
33 people so far signed up for that meetup.

413
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,240
People don't say no to barbecue.

414
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,840
Never do.

415
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,320
You don't say no to barbecue.

416
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,160
And Carl has vetted the barbecue for us.

417
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
So we know it's good.

418
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
I love that.

419
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,400
All right.

420
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,000
There you have it.

421
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,720
That's what you need to know about.

422
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,360
Moving right along now.

423
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,840
We, well, really me, had a situation

424
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
that was particularly challenging to solve.

425
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,640
In my home network, I am afflicted by double net.

426
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,520
We all have it from time to time, every now and then.

427
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,960
Maybe you're in a hotel.

428
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,040
Maybe you're going somewhere that's

429
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,080
off of your regular beaten path.

430
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,360
And you wind up, even though you tried your best,

431
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,720
in a double net situation.

432
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,520
And you've got kind of a complicated setup.

433
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,640
I mean, you've got a mobile home, right?

434
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,480
Right.

435
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,680
So I frequently find myself in the double net.

436
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,440
Now, just a brief explanation of what I mean there.

437
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,840
When I say double net, I mean that my internet connection

438
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,920
is getting a 192.168.1.something address

439
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,440
as if it were on a LAN.

440
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,540
That is the quote unquote public address

441
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,760
that my router is getting.

442
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,880
So you've got that from your ISP regardless.

443
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,440
Yeah, so I'm on a 192.

444
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,080
And then my LAN's also on a 172.16.0.0, whatever.

445
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,120
So I have a net just for a day.

446
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,160
So it's net all the way down.

447
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,680
This makes accepting inbound connections

448
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,680
essentially impossible.

449
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,400
I can't SSH into my LAN.

450
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,360
I can't VPN into my LAN because of this double net situation.

451
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,280
It's the worst.

452
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,960
Yeah, no just easy open up a port on your firewall

453
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,760
and call it a day, right, that you don't have access to that.

454
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,440
Right.

455
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,040
But I demand, I demand full remote access, Wes.

456
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,520
The goal I wanted was to connect the studio network

457
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,480
and my home network together.

458
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,120
So when sitting on either LAN, I could access systems

459
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,240
from the other LAN.

460
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,720
Right.

461
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,160
I mean, you've been, as people following self-hosted, well,

462
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,680
no, you're doing all kinds of fun stuff,

463
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,360
hosting things on all manner of gadgets.

464
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,600
You've got your RV just automated and wired up to the nines.

465
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,360
Yeah, this upcoming self-hosted episode

466
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,360
goes into some of that.

467
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,120
There's a lot of ways you can solve this.

468
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,440
Tink VPN is something we've talked about.

469
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,280
Sure, open VPN is very popular.

470
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,800
I suppose at the end of the day, you

471
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,720
could really just do it with a SSH tunnel.

472
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,760
Sure.

473
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,360
There's also a lot of services out there

474
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,940
that will sort of forward those ports along for you

475
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,880
and give you a port on their public IP address.

476
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,920
But that's not really the spirit of what we wanted to do.

477
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,560
Right, right.

478
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,760
I wanted to solve this using some open source software,

479
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,560
built-in stuff to Linux.

480
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,040
We could have used open VPN too, but we

481
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,360
wanted to mess around with WireGuard

482
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,740
because it was a great opportunity

483
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,040
to learn what it's capable of and what it's not capable of.

484
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,120
And there's some infrastructure that you

485
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,360
have to build yourself when you're using WireGuard

486
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,720
that you might not with other solutions.

487
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,800
So a quick recap.

488
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,360
WireGuard is a new type of VPN connection

489
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,640
available for Linux that right now

490
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,520
uses some very clever crypto called Zynk,

491
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,100
but sounds like possibly in the future

492
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,800
we'll use the standard crypto that's in the Linux kernel.

493
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,840
It creates a new interface on your box, a new network

494
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,600
interface.

495
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,080
Shows up like any old interface, like eth0, now you've got wg0.

496
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,680
Yep, like just another interface.

497
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,240
And you can up and down that interface.

498
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,600
When it's up, your VPN is established.

499
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,640
And you can interact with it like you would

500
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,240
any other interface on your system.

501
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,080
It's so great that way.

502
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,920
Another nice thing about it is it's just minimal and clean

503
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,760
and fast.

504
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,520
And unlike some other options like open VPN, say,

505
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,600
there's not as much complicated, stateful tracking

506
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,280
of connection status because all the cryptography handles it.

507
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,440
And you just basically are shoving encrypted packets

508
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,640
at a host.

509
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,000
That host that's receiving it knows that if it can read that,

510
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
it's got a big map of allowed IPs

511
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
and which keys can send from those IPs.

512
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,880
And it just handles it.

513
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,240
So instead of having to make sure that your VPN's restarted

514
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,560
correctly, if you've got your interface up

515
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,040
and you have an internet connection,

516
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,520
WireGuard's going to figure it out.

517
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Now, the other thing that it does really well

518
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,960
is it bounces back.

519
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,600
WireGuard can get knocked down, but it gets back up

520
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,000
every single time.

521
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,960
And this is particularly useful in an RV that's

522
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,000
going down the road that sometimes will have connectivity

523
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,360
and sometimes will not.

524
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,400
Sometimes I'll be parked in a national park that

525
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,160
has no wireless signal for miles.

526
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
And then when I get back into civilization,

527
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,280
I just want things to kind of pick back up and start

528
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,960
working again.

529
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,080
No futzing.

530
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,040
WireGuard's really good at that, too, a fault.

531
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,040
We had even bit Wes today as we were setting some of this up.

532
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,680
Yeah, we've been testing things out.

533
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,760
So last night, I was working on some of this.

534
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,740
And I VPNed into the studio from home.

535
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,180
And of course, forgot to town that interface.

536
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,880
And then we're doing some troubleshooting.

537
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,560
And I'm realizing, I can't ping that host.

538
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,220
What's happening?

539
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,480
It's working on your machine.

540
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,840
And of course, I was routing through WireGuard

541
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,680
because it had just magically bounced back.

542
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,640
It reconnected.

543
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,040
And it just does that.

544
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,000
And that's one of the aspects that I really want

545
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,760
in this particular kind of setup.

546
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,280
The idea being that when I do have connectivity,

547
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,200
I can traverse both lands with ease,

548
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,960
as if there is a connection persistently through them.

549
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,460
Right.

550
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,960
I mean, you might be doing a show, let's say,

551
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,880
remotely from the rig.

552
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,440
And you want to come in and be able to mess with the mixer

553
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,040
like you're on the local network.

554
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,840
The other reason why I really want to do this

555
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,320
is I'm trying to not expose any public ports on my homeland.

556
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,160
So there's no inbound connections

557
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,120
other than an outbound WireGuard connection.

558
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,560
So I have an outbound WireGuard connection

559
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,760
on a Raspberry Pi in my RV that runs Raspbian.

560
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,600
And then on there is Docker, which is running PiHole.

561
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,880
So this is essentially my network services Pi.

562
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,840
And on there, I have a persistent WireGuard connection

563
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,720
back to the studio.

564
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,480
The neat thing about it is WireGuard

565
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,720
is pretty clever on how it routes traffic.

566
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,360
It's pretty intelligent about that.

567
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,560
Yeah, you have all kinds of options,

568
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,760
especially if you're using some of the nice like the WG

569
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,960
quick script that comes with the WireGuard tool set.

570
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
As long as you've given it the right information

571
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,040
about what IP ranges are in play,

572
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
it's going to run a lot of the right IP tables

573
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,720
commands for you.

574
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,600
So you don't have to worry so much about that.

575
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,640
Yeah, that is really nice.

576
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,440
I really appreciate that.

577
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,360
And with a little bit of extra clever DNS trickery,

578
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,200
we've got this thing working pretty well.

579
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,080
So let's talk about a couple of the things

580
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,880
we had to do to actually make this work.

581
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,600
So we have an outbound connection from my RV

582
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,800
coming into the studio.

583
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,520
From a box here in the studio, just any one of these computers,

584
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,720
I can now access the systems in my RV.

585
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,200
How did we make that possible?

586
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,280
We had to do a bit of routing trickery,

587
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,520
a little bit of DHCP trickery, and a little bit of DNS.

588
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,640
But at the end of the day, once you know what to do,

589
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,920
it's only about maybe a half hour's worth of work.

590
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,160
Yeah, so once we've got our WireGuard VPN network,

591
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,000
it's got its own IP space.

592
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,160
And then there's an IP space for the studio,

593
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,880
and there's a different IP space for your network at the RV.

594
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,760
So basically, we just had to make sure

595
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,120
that both sides knew about the other one.

596
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,520
So somewhere you need to add a route entry that says,

597
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,840
oh, if you want to get to space A,

598
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,800
here's the machine to do it, whether that's the Pi

599
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,800
or whatever gateway box we've got here.

600
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,880
For the most part, depending on how you set it up,

601
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,480
WireGuard will handle that, or you

602
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,440
may need to add a routing entry somewhere

603
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,320
if you don't have that pushed from your gateway.

604
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,600
So in your RV, we're using DNS mask on the Pi hole, which

605
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,520
is kind of great, and added a little bit of extra config

606
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,480
that basically tells anyone who's pulling a DHCP lease

607
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,080
that, oh, hey, there's this additional network,

608
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,200
and to get to it, well, use me as a gateway.

609
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
We didn't quite have that option here at the studio

610
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,920
for really some boring reasons.

611
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,120
So we've just added some manual routes for the moment

612
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
to machines that need access back to your RV,

613
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,960
and that works just the same.

614
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,600
Yeah.

615
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,240
And so every device at the RV knows how to route back here,

616
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,760
but only select systems in the studio

617
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,680
can route to the RV, which I kind of prefer anyways.

618
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:10,800
Yeah.

619
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,520
I mean, my laptop doesn't need access.

620
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,000
No.

621
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,520
And you know how to do it if for some reason

622
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,900
I needed your help with something,

623
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,120
so it's not like it's not a possibility.

624
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,960
And then we also used DNS mask to put some nice names to all

625
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,680
these different IP addresses.

626
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:25,920
Yeah.

627
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,720
I mean, since we were already using Pi hole,

628
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,920
and then took the opportunity to deploy another Pi hole here

629
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,840
at the studio, and it's using DNS mask under the hood,

630
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,920
it's just so easy to add that stuff, right?

631
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,720
So we just added an extra file where

632
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,240
we defined some new hosts entries

633
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,520
and statically add them for any of the ones we care about.

634
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,360
And that file, it just looks like a host file,

635
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,880
you just put the machine and the IP in there, and done.

636
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,080
It's really easy.

637
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,920
And now all the machines that get that from the DHCP server

638
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,520
can query that.

639
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,240
Now they can talk to each other by machine name.

640
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,960
And we have created, essentially,

641
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,800
a little two-way tunnel using WireGuard

642
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,900
that involves no inbound connections to my homeland.

643
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,400
Right.

644
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,160
It's nice that way, so that as long as you've

645
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,560
got internet connection, well, WireGuard's

646
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,400
just going to go build up a tether right here

647
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,680
to the studio.

648
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,840
And of course, what we may want to do down the line

649
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,600
is add a few other redundant connections.

650
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,160
We've got some VPSes out there in the cloud,

651
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,920
and we could add some there too, so that as long as your RV's

652
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,920
got connection and not all of our machines are down,

653
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,240
you're going to have a backdoor in.

654
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Westpane, you're always watching my backdoor.

655
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,160
Now we also decided to play around,

656
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,320
and really this is how this all got kicked off,

657
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,480
to tell you the truth, with a tool called Subspace.

658
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,440
Not only does it have a bad ass name,

659
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,360
but it is a very elegant, simple-to-use WireGuard VPN

660
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,040
server GUI.

661
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,320
Yes, friends, it's a graphical front end to WireGuard.

662
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,920
It's called Subspace, and it has a couple of catches.

663
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,680
It really wants to own the box it's on.

664
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,800
Yeah, so this is coming from portal.cloud.

665
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,600
It's open source.

666
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,040
It's MIT-licensed and mostly based in Go.

667
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,920
And if you're just running this as a machine,

668
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,020
you want to have some VPS that you're

669
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,600
going to connect a whole bunch of other devices

670
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,440
to when you want to sort of form a VPN that way, it is great.

671
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,360
Especially if you don't want to customize any of your configs,

672
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,080
Subspace works very well.

673
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,000
Yes, I'll also just add a little side note here.

674
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,160
When I was messing around with Subspace,

675
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,120
I noted that Lin Note has a community image that's

676
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,160
ready to go with WireGuard all pre-installed.

677
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,840
WireGuard is not hard to set up on pretty much all major

678
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,560
distros, because there's so many great guides.

679
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,660
But there are now some VPS images

680
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,360
that are one-click deployments with WireGuard ready to go.

681
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,460
And then you could just throw a Subspace on top of it,

682
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,160
and you're done.

683
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,960
Yeah, I mean, we were just running it from a container.

684
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,660
But since it's Go, I'm sure you could

685
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,760
find all manner of ways of running that.

686
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,220
Yeah, it's going to give you a UI to manage devices,

687
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,520
to manage keys.

688
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,900
And while we didn't test this aspect of it very much,

689
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,320
because we didn't require this, it

690
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,600
may also do some easy name resolution for devices

691
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,880
that are on the VPN IP space.

692
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,400
Yeah, it turns out it's also running DNS mask,

693
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,160
and then adding host entries for as you add them,

694
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,600
configuring them, and giving access to your VPN.

695
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
And that's really where Subspace shines.

696
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,000
The kind of trickiest part about WireGuard often

697
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,360
is managing all the keys that you have to keep track of,

698
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,680
especially once you've got, say, five, six, 10, 20 machines.

699
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,080
With Subspace, you've got them all there as a list.

700
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,800
And you, as the administrator, can go download those configs,

701
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,080
modify them, mess with them if you need to.

702
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,480
Now, unfortunately, you're going to have to do that manually.

703
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,720
And this is where some of the limitations of Subspace

704
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,960
comes in.

705
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,080
It seems to me like a project ripe for some community

706
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,720
involvement, because right now, it hasn't been updated

707
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,960
in a couple months, and sort of seems like it's probably just

708
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,380
tossed over as an open source contribution, which is great.

709
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,120
I don't mean that as a bad thing.

710
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,480
It just means it doesn't have a lot of customization built in.

711
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,040
Yeah, it's made by a VPS provider

712
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,640
to just create something that's easy for their customers

713
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,400
to use.

714
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,880
And I think it is very much sort of like,

715
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,440
here's the open source version of it.

716
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,880
However, it's so fantastic, a little bit of love,

717
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,040
and it could be perfect.

718
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,000
In our testing, I can't remember how long.

719
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,880
I want to say 10 seconds is how long

720
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,360
it took me to get a WireGuard VPN created and connected

721
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,880
on an iPhone.

722
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,860
Yeah, I just sent you the URL and the password,

723
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,760
and you were in.

724
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,240
It's so good, because Subspace will create a QR code that

725
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,480
contains all the config info you need for the WireGuard

726
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,800
VPN on the client.

727
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,200
So as fast as my phone could read the QR code,

728
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,800
my VPN configuration was set up.

729
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,880
I tap in my iPhone pin code once to add it to the network stack.

730
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,280
And at the network level, I can now WireGuard VPN

731
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,080
from my frickin' iPhone.

732
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,720
That's what's so great about WireGuard.

733
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,760
I mean, one of the many things that's so great, really,

734
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,260
is that the mobile clients have really come a long way.

735
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,880
Even on iOS, what feels like it should

736
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,480
be a pretty foreign platform to WireGuard,

737
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,520
those apps are rock solid.

738
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,280
So Subspace is killer when you're just

739
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,600
trying to create something that's really easy for end

740
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
users to consume as well.

741
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,120
Family members that you want to give remote VPN access

742
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,880
to your LAN, maybe you have, like for me,

743
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,520
my notes now are on my LAN.

744
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
They're offline, and I use WireGuard.

745
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,800
Just I leave that persistently connected when I'm not home,

746
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,440
and I just access everything as if I were there.

747
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,240
And so it's such a great tool.

748
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,640
Cheesy, I think you happen to be playing with WireGuard

749
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,760
over the weekend, too.

750
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,000
Yeah, so my use case is a little different.

751
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I wasn't necessarily trying to connect to LANs.

752
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,340
I just wanted something that whenever I was traveling,

753
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,600
I could easily connect through a VPN

754
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,980
and kind of tunnel my traffic through and stuff.

755
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,240
And I connected to a private VPN provider.

756
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,240
In my case, I'm trying out VPN AC.

757
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,000
There are a ton of different ones out there,

758
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,660
though I will say that it seems to be the least supported

759
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,040
option WireGuard does compared to OpenVPN.

760
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,320
So you might end up paying a little bit more for it.

761
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,220
But I found that it was less expensive for me

762
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:56,060
to buy a yearly subscription than what it would cost me

763
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,280
to run the cheapest Linode.

764
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,140
Yeah, it is kind of expensive if you're only

765
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,400
using a VPS for WireGuard.

766
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,620
You could do something like this and get just a hosted service.

767
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,080
Were you worried, though, about privacy or security

768
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,760
implications of connecting to a third party VPN versus one

769
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,800
that you have a little more direct control over?

770
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,680
Well, absolutely.

771
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,040
I mean, that's always a concern.

772
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,000
But I felt that given the use case,

773
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,640
I think it's going to work fine for me.

774
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,480
I'm not overly paranoid about it.

775
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,640
You're more thinking like in the hotel scenario

776
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,360
and you want to protect your traffic

777
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,440
and you're not so worried about the other end.

778
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,480
Exactly.

779
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,880
I wouldn't necessarily be opposed

780
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,020
to using a hosted WireGuard service provider.

781
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,720
I think I heard NordVPN does it.

782
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,800
Yeah, more and more are.

783
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,920
Actually, I had an existing account

784
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,800
with one of the providers.

785
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,160
And I saw the other day, they have WireGuard support.

786
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,520
Let's go around the horn in the mumble room.

787
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,080
Does anybody in the mumble room want

788
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,560
to volunteer a rough overview of how they do a VPN solution

789
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
if they have one?

790
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,640
I'm sure not everybody does.

791
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,040
But someone there must be using a VPN for something.

792
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,720
Well, in fact, I have one.

793
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,520
I have a little dacha, so I mean a little apartment

794
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,440
in the Alps, in the stress Alps.

795
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,160
So I have direct access to this router.

796
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,080
But it's using internal router software.

797
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
It's a Fritz box.

798
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,960
I don't know if you know these in the United States.

799
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,920
But they have good VPN solutions.

800
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,440
Cool.

801
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,160
So you can directly access this router.

802
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,720
And from then, you can access whatever you want.

803
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,360
You know, I wouldn't be surprised if, for a lot of people,

804
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,100
the answer is don't use a VPN, but just use SSH.

805
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,640
Because you'd be surprised what you

806
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,760
can get away with with port 40 and whatnot with just SSH.

807
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,640
What about you, Wimpy?

808
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,880
Do you have any remote login solutions?

809
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,960
I mean, you travel a lot these days.

810
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,340
You must, every now and then, wish

811
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,640
you could get back to your LAN.

812
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,560
Yes, I do have VPN running.

813
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,320
I've got VPN running on a Raspberry Pi that

814
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,000
is NATed through my router when I need

815
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,080
to get to my home network.

816
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,920
Very nice.

817
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,120
So you're using the Pi.

818
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,120
And do you find it to be sufficiently fast enough,

819
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,520
even with the network limitations and whatnot

820
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,200
of the Pis?

821
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,760
Yeah, once the key negotiation is out of the way,

822
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,360
it's perfectly fast enough.

823
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,240
Because I'm usually just wanting to SSH in.

824
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,360
I'm not wanting to stream video or anything like that.

825
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,120
Sure, right.

826
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,760
Yeah, yeah.

827
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Yeah, fair enough.

828
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,640
What about you, Carl?

829
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,100
Do you have any remote access solutions

830
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,960
when you're on the go?

831
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,600
Yes, sir.

832
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,880
I'll use SSH tunnels pretty regularly.

833
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,560
I just got used to it for my day job.

834
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,280
And it's just my go-to now.

835
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,600
Yeah, I think that's probably, if somebody wanted a hot take,

836
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,440
I'd say don't use a VPN.

837
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,560
Use an SSH tunnel.

838
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,980
You know, one nice thing about doing it,

839
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,640
the way you're doing it now too, is sort of the dynamic DNS

840
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,280
stuff, well, it doesn't really matter as much,

841
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,900
because you're not going that direction.

842
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,400
Right.

843
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,280
The connections, they all start from the RV,

844
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,280
which is great, because that's where the connectivity is

845
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,440
going to be the most hit and miss.

846
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,440
There could be days where there's no connectivity.

847
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,840
It's funny, as we were sort of testing this out,

848
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,900
both on the RV and here at the studio,

849
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,000
setting up those SSH tunnels just as back doors

850
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,800
in case we messed something up, that was handy more than once.

851
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,440
Yeah, yeah.

852
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,480
One time, we couldn't get into the WireGuard server.

853
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,960
So it was nice to get into another machine on the LAN.

854
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,800
And then until the WireGuard tunnel was up from the RV,

855
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,640
we had really no way into the RV other than an SSH tunnel.

856
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,640
So I just was able to connect out, in that case,

857
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,240
to a machine that we share.

858
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,320
And then we came back in over that machine.

859
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,180
But there are a lot of different ways

860
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,560
you can pull these tricks off.

861
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Even if you, like me, suffer the plague of double NAT,

862
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,600
there is a solution out there for you.

863
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,400
And a WireGuard may be it.

864
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,660
An SSH tunnel may be it.

865
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,080
And the other options out there, like OpenVPN and others,

866
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,000
are still perfectly viable.

867
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,760
Wes and I just, we think you're going

868
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,680
to be hearing a lot more about WireGuard

869
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,800
over the remainder of this year and early next year.

870
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,500
I think it's going to be a pretty big story as it gets

871
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,720
merged into the Linux kernel.

872
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,320
Yeah, there's already so much support, right?

873
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,880
I mean, we were able to get it working on a Raspberry Pi.

874
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,360
It took a little bit of doing here and there.

875
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,580
But we got it to work.

876
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,620
There's already devices out there

877
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,960
that have WireGuard support, routers that you can find.

878
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,780
So there's all kinds of gadgets.

879
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,820
And once it's mainline, I'm sure there'll be more.

880
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,320
We had a really brief but great opportunity

881
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
to just have a quick email exchange

882
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,200
with the developer of WireGuard as we

883
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,640
were doing some of the preparation for this project.

884
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,400
And it's hard to read much into just a quick couple of emails.

885
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,080
But Jason seemed really, really accommodating

886
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,800
to our questions, really clear spoken, and really engaged.

887
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,360
Like, he was right on answering the stuff.

888
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,120
He gave us really clear, concise answers to our questions.

889
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,880
And I just sat there for a moment

890
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,560
thinking, how awesome is this?

891
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,840
At the end of it, I said, thank you for WireGuard.

892
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,200
Just thank you, because it's such a great project.

893
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,640
And then to also have him answer our questions,

894
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,400
we're just a couple of yokel podcasters.

895
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,320
Yeah, he's very active, giving presentations.

896
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,940
And if you're more curious, too, there's

897
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,240
a WireGuard mailing list that you can follow.

898
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,440
Stay tuned for updates.

899
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,120
Yeah, there will be updates coming.

900
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,560
He said to us that there'll be some more significant

901
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,840
developments over the next week or two,

902
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,340
and to keep an eye out for that.

903
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh, boy.

904
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,080
Yeah, I think you will be hearing a lot more about it.

905
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,860
And I am elated with the setup now.

906
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,700
It's so slick to be sitting on either LAN

907
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,440
and be able to get access to everything on either side

908
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,480
from any machine.

909
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,900
And I think it's kind of just enough.

910
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,520
WireGuard integrates so nicely with the rest of Linux.

911
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,940
It plays nicely with IP tables, and the IP route to package,

912
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,200
and all the modern Linux networking stuff.

913
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,160
Plus, since you don't have some demon running somewhere,

914
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,840
if you're not touching it all the time,

915
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,200
it's just simpler to administer.

916
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,540
And I think that's something that will give it staying power.

917
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,040
So I'm glad you said that, because I

918
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,840
think that maybe was the unspoken piece that we haven't

919
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,080
really made clear, is what makes it so great

920
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,560
is it's just enough VPN.

921
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,440
And then it works with all of the other things on Linux

922
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,960
that you're used to working with.

923
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,320
So even an old blockhead sysadmin like me

924
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,800
is able to work with something relatively brand new,

925
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,180
because I understand default routes, DNS, IP tables.

926
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,280
I get that stuff, and all of that is applicable here.

927
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,200
That's so great.

928
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,280
And that, you're right.

929
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,160
It's just enough VPN.

930
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,800
And it's that perfect Unix philosophy,

931
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,680
where it's the right tool for the right job,

932
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
and it doesn't do too much more than that.

933
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,000
And we love it.

934
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,320
Anyways, enough fawning, I suppose,

935
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,840
because we have an app pic this week

936
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,280
that Wes Payne built just for us.

937
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,120
He set up a container even for it.

938
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,280
It is truly something that the internet's been demanding.

939
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,800
Spotify on the command line.

940
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,780
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, you

941
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:46,120
can have a Spotify UI written in Rust on your command line.

942
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,640
Oh my, let's just come on now.

943
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,520
I know, you've been laying awake at night thinking to yourself,

944
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,360
life is great, except I can't run

945
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,000
Spotify on the command line.

946
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,480
So why did you have to create a entire build environment?

947
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,160
Well, right now the release binaries

948
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,360
they've got over on GitHub are only supported on Mac OS.

949
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,960
And since this is Linux unplugged,

950
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,240
that wasn't going to fly.

951
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,160
I know you're shocked to hear this,

952
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,900
but on the current setup on this laptop,

953
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,840
I didn't have the Rust build chain already installed.

954
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,560
So what do I do but pull down a container?

955
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,760
So there's a Rust build environment container?

956
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,240
Yeah, of course, an official one even.

957
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,880
I love it.

958
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,400
So then you just use Cargo, the excellent build tool,

959
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,360
install the package.

960
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,120
And again, since it's Rust, I just

961
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,000
copied the built binary out of the container

962
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,920
onto my local system.

963
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,240
Yeah, once it's built, you're done.

964
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,120
Good to go.

965
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,880
Why don't they just do that then?

966
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,380
Well, if you're developing on a Mac,

967
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,000
you have to set up a Linux build server.

968
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,240
And it's a little bit more work.

969
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,920
What they had to do is they could download this container.

970
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,400
Oh, that's a great idea.

971
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,840
Now one little catch here, it has a great little introduction

972
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,120
to help you go through the create an app,

973
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,120
and you have to get the token and the secret

974
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,440
so you can off do it.

975
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,920
And apparently, somehow I actually

976
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,480
signed into your account.

977
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,200
That's amazing.

978
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,280
Yeah.

979
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,040
I'm also not clear in that I'm just trying this now,

980
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,720
it seems like it's actually used to control another device.

981
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,280
So when I loaded it up, it gave me like.

982
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,120
You were controlling the soundboard machine.

983
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,200
Yeah, the soundboard machine, or I can control it

984
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,800
running on an Echo, say.

985
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,320
Yeah, that's Spotify Connect right there, yeah.

986
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,460
So I don't know how that happens since that's

987
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,480
on your own machine, but it's great.

988
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,240
And yeah, so the thing is, we were thinking,

989
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,840
wouldn't it be fun just to have, again, some sort of device,

990
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,920
like a Raspberry Pi or something that's just sitting around

991
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,000
with this always going, and then you just

992
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,720
could turn on the speakers when you want to listen or not.

993
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,480
And I love a nice terminal user interface like this.

994
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,960
It feels so clean, I don't have to mess with anything else,

995
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,840
and it's right there in a terminal,

996
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,440
which I always have open.

997
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,520
Can I admit something?

998
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,920
Yeah, oh, please do.

999
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,520
To me, that terminal UI, this end curses style layout,

1000
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,120
is easier for my brain to process and understand

1001
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,600
than the actual Spotify UI.

1002
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,720
That is clean and simple and well delineated.

1003
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,120
I can understand all of that just

1004
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,320
by glancing at the screen.

1005
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,360
You know what's also great?

1006
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,520
You can use the arrow keys, or it's got VI style movements,

1007
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,160
too, right?

1008
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,560
It's fantastic.

1009
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,960
OK, all right, there you go.

1010
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,120
There you go.

1011
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,320
I'm glad you got that in there.

1012
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,480
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes,

1013
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,680
linuxunplugged.com slash 322 if you want to build it,

1014
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,360
if you have a Rust build environment and want to build it.

1015
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,320
I want to make it clear, it's not ready to go out of the box,

1016
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,040
unless you're on a freaking Mac, and then

1017
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,680
apparently it's just a brew away.

1018
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,360
What kind of, I'll tell you what.

1019
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,480
Next week on macOS Unplugged.

1020
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,280
All right, well, we're going to wrap up here,

1021
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,080
so Mr. Payne and I can go pack.

1022
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,020
If you're going to be in the San Antonio area,

1023
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,080
do come say hi to us.

1024
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,400
Otherwise, we're back next week.

1025
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,520
We're just down there for the weekend,

1026
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,040
so it doesn't really impact the show production at all,

1027
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,840
other than Wes won't be doing headlines.

1028
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,440
No, we've got some fill-in, so.

1029
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,560
And I'm not doing headlines.

1030
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,080
No.

1031
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,240
Neither one of us are doing headlines for the rest of the week.

1032
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,840
We're done for the week, woo-hoo.

1033
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,000
If you haven't checked out the new daily podcast,

1034
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,840
linuxheadlines.show, it is a breakdown of the day's news

1035
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,360
events at Linux and open source in under three minutes.

1036
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,360
Yeah, if you don't want to go troll hacker news

1037
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,720
and find out all the things that are happening in the world,

1038
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,600
we'll do it for you.

1039
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,080
There is a really fair amount of research analysis

1040
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,000
that goes into that.

1041
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,600
We have a team member, and that is their job.

1042
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,120
Yeah, we're tracking trends, making

1043
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,880
sure we follow up on things.

1044
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,720
It's not one of our on-air people.

1045
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,080
It's just somebody who's dedicated to that task

1046
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,880
and puts a lot of work and research into the headline show.

1047
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,160
Our staff in the newsroom.

1048
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,560
That's right, we have a newsroom now.

1049
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,000
All right, so we do this show live like next week over jblive.tv.

1050
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
We do it on a Tuesday.

1051
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,200
We'd love to have you here.

1052
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,120
Oh, please join us.

1053
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,120
Yeah, we've got the virtual lug you can hang out in.

1054
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,080
We've got the chat room, or you can just sit back and watch.

1055
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,360
But there's a lot more show.

1056
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,520
There's probably about an hour or more

1057
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,320
show if you join us live at the beginning and at the end.

1058
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,160
jblive.tv, Tuesday, 2 PM Pacific.

1059
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,080
Or get it converted at jubilabroadcast.com.

1060
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,960
Or you want audio only, jblive.stream.

1061
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,880
That's right.

1062
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,400
Got to mention, too, that's also a really nice low latency

1063
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,480
way to listen, jblive.stream.

1064
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,040
Go check out West, techsnap.systems.

1065
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,800
I'm at Chris Elias, the network at Jupiter Signal.

1066
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Go find the Ubuntu podcast, too, ubuntupodcast.org.

1067
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,880
Yeah, do that.

1068
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,200
And go get Mr. Cheesy at Cheese Bacon.

1069
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,040
That's right.

1070
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,960
All right, everybody.

1071
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,640
See you next Tuesday.

1072
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:52,200
Thanks for watching.

1073
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Minimac, you were pointing out that Spotify app looks a lot like another famous command

1074
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
line music app.

1075
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,840
Well, it was Cheese Bacon that pointed that out, but I'm using Seamus.

1076
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,840
Oh yeah, okay.

1077
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:16,480
It is much easier for my muscle memory to look for songs because just slash and then

1078
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,280
you do some letters and then you get the songs you want.

1079
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
That's so nice.

1080
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
It's so easy.

1081
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,020
It is so easy and it's so fast, you know?

1082
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,800
Have we mentioned Seamus before on the show?

1083
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
I don't know that we have.

1084
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,300
I guess you did.

1085
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,040
I'm going to put a bonus link in.

1086
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:37,600
You know, you even have GTK3 integration when it comes to notification and everything.

1087
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:44,160
You can just launch Seamus in a terminal and then you get notifications for song change

1088
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
and everything.

1089
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
I'm putting a link to that in the show notes.

1090
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
That looks great.

1091
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,840
By the way, I have a question about that Spotify tree.

1092
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,640
Do you have to be registered for that or can you just use it later?

1093
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,640
And do you have all the ads still or you got to have a token, so you have to have an account.

1094
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,200
Yeah, I had to go create like a new client.

1095
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Yeah.

1096
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Yeah.

1097
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,040
And I think the ads are added in line to the audio stream itself.

1098
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Oh, okay.

1099
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,040
I see.

1100
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
Mm hmm.

1101
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Mm hmm.

1102
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,040
That's how they get you.

1103
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,560
Seamus is definitely an app pick.

1104
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,320
You have to look if you just have on because Seamus is really great.

1105
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:25,080
I didn't mention this in the show, but I've kind of in the last three weeks, four weeks

1106
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,800
kind of started reevaluating how I'm doing my music and I think I'm going to do more

1107
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
local music.

1108
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
What?

1109
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
More all or do it.

1110
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,680
I'm going to try to just do all flack local music.

1111
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,680
All flack even?

1112
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,600
If I'm going to go local, right?

1113
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,960
I've got a couple of different areas where I can, I have speakers where I can really

1114
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,960
tell the difference.

1115
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,400
And I'm like, well, if I've got two areas that I spend a fair, one of them is my car

1116
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,440
and I spend a lot of time in my car, I can really hear the difference in the car speaker

1117
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,440
system.

1118
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
So why not?

1119
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Why not?

1120
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
Right.

1121
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
And I'm just going to, I'm not going to rush.

1122
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440
I'm just going to take my time.

1123
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm going to listen to music, not waste a bunch of disk space.

1124
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,160
Cause really there's like a, you know, you have a hybrid approach.

1125
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,200
You have a streaming plan account and you have access to all this cloud music.

1126
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,600
So you just start collecting the things that really matter to you.

1127
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,440
I blame Alex.

1128
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,360
You know, all this self hosted stuff.

1129
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,840
He's really got me going there.

1130
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,300
And now I'm loving it in the RV cause I can, I can take all this stuff with me offline

1131
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,300
wherever I go.

1132
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,480
You're no longer hooked on the cloud.

1133
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,200
I am so jazzed about self hosting right now.

1134
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,480
This perfect time to launch a self hosted show.

1135
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Tell you what.

1136
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,360
On speakers, have you guys noticed that the, uh, uh, Alexa devices favorite distribution

1137
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,120
is we want to, do you guys see that this week?

1138
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
Yeah.

1139
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,120
What was that?

1140
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
I saw the headline go by, but what does that mean?

1141
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,720
Well, just ask Alexa what his favorite operating system is.

1142
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,720
All right.

1143
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,720
Hold on.

1144
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,720
We, okay.

1145
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,720
You keep getting a trigger.

1146
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,720
You keep saying, you want me to do it?

1147
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
I'll do it right now.

1148
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,720
Do it right now.

1149
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,720
Alexa, what's your favorite operating system?

1150
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,720
I'm glad you asked.

1151
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,720
It's all about windows.

1152
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,720
What?

1153
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
What?

1154
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,280
She said it's all about windows, dude.

1155
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,160
I just asked her and she said it's all about windows.

1156
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,160
How dare she?

1157
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,160
Did they change it already?

1158
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,560
Did they already change it?

1159
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
That's too funny.

1160
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,560
I'll screw again.

1161
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,560
All right.

1162
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
Okay.

1163
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
I'm going to ask her again.

1164
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,560
You ready?

1165
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,040
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm sorry for everybody at home if I'm triggering your,

1166
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,400
uh, your echo devices here, Alexa, what's your favorite operating system?

1167
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
Definitely windows.

1168
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Oh man.

1169
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,400
She's picking up all the windows.

1170
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
You're running on your network there.

1171
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
That's what's going on.

1172
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,040
You know, what's interesting is she shortened the answer to it was a tighter answer this

1173
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,040
time.

1174
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,840
I don't want to answer this again.

1175
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,840
Holy crap.

1176
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,120
What's going on there, Alexa?

1177
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,960
What's your favorite operating system?

1178
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,320
Definitely Ubuntu.

1179
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,320
What the hell?

1180
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,320
Interesting.

1181
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,720
That'll be on account of all the Ubuntu I'm running on my network and all the windows

1182
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,000
you're running on yours.

1183
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,400
There's probably never been a windows box on this network in the lifetime of that echo

1184
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,400
device.

1185
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
No, no.

1186
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
It's reactOS.

1187
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
It's just getting confused.

1188
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,400
It's the country.

1189
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,200
It's the country you live in.

1190
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,760
You're in the windows country.

1191
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,960
Oh, it's cause we're in Washington and it knows.

1192
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,960
That's what I thought.

1193
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
Yeah.

1194
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
We're in Redmond town.

1195
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,680
I don't know if all those previous tweets were UK based.

1196
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,280
Do we have any Cupertino based friends here to check in?

1197
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,280
Yeah.

1198
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,080
Has anybody else got a lady tube near them that isn't in Washington that could ask?

1199
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,320
Because somebody in the chat room asked you something.

1200
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,720
Because what's not only weird about it to me, it's weird that she changes the answer.

1201
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,040
That's something I've noticed they're doing more and more is she'll give you a long answer

1202
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,040
and then she'll give you a short answer.

1203
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,840
And then somehow if she thinks you're not very busy, she'll be like, by the way, sometimes

1204
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,360
she does it at the wrong time.

1205
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,040
By the way, did you know that and then she'll tell you about something else that they can

1206
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,520
do now that they've added?

1207
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,520
Yeah.

1208
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,520
It's very clever.

1209
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,520
It's very clever.

1210
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:35,280
I noticed that our family was barking orders at the echo and I felt a bit bad about that

1211
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,080
because it felt rude.

1212
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:45,660
So I started being polite and occasionally it acknowledges your politeness, which is

1213
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,240
also a little bit creepy, but quite clever.

1214
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
Like a little.

1215
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,240
You're welcome.

1216
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Yeah.

1217
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
Oh, it's no problem.

1218
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Isn't that something?

1219
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
It's kind of nice.

1220
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,480
I mean, I suppose it's all trying to increase engagement and the more human it feels, the

1221
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,520
easier it is to talk to and the more you'll talk to it.

1222
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,520
Ding.

1223
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,520
Yep.

1224
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,520
Absolutely.

1225
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,520
They're aggressive.

1226
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,480
The echo team is aggressive with these features.

1227
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,400
Google is a little bit slower and Apple is glacial.

1228
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:16,840
I am flabbergasted that the other lady tubes haven't ripped off whisper mode.

1229
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,040
If you have an echo, you've got to turn on whisper mode.

1230
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,920
It's the best thing for night times because if you whisper to it, she automatically recognizes

1231
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,160
that you're whispering and whispers the responses back to you.

1232
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,160
That's so smart.

1233
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,160
Super clever.

1234
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,040
And there's a lot of little things like that.

1235
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,960
Like now they have celebrity voices like Samuel Jackson and they have like you can play with

1236
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,960
Jimmy Fallon.

1237
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,640
I assume there's a Chris Fisher voice in the works.

1238
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,920
Nobody is making a wiretap device more appealing than Amazon these days.

1239
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,040
I tell you what.

1240
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,040
And it can order you packages.

1241
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,040
Oh yeah, that too.

1242
00:46:49,040 --> 00:47:09,120
Oh man, I wish my craft would have been a thing.
