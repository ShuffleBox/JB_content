00:00.000 --> 00:04.500
Did you know that researchers are now putting fish into augmented reality tanks?

00:04.500 --> 00:06.800
That's right, AR for fish.

00:06.800 --> 00:07.400
I love it.

00:07.400 --> 00:11.000
You're telling me I can get a fish tank that's not real or the fish tank's real but the fish aren't.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.700
What part's the AR part?

00:12.700 --> 00:15.000
Well, so they've attached AR to the fish.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.300
They're trying to use it to study how the fish think they can hide.

00:17.300 --> 00:23.400
So they're like recording what the fish sees and playing it back and tweaking it to see how the fish responds to different visual input.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.700
This is what we're spending our time on?

00:26.700 --> 00:31.400
This is Linux Unplugged episode 282 for January 2nd, 2019.

00:31.400 --> 00:47.200
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's talking about fish this week.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.100
My name is Chris.

00:48.100 --> 00:48.900
My name is Wes.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.900
And not the shell, not the shell, not yet at least, although they did have a new release.

00:51.900 --> 00:52.600
Sometime soon.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.900
Yeah, sometime soon we're going to have somebody on from the project and talk about the awesome fish shell.

00:55.900 --> 01:00.300
But this, this episode, we're doing what I like to call a little hope casting.

01:00.300 --> 01:09.500
If you had a magic wand bestowed upon you by the Linux Unplugged program and you could affect any change in the open source world in 2019, what would it be?

01:09.500 --> 01:16.000
And to warm us up, we're going to look back at some of the major trends that really stood out from us throughout 2018 and talk about those things.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.800
The things that bent the open source world a little bit and changed the direction of things.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.200
The things that really kind of stick out now that we're on the other end of it.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.200
And then that will inform our 2019 hope casting.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.500
What do you think, Wes? That sound like fun to you?

01:28.500 --> 01:32.200
That's a winning recipe.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.600
Okay. Do you have a good holiday?

01:33.600 --> 01:35.100
Oh, I had a wonderful holiday.

01:35.100 --> 01:38.600
But we're back here at work because there's just so much awesome Linux news to talk about.

01:38.600 --> 01:39.800
That's true. We couldn't, we couldn't be away.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.700
Yeah, and I'm excited to hope cast, right?

01:41.700 --> 01:45.300
There's a lot of good things that could happen and there's no ref on this episode.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.900
We can say whatever we like.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.100
This one's free wheeling.

01:48.100 --> 01:51.200
Although we'll probably still hear from that ref if we get it wrong.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.300
You know how that works.

01:52.300 --> 01:56.000
All right, before we go any closer, let's bring in that virtual lug.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.300
Time, appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:58.300 --> 01:59.500
Hello. Good morning.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.400
Hello. Good morning. Good afternoon.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.100
And like I always say, time approves.

02:03.100 --> 02:06.000
That's just easier. The general catch-all.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.800
You know, I did say we're going to, we'll be doing our hope castings.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.400
But I did have a little community news.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.100
Originally, when we were planning this episode, I thought, oh, there's not going to be any news with the holidays.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.100
Everyone's taking breaks.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.500
Everybody's off. There's no open source getting made.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.700
Turns out there's news.

02:21.700 --> 02:22.700
Turns out there's news.

02:22.700 --> 02:31.200
And the first news may actually, may be really good for me and my predictions that I made just last week.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.400
You are getting lucky already.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.700
I am actually doing quite well.

02:35.700 --> 02:42.900
The first one was my Clear Linux prediction, which apparently, apparently the good folks over at Intel agreed with me.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.100
And we have a pretty big update from Clear Linux this week.

02:46.100 --> 02:54.400
The first is this, this sort of call-to-action blog post co-authored by Aiki and I'm going to say Oak.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.300
I think you're right.

02:55.300 --> 03:03.200
And they talk about the challenges they're trying to solve with their special get out of the way desktop version of Clear Linux.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.600
That's ready for remote desktop, ready for performance.

03:06.600 --> 03:15.200
Everything you need, just a single command away, optimized around a special built XFCE desktop.

03:15.200 --> 03:18.400
Oh yeah, trim down, lean and mean.

03:18.400 --> 03:26.700
With same defaults as they say, their philosophy is stateless and that is enshrined in their operating system.

03:26.700 --> 03:34.900
They've also extended this to the visuals of the desktop using the beautiful Arc GTK theme with elementary XFCE icons

03:34.900 --> 03:42.800
and made it ready for remote rendering to make sure that things like special gradients wouldn't be there to slow down the remote performance

03:42.800 --> 03:46.700
and that OpenGL applications would work awesome.

03:46.700 --> 03:52.700
This is a big push by Intel for Clear Linux to be a player on the desktop.

03:52.700 --> 03:56.100
I don't know if it's going to be successful, but I like this angle.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.300
I like the XFCE base for the desktop.

03:58.300 --> 04:04.600
I like that they're focusing on running it in remote desktops, remote virtual desktops you might say, which was another prediction of mine.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.900
Yeah, I can see it too.

04:05.900 --> 04:12.300
I thought some of their verbiage around you're a grumpy old sys admin who just knows what a desktop should be

04:12.300 --> 04:16.600
and doesn't need a newfangled thing on your server under the familiarity header.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.400
That doesn't play well with me, but I can see it.

04:19.400 --> 04:25.900
A simple thing that does work well in a virtualized environment if you're already using an operating system that basically targets that.

04:25.900 --> 04:34.000
Yeah, sometimes, especially if you're coming from the Windows world or you just want a GUI because using something to edit the partitions is just easier that way.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.800
What do you think, Popeye, of Intel's play here to base their Linux desktop around XFCE?

04:40.800 --> 04:41.500
Clever?

04:41.500 --> 04:44.300
I think it makes sense because you need something, especially for remote desktop.

04:44.300 --> 04:55.900
You need something that's not got too many effects baked in and it's not too GPU heavy so that you can scale it up and have tons of these running on one machine if needed,

04:55.900 --> 05:01.200
or you just want to have a super fast lightweight protocol between you and the remote machine, I guess.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.500
Yeah, I agree.

05:02.500 --> 05:08.700
I think it's cunning in a way that most people might go for flashy and name grabby,

05:08.700 --> 05:13.700
and they went for tried true and honestly one of the better desktops for a remote session.

05:13.700 --> 05:19.500
I'm really curious to see where Intel goes with this, and maybe it's me,

05:19.500 --> 05:25.200
but I feel like I read kind of Aiki's language in this blog post a little bit.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.700
I'll give you one of the lines that stands out as sort of an Aiki line to me.

05:29.700 --> 05:35.400
When it comes specifically to targeting the developer or administrators, we see an entirely different set of challenges.

05:35.400 --> 05:41.200
Many of us would like to simplify remote access from the desktop to our deployed machines to facilitate that efficient workflow.

05:41.200 --> 05:46.900
As such, we took certain points into consideration when building the developer desktop experience.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.100
Reminds me a lot of how he talked about projects in Solus.

05:49.100 --> 05:53.000
Right, there's this idea of, well, of course, it should be done this way and just like do it right.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.400
You don't have to do everything.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.100
Right.

05:55.100 --> 05:55.900
And those are principles.

05:55.900 --> 05:56.900
I mean, in general, I think.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.900
Yeah, he's usually right.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.400
That was the thing about Aiki.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.500
Yeah, that's fascinating.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.400
And it was co-authored by him in this post.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.500
So we'll be hearing a lot more, I think, from ClearLinux.

06:07.500 --> 06:11.400
It'll be interesting to see how that evolves and actually how many people in the community pick it up.

06:11.400 --> 06:11.800
Yeah.

06:11.800 --> 06:16.500
And of course, the other big thing around ClearLinux is the gaming project.

06:16.500 --> 06:22.500
The Steam project that Aiki had been working on, that he talked on the show about before, is being moved over to ClearLinux, it appears.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.000
Did you see this?

06:23.000 --> 06:23.800
No, I did not.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.400
Yeah.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.300
Yeah, that whole Steam compatibility thing that he was working on.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.900
Popey, did you see this, that this is now a ClearLinux project?

06:28.900 --> 06:34.300
Yeah, I saw it as a fork of it now under Aiki's new GitHub account.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.800
Yeah.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.300
Yeah.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.300
Isn't that interesting?

06:38.300 --> 06:39.000
I wonder how Solus...

06:39.000 --> 06:42.400
I think I know how Solus feels about that, actually.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.500
But yeah, I think I'll be watching this one, hoping that my predictions come true.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.400
I mean, that's really all I...

06:47.400 --> 06:48.000
That's the reason I...

06:48.000 --> 06:49.600
Good luck to you.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.100
I'm kind of tempted to try it, too.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.700
If I can install Snaps.

06:53.700 --> 06:54.900
Seriously.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.300
Are Snaps available for ClearLinux?

06:56.300 --> 06:57.200
Because...

06:57.200 --> 06:58.800
Nope.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.700
That makes it a lot harder to do the...

07:00.700 --> 07:05.300
You know, some of those applications that I use for my job, they're in Snaps.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.300
Why would you want that on your professional workstation, Chris?

07:07.300 --> 07:09.000
I don't get that.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.700
Somebody ought to get on that.

07:11.700 --> 07:12.200
All right.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.900
Well, I know something else somebody ought to get on.

07:14.900 --> 07:19.500
We got to get collective, and we got to make some collective action on this next story.

07:19.500 --> 07:26.900
You're not going to believe this, but a port of the Riser 4 file system for Linux 4.20 is in the works.

07:26.900 --> 07:31.400
His wife might be dead, but the file system in his name continues on.

07:31.400 --> 07:35.200
There hasn't been a formal Riser 4 file system patch released since September,

07:35.200 --> 07:37.500
when it was ported to the 4.18 kernel.

07:37.500 --> 07:41.700
But via Git this week, there was a port for Linux 4.20 kernel,

07:41.700 --> 07:47.000
should you want to utilize this once promising Riser file system.

07:47.000 --> 07:47.600
Yeah, that's right.

07:47.600 --> 07:52.600
Okay, so Edward Shishkin, he's the last main developer.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.100
He's got his own kernel tree, and it's not actually released yet,

07:56.100 --> 07:59.700
but there is a new branch with fixes, and they're not very many, honestly.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.900
There hasn't been that many changes on the Riser side,

08:01.900 --> 08:04.700
so there's not a lot of changes that you actually need here.

08:04.700 --> 08:05.600
Yeah.

08:05.600 --> 08:12.900
There's also a new branch for some upcoming feature work, volume-related fixes, balancing work, a new key allocation scheme.

08:12.900 --> 08:18.100
So if you're a user, okay, maybe there's some good stuff happening, but why are you a user?

08:18.100 --> 08:19.700
Legacy data, maybe?

08:19.700 --> 08:23.700
But even then, like, get a new RAID setup and copy it over.

08:23.700 --> 08:24.800
I don't know, really.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.500
We have XFS, you'll be fine.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.400
You know, that's sort of been the situation for years, though.

08:29.400 --> 08:33.300
Like, some people are still using it, but you think about it.

08:33.300 --> 08:37.100
We haven't seen Riser 4 mainlined in the Linux kernel in 2019.

08:37.100 --> 08:37.800
We're not going to see it.

08:37.800 --> 08:38.800
We haven't seen it yet.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.300
It's not likely to happen in 2019.

08:40.300 --> 08:41.900
Hey, that might be someone's hope cast.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.300
Well, I'm going to say this right now.

08:43.300 --> 08:46.900
Here's my pledge.

08:46.900 --> 08:50.800
People speculate, people in the know, people familiar with the matter,

08:50.800 --> 08:55.500
speculate that if a corporate backer were to come along and corporately back Riser,

08:55.500 --> 08:59.600
whatever that means, like it's inclusion in the kernel or whatever, then it could be mainlined.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.700
So I make this commitment right now.

09:01.700 --> 09:07.400
If the audience can organize around this and form a company, I will fund it.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.000
I'll fund $2,000 of my own personal money.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.800
If we could get Riser somehow mainlined in the Linux kernel,

09:13.800 --> 09:16.500
it'd be the best thing this show ever did.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.800
It would be amazing.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.900
And what is corporate backing really, right?

09:20.900 --> 09:24.800
Isn't that just a company that's willing to put their name on something and submit the patch and fight for it?

09:24.800 --> 09:25.300
I mean, I don't know.

09:25.300 --> 09:26.400
I think so.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.800
We just got to get organized.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.100
Maybe fund a little bit of development work if there's, you know, changes.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.500
Sure, why not?

09:32.500 --> 09:32.800
Sure.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.800
If we got extra money after the pizza party, we form an LLC, right?

09:36.800 --> 09:41.300
Something like Axe Murder File Systems Incorporated.

09:41.300 --> 09:47.000
No, I don't know what we call it, but we form an LLC and we collectively raise some money.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.200
I'll seed it with $2,000 just to get this going.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.700
We probably need to raise a little more than that.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.000
And then we submit it to the kernel for inclusion.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
By the end of 2019, we get RiserFS mainlined.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.500
I think it'd be a massive accomplishment.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.200
I'm just putting it out there.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.600
It's for the audience to take and run with.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.900
I'm just the idea guy.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.000
But you let me know.

10:04.000 --> 10:04.800
What do you think?

10:04.800 --> 10:06.400
I think it's a great plan.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.400
Would you put in 10 bucks?

10:07.400 --> 10:08.600
Oh, yes.

10:08.600 --> 10:09.200
Of course.

10:09.200 --> 10:09.900
For Linux?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.900
Who wouldn't?

10:11.900 --> 10:14.800
What a ridiculous accomplishment that would be.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.500
Like if we somehow had managed to put together enough organization to...

10:18.500 --> 10:21.300
Yeah, probably we should use that to fund other kernel features.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.300
No, that's ridiculous.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.800
This is important.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.800
I mean, somebody's got to work on the important things.

10:27.800 --> 10:34.100
Because companies like Google now are focusing on getting GPU support for their Linux apps running on Chrome OS.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.300
This is massive.

10:35.300 --> 10:42.600
Chrome OS is in the early stages right now of adding full-fledged graphics acceleration to the Linux apps.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.500
They're necessary for not only running games, but some other important apps, too.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.700
There's probably a few that come to mind.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.600
Oh, yeah, that is right.

10:50.600 --> 10:54.600
Yeah, you can play non-intense games, a little bit of GPU work, things like that.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.100
Sure.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.100
But don't go crazy.

10:56.100 --> 10:56.600
No.

10:56.600 --> 11:01.000
And of course, especially these days, games aren't the only programs that actually use a GPU.

11:01.000 --> 11:01.900
No, more so than ever.

11:01.900 --> 11:08.900
Yeah, actually one major application that Google has been hard at work trying to perfect for Chrome OS is, of course, Android Studio.

11:08.900 --> 11:09.400
That'd be good.

11:09.400 --> 11:14.100
And while Android Studio itself can run on Chrome OS today through the Linux app support,

11:14.100 --> 11:18.600
the Android emulator, which is used for testing all of your Android apps on a simulated device,

11:18.600 --> 11:19.600
well, it needs the GPU.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.300
It needs that GPU.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.100
Yeah.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.300
Yeah, so that's probably the main driver for this.

11:25.300 --> 11:26.300
But we'll see.

11:26.300 --> 11:29.300
It is in the source code management system now.

11:29.300 --> 11:36.700
There is a new option to enable Linux GPU virtual machine acceleration, whatever they're calling it.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.600
It's going to be in the beta channels, obviously.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.900
But I don't think you're going to see a super easy user way to do this yet.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.200
No, not so far.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.900
You're going to have to go to the command line, run VMZ start, enable GPU.

11:45.900 --> 11:46.400
There you go.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.900
And then the application you want to enable.

11:47.900 --> 11:48.900
That's not so bad.

11:48.900 --> 11:53.000
And then eventually, they'll probably just turn it on automatically once they've got it nailed down.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.400
The nice thing about Chrome OS, I suppose, is they've got kind of the Apple advantage.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.300
They control the operating system.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.700
And it's a range of devices, but it's a limited range.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.500
It's not the entire marketplace they have to support.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.600
It's devices that they've blessed to run Chrome OS.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.600
So they, in theory, know the whole addressable market there.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.600
And in somewhat of like an iOS, same thing.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.200
Like, they're starting from a more limited platform of support, right?

12:15.200 --> 12:19.900
Here's what our device does, and then adding things as they think it's up to stuff.

12:19.900 --> 12:24.900
Yeah, I wonder if that's 2019 might be the year I get a Chromebook, I think.

12:24.900 --> 12:25.900
I've been pushing it.

12:25.900 --> 12:28.900
But you've got full-fledged Linux apps on there with GPU support.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.400
I got to at least try it, kind of see what it's like.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.400
Yeah, okay.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.200
I'm curious, too.

12:33.200 --> 12:36.800
Part of me is, you know, nervous that this is the Linux desktop.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.600
Chrome OS is the Linux desktop.

12:39.600 --> 12:40.300
What if you love it?

12:40.300 --> 12:41.400
What if that's true?

12:41.400 --> 12:42.100
Would you love it?

12:42.100 --> 12:43.200
That'd be great, actually.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.700
I'd be okay with that.

12:44.700 --> 12:48.100
Brent, you didn't end up with any Chrome OS experiences on your recent travels.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.200
Welcome back to the show, Brent.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.100
It's good to have you back.

12:50.100 --> 12:54.600
You must have had a mobile computing setup while you were traveling all around the world.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.100
World traveling man, you are.

12:57.100 --> 12:57.800
Yeah, thanks.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.500
First of all, it's good to be back.

12:59.500 --> 13:03.900
I got all set up yesterday and realized I was one day off.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.900
Yeah, well, it's a special day today because of the holidays.

13:06.900 --> 13:11.600
Yeah, I sort of brought my whole production machine down.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.300
You did?

13:12.300 --> 13:13.000
Wow.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.100
Well, I was in Chile for like two and a half weeks or something like that doing some really

13:19.100 --> 13:21.100
in-depth paragliding stuff.

13:21.100 --> 13:26.100
My twin brother does that and I got a free opportunity to learn how to do it, which was

13:26.100 --> 13:26.600
really great.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.600
But I was also there with a camera.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.000
So I was trying to capture a whole bunch of stuff that was going on.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.200
And I just thought, if I'm going to try to be on assignment without my production machine,

13:36.200 --> 13:37.000
it's a bit of a challenge.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
So I did break down and carried extra stuff and half regretted it because I had to haul

13:43.000 --> 13:43.300
it all.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.000
But no Chrome OS.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.200
Sorry, no Chrome OS.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.300
I bet more than half.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.500
Well, I'm being generous.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.000
I didn't know you had a twin brother either.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.700
How do I know if I'm talking to real Brent or Brent's twin?

13:54.700 --> 13:55.400
You know, it's strange.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.900
So I'm visiting him in BC still at this point.

13:57.900 --> 14:01.400
And I'm sitting at his desk and he has, of course, the exact same computer that I do

14:01.400 --> 14:02.300
because I set him up with it.

14:02.300 --> 14:06.400
So it's slowly stealing his identity.

14:06.400 --> 14:06.900
Nice.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.000
That's it, right?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.400
Pretty soon I'll be driving his car.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.300
Soon you'll be just as good of a paraglider.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.100
If I had a twin brother, I'd keep it a secret.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.800
And I would swap.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.100
Like today, he'd be working, not me.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.600
This week, it would be twin brothers week.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.000
And I'd be off this week.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.400
But I'd never tell anyone I was doing it.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.100
You know?

14:23.100 --> 14:25.900
So most of the time he spends like he's just having to learn, right?

14:25.900 --> 14:27.100
You write down all the things you do.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.000
Here's the new facts.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.600
Well, we got to make sure we're eating the same stuff.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.900
We got to buy two of everything.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.600
I mean, it's not cheap, but I feel like it's worth the long game.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.200
Have you tried?

14:34.200 --> 14:35.100
Have you thought about it, Brent?

14:35.100 --> 14:37.000
Have you tried that?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.300
Well, here's a question for you, Chris.

14:38.300 --> 14:40.700
How do you know it's not me?

14:40.700 --> 14:41.500
How do you know it is me?

14:41.500 --> 14:42.400
You're right.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.100
I got you there.

14:43.100 --> 14:43.900
OK.

14:43.900 --> 14:44.400
Fair enough.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.100
And you wouldn't say.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.000
You wouldn't tell me, obviously, because I would ruin it.

14:47.000 --> 14:47.800
Well, exactly.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.000
All the benefits go away if you say something.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.200
Now, let's say, you know, Richard Stallman comes down.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.500
He says, you know what I want to do is I want to give you some of this free software foundation

14:56.500 --> 14:57.500
money, you know?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.200
Because, you know, what's he going to do with it?

14:59.200 --> 15:02.300
So he writes you a big old check and says, here you go.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.100
Here's $5,000, Brent.

15:04.100 --> 15:08.200
I want you to modernize your mobile setup.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.000
Where do you go with that $5,000?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.900
Do you go, like, down the route of a ThinkPad?

15:11.900 --> 15:14.600
Do you go down the route of a Chromebook?

15:14.600 --> 15:16.100
Where would you go at this point?

15:16.100 --> 15:18.400
So that's interesting, because when you were asking the question,

15:18.400 --> 15:23.400
I thought it was like 5K to revolutionize the idea of a mobile setup.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.400
But you're talking just 5K to purchase one.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.000
If you had to go and get one today, because, you know, the reason why I ask you is,

15:28.000 --> 15:29.200
man, I would be thinking that.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.300
As I'm sitting there carrying all these heavy bags around and stuff,

15:31.300 --> 15:33.700
like, what would be going through my head is how can I make this better?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.300
This is the worst thing ever.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.300
But I'm also a bit of a whiner.

15:37.300 --> 15:37.700
It's funny.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.100
This trip for me changed something in my mind.

15:40.100 --> 15:44.000
And my number one change that I would love to see actually doesn't have anything to do

15:44.000 --> 15:44.700
with my computer.

15:44.700 --> 15:47.300
It would be a lighter, better camera.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.100
Oh, sure.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.800
And I think that might be a bit of my own limitation.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.800
I'm still using a DSLR, and they've got some wonderful mirrorless cameras and stuff out there.

15:54.800 --> 16:02.300
So it's more about me having to buy something else and push the envelope in my own arena.

16:02.300 --> 16:05.000
Right, I suppose that stuff's so heavy in comparison to your computer.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.600
The computer stuff isn't that big of a deal.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.300
That's it, right?

16:07.300 --> 16:11.900
And the computer's slim, so you can shove it in a bag and it doesn't take up that much space.

16:11.900 --> 16:17.300
But as far as the camera gear goes, you know, it generally has its own backpack or whatever, right?

16:17.300 --> 16:17.800
Yeah.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.800
But 5K won't do it, Chris.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.600
5K won't do it in that arena.

16:21.600 --> 16:25.400
No, that might get you a lens.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.600
Yeah, that's a start.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.800
Oh, boy.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.600
Yeah, it's a totally different ballgame.

16:30.600 --> 16:34.600
Yeah, well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see if Richard Stallman comes and writes that check.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.800
Because, yeah, you're right.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.700
You could totally redo that whole setup if you're starting with the camera gear.

16:38.700 --> 16:39.300
Yeah, that's it.

16:39.300 --> 16:43.800
And so having invested so much into one system, it's always a little tricky to move, right?

16:43.800 --> 16:46.600
And that's probably true of computers as well.

16:46.600 --> 16:58.400
But to answer your original question, I would say, just very broadly, the thinnest, most Linux-friendly laptop I can possibly get that has an IPS screen and just gets out of the way.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.000
Yeah, a nice screen is definitely important for what you're doing, too.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.400
Well, glad to have you back.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.700
And glad you enjoyed your travels.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.100
Sounds like paragliding.

17:08.100 --> 17:09.700
Sounds like quite the adventure.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.500
With a twin brother?

17:10.500 --> 17:12.100
I mean, that's a heck of a story.

17:12.100 --> 17:13.100
You should be vlogging this.

17:13.100 --> 17:13.800
I'd watch that.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.100
I'd watch that.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.500
You know, I'm not as sophisticated as you.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.200
Maybe I'll start.

17:17.200 --> 17:17.700
You should.

17:17.700 --> 17:23.300
But I did throw up in the IRC a little gallery just so people can get a sense of what I was doing.

17:23.300 --> 17:26.800
So almost all of those shots, at least the photos, are actually of me.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.000
So there's me in the sky with birds and stuff like that.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.600
It's really amazing.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.700
And there's some cool videos there from an expert who knows a lot more than I do.

17:33.700 --> 17:37.300
But basically, we're flying over the city and doing some really cool stuff.

17:37.300 --> 17:40.400
So yeah, thanks for the interest there.

17:40.400 --> 17:46.000
And for sure, I missed being plugged into JB for that time.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.800
Plugged into Untucked.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.000
It's good to have you back.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.200
Well, why don't we do a little kind of looking forward now?

17:54.200 --> 17:55.200
Let's start shifting gears.

17:55.200 --> 17:59.000
What we're gathered here for today, and let's start with Wine.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.400
Wine is one of those projects that's been around forever now.

18:02.400 --> 18:08.600
And they're aiming for their 4.0 release, which could be massive for them,

18:08.600 --> 18:14.400
including a lot of the work with the DXVK stuff recently being moved back in.

18:14.400 --> 18:19.500
Support for querying BIOS data on Linux, Kerberos authentication,

18:19.500 --> 18:24.000
OpenGL core context being enabled in Direct3D, a bunch of Direct3D stuff

18:24.000 --> 18:29.600
actually, including multi-threaded command streams, all kinds of good stuff.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.400
So Wine, I think, this isn't a prediction.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.700
I mean, just Wine with the recent Proton work and all this

18:34.700 --> 18:37.500
is just going to have a fantastic 2019.

18:37.500 --> 18:44.800
But just to kind of get us kicking, I think 2019 might be Gnome's year to lose.

18:44.800 --> 18:50.400
So, you know, Gnome shipping on all major commercial and non-commercial Linux

18:50.400 --> 18:51.600
distros right now.

18:51.600 --> 18:56.100
But just looking at some benchmarks that Michael Larble posted on December 30th

18:56.100 --> 19:02.900
over on Ferronics, impressively, Gnome has made significant performance

19:02.900 --> 19:04.600
improvements over 2018.

19:04.600 --> 19:09.500
And now at the beginning of 2019, in some benchmarks, is performing better

19:09.500 --> 19:16.700
than MATE, LXQt, XFCE, and Plasma, even.

19:16.700 --> 19:21.400
Not in all circumstances, and these are mainly GPU-bound tests.

19:21.400 --> 19:26.200
Even in some circumstances under Wayland, it's under Wayland,

19:26.200 --> 19:29.700
it's still performing better than those other desktops.

19:29.700 --> 19:33.900
And this is undoubtedly due to work by a lot of great people on the Gnome project

19:33.900 --> 19:35.900
and folks at Canonical, no question about it.

19:35.900 --> 19:39.600
This has been a collective effort for them to improve the shell.

19:39.600 --> 19:45.000
But we started out 2018 feeling pretty bad about where Gnome was at performance

19:45.000 --> 19:46.500
wise, memory leaks.

19:46.500 --> 19:50.100
I mean, the beginning of 2018, we're talking about memory leaks.

19:50.100 --> 19:55.200
Now, they've closed that performance gap and even in some cases exceeded the

19:55.200 --> 19:58.800
performance of the other desktops in certain types of tests.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.200
We're not talking about like multi-threaded things, you know,

20:01.200 --> 20:03.900
we're talking about certain types of GPU-bound tests.

20:03.900 --> 20:08.100
So, it's really Gnome's year to lose over 2019 because they're addressing the

20:08.100 --> 20:09.200
performance issue.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.700
If they can start rebuilding parts of the shell over time, so we have…

20:12.700 --> 20:16.500
That's the question right there is, okay, well, it's in an okay place.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.500
I don't think…

20:17.500 --> 20:20.400
There are questions about the future in 2019.

20:20.400 --> 20:24.500
Can they keep up the same level of attention to detail, new features,

20:24.500 --> 20:28.200
keeping things stable while going under a major re-architecture?

20:28.200 --> 20:31.300
Yeah. All right. So, there you go.

20:31.300 --> 20:34.900
In old school when we still had ads, that's what we call a tease.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.400
I've never installed Gnome slash Linux.

20:37.400 --> 20:42.300
Let's take a second here and do a little housekeeping and then we'll jump into

20:42.300 --> 20:44.300
the year in review and the hope casting.

20:44.300 --> 20:47.300
So, a couple of items I just want everybody listening to be aware of that

20:47.300 --> 20:48.200
I think are important.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.500
Just, I'll be gone for a little bit.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.800
I'll be traveling down to Texas in the RV and on my way down,

20:55.800 --> 20:58.300
stopping to get married and then honeymooning.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.400
So, I'll be in and out in a way.

21:01.400 --> 21:05.500
We've pre-recorded some great conversations that will be rolled into the show

21:05.500 --> 21:06.800
while I'm not here.

21:06.800 --> 21:10.900
And we also have some episodes that I'll be on while I'm on the road

21:10.900 --> 21:12.900
and then there'll be some that I'm not on.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.900
So, it's big, it's exciting and I also I'll be down in Texas.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.400
We'll be doing a whole bunch of new content launches for Linux Academy.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.300
Nice.

21:19.300 --> 21:21.200
So, I'll be on the live streams doing that again.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.800
Yeah, that's always a lot of fun.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.800
And then yeah, flying to Cancun for part of that and doing the honeymoon thing too.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.100
Oh, are you excited?

21:28.100 --> 21:29.100
I am, I'm very excited.

21:29.100 --> 21:35.600
And the, so on our way down to Texas, we're stopping in the Arizona desert in this spot.

21:35.600 --> 21:39.100
It's called BLM Land, which is the Bureau of Land Management.

21:39.100 --> 21:39.600
Right.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.600
And it's kind of like no man's territory.

21:41.600 --> 21:45.300
The federal government owns it and they just have nothing,

21:45.300 --> 21:48.300
they have no use for it so they let you just camp on it for free.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.200
Particular American West kind of problem.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.100
It's so great.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.000
It really is the best kind of problem.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.400
And it's really, this area is really, really well known for its star watching.

21:58.400 --> 22:04.600
So, we're going to do like a 5 a.m. in the front of the stars kind of thing.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.600
That sounds beautiful.

22:05.600 --> 22:09.100
Yeah, we're kind of hoping to track down a photographer in the area.

22:09.100 --> 22:10.800
So, we'll see.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.900
Oh, hey, my hands up.

22:12.900 --> 22:16.000
Are you in Arizona though?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.100
Bring it on.

22:17.100 --> 22:17.900
I love it.

22:17.900 --> 22:20.300
That's awesome.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.400
So, we will have some stuff while I'm out.

22:22.400 --> 22:27.900
So, I'll be in and out for a bit and doing that stuff down in Texas.

22:27.900 --> 22:30.400
Going to live down in Texas for like three weeks basically, almost a month.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.000
Just going to have Lady Joop's Park down at Linux Academy.

22:33.000 --> 22:33.900
That is nice.

22:33.900 --> 22:37.500
Yeah, this is the whole you live in an RV benefit.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.000
Yeah, plus it's winter.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.700
So, I'm cool getting out of here for a little while.

22:40.700 --> 22:41.700
That's good.

22:41.700 --> 22:45.900
Not that it's amazing in Texas, but it doesn't rain like it does here.

22:45.900 --> 22:48.700
And then, of course, one more thing I want everyone to know about

22:48.700 --> 22:53.500
is I'll be back before Linux Fest, but in April, it is Linux Fest.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.200
I'll be back by around the end of January,

22:55.200 --> 22:58.600
but April 26th to the 28th, 2019,

22:58.600 --> 23:02.500
Bellingham Technical College in Washington State, Linux Fest Northwest,

23:02.500 --> 23:04.400
20th anniversary of Linux Fest.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.300
Yeah, you've heard us invite you to this before and extol the many,

23:07.300 --> 23:09.000
but this is the year.

23:09.000 --> 23:09.700
This is the one to go to.

23:09.700 --> 23:10.700
It's going to be big.

23:10.700 --> 23:13.000
So, that's about housekeeping I had for you.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.300
I'm looking forward to my time on the road.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.500
I will be popping in like when I'm in Texas.

23:17.500 --> 23:21.600
I have a studio down there now, so I'll pop in and do the show thing and all that.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.600
So, I won't be gone the entire time,

23:23.600 --> 23:26.200
but there will be portions in January where I'm gone,

23:26.200 --> 23:29.400
but the show will go on, LinuxUnplugged.com slash subscribe.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.700
Now, before we go into 2019,

23:32.700 --> 23:37.500
let's talk just a little bit about what stuck with us in 2018.

23:37.500 --> 23:41.000
And I got a couple of things and we could toss them around,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.200
but just one I bet we don't have a lot of commentary on,

23:44.200 --> 23:48.900
but I think we'll always remember Meltdown was in 2018.

23:48.900 --> 23:51.300
Meltdown and Spectre were a huge thing.

23:51.300 --> 23:55.500
Yeah, remember when we found out that a lot of the recent designs of our CPUs

23:55.500 --> 23:57.200
was just kind of fundamentally on sound?

23:57.200 --> 23:57.600
Yeah.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.300
That was great.

23:58.300 --> 24:05.100
And even today, we are seeing articles published about the performance penalties.

24:05.100 --> 24:10.300
I just saw an article about how Linux is particularly taking a penalty right now

24:10.300 --> 24:13.100
in a particular area when you have a particular type of mitigation.

24:13.100 --> 24:15.400
It's much worse than any of the other operating systems.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.000
And they're scrambling to try to fix that.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.500
And now we're in 2019.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.700
So, I think that was pretty big.

24:21.700 --> 24:24.900
But for me personally, in my Linux usage,

24:24.900 --> 24:30.100
one of the biggest things that happened was the release of Ubuntu 18.04.

24:30.100 --> 24:32.400
I rebased my whole studio on that.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.000
And I rebased my workstations on that.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.800
And some of the derivatives I used rebased on that.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.500
Yeah, it kind of took over your whole life.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.000
Mm-hmm.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.300
Yeah, I went all in on 18.04.

24:42.300 --> 24:44.700
And I think it's been a pretty great release.

24:44.700 --> 24:47.500
I think it's been pretty solid.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.100
I think—

24:48.100 --> 24:50.400
Especially for workstations, for servers.

24:50.400 --> 24:54.000
I mean, I think 16.04 was a big culmination for the project in general,

24:54.000 --> 24:55.900
just with all the changes that had happened.

24:55.900 --> 24:56.200
Yeah.

24:56.200 --> 25:00.200
And then 18.04 is just a shiny, nice OS.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.600
It's one of those releases that you feel really comfortable recommending, you know,

25:03.600 --> 25:05.300
to new people and stuff.

25:05.300 --> 25:06.200
It's like, yeah, give this a go.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.800
Give that—give this a try.

25:07.800 --> 25:12.400
And I felt like at the end of 2018, 18.04 still stands out,

25:12.400 --> 25:14.600
you know, a year—almost a year later now.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.900
It really still stands out as one of the best releases that they've had

25:17.900 --> 25:20.000
and one of the better desktop Linux releases.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.700
Every distro's got good releases,

25:21.700 --> 25:24.100
but this, I thought, was a particularly good one.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.600
I'm sure anybody in the moment, if they want to chime in on that,

25:26.600 --> 25:27.800
I'm sure you guys probably feel similar.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.200
But if you don't, feel free to interrupt me.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.200
I wholeheartedly agree, Chris, of course.

25:32.200 --> 25:32.700
Of course you do.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.900
But I think even, you know—

25:34.900 --> 25:36.600
I mean, even as somebody who works for Canonical,

25:36.600 --> 25:38.600
you have to admit there's some releases that are good,

25:38.600 --> 25:40.600
and there's some releases that seem like they're pretty great.

25:40.600 --> 25:45.500
And I think you guys do a pretty good job of nailing it on the LTSs.

25:45.500 --> 25:50.200
14.04 was solid, 16.04 was solid, and 18.04 is solid.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.800
But now you've really got it down.

25:52.800 --> 25:57.100
Live patching, hardware enablement, backporting, like the whole thing.

25:57.100 --> 26:03.000
Like, there's just—there's very little penalty now for using the LTS.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.600
And it really kind of all came together.

26:04.600 --> 26:08.900
I've long stuck on the LTSs like most normal people.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.400
And as I've mentioned here before,

26:11.400 --> 26:16.000
the number of people who stick to LTS releases of Ubuntu is,

26:16.000 --> 26:21.400
you know, an order of magnitude greater than those people who venture into the non-LTSs.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.900
And sure enough, there are people who try the non-LTSs,

26:23.900 --> 26:27.400
especially those adventurous gamers who want the latest Mesa

26:27.400 --> 26:31.300
or some other interesting driver for a bit of hardware they have.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.600
Sure, and that's what that's there for, is to try out that new stuff.

26:34.600 --> 26:39.300
But the stability of the LTS is so critical.

26:39.300 --> 26:43.600
And 18.04 has, I agree, been pretty fantastic.

26:43.600 --> 26:47.100
I'm running 18.04 on my main machine here,

26:47.100 --> 26:49.600
and I have no intention of moving off it right now.

26:49.600 --> 26:54.300
And I think a lot of the projects that are based on Ubuntu have benefited from it too.

26:54.300 --> 26:59.000
The elementary team released Juno this year, and it is a great release.

26:59.000 --> 27:04.800
And that project is firing on all cylinders in a way that no other distribution is.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.000
It's really impressive to watch that.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.500
But another 2018 item that impacted me, like in an emotional way even.

27:13.500 --> 27:17.500
And now looking back on it feels like, what is it?

27:17.500 --> 27:19.800
What is the, not a Tempest, what's the same?

27:19.800 --> 27:20.800
Tempest and a decup.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.300
Is that it? Is that it? Okay.

27:22.300 --> 27:28.300
Yeah, the kernel code of conduct stuff just blew up in a...

27:28.300 --> 27:29.300
Huge news.

27:29.300 --> 27:34.300
In a way that was just maybe way, way, way, way too strong.

27:34.300 --> 27:38.300
Not because these things don't matter, but because if you're not involved with the project,

27:38.300 --> 27:43.300
you know, you don't really have a lot of skin in the game.

27:43.300 --> 27:47.800
Right, like if you didn't hear any news, you didn't know about Linus stepping away,

27:47.800 --> 27:52.300
any of that stuff, kernel releases, I mean, they kept happening, work on goes.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.800
Yeah, I think looking back on it, what bothers me about it the most

27:54.800 --> 27:59.800
is something that the Linux community does more and more as we are more hyper connected on the internet.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.800
And that is we have secondary outrage.

28:01.800 --> 28:07.800
We almost like we get outraged on the behalf of another individual.

28:07.800 --> 28:12.800
So some other individuals, in this case, the kernel developers are being oppressed by this code of conduct.

28:12.800 --> 28:16.800
And so everyone freaks out and gets outraged, even though it doesn't directly affect them.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.300
They're not involved with the project.

28:18.300 --> 28:20.800
They won't be under this code of conduct.

28:20.800 --> 28:25.300
I mean, you could argue they use the product, but, you know, but the outrage just was,

28:25.300 --> 28:29.300
it was as if each person was individually affected by the change.

28:29.300 --> 28:32.800
And we, you know, we just like to make doom and gloom predictions too.

28:32.800 --> 28:38.800
And it's hard when there are big things announced, big changes to just be like, take a beat, let's see how this goes.

28:38.800 --> 28:43.300
Well, and not to toot our own horn, but I feel like that was sort of our take on it was everybody slow down

28:43.300 --> 28:45.300
and let's just see how this thing plays out.

28:45.300 --> 28:48.800
I mean, we, you know, we had a lot behind the scenes where we kicked,

28:48.800 --> 28:53.300
we voiced everybody's opinions and everybody, we really kind of had a group discussion.

28:53.300 --> 28:56.800
But when we got a microphone, we kind of in that episode, I feel like took a more.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.800
All right, let's just let's just everybody slow down.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.800
And remember that we need to trust the people that are running the project,

29:02.800 --> 29:08.300
the people that are developing the kernel know more than we do about what it's like to develop the kernel.

29:08.300 --> 29:13.300
But I think we'll always kind of look back at that as I don't want to say a stain

29:13.300 --> 29:15.800
because there's still valid points that were made in the discussion.

29:15.800 --> 29:20.800
But I wonder if we'll see any changes or progress in that discussion in 2019.

29:20.800 --> 29:24.300
Not our proudest moment, though. Not our proudest moment.

29:24.300 --> 29:30.300
Chrome OS, Linux apps coming, you know, we watch that go from a rumor to beta to shipping.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.300
They really moved on that pretty quickly.

29:32.300 --> 29:36.800
And now we have full fledged Linux applications on Chrome OS and Google's really signaling,

29:36.800 --> 29:40.300
hey, this is a platform for developers now.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.800
It's becoming a full fledged operating system.

29:41.800 --> 29:44.800
A couple of years ago, would you have ever thought that like Google's making a desktop Linux?

29:44.800 --> 29:49.300
It's supposed to be the web browser OS, you know, and they're just using Linux as a detail.

29:49.300 --> 29:50.300
I thought they were a search engine.

29:50.300 --> 29:52.300
I thought they were an ad company.

29:54.300 --> 29:55.300
Yeah.

29:55.300 --> 29:59.300
I mean, now you're thinking that this next year is going to be the one where you do get a Chromecast.

29:59.300 --> 30:02.300
A Chromebook. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, you're right.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.300
Yeah, I mean, because they added that support.

30:04.300 --> 30:05.300
They added that support.

30:05.300 --> 30:06.300
What do you think, guys?

30:06.300 --> 30:12.300
Code of conduct and the Chrome stuff, would you rank those as major moments in 2018?

30:12.300 --> 30:17.300
Brent, how do you feel like looking back on the code of conduct stuff and Chrome OS?

30:17.300 --> 30:20.300
Does that stand out to you as something that shifted?

30:20.300 --> 30:25.300
Well, I think as you were talking about it, I was thinking, well, OK, imagine ourselves in five years

30:25.300 --> 30:27.300
and looking back, what are the things that are going to stand out?

30:27.300 --> 30:33.300
And I think certainly those are unusual happenings that really, really shook things.

30:33.300 --> 30:36.300
Or at the very least got tons of people talking.

30:36.300 --> 30:39.300
So is that alone a benefit?

30:39.300 --> 30:40.300
Yeah, I think so.

30:40.300 --> 30:41.300
And we're still talking about it.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.300
So, yeah, maybe they're a good thing.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.300
Still playing out, right?

30:44.300 --> 30:45.800
The code of conduct is a living document.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.300
It's been modified once already.

30:47.300 --> 30:53.300
And Chrome OS, Linux apps, like we just covered in the community news, getting GPU support now.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.300
So they're getting even more sophisticated.

30:55.300 --> 30:58.300
Well, and it played into your predictions, too, right?

30:58.300 --> 31:05.300
You're expanding on that idea of Chrome OS running Linux apps to Fuchsia and things like that.

31:05.300 --> 31:08.300
So it's continuing for sure.

31:08.300 --> 31:19.300
All right, the other area that just saw rapid development and just blew up in 2018 is Proton.

31:19.300 --> 31:27.300
Steam play, it just went from like here is 15 officially supported games to, oh, by the way, it's actually more like 2000.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.300
You can actually play like 2000 Windows games.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.300
Most of them work.

31:31.300 --> 31:34.300
Wine is over 20 years old.

31:34.300 --> 31:39.300
It took us 25 years to get a handful of games.

31:39.300 --> 31:43.300
And then it took us, not us, it took Valve and the developers their pain.

31:43.300 --> 31:47.300
It took them three, four months to get us 2000.

31:47.300 --> 31:50.300
It just exponentially expanded.

31:50.300 --> 31:51.300
It is amazing.

31:51.300 --> 31:54.300
I mean, it's amazing in some sense, like how close we were.

31:54.300 --> 32:00.300
You know, there's a lot of fundamentals in wine and the work that's been put in over the years to make this possible.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.300
And now we're actually reaping the benefits.

32:02.300 --> 32:10.300
And before, I mean, right, there were some games that worked and you could do things and if you really had all the right bottles set up.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.300
But I never recommended that to anyone.

32:12.300 --> 32:17.300
And now people who I was thinking about converting will be like, well, here, look at this giant database to games you can play.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.300
Yeah.

32:18.300 --> 32:24.300
And when you turn on Steam play, you click the play button and it just launches and it'll come up with a message saying, you know, it's not optimized for this operating system or whatever.

32:24.300 --> 32:26.300
But even that's very vague.

32:26.300 --> 32:27.300
You don't really know.

32:27.300 --> 32:28.300
You're like, well, I don't care.

32:28.300 --> 32:29.300
Just play a damn game.

32:29.300 --> 32:30.300
And it works.

32:30.300 --> 32:31.300
It works.

32:31.300 --> 32:32.300
And the hell out of No Man's Sky.

32:32.300 --> 32:33.300
Oh.

32:33.300 --> 32:34.300
In creative mode.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.300
They didn't have that the last time I played.

32:35.300 --> 32:39.300
The last time I jury rigged it under wine, I got it working for like two months under wine.

32:39.300 --> 32:42.300
And then it didn't update because the game was so bad when it launched.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.300
And they didn't update and it quit working under wine.

32:44.300 --> 32:45.300
And I just kind of didn't bother.

32:45.300 --> 32:48.300
And now with Brodon, well, let's try it again.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.300
And the game's way better than it was at launch now.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.300
It's way more fun to play.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.300
So I've really liked that.

32:54.300 --> 32:57.300
And now that I have that GPU dock too, it's like, oh, I got a GPU.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.300
Might as well, you know, got to do this guy one.

32:59.300 --> 33:01.300
Yeah, that's going to change the discussions too, right?

33:01.300 --> 33:02.300
You can point outsiders to this.

33:02.300 --> 33:05.300
People skeptical of, well, does it ever really work on Linux?

33:05.300 --> 33:06.300
It already does.

33:06.300 --> 33:07.300
Yeah.

33:07.300 --> 33:12.300
I remember on Linux Action Show was it a few years ago when you guys were in the wants,

33:12.300 --> 33:14.300
like, oh, crazy desires episode.

33:14.300 --> 33:17.300
You guys were saying, oh, if only we had games, right?

33:17.300 --> 33:18.300
And now it's a normal thing.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.300
Yeah.

33:19.300 --> 33:21.300
That's a huge success for sure.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.300
All right.

33:22.300 --> 33:26.300
Just a couple more quick ones to get us ready for our Hope Casting because we've probably

33:26.300 --> 33:27.300
reflected on these enough.

33:27.300 --> 33:31.300
The LVFS project getting official firmware support by a bunch of vendors.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.300
Yeah, right.

33:32.300 --> 33:36.300
At the start of the year, there were a couple, but now it feels like most in some quadrants.

33:36.300 --> 33:39.300
Yeah, that is massive momentum that they're going to carry into 2019.

33:39.300 --> 33:42.300
And WireGuard.

33:42.300 --> 33:45.300
WireGuard is incredible.

33:45.300 --> 33:46.300
It's going to be a game changer for Linux.

33:46.300 --> 33:51.300
The hype, I know it's strong, but the reason why I say it is if you use it, you'll know.

33:51.300 --> 33:59.300
When a VPN is as simple as key exchanges and upping and downing an interface, it becomes

33:59.300 --> 34:01.300
a glue that will hold the internet together.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.300
It really will.

34:02.300 --> 34:07.300
And we've just seen it get so far in 2018.

34:07.300 --> 34:11.300
I feel like it's one of the underappreciated success stories of 2018 is WireGuard.

34:11.300 --> 34:14.300
It's not very often a new way to VPN comes around.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.300
It all just went so well.

34:16.300 --> 34:17.300
It's almost sort of suspicious.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.300
It's like it just works.

34:18.300 --> 34:19.300
Everyone seems to like it.

34:19.300 --> 34:20.300
There's already commercial providers.

34:20.300 --> 34:21.300
If you want that route.

34:21.300 --> 34:22.300
I'm already using it.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.300
And it's so good.

34:23.300 --> 34:24.300
You're using it?

34:24.300 --> 34:25.300
It's so good.

34:25.300 --> 34:26.300
I'm using it from an iPad.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.300
And you set it up.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.300
I mean, like, you did a couple of things.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.300
Yeah, I was like, yeah, this isn't too bad.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.300
And then I got two more.

34:34.300 --> 34:38.300
So in order of, I think, just huge shocks to me.

34:38.300 --> 34:44.300
Seriously, Neon, KDE Neon took the year by storm.

34:44.300 --> 34:48.300
I watched their groups, you know, the Telegram groups, and I pay attention to the Reddits

34:48.300 --> 34:52.300
and been running it now for a while on a few of my machines.

34:52.300 --> 34:55.300
And I don't know what it is.

34:55.300 --> 35:00.300
I don't know if it's a meta overlay or if it is a distribution.

35:00.300 --> 35:02.300
Some would argue it's not.

35:02.300 --> 35:06.300
I was talking with Simon Quigley in the Telegram channel, the Jupiterbroadcasting.com

35:06.300 --> 35:07.300
slash Telegram.

35:07.300 --> 35:13.300
And he was arguing that because it's really just a matter of scripts and continuous integration

35:13.300 --> 35:17.300
and then deploying on that basis, that it's not technically a distribution.

35:17.300 --> 35:20.300
And I was arguing that it still takes care and time to put that together.

35:20.300 --> 35:24.300
And when they transitioned from 1604 to 1804, that they worked on that and were very hands-on

35:24.300 --> 35:27.300
and that makes it a distribution, even if they don't like it.

35:27.300 --> 35:30.300
But either way, their user base is huge.

35:30.300 --> 35:33.300
Now, like KDE Neon has a serious representation.

35:33.300 --> 35:38.300
And it's remarkable because in a lot of ways, it's completely inappropriate for a lot of users.

35:38.300 --> 35:46.300
It's a way to use the latest and greatest Plasma desktop that maybe shouldn't be fully deployed yet.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.300
I don't know.

35:47.300 --> 35:50.300
I use it, not on all my production systems.

35:50.300 --> 35:57.300
On my production systems, I use Kubuntu 1804, which to me is a better workstation distribution

35:57.300 --> 35:59.300
because it's LTS top to bottom.

35:59.300 --> 36:03.300
I mean, on the desktop, when you get a new feature or something works on the bed, you're like,

36:03.300 --> 36:05.300
oh, yay, change, fun, okay.

36:05.300 --> 36:09.300
And on your server or your workstation, you're like, oh, no, I'm not ready to learn a new workflow.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.300
Or why would you change that setting I was using to rely on?

36:12.300 --> 36:13.300
But it was Neon's year.

36:13.300 --> 36:17.300
I mean, they went huge in 2018.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.300
It's surprising it worked so well.

36:19.300 --> 36:23.300
But I think it speaks to that simplicity that we were talking about earlier.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.300
And that 1804 base.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.300
Yeah, a great base.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.300
Yeah, that too helps.

36:28.300 --> 36:36.300
And then lastly, you just can't get through 2018 without mentioning IBM buying Red Hat for $34 billion.

36:36.300 --> 36:38.300
That's sort of the biggest story of the year.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.300
There's just no getting around that.

36:40.300 --> 36:48.300
Anything that sells for $34 billion is if Red Hat sold for $2 billion, that would have been a big story, okay?

36:48.300 --> 36:52.300
$34 billion and IBM, huge story.

36:52.300 --> 36:56.300
And there's just no getting around that.

36:56.300 --> 36:58.300
Like Brent said, I like Brent's perspective.

36:58.300 --> 37:02.300
I take a five-year perspective, that's still a big story, right?

37:02.300 --> 37:03.300
In five years, that's still a big story.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.300
Oh, yeah, right.

37:04.300 --> 37:07.300
We haven't really even seen at all what the outcome of this is going to be.

37:07.300 --> 37:08.300
No.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.300
Early days isn't even fair.

37:10.300 --> 37:12.300
It's not even early days still.

37:12.300 --> 37:16.300
It'll be early days after the merger is approved and it's actually happened, then it's early days.

37:16.300 --> 37:19.300
We're like in the pre-show still.

37:19.300 --> 37:28.300
I look back at 2018 and that is, by the way, a super brief summation we have because of Linux Action News.

37:28.300 --> 37:35.300
And this show, Joe and myself have been tracking stories and you have been tracking stories relentlessly all year round.

37:35.300 --> 37:39.300
And this is like such a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of what's happened.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.300
The pace of development and major things happening.

37:42.300 --> 37:46.300
Like I didn't even mention Microsoft buying GitHub, you know?

37:46.300 --> 37:49.300
There's all sorts of stuff just on the cutting room floor right here.

37:49.300 --> 37:50.300
So there's so much.

37:50.300 --> 37:58.300
When you think about what's happened, guys, when you think about what Microsoft's done about Red Hat, about Proton, about Meltdown,

37:58.300 --> 38:05.300
like almost anything is possible in 2019, even as batshit crazy as Oracle GPLing ZFS.

38:05.300 --> 38:06.300
Could happen.

38:06.300 --> 38:09.300
Oracle could get bought by a company that open sources it, you know?

38:09.300 --> 38:10.300
It could happen.

38:10.300 --> 38:15.300
So I thought, let's take some time and do our Hopecast for 2019.

38:15.300 --> 38:16.300
And I'll start with that one.

38:16.300 --> 38:26.300
I hope in 2019, Oracle just settles all of this shenanigans around ZFS and just open sources it properly and GPLs it.

38:26.300 --> 38:31.300
One of the things that's happening in the background right now is the Lumos,

38:31.300 --> 38:35.300
which is essentially the master upstream for ZFS, kind of.

38:35.300 --> 38:39.300
At least it is for FreeBSD and the BSD projects and a bunch of other stuff.

38:39.300 --> 38:45.300
The repo where previously a lot of the main feature work for ZFS took place.

38:45.300 --> 38:50.300
That's all transitioning now to be rebased off of the ZFS on Linux project.

38:50.300 --> 38:52.300
That will sort of be the master upstream project.

38:52.300 --> 38:57.300
We're going to get into more details in a future episode very soon with very specific information.

38:57.300 --> 39:01.300
But at a high level, that's a huge shift for the industry just right there.

39:01.300 --> 39:06.300
Just sort of all the other projects realigning under the ZFS on Linux project.

39:06.300 --> 39:11.300
And it would just be the perfect solution.

39:11.300 --> 39:13.300
Like they could own the market.

39:13.300 --> 39:20.300
Oracle's file system could dominate the entire market if they just GPLed it and could get it mainlined in the Linux.

39:20.300 --> 39:24.300
That's what my magic wand Hopecast is for 2019.

39:24.300 --> 39:28.300
I know it's boring, but it would change so many things.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.300
It would change so many things for Linux.

39:30.300 --> 39:31.300
It would be massive.

39:31.300 --> 39:33.300
I have a question about that, Chris.

39:33.300 --> 39:39.300
What do you think would be their incentive to have it be run everywhere?

39:39.300 --> 39:43.300
That's tough and that's why I'm very skeptical.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.300
That's why it's in the magic wand section and not predictions.

39:45.300 --> 39:49.300
But you could ask that same question about a lot of the actions Microsoft has taken recently.

39:49.300 --> 40:00.300
And it usually takes several layers of analysis to really get to the root of how does Microsoft open sourcing XYZ benefit them?

40:00.300 --> 40:03.300
And you can usually work your way there, but you got to really think it through.

40:03.300 --> 40:14.300
And maybe there's something there we're not seeing yet with Oracle that they could maybe there's some advantage to having your file system be the number one enterprise file system.

40:14.300 --> 40:17.300
Maybe there's a way to make money from that, even if you're not selling licenses for it.

40:17.300 --> 40:19.300
Because they're not making a ton of money on it right now.

40:19.300 --> 40:22.300
Everybody's just re-implementing the open source free version.

40:22.300 --> 40:25.300
They're using the ZFS on Linux, open ZFS or the Lumos version.

40:25.300 --> 40:32.300
There's not like a revenue stream that they'd be giving up on other than people that are buying unbreakable Linux.

40:32.300 --> 40:36.300
And all five of those people are not really going to make a big difference, I think.

40:36.300 --> 40:39.300
But I couldn't tell you what it would be.

40:39.300 --> 40:41.300
I don't know.

40:41.300 --> 40:42.300
What about you, Mr. Payne?

40:42.300 --> 40:44.300
You got any magic wand, Fu?

40:44.300 --> 40:45.300
Yeah, okay.

40:45.300 --> 40:46.300
Yes, I do.

40:46.300 --> 40:51.300
If I could have something, I think it would be, well, I mean, there's a lot, there's many somethings, of course.

40:51.300 --> 40:52.300
I know.

40:52.300 --> 40:54.300
How about this?

40:54.300 --> 41:03.300
And totally, totally open source, commercially available touchpad that works with Linux of MacBook quality.

41:03.300 --> 41:05.300
That could be integrated into laptops.

41:05.300 --> 41:06.300
Yeah, right.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.300
I mean, just like a regular part that you could buy, the driver was solid.

41:08.300 --> 41:10.300
Oh, that is such a great one.

41:10.300 --> 41:14.300
It'd be a small change, but I mean, I use this darn thing every day.

41:14.300 --> 41:15.300
And it's still not good enough.

41:15.300 --> 41:16.300
No, I know.

41:16.300 --> 41:22.300
I mean, normally, actually, I don't hate touchpads, but this actively gets in my way.

41:22.300 --> 41:28.300
The problem we have, both of us on our ThinkPad, it's like detecting our hand fat.

41:28.300 --> 41:33.300
Even hovering over, I swear it hasn't made contact, and yet the cursor jumps halfway across my screen

41:33.300 --> 41:36.300
and highlights a whole paragraph of text and replaces it with whatever.

41:36.300 --> 41:38.300
I've had to get stuck where it thinks it's like still pressed.

41:38.300 --> 41:39.300
Yeah.

41:39.300 --> 41:40.300
Yeah, it's not great.

41:40.300 --> 41:41.300
It's not, not great.

41:41.300 --> 41:42.300
No, it's not great.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.300
That's a really good one.

41:43.300 --> 41:46.300
I really don't think it's going to happen, but I would love it.

41:46.300 --> 41:50.300
Something with like an open source haptic engine in it, maybe like a RISC-V processor

41:50.300 --> 41:54.300
or one of those new open source MIPS processors to do the management inside there.

41:54.300 --> 41:55.300
It could even be an Arduino, I suppose.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.300
You know, you could go the keyboardios route.

41:57.300 --> 42:00.300
Something that could be integrated into a laptop or a standalone trackpad.

42:00.300 --> 42:02.300
Oh, yeah, that could be fine, too.

42:02.300 --> 42:03.300
That'd be really nice.

42:03.300 --> 42:04.300
I like that one a lot.

42:04.300 --> 42:05.300
What about you, Mumbroom?

42:05.300 --> 42:08.300
Anybody in the Mumbroom want to jump in with one of their Hopecasts?

42:08.300 --> 42:10.300
I hate the word, but I don't got anything better.

42:10.300 --> 42:16.300
Okay, I'll start with the small one, and this is where you can have an effect.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.300
It also includes Linux Fest Northwest, actually.

42:18.300 --> 42:24.300
So one huge thing that I think everyone would benefit from, and I personally would absolutely

42:24.300 --> 42:31.300
love, if realistic, I'll put that in there, is to be able to listen live in real time

42:31.300 --> 42:32.300
to the shows being recorded.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.300
I think that'd be really awesome.

42:33.300 --> 42:34.300
I like the audio stream again.

42:34.300 --> 42:35.300
Could the audio stream work in again?

42:35.300 --> 42:36.300
Do you have that wand?

42:36.300 --> 42:39.300
We actually are assembling that wand right now.

42:39.300 --> 42:46.300
Yeah, so the audio stream was working at the last Linux Fest, but there were some delays

42:46.300 --> 42:49.300
last year, so it didn't really make sense.

42:49.300 --> 42:53.300
So either if you can cut that delay or if...

42:53.300 --> 42:57.300
Anyways, if you need some help, I'm totally willing to help with that, and if anybody

42:57.300 --> 42:59.300
else is willing to help, I think that'd be really cool.

42:59.300 --> 43:00.300
I feel like that could happen.

43:00.300 --> 43:01.300
That may be one magic wand.

43:01.300 --> 43:02.300
That's what I like to hear.

43:02.300 --> 43:03.300
All right, all right.

43:03.300 --> 43:06.300
So is there another one I can help you with, or is that it?

43:06.300 --> 43:07.300
Is that where all my leverage is?

43:07.300 --> 43:10.300
This is where Chris grants everyone's wishes.

43:10.300 --> 43:18.300
I have many more, but I think one that's more sort of open source community, a little on

43:18.300 --> 43:27.300
the outlandish side, which is always fun to chat about, would be I know that GDPR is encouraging

43:27.300 --> 43:33.300
services to open up data so you can share between services, so you can get in and out

43:33.300 --> 43:34.300
easily.

43:34.300 --> 43:40.300
I would love to see that for OSs, so to make it much easier to get people out of certain

43:40.300 --> 43:43.300
other OSs, say Apple, and into OSs like Linux.

43:43.300 --> 43:48.300
I try to help a lot of people do that, and the most frustrating part is getting their

43:48.300 --> 43:52.300
data out of their proprietary systems, so that's a big one for me.

43:52.300 --> 43:57.300
Like a standard export function that collects up the documents, the photos, your desktop

43:57.300 --> 44:03.300
icons, your settings, and puts them in like an easy-to-read file that any other operating

44:03.300 --> 44:06.300
system could then import, and then it would put the information where it's supposed to

44:06.300 --> 44:08.300
be in its relevant applications.

44:08.300 --> 44:10.300
It's crazy talk, and I like it.

44:10.300 --> 44:11.300
Yeah, right?

44:11.300 --> 44:15.300
I mean, you could even make it easy, like, oh, yeah, these applications are installed.

44:15.300 --> 44:16.300
Here's where their data lives.

44:16.300 --> 44:17.300
Yeah.

44:17.300 --> 44:21.300
That should be a thing, just like Google Takeout.

44:21.300 --> 44:22.300
Yeah.

44:22.300 --> 44:26.300
The hardest thing I've run into is trying to get even the simplest data out of iOS,

44:26.300 --> 44:28.300
for instance, like notes.

44:28.300 --> 44:29.300
Oh, no.

44:29.300 --> 44:33.300
It's crazy how difficult it is to get out in a just bulk export way.

44:33.300 --> 44:34.300
You can't even do it.

44:34.300 --> 44:38.300
So I know that they're not incentivized to help you get out of there.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.300
Right.

44:39.300 --> 44:40.300
Yep.

44:40.300 --> 44:42.300
That's the biggest problem is that they use that as a lock-in technique.

44:42.300 --> 44:43.300
Well, yeah, that's it.

44:43.300 --> 44:48.300
So that's a crazy outlandish hope that I would have to make the planet a better place.

44:48.300 --> 44:49.300
I like that.

44:49.300 --> 44:50.300
All right.

44:50.300 --> 44:53.300
If you got more, hold on, and we'll come back around.

44:53.300 --> 44:54.300
What about you, Bruce?

44:54.300 --> 44:58.300
Do you have any wishes or hopes for 2019 if you could snap your fingers and make it happen?

44:58.300 --> 44:59.300
Well, I didn't have too much time to think.

44:59.300 --> 45:03.300
But the one thing that came to mind was something that might be in the crazy idea territory

45:03.300 --> 45:09.300
is a non-distribution-specific public Linux repository of software.

45:09.300 --> 45:10.300
Hmm.

45:10.300 --> 45:11.300
A free software?

45:11.300 --> 45:13.300
Sort of like old SourceForge?

45:13.300 --> 45:14.300
Well, no.

45:14.300 --> 45:18.300
You normally have your apt-get and your yum repositories connected to the distribution

45:18.300 --> 45:19.300
that you've chosen.

45:19.300 --> 45:24.300
But like the EPL kind of sort of thing where you subscribe to another repository, one that

45:24.300 --> 45:25.300
is just kind of universal.

45:25.300 --> 45:29.300
I'm not even sure it's a good idea, but this is what I've come up with on short notice.

45:29.300 --> 45:30.300
I like it though.

45:30.300 --> 45:31.300
I can see it.

45:31.300 --> 45:33.300
I mean, really, part of that could be that one of those takes off because I feel like

45:33.300 --> 45:35.300
there are some of those things.

45:35.300 --> 45:39.300
And I guess in some ways you could think of snaps as those, but it's not quite the right

45:39.300 --> 45:40.300
fit.

45:40.300 --> 45:41.300
Hmm.

45:41.300 --> 45:44.300
The other thing that I was thinking of was just the hardware support thing of Linux.

45:44.300 --> 45:48.300
One thing that's a pet peeve of mine is when I go to the computer store and I look at a

45:48.300 --> 45:51.300
box and it says, supports Linux or supports Windows and Mac.

45:51.300 --> 45:52.300
Oh, yeah.

45:52.300 --> 45:55.300
And then I pull up my phone and I look and see if somebody else has managed to get this

45:55.300 --> 45:56.300
thing working.

45:56.300 --> 46:00.300
I wish hardware companies would at least check and see whether their stuff worked in Linux

46:00.300 --> 46:01.300
and put it on the box.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.300
Oh, you're reading one of my hopes.

46:02.300 --> 46:03.300
Yeah.

46:03.300 --> 46:05.300
I have one about that if nobody else calls it.

46:05.300 --> 46:06.300
Yeah, I agree.

46:06.300 --> 46:07.300
Some branding, some marketing.

46:07.300 --> 46:09.300
Just really quickly, that's mine.

46:09.300 --> 46:13.300
Just like an organized group comes together, like a moderately well-funded organized group

46:13.300 --> 46:14.300
could come together and do some marketing.

46:14.300 --> 46:15.300
Yeah, right.

46:15.300 --> 46:17.300
You hear like ads about like from the USB people.

46:17.300 --> 46:18.300
So we could have Linux ads.

46:18.300 --> 46:20.300
What's that foundation doing?

46:20.300 --> 46:22.300
Dude, the Dairy Association got milk.

46:22.300 --> 46:25.300
Like if we could have our own got milk, it would make a huge difference.

46:25.300 --> 46:27.300
Got uptime.

46:27.300 --> 46:29.300
Got freedom.

46:29.300 --> 46:33.300
My hope for this year is one of positivity.

46:33.300 --> 46:41.300
I would like to see us, and by us, I mean the wider Linux community and people who are

46:41.300 --> 46:48.300
spectating and commenting on the Linux community, I wish we could focus on some of the positive

46:48.300 --> 46:55.300
things that happen and the new applications people are developing and new features and

46:55.300 --> 47:02.300
freedoms that people are enabled with free software rather than focusing on all the drama.

47:02.300 --> 47:07.300
We have a tendency in the Linux community to eat ourselves alive, and the rest of the

47:07.300 --> 47:14.300
world looks on and thinks we're some kind of amateur hour idiots who just argue with

47:14.300 --> 47:15.300
each other constantly.

47:15.300 --> 47:21.300
And it would be lovely if we could count to 10, think, and maybe put out some positive

47:21.300 --> 47:28.300
messages rather than constantly making articles and YouTube videos about the biggest drama

47:28.300 --> 47:29.300
in Linux.

47:29.300 --> 47:31.300
It gets tiresome, and it doesn't get us any further forward.

47:31.300 --> 47:32.300
It does get tiresome.

47:32.300 --> 47:34.300
And I'll also say this, too.

47:34.300 --> 47:36.300
We can't afford all the...

47:36.300 --> 47:37.300
What did you say?

47:37.300 --> 47:38.300
We're eating our own tails?

47:38.300 --> 47:40.300
It's sort of we just eat ourselves?

47:40.300 --> 47:47.300
We are so far behind in market share when it comes to the desktop area and desktop adoption

47:47.300 --> 47:51.300
and getting the market even recognize it as a viable platform for even web applications

47:51.300 --> 47:52.300
and Unity games.

47:52.300 --> 47:54.300
That's where we're at still.

47:54.300 --> 47:56.300
We're getting better, but that's where we're at.

47:56.300 --> 48:02.300
And so anything that really is effort that isn't spent in fixing that, any time we're

48:02.300 --> 48:06.300
spending effort on tearing each other down, even when we think it's super justified, like

48:06.300 --> 48:09.300
going back to that code of conduct thing, like everybody on both sides of that, even

48:09.300 --> 48:12.300
now, as I say, that still feels like they were completely justified in their behavior

48:12.300 --> 48:13.300
and on their...

48:13.300 --> 48:17.300
But looking at it from the outside, in the rest of the industry, like a code of conduct

48:17.300 --> 48:21.300
is standard operating procedure, and it's normal.

48:21.300 --> 48:27.300
And so while you can argue if that's good or bad, when they look at it, they see what

48:27.300 --> 48:29.300
we're doing and they go, what the hell are they freaking out about?

48:29.300 --> 48:31.300
What is their problem?

48:31.300 --> 48:36.300
And meanwhile, we're really not focused on the core issues and the core problems.

48:36.300 --> 48:39.300
And it really changes.

48:39.300 --> 48:40.300
It really changes things.

48:40.300 --> 48:42.300
So I completely back that up.

48:42.300 --> 48:45.300
And as much as we can, I hope we can contribute to that.

48:45.300 --> 48:48.300
I feel like we've been trying to, you know, we try to walk the line.

48:48.300 --> 48:52.300
We don't want to come on here and sort of sugarcoat everything.

48:52.300 --> 48:54.300
And we also want things to talk about.

48:54.300 --> 48:58.300
But also, and you guys know who watched the shows live, like we'll intentionally not run

48:58.300 --> 49:02.300
with a title that we think is extra clickbaity, even though, like we'll even have the conversation

49:02.300 --> 49:06.300
many times, we'll say, hey, that title would definitely get us some clicks, but we're not

49:06.300 --> 49:07.300
going to use it.

49:07.300 --> 49:08.300
Right?

49:08.300 --> 49:09.300
Like that happens all the time.

49:09.300 --> 49:10.300
And so it's a line you have to walk.

49:10.300 --> 49:14.300
And that's, it sounds stupid, but we kind of, we hope that in part it can be our contribution

49:14.300 --> 49:18.300
back as trying to direct the conversation in a positive way as much as appropriate.

49:18.300 --> 49:22.300
So I agree with that one, Poppy, and I really do hope that one comes true.

49:22.300 --> 49:23.300
Well, let's go back around the top.

49:23.300 --> 49:26.300
Brian, I think you said you had another one.

49:26.300 --> 49:30.300
You had another prediction, or actually, I guess let's not call it a prediction, but a hope.

49:30.300 --> 49:33.300
Yeah, I mean, hope is an interesting word because you can just make up whatever you

49:33.300 --> 49:35.300
would like, or you can make it a little bit more realistic.

49:35.300 --> 49:36.300
Right.

49:36.300 --> 49:37.300
Yeah.

49:37.300 --> 49:39.300
So I'm going to move to the realistic side, maybe.

49:39.300 --> 49:47.300
But I think Wes touched on this a little bit, but just to expand it, I think an open source

49:47.300 --> 49:52.300
mobile OS that's actually usable for almost the everyday person would be really great.

49:52.300 --> 49:55.300
I know we're making strides towards that.

49:55.300 --> 49:57.300
And it's coming very slowly.

49:57.300 --> 50:01.300
And we have some cool projects working on it, but just to see it become a bit more mainstream

50:01.300 --> 50:03.300
would be a real treat.

50:03.300 --> 50:07.300
If I could piggyback off that and, again, make it a little more real-ish.

50:07.300 --> 50:09.300
Please do.

50:09.300 --> 50:12.300
I would just say I wish for the Librem 5 to work out.

50:12.300 --> 50:13.300
Yeah, yeah.

50:13.300 --> 50:14.300
I like that.

50:14.300 --> 50:16.300
There's a lot of skeptics, but it would be so great, wouldn't it?

50:16.300 --> 50:17.300
Oh, yeah.

50:17.300 --> 50:18.300
I mean, I'm one of them.

50:18.300 --> 50:20.300
I really am.

50:20.300 --> 50:23.300
Yeah, I'm not hoping for a realistic hope.

50:23.300 --> 50:25.300
I'm hoping for it's just great.

50:25.300 --> 50:26.300
Yeah, yeah.

50:26.300 --> 50:30.300
So if they could even, even within like, I mean, I'd be okay with like within the year

50:30.300 --> 50:36.300
if it was I can make calls, I can look stuff up, maybe I can send some messages on Telegram

50:36.300 --> 50:42.300
or something, some real just basics, usable MVP style product.

50:42.300 --> 50:44.300
I'd be okay with that.

50:44.300 --> 50:45.300
That would be a success in my book.

50:45.300 --> 50:47.300
That would be a success, honestly.

50:47.300 --> 50:52.300
It wouldn't be ready to replace iOS or Android, but something that isn't crashy, that's usable.

50:52.300 --> 50:53.300
Something to build on.

50:53.300 --> 50:56.300
And it's free would be a massive accomplishment.

50:56.300 --> 51:00.300
And it's weird to think it's, I mean, it's within striking distance.

51:00.300 --> 51:03.300
It's possible, you know, we'll just see.

51:03.300 --> 51:05.300
So I like that one, Brent.

51:05.300 --> 51:07.300
You still sound so skeptic.

51:07.300 --> 51:14.300
It's just, you know, I think 2018 was also the year I kind of gave up on the idea that

51:14.300 --> 51:16.300
we're ever going to replace Coke and Pepsi.

51:16.300 --> 51:22.300
And it's like bumming me out a little bit because we've watched so many cool ideas over

51:22.300 --> 51:27.300
the years kind of go nowhere.

51:27.300 --> 51:31.300
So, you know, it seems almost impossible at this point because there's so much.

51:31.300 --> 51:38.300
Even if you built a great operating system with good apps and great security features

51:38.300 --> 51:43.300
and a fully free hardware and software stack, nothing says it'll have any market success

51:43.300 --> 51:44.300
in any way that makes revenue.

51:44.300 --> 51:50.300
There's still nothing that says you're because the mobile market isn't a regular, you know,

51:50.300 --> 51:52.300
products win on their merits market.

51:52.300 --> 51:58.300
It is a market where there's deals made, there's ecosystems, there's carriers, there's middlemen,

51:58.300 --> 52:04.300
salesmen, there's just so many factors at play that dictate success and so many entrenched

52:04.300 --> 52:11.300
interests that want the current Android and iOS normal ecosystem to be the thing because

52:11.300 --> 52:12.300
that's what makes the money.

52:12.300 --> 52:17.300
Like, it's just those entrenched interests aren't really all that motivated to sell some

52:17.300 --> 52:21.300
new unheard of product by some company that has no brand.

52:21.300 --> 52:23.300
Nobody knows who Purism is.

52:23.300 --> 52:24.300
They know who Apple is.

52:24.300 --> 52:26.300
They know who HTC and Motorola is.

52:26.300 --> 52:31.300
But even the phones by those companies like LG and HTC...

52:31.300 --> 52:33.300
There's already way too many phones to pick from.

52:33.300 --> 52:35.300
It makes it pretty hard to distinguish.

52:35.300 --> 52:36.300
And they don't make any money.

52:36.300 --> 52:37.300
The only...

52:37.300 --> 52:39.300
It's Apple and Samsung making money, right?

52:39.300 --> 52:40.300
And probably Goos.

52:40.300 --> 52:41.300
I don't know.

52:41.300 --> 52:42.300
But I just...

52:42.300 --> 52:43.300
Yeah, Brent.

52:43.300 --> 52:44.300
I mean, that is a magic wand one.

52:44.300 --> 52:46.300
But, oh, man, am I right there with you?

52:46.300 --> 52:50.300
Well, I got something that's a little more down to earth if you want.

52:50.300 --> 52:52.300
Just something that I think that actually could happen.

52:52.300 --> 52:53.300
All right.

52:53.300 --> 52:54.300
All right.

52:54.300 --> 52:58.300
Last year, I saw that Fedora set up with Flickr-free Linux boot.

52:58.300 --> 53:01.300
I hope 2019 sees that just widespread.

53:01.300 --> 53:02.300
Yeah.

53:02.300 --> 53:03.300
It's a small thing, but it's just...

53:03.300 --> 53:04.300
So nice.

53:04.300 --> 53:05.300
It's polish, right?

53:05.300 --> 53:06.300
So nice.

53:06.300 --> 53:07.300
So nice.

53:07.300 --> 53:11.300
And I'll say, too, I was thinking one of my hopes is that we finally finish off high

53:11.300 --> 53:12.300
DPI support.

53:12.300 --> 53:13.300
Oh, yes.

53:13.300 --> 53:14.300
Come on.

53:14.300 --> 53:18.300
You and I, towards the end of 2018, had an opportunity to buy new laptops, looked at

53:18.300 --> 53:20.820
it and decided to go with 1080p screens.

53:20.820 --> 53:24.420
If they had 2K screens in these laptops, I would have gone with that.

53:24.420 --> 53:29.260
But they had 4K screen options, they probably would have been better screens, but we just

53:29.260 --> 53:32.500
didn't want to fight with software issues, especially with some of the production software

53:32.500 --> 53:36.980
we use that isn't using GTK 3 or Qt, which maybe there's just nothing that can be done

53:36.980 --> 53:37.980
there.

53:37.980 --> 53:42.300
But I would love to see it because compared to the Mac, it's embarrassing.

53:42.300 --> 53:43.300
Oh, it is.

53:43.300 --> 53:45.100
Compared to Windows 10, we're doing all right.

53:45.100 --> 53:46.420
We're doing okay.

53:46.420 --> 53:52.300
But compared to the Mac, the Mac has had, quote unquote, retina support since 2012 or

53:52.300 --> 53:55.020
something like that.

53:55.020 --> 53:59.340
They've had that locked in now for multiple releases of multiple operating systems and

53:59.340 --> 54:02.960
they've iterated on multiple screen technologies in multiple laptops.

54:02.960 --> 54:05.420
They've destroyed their keyboards, but they nailed high DPI.

54:05.420 --> 54:08.100
You can only do so many things, Chris.

54:08.100 --> 54:09.100
And I would love to see that.

54:09.100 --> 54:10.980
I'd love to see a Mac OS level high DPI.

54:10.980 --> 54:12.440
And you can get close.

54:12.440 --> 54:17.240
If you live all GTK 3 or all Qt, or you're on elementary and you're installing all the

54:17.240 --> 54:20.180
elementary apps from the app center, you can get there.

54:20.180 --> 54:21.180
You can get there.

54:21.180 --> 54:26.260
But when you deviate out into applications that don't use the native toolkits-

54:26.260 --> 54:29.020
When you take advantage of that open source diversity.

54:29.020 --> 54:33.660
Yeah, that diversity we love so much, it does get a little wonky.

54:33.660 --> 54:35.860
And especially some of the more commercial applications.

54:35.860 --> 54:36.860
All right.

54:36.860 --> 54:41.440
Well, does anybody else have a hope they want to toss into the mix before we wrap it up?

54:41.440 --> 54:43.700
One last time to get on the record for 2019, Bruce.

54:43.700 --> 54:44.700
You want to try?

54:44.700 --> 54:45.700
Yeah.

54:45.700 --> 54:47.980
One thing I just came up with is I'd like to not have to fiddle with video drivers and

54:47.980 --> 54:50.140
just to be able to depend on them to do it there.

54:50.140 --> 54:53.740
I've always been an Nvidia guy, but lately I've run into problems with that.

54:53.740 --> 54:57.980
And it's always been a sore point with me with Linux system is just getting the video

54:57.980 --> 55:01.980
to behave and not to do flickery things and crash games and things like that.

55:01.980 --> 55:05.780
So I've been hoping that one for a long time, but that might be magic bond stuff too.

55:05.780 --> 55:10.140
It seems to be kind of like a one arm bandit kind of thing, whether you get a setup that

55:10.140 --> 55:11.820
works flawlessly or not.

55:11.820 --> 55:14.860
You know, I like that one, especially for those out there that are trying to use the

55:14.860 --> 55:18.900
Nvidia cards because that is still an area where I have a little bit of issue.

55:18.900 --> 55:24.940
My Intel only systems are so solid, they're literally the definition of zero hassle.

55:24.940 --> 55:26.500
It's so, so nice.

55:26.500 --> 55:27.500
I'll add onto that.

55:27.500 --> 55:28.500
I'll pile on.

55:28.500 --> 55:32.940
I'm going to say audio, you know, and I have had really good luck since we switched to

55:32.940 --> 55:34.540
plasma in 1804 in the studio.

55:34.540 --> 55:38.220
I have had really, really, really good systems.

55:38.220 --> 55:45.060
However, over the last couple of weeks and especially today, I have had significant audio

55:45.060 --> 55:51.460
problems where when I open up mumble or OBS impulse audio, it changes the input and output

55:51.460 --> 55:57.140
devices to just different devices, even in some cases, devices that are actually disabled.

55:57.140 --> 55:58.660
And my applications don't have audio.

55:58.660 --> 56:01.920
I could open up, say, a web browser and play a YouTube video just fine, but maybe that

56:01.920 --> 56:05.060
one application got the audio swapped.

56:05.060 --> 56:08.220
But there's other deficiencies to where pulse audio gets confused.

56:08.220 --> 56:12.460
If you have multiple audio devices with the same exact name, we standardized on a couple

56:12.460 --> 56:13.460
of audio interfaces.

56:13.460 --> 56:16.740
So some systems have three audio interfaces plugged into them because we're doing multi

56:16.740 --> 56:18.820
track recording and whatnot.

56:18.820 --> 56:21.320
And pulse audio will just kind of randomly mix them all up.

56:21.320 --> 56:26.980
So in one day you boot up in the drop down, it's one unit.

56:26.980 --> 56:29.780
But the next day in the same drop down, in the same slot in the drop down, it's a totally

56:29.780 --> 56:33.140
different audio unit and there's no way to tell them apart.

56:33.140 --> 56:35.660
So I'm really hopeful for PipeWire.

56:35.660 --> 56:40.040
I'm really hopeful that we finally nailed this because honestly, we were 15 minutes

56:40.040 --> 56:41.040
out from starting.

56:41.040 --> 56:44.540
I'm already on the live stream and I can't talk to the mumble room because even though

56:44.540 --> 56:49.340
I've been using this computer literally all day since 9 a.m. nonstop making shows with

56:49.340 --> 56:51.660
Wes because we're recording some content while I'm gone.

56:51.660 --> 56:55.340
So we've been in the studio since 9 a.m. recording without issue.

56:55.340 --> 56:58.740
But then we close one application and open up another application and the whole audio

56:58.740 --> 56:59.740
system's all screwing up.

56:59.740 --> 57:02.340
We walked away for 20 minutes and came back and nothing worked.

57:02.340 --> 57:03.900
We took a 20 minute break.

57:03.900 --> 57:08.860
And then across the table from me, a separate rig, same software stack, but we're using

57:08.860 --> 57:11.160
OBS instead of mumble, same problem.

57:11.160 --> 57:12.900
And it's just the weirdest thing.

57:12.900 --> 57:16.540
And I just completely lose confidence in the equipment when that happens because we start

57:16.540 --> 57:20.720
having like we start having a weird audio issue on the audio stream and now I don't

57:20.720 --> 57:23.880
know if it's something wrong with Pulse Audio, if it's something on the encoder, like I've

57:23.880 --> 57:26.300
lost confidence in the entire stack.

57:26.300 --> 57:30.700
And these are static systems that get minimal important critical updates and minimal reboots

57:30.700 --> 57:33.140
and except for about once a month.

57:33.140 --> 57:34.140
And yeah, right.

57:34.140 --> 57:39.500
I mean, that kind of plays into the pipewire hope of that's kind of that's been the problem

57:39.500 --> 57:42.120
too with what we're talking about clear desktop and other things.

57:42.120 --> 57:47.740
It's hard sometimes a really good desktop system or some of the goals that dynamic nature

57:47.740 --> 57:50.940
the usability make a pretty poor workstation, right?

57:50.940 --> 57:54.020
We didn't want things automatically changing because we want to set it up once and leave

57:54.020 --> 57:55.020
it.

57:55.020 --> 57:58.020
But we also don't have to rip out Pulse and then put Jack in or do something complicated,

57:58.020 --> 57:59.020
right?

57:59.020 --> 58:00.020
That's that's a lot more work.

58:00.020 --> 58:02.780
That's a lot more work on system just made it all work together.

58:02.780 --> 58:03.780
Mm hmm.

58:03.780 --> 58:04.780
Mm hmm.

58:04.780 --> 58:05.780
All right, Brent.

58:05.780 --> 58:06.780
I think you got another one in there.

58:06.780 --> 58:08.020
We probably get this last couple of ones in there.

58:08.020 --> 58:09.020
So I'd love to hear what you got.

58:09.020 --> 58:10.020
Sure.

58:10.020 --> 58:11.500
I was just wondering for your audio problem.

58:11.500 --> 58:15.700
It's not Brown Bear playing some New Year's tricks on you or anything.

58:15.700 --> 58:17.180
No, I don't think so.

58:17.180 --> 58:20.380
Because there's one thing he doesn't want me to do is rage quit using Linux.

58:20.380 --> 58:24.980
They don't think he wants that.

58:24.980 --> 58:27.420
So I have a JB related one.

58:27.420 --> 58:30.380
It's actually more of a question and then a Dell related one.

58:30.380 --> 58:31.380
All right.

58:31.380 --> 58:32.380
If we have time.

58:32.380 --> 58:33.380
Sure.

58:33.380 --> 58:36.260
So for JB, my question is, do you have any hopes for JB in the new year?

58:36.260 --> 58:38.060
It's been some major changes in 2018.

58:38.060 --> 58:40.860
Do you guys hope to see anything in 2019?

58:40.860 --> 58:41.860
Well, yeah.

58:41.860 --> 58:45.420
Yeah, I have a lot of really big, ambitious things.

58:45.420 --> 58:47.140
I haven't really thought about how much I want to talk about.

58:47.140 --> 58:48.140
That's a good question.

58:48.140 --> 58:53.140
Because we've been now, you know, now that we're part of a larger company, companies

58:53.140 --> 58:57.100
plan and they like set goals and stuff for like the next year.

58:57.100 --> 59:05.500
So since early November, I've been flying back and forth to Texas quite a bit, meeting

59:05.500 --> 59:09.140
with the leadership team down there and just kind of getting involved.

59:09.140 --> 59:14.100
I've taken on a larger role where I'm getting involved with other projects in the company,

59:14.100 --> 59:15.100
just advising.

59:15.100 --> 59:19.580
You know, it's one of the reasons they wanted to bring me on is just for other skill sets

59:19.580 --> 59:21.340
that I have that don't really come out on mic, I guess.

59:21.340 --> 59:22.340
I don't know.

59:22.340 --> 59:23.660
Maybe it's the hair.

59:23.660 --> 59:27.700
And that's been really interesting because it's given me a much broader perspective.

59:27.700 --> 59:31.740
It's given me insights into the larger industry as well.

59:31.740 --> 59:38.800
And I'll say in broad strokes, we want to do a lot more meetups that we could stream

59:38.800 --> 59:41.020
and have maybe an educational angle on them.

59:41.020 --> 59:45.420
I want to release some of the Linux Academy content for free to the community and then

59:45.420 --> 59:49.300
build study courses around them or videos, not full courses.

59:49.300 --> 59:51.980
I probably shouldn't use the same language they use because they're not, you know, it's

59:51.980 --> 59:54.060
our version of those things.

59:54.060 --> 59:58.060
They're not like the multi-month projects that the Linux Academy training architects

59:58.060 --> 59:59.060
go on.

59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.060
But something to introduce you to that.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:03.260
Something, you know, something that we can contribute back.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.220
So I want to free some of that up and release some of that and then use some resources to

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:11.100
build videos around that as sort of a secondary thing to what we do now.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:15.640
But I want to grow our team a little bit.

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:21.900
And I hope by the end of 2019, JB shows are like tap water.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.460
There's a release every single week like clockwork and we're really close.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.980
Like we almost never miss a week on any of our shows, but I want it to be universally

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:34.340
true on all of our shows that every week there's something there, even if it has to be a week

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:38.060
where we do something, we say, hey, we don't have a regular episode for you, but you know,

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:41.780
and we just, you know, update you on what's going on and what to expect.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.100
So I want to get really good about that.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:47.460
Now that we've got a full time team, I feel like there's really no reason we can't achieve

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.460
that.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:52.540
We only, we nearly got there when we were all doing it on our own time and now I feel

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:55.440
like that we have a full time team should be achievable.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.340
So I want us to be a very reliable podcast network that's releasing great schedule for

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.340
you guys.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:05.980
Um, and then this is the year one way or another that the website gets replaced.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:10.300
I have been, I have been done with the Jupiter broadcasting website for three years and now

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.220
I, we're not even, we're not even living in the same home anymore.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.580
Me and the website are not even speaking to each other anymore.

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.580
Oh, you make me be the intermediary.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:23.500
Wes, will you tell the website that I want this show posted?

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.580
That's that's true in a lot of ways.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.020
Um, don't you love having a West?

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.940
So yeah, it's pretty good.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:30.940
It's pretty good.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:36.500
So, uh, replacing the website, um, and then obviously we have a couple of, I think our

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:44.460
most ambitious show ideas that we've ever done and, um, now we have more resources to

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.460
pull some of those off.

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:49.380
And I'm not talking like in production, but more like the, the, the host that'll be joining

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.380
us.

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:51.820
Um, and that's really exciting.

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:55.980
Um, like, uh, actually we could probably, I mean, we kind of teased it what's happening

01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:01.700
on tech snap, but tech snap for example, be the first show that seems some changes, um,

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.060
some shows aren't gonna have anything change.

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:05.900
Um, some shows are just like, you know, really, really like our plans for the show are just

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.460
mostly keep doing what we're doing and see if we just can't, you know, always just do

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:09.460
a better at it.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.460
Yeah.

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:15.420
But for tech snap, um, we're going to replace me with Jim Salter, who is an author.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:20.260
And writer over at ours, technica and he's also previous tech snap guest, the previous

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:24.460
tech snap guests, a wire guard expert and a sys admin by trade.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:28.500
And uh, he's going to be joining West and they both have practical hands on experience.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.660
That's very current.

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:33.460
They both really sharp and both have strong opinions about this stuff.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:41.140
And um, so we want to bring that, that those style of hosts and, um, and quality to our

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:42.140
show.

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:44.500
So we want to really kind of raise the bar as much as we can in terms of production quality

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.500
and host quality.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:49.220
Um, and you know, we can, you know, now we can afford to like buy, you know, recording

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:52.260
remote recording kits and send them so people sound better and things like that.

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.580
So we'll be doing more of that.

01:02:53.580 --> 01:03:00.980
Uh, but really it's, it's, um, for us, it's sort of getting to just take the leash off

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:05.060
and just go full bore at something that we've always wanted to be able to do, but never

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:06.300
could quite pull it off.

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.860
And now it's like, okay, well let's pull this off and pull this off.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:12.260
We're trying to break it down into quarters that way we don't overdo it and overbite and

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.260
it's hard to decide, right?

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.860
There's so many things like, Oh, we finally have some resource and time to do these things.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:17.860
What do we do first?

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:22.740
So we've got quarter one goals and when we're building the quarter two goals right now and

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:26.500
we're trying to think about things and what can we pull off and, uh, we had a new person

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.500
join our team today.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.660
Um, I'm going to wait to announce her and talk about her until she can join us.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.220
But, uh, very excited about having her on.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:37.740
Um, she's a, she's a course architect also at Linux Academy and, uh, involved with the

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:43.100
Docker community and, um, super sharp, funny, nice, just great to work with.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.020
Um, so we're able to grow the team a little bit and things like that.

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.700
Uh, so those kinds of things I'm really looking forward to in 2019.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:53.300
And then just kind of seeing where this sole VP of community role takes it, uh, because

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:57.920
it's already included, inclusive of a lot more than I originally expected.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.100
And it's, I think it's just kind of getting started because I'm a maniac.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.380
You know, they, uh, bought my company and then I'm going to come in and take them.

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:05.380
Yeah, that's right.

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.380
That's how we do.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:07.380
I know.

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.380
Uh, okay.

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:13.380
So that was the JB one, but there was a second one there, Brent.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.380
Yeah.

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.260
Uh, the, uh, so anyways, thanks for that answer.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.260
That was awesome.

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.300
And, um, well, sounds great.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:23.660
Um, the, the other one is, is a bit more maybe on point for what we're trying to do.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:29.460
And that's just, I hope that, uh, Dell, um, instead of having their Linux laptop offering

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:33.700
be a little bit hidden, I would love to see it offered on all of their machines on the

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.060
website anywhere.

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.300
Really more prominent on the site.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.300
Well, yeah.

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:38.300
Make it a standard option.

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.300
That'd be great.

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.300
Yeah.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.740
If only we knew of some wizard that could, uh, something like a Barton George style wizard.

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.740
Oh yeah.

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:47.260
I really, it's driven me so crazy what you're saying right now.

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:50.540
It really makes me disappointed that they haven't fixed it by now.

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:53.920
And I wonder if it's because they have such a tight relationship with Microsoft or what,

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.060
but, or maybe they just feel that there's, there's no reason to do it.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.460
Maybe it'd be confusing for their customers or whatever else.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.740
You wouldn't have a strong sense that they have some really solid Linux offerings.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:05.180
Uh, of course they're already shipping it, right?

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.180
Their website's not great.

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.460
They may have one of the worst websites in the computer industry.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:10.080
I mean really HP has got a bad one too though.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.640
So it's, I find like browsing their site cause just for a few different reasons, I actually

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:19.100
found it very difficult to find the Linux offering, even though I knew it existed, you

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.100
know?

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.940
So just go to Barton's blog and then he'll link yet.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:26.220
That's what I either go to Barton's blog or I Google search for Dell developer laptop.

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:28.460
And yeah, that's exactly the only way to get there, right?

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:29.460
Yeah.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:30.460
It's not good.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.860
And the fact that it hasn't been addressed is a little embarrassing at this point because

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.740
it's a good product and it should.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:36.860
It works really well.

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:39.500
They're doing it well and they just don't won't let you have it.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.980
No, but people, the word's getting out there.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.460
The word is getting out there about it.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.580
Uh, you know, the folks at Linux Academy, they're the, that and uh, the system 76 weeks

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.580
to people.

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:52.020
Linux Academy are talking about trying out some, so it's people find out even, even though

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.300
it's not front and center.

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.300
All right.

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:55.300
Well you're on a roll brand.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.300
Anything else?

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:57.300
Or was that it?

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:58.300
Was that your last one?

01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.300
Yeah.

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:00.300
Yeah.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:01.300
I got one more phone.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.300
All right.

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.300
It's, it's another question for you.

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:04.300
Do you have any hopes for lady jupes in 2019?

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.300
Solar.

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.300
Solar.

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.300
Solar.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.300
And I want to replace the batteries.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:12.580
I want to go full off grid and um, and then, and I don't think it's going to happen in

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:17.340
2019 if I could really go crazy, I'd like to replace the really stupid old school sensors

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:21.260
I have like in the tanks and for like the propane sensors, I'd like to replace it with

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:25.740
like Arduinos or raspberry pie or something that would give me a dashboard of like my

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.300
tank levels and my fuel level.

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.300
That would be neat.

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.300
Yeah.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.820
And the water heater and all that kind of stuff that has dumb switches and dumb toggle

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:34.580
lights to tell me like, you know, if they're working or not.

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:37.960
And it's just contact leads that like generate an electrical signal back to an led, right?

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.540
So I know there's some way I could intercept that and have it feed into something.

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:46.540
I know it's, it's, it's within my range to conceive of it, but like how to put it all

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.540
together.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:48.540
I have no idea.

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.020
And I'd love to address all of that stuff.

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:55.580
But first I got to get better batteries and a solar well on that note, this was a lot

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:56.580
of fun.

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.760
Uh, I enjoyed hearing what everybody thinks and I think a lot of us were kind of thinking

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.760
along the same things.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.140
Everybody had like another idea after somebody said something, I think that was some good

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:04.140
stuff.

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:05.140
I enjoyed it.

01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:06.140
And you know what?

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:09.660
Just crossed my mind as we're wrapping up, um, just looking forward, like the next time

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.060
I'm on this show, I'll be a married man again.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.620
Isn't that weird?

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:14.620
Wow.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:15.620
That's weird.

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:18.820
That is a weird starting 2019 out with a bang, you know, figured.

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:19.820
Congrats.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:20.820
That's awesome.

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:21.820
Thank you.

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:22.820
Thank you.

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.820
It is very exciting.

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:24.820
Um, I hope everybody had a great new year.

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:25.820
I hope you do have a great year.

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:29.940
And if you'd like to get a hope cast in, I'm sorry for the name, if you got something better,

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:30.940
I'd like that too.

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.940
There's no going back.

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:34.580
Linux, unplug.com slash contact.

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.580
We can read a couple more.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:36.580
Oh yeah.

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:37.580
Very fun.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:38.580
Get a couple of good ones in here and read them.

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:39.580
I'd love to hear yours.

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:42.460
And uh, maybe consider joining the show next week.

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:47.420
I'll be out so the guys could use a little extra coverage, help the guys out, show up

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:48.420
and uh.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.420
Come join.

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:50.420
It'll be plenty of fun.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.420
Yeah.

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.660
And then also go catch the last Ubuntu podcast.

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:54.660
Maybe ever.

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:55.660
You just don't know.

01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:56.660
That's the thing.

01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:57.660
We don't know.

01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:58.660
You can't know.

01:07:58.660 --> 01:07:59.660
You don't know.

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.660
They don't know until they have the curry.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.660
Ubuntu podcast.org.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.140
The last season's episode is out now.

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:07.140
I think technically there will definitely be two episodes next year cause we've committed

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:15.100
to doing one at um, at Joe's event at Vox, Fostalk and we've made predictions for next

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.100
year.

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.100
So we've got to do one at least at the end of the year.

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.100
Got that one wrong.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.100
Got that one wrong.

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.100
All right.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.100
Very good.

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.100
Yeah.

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.100
Well, all right.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.140
I look forward to those two episodes at least, but something, something tells me, something

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:31.380
tells me we may see another season either way, Ubuntu podcast.org and go check out what's

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:32.820
coming to TechSnap.

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.540
Very excited about those changes.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:35.540
TechSnap.system.

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.540
Systems or system?

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:37.540
Systems.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:38.540
System?

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:39.540
TechSnap.system.

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:40.540
Systems.

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:41.540
TechSnap.system.

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.540
See if you say it a few times it might stick.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:47.180
And you can go to TechSnap.systems slash subscribe to get that.

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:51.700
We just did my final episode that'll be going out later this week where we kind of reviewed

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:53.500
some of the crazy great trends we've seen.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.500
Yeah.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.940
We'll talk about the things TechSnap's seen and where it's going to be going.

01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.240
That show has seen a few things, Wes.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.300
That show has seen a few things.

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.580
And you can find links to whatever we talk about, although there wasn't really much,

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:07.900
but we do have the community news and things like that linked at linuxunplug.com slash

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:08.900
282.

01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:11.580
But that does bring us to the end.

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.180
We're back to our regular BAT time and BAT channel.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.660
Tuesdays you can go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted in your

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.860
local time zone and hang out in the Mumble Room.

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:20.860
Join us there.

01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:24.420
Tell us your thoughts or the IRC room, always going during the show, always watching it.

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:26.340
It's a really great community.

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:28.780
Some of these people have been around for a very long time.

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:29.780
It's great.

01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:30.780
They're just showing up.

01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:31.780
They're new.

01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:32.780
You're welcome.

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:33.780
You could be next.

01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:34.780
You definitely could.

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:35.780
Thank you so much for joining us.

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:36.780
You can follow me on Twitter at Chris Elias.

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:37.780
He's at Wes Payne.

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:39.820
The whole network at Jupiter Signal.

01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:43.500
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.380
Here's to a fantastic 2019 and the guys, not me, but the guys, we'll see you back here

01:09:48.380 --> 01:10:05.140
next Tuesday.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.980
Unplugged program.

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:25.700
I just thought of another hope.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:33.380
I hope I get open hab, home assistant, something set up in lady jupes in 2019.

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.740
I think it's going to happen probably early 2019, really.

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.720
I got that new Raspberry Pi.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.700
The whole thing with the kids, lukewarm.

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:43.860
They like the switches way more than they like.

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.140
So we've got the hardware.

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:49.340
I've heard the software might be a free and open source.

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:52.340
So for people that don't know, I got the new Raspberry Pi that came out, you know, the

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:56.560
smaller one that's a little cheaper, but like a lot worse, but not too worse.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.340
So like this will run RetroPie just fine.

01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:01.500
And I looked it up first and yeah, everybody said it's going to run RetroPie just fine.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.500
Super proud of myself.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.500
Got a case.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:04.500
So we assembled it like Legos.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.500
That was fine.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:09.660
Then we got all hooked up and you know, I got the CRT television.

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:10.660
So backstory.

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:13.340
I bought a CRT television, but anyways, I'm like, well, let's go hook it up because you're

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:17.540
going to have a whole day at work with dad on this is on Monday and because they're out

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.540
of school.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.580
And so I'm doing coder.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:20.580
So when I bring the kids, right?

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.580
Yeah, right.

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:22.700
You got some games for them.

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:28.060
I go up there after thinking, well, this will keep them busy for an hour within 10 minutes.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:32.040
They turned it off and instead busted out the Legos and decided to build like a Lego

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.580
castle around the TV.

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:38.420
And I mean, it looks cool, but they just were like not interested at all.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.660
Oh, that is disappointing.

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:41.140
It's not Mario.

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.620
They're out.

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:45.820
The RetroPie experiment didn't go well.

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:50.160
So now we have a free Raspberry Pi to use for our home assistant or home bridge or whatever

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.160
we want to use.

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:54.100
We'll see how many we can set up on one machine.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:57.220
The whole chat room wants me to talk about this.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:04.740
This Ethan tweet where so this there has been a real I guess you call it a tweet storm.

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:05.740
I don't know what you call it.

01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:10.500
There's been a lot of upset on Twitter today because someone named Ethan, not Ethan from

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:16.580
H3, but a different Ethan, a game developer, tweeted out a very poignant picture of how

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:18.700
game developers will claim that Linux is too niche.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:22.900
But meanwhile, they're building apps for Fire TV, Tizen, Apple Watch, the Nvidia Shield,

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.680
the jump device.

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.680
And there's so many.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.680
There's so many more.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.780
We all know that all these crazy devices that people make their games for their applications

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.660
for but Linux, that's too niche.

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:36.600
And man, did that not just kick off the biggest back and forth between developers who claim

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.460
that Linux is horrible to write for and others say that Linux is the only one they can

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.640
stand writing for.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.640
It's all over Twitter today.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.460
It's really it's kind of a thing.

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:49.500
It's when you if you just go to Twitter today and search for Linux, that's all anybody's

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.620
talking about.

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.620
Everybody's really upset.

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:56.100
And I don't have anything to make them feel better.

01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:10.980
There's nothing you can say.
