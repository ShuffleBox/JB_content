1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,980
The internet cannot figure out how to quit them. How do you get out of him? Well friends

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,060
How about a simple tool West pain brings us the Vim killer?

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:16,400
I mean I was thinking of you here Chris because as you know, I'd like to alias

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:23,120
Nano-2 Vim on really any system that you're gonna come across. So why not install a hardware kill switch?

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,440
You're familiar with the mute pedal you've got down below you for taking a cough

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,680
But what about when you run into trouble with your least favorite editor? I can never get out of it

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,040
It's just too darn hard. If only there was an easier way

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,380
Well Vim killer is a button on top of an Arduino wrapped in a 3d printed enclosure

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,120
It's expertly crafted and with one button click you can finally quit them. What could be easier?

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,060
I just 3d print a case build a tiny computer

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,900
Install software develop that software connect it to my host system and set up software on that side

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:03,860
And then when I'm all done one button press to end Vim, it's easy and yet it's still easier than learning Vim

13
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,140
Hello friends, welcome to Linux unplugged episode

14
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,980
355 my name is Chris. My name is Wes. There's no kill button for this show Wes

15
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,340
This is just too much show. I'm a wounded soldier. I'll tell you my tale of whoa

16
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:36,380
I'm how I managed to completely bork up my home server last night and Wes discovered a rogue device on his network

17
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,900
We'll tell you how he managed to track that down

18
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:45,020
We have a bunch of community news and some feedback, but before we get into that we have some pleasantries

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:51,660
I'd like to say hello to mr. Cheese bacon and drew. Hello, gentlemen. Thanks for joining me. Hello internet. Hello. Hello guys

20
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,900
Hello, you know, this is nice you me and Wes here could just have a little picnic while we do this

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:03,380
We should do that sometime a podcast picnic. We'll all order the same meal have it right here snacking, but don't get it on Mike

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,880
Yeah, although we'd have to figure out a way to include that virtual log time appropriate greetings bumble room

23
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,200
Hello did a bunch of you sneak in during the intro

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,340
I feel like I feel like that's a lot of people that weren't in there before but it's good to see all of you

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Welcome into the show. I

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,560
Apologize. I'm a little sad today because of a data loss situation that happened last night

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,880
And of course, I spent the morning refusing to accept what happened trying to recover the file system data loss. You said data loss

28
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,280
Yeah, I am so sorry before we get there. This actually is really cool. We were joking around in the pre-show

29
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,640
I mean, it's silly but this VIM killer button on top of an Arduino wrapped in a 3d printed enclosure

30
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,700
I kind of like this idea for just a general close the application function if you could expand it beyond VIM

31
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,360
So it supported any application and you just hit that red button and we'll put a link in the show notes

32
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,680
You guys can see this you just hit that red button and it just closes whatever app you're using right there

33
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,960
Maybe it just kills it even how great would that be kill it?

34
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:12,360
What if I told you that you could easily do that with a few buttons and like an Arduino Pro Micro?

35
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,420
What is it the El Gato that all the streamers use these days? Yeah, right

36
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,500
you can do the same thing with just a little Arduino Pro Micro which can act as a

37
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,600
Hit device and boom that should be kind of a fun segment

38
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,600
You know, what else would be fun is to make a homemade OBS

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,700
Streamer rig switcher kind of thing that is way cheaper than that El Gato because that El Gato

40
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,800
OLED or whatever it is panel is like $300 and I don't even think it works with Linux. I might be wrong

41
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,020
I've never tried it because it's so expensive. That's why you got to go with cheese brand products. That's right. I got you fam

42
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Cheese printed and approved. Yeah, I think the El Gato works with Linux under OBS

43
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,980
But I think to program the buttons you need Mac or Windows. I've never really tried it

44
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,840
I'd be curious to know if anybody has this is the streamers life. So anyways, let's talk about a little community news

45
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,760
We really just have one story. We wanted to dig into although

46
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,920
There are many maybe next week

47
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,200
We'll cover what happened with the gnome foundation and their patent suit, but I'm waiting to get a little more details on that

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,720
I'm hoping to get more information. So let's talk about this Raspberry Pi firmware update

49
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,280
I got a lot of people telling me about this one people knew I was looking out for this. This is an update

50
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,760
That will be official eventually right now

51
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,800
It's in beta that enables the Raspberry Pi 4 to boot from a USB SSD

52
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,200
No SD card required at all, which we were just recently talking about Wes

53
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,800
Yeah, that's maybe where it's a little bit confusing because I mean you and I have already been talking about using a you know

54
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,240
USB mass storage device for your root file system

55
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,040
But you've still got to have the bootloader and all the requisite files sitting on that SD

56
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,320
But really since launch Raspberry Pi 4, I mean there's been promised functionality around the booting

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Directly, you know right off with no SD card required right from USB

58
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,260
Finally as of I think May 15th, there's a firmware out that lets you do just that

59
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,940
Well that is if you can get that firmware installed. So in theory a very simple process you edit a

60
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:23,140
Raspberry Pi EEPROM update file and there's just one line in there about firmware release status

61
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,140
and you change it from critical to beta and

62
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,620
Then you do an apt-get update and there's a package that gets updated and they're called rpi-eprom and that package

63
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,740
Will pull down the latest firmware and put it on the file system

64
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,540
And then there's a pretty easy rpi-eprom update command where you just point it at that bin file

65
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,860
That's now sitting on your file system and it writes it to the Raspberry Pi's firmware

66
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,480
You reboot and then in theory from that point forward it will boot from a USB device

67
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,600
For us on my test Pi because I've got one

68
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,020
Just on the bench here at the studio that I use for testing these kinds of things now

69
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,940
This is how you know that you're using these pies in production is you've got a whole staging environment set up for your pie

70
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:10,420
You're dang right Wes. I'm taking this serious here. I'm not gonna deploy beta firmware on my production devices

71
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,380
That's what operating systems are for I admit

72
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,860
I did put it Ubuntu 20.04 on my pies before it was released, but that was different several weeks before

73
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,980
Okay. Yeah, but I'm not doing this firmware, but I will put it on this test device and this is kind of a nice candidate

74
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,780
I got it

75
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,700
Two three weeks ago, and I have a fresh Raspbian

76
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,500
SD card on there and I got a fresh SSD on there

77
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,780
so it's like the perfect candidate to try this firmware and you and I both gave it a go and

78
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,620
No matter what we did it would write the new firmware in theory

79
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,660
It would seem to and then it would say okay reboot for it to take effect and you would reboot or power off power cycle

80
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,740
And it would still be the old firmware. Yeah, I'm not quite sure what's going on

81
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,900
I mean, I think to the best of our knowledge

82
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:03,540
We followed both the official advice and there's a handy article that sort of summarizes things skip some of the intermediate steps over at Tom's

83
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,260
Hardware and in theory the new firmware includes a bunch of defaults that you know

84
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:14,580
Sort of do exactly what you want. They try the SD card and then well if there's no SD card boot from USB

85
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,580
so all you have to do is

86
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:23,080
Install the new firmware and let it use its defaults to overwrite any sort of bootloader customizations. You've got installed

87
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,180
That's one command

88
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:31,020
But after rebooting we got nothing nada. Yeah, and I'm not

89
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:38,860
really urgently trying to fix this because for me having just slash boot on the SD card and then the

90
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,060
rest of the file system on a USB SSD is

91
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,000
Perfectly functional, you know, that's one of the things that's using Linux

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,820
Like that's that's a behavior that's entirely supported in all of the models we have

93
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,180
So like just having this separate little boot drive is really not a big deal

94
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:02,940
It's just sort of they mentioned that this support would exist and you know, therefore we want it now

95
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,380
I have a tale of woe about my Raspberry Pi home server last night if you want the full like

96
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,940
Multi-pi setup all of that. It's well documented in the self-hosted podcast. So I'll just make that disclaimer

97
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,940
So some of this is a shortened version. Oh

98
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,060
God, I'm so sad about this is actually still hard to talk about

99
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,640
So some context is soon I'm heading out in Lady Choups my RV to go to Austin

100
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,240
it'll be about a nine-day drive down there because we'll be stopping a bit along the way and

101
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,360
Then I'll be there for about a week and then I'm driving back

102
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,260
And so that's a long time and I'm bringing my three kids with me. You've got a full load. Yeah

103
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,440
seriously and

104
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,400
Including production gear wife and dog and that's food and clothes for all of us

105
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,080
I mean it really is a full load and it's a lot of time on the road and I wanted to

106
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,280
Sort of re-engineer my home storage setup. So that way I could get it ready for this and during the luck lug

107
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,840
Neal convinced me I should try butter fs

108
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,400
I was gonna use merger fs for my cousin and I thought if it worked out well for him

109
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
I'd use merger fs at home to accomplish this

110
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,560
Okay, but there's a way to do with butter fs and it seemed like a superior route to go and it probably is I'm going

111
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,280
To still try to do it

112
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,920
I

113
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,560
Come into the situation kind of in a rush

114
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,840
because I'm trying to get everything ready to go and get more storage copied over and trying to just get it done really fast and

115
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
So I ended up doing it late at night

116
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,800
But I probably shouldn't have because I had that thought crossed my mind like I'm not feeling my sharpest right now

117
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,520
Been a long day been on you know, some zoom meetings during the workday, and this is probably about 930 at night

118
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,320
So that's late for me. I mean that's the only time you have right where you're just like I'm sitting here

119
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,880
I'm thinking about the problem. I should just fix it right now. I have to drop the RV off for some work before we leave so

120
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,760
I only have it for a couple of more days before we're gone. So I really only have like like last night to do it

121
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,760
Although it's gonna be tonight, too

122
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,400
So I'm doing it later than I should but my idea was is I need to shut down a couple of my raspberry pies

123
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,500
They're producing too much heat and I want to shut down two of them and consolidate the functionality onto one

124
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,360
I'll shut down one of them

125
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,600
I removed the hard drive and on this hard drive contained all of my media for home like

126
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,120
movies and television and all of that and my Docker containers and

127
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,960
You know all their data

128
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:25,040
All my other like my compose stuff and really there's nothing else installed on the host OS that I have separately

129
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,520
And of course, I have backups going for all of this. I'll make that disclaimer up here

130
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,720
so I disconnect the drive hook it up to the new Raspberry Pi that I'm going to be consolidating to and

131
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm doing all of this through an SSH session on my laptop and it's about a

132
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,000
45 to

133
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,120
50-minute conversion process when you run the butter FS convert from extended for so I sit down to run this because I know it's gonna

134
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Be a bit. Oh you're converting

135
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,440
Hmm. I mean that's a feature that is advertised, right?

136
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:02,400
Yeah, and it in theory is a fairly straightforward process unless you manage to screw it up in the dumbest way possible like I did

137
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,880
Interestingly enough no matter what I did the new USB device

138
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,200
I hooked up would show up as dev SDA and my root now became dev SDB

139
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,200
But because I'm using labels for all my mounts and for my bootloader

140
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,480
Everything was fine. I tried changing different USB ports and I moved the new disk to a hub and

141
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,400
The the main root disk to the still plugged into the back of the Raspberry Pi

142
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,600
So it should be like directly connected to the pie and it still shows up as dev SDB

143
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
It's fine

144
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,980
So I had to verify I was working with the right disk and I was it I verified it was dev SDA

145
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:46,300
So I set off to do the butter fest conversion. Step one is I did a full check disk, you know fsdk, whatever

146
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,340
Made sure that the extended for system was in good shape

147
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,640
Verified everything was right made sure everything was unmounted. This sounds so responsible

148
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,680
I kick off the butter a fast conversion and you know, it's going it's going it's on a Raspberry Pi over USB

149
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,160
So it's gonna take quite a while. So I decide I

150
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Should probably start working on luck, you know, it's gonna be tomorrow morning. I'm gonna need to have a show ready to go

151
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,760
I should probably work on it. I start opening him up the dock

152
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,200
I start working on and things are just they're going real slow with and this is where

153
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
impatience and

154
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,320
time crunch and

155
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,080
Sleepiness came together and I made a horrible mistake

156
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,400
Oh, no, and then that was compounded by another failure

157
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:35,000
so first stupid thing I did is I was trying to load some web pages to do some show research and just the internet was

158
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,240
So throttled up where I'm at at this campsite that I just couldn't even get a web page to load literally could not even load

159
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,440
Web pages so I decided yeah screw this I'm going to tether from my phone

160
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,360
Yeah, you've got this LTE plan you pay for yeah, and the Wi-Fi is running on my phone all the time

161
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
So I just jump Wi-Fi networks

162
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,440
Boom pages start loading. I immediately start filling out information in the dock about a minute or two into it

163
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,200
I don't know. I lost track of time

164
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,400
All of a sudden I just stopped. I have this realization. Oh

165
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,780
No, I've just just connected from my SSH session in which I was running a file system conversion

166
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,520
What have I just done the heaviness of that hits me? No screen or team X session in play

167
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,360
No, I have and this is something I'm going to work on now. I have developed a habit of

168
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,920
Always using in the past it was screen and now it's been team X or even teammates sometimes

169
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,920
I think teammates pretty great too for when I'm trying to share whenever I'm in a remote session

170
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,680
I at least have mosh and I'm almost always using screen or team X now

171
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,440
That's just a habit

172
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,000
I've built up anytime I'm remote because I'm on this my fi so often that connections are are unreliable

173
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,160
But for whatever reason when I'm on the LAN and it doesn't matter if it's a box here at the studio or if it's at

174
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
lady jupes when I'm on the LAN I

175
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,720
Just don't think to use those tools because I'm on the LAN. It's not going anywhere. It's steady. It's stable, right?

176
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,640
You're not leaving. So your session won't break, right? I

177
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,200
Realized the mistakes that are stacking at the moment. So I switch back over to the local LAN

178
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,360
Bring the terminal up then I just sit there

179
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,400
Does it say anything does anything happen? Do I get dropped back to my local box?

180
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,480
So I hit enter and it returns to the command prompt with no air

181
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,820
But I'm still logged in like it resumed the session. I'm not using mosh. It just resumed the session

182
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,960
I don't know like if it timed out or what because it might it be

183
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,200
I don't know. It's all happened really fast in this point because I was beginning to freak out

184
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,600
You know calmly freak out, but I was really starting to worry. And so I

185
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,720
I immediately thought well, I believe the way the conversion works is it really doesn't do

186
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,520
The final stuff until the end and if I interrupted it mid conversion

187
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,080
It's building that tree

188
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:55,440
But it hasn't switched over to the butter FS file system yet. And so perhaps the extended file system is still fine

189
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,480
So I run another check. I run an extended for file system check comes back clean

190
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,160
Oh, did you see any processes still running from your previous command Wes?

191
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,800
I was in a fugue state. I was in a fugue state Wes. I was like, oh no, what's happening, right?

192
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,220
And plus it's like 10 o'clock at night now and I'm exhausted because it's been a long day and I it was Memorial Day

193
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,240
And so I was I did a bunch of chores which I felt really awesome about

194
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,680
Reorganized a bunch of our storage to get it road ready felt awesome

195
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,120
Have like a two-hour power hour meeting felt drained as hell from that

196
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,400
like just you know, one of those big days and then I'm working on this after a big big meal, which was

197
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,340
Delicious, but also draining. This is where I should have stopped

198
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,880
Because the extended for check came back clean, but I thought to myself I got to get this done

199
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:52,760
I'll run butter if s convert again, and I'm sure if something screwed up the tooling will give me some kind of air

200
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,760
This doesn't sound good you can tell I was exhausted so I set it up to go I said

201
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,280
You know caffeine the little gnome extension caffeine I click that so that way my laptop stays awake all night long

202
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
You got it running this time

203
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,760
in T mugs

204
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,020
Ready to go Ethernet with into the into the cabinet like I am dialed in man

205
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,880
I am NOT letting anything happen again, right my head enter and it's going and I'm sitting there. I'm

206
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,640
They and it's just sitting there clock just no feedback cuz it's just creating image or whatever

207
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,920
It says and I decided I'm going to bed and I set my alarm for 545 a.m

208
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,400
Because I figure I'll get up

209
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,840
Try to finish the work and then run into the studio for the show because you know

210
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,360
It's quite a bit of a long drive. So I gotta like get up early

211
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,960
So I set the alarm clock I wake up before the alarm goes off a half hour before my alarm goes off

212
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,680
I'm up and I'm working on this thing

213
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,200
I'm sitting there chugging a Red Bull while I'm like one hand on the keyboard the other hand slamming a Red Bull

214
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,840
I'm down to clown like getting this thing going look at the output of the butter FS convert

215
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,360
Completed successfully. It's got all the stuff on there that all the guides say should have

216
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,760
Looks good to go. I'm thinking at this point. Oh my god, it worked

217
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,040
It didn't do it until the very end which I interrupted so that way it just started over from scratch and it took hours

218
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,840
So I you know, I assumed it must have it's gotta be good. So I think okay now it comes down to this

219
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,840
Mount file system. I get an error that it can't be mounted

220
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,520
I checked the logs a bunch of layers are in there

221
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:27,440
But one of the ones that I've pulled out now after running butter FS repair and check is could not find extended items for root

222
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
256 that just keeps coming up every time I do a check

223
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,560
So I brought it into the studio. I ran like all the rescue things against it. I ran all the different stuff

224
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,280
I cannot get this file system back up. It's there. You can see the size of it

225
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,580
You can see how much is used, but you can't get to the data. It's infuriating and it starts to dawn on me

226
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:53,020
I'm gonna need to recover. All right, let's start that process. I've got backups. Oh, what a mental shift though, right?

227
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,180
You're like, okay. Well this system is lost

228
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,300
What do I have in backups and maybe you know, I still I have all my docker compose files

229
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,660
I've I've got the configuration and backup and the media files. I have other copies of then

230
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
These are not my only copies of them

231
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,320
So I can recover so I go to login to Google Drive

232
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:20,100
Download my last duplicati backup, which happens every night at 3 a.m. So I was just gonna go get the previous night's backup and

233
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,140
I see a red bar

234
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,260
at the bottom of my Google Drive

235
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,700
Where it says I am using eight hundred and eighty six gigabytes of 15 gigabytes allocated

236
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,020
Yeah, you see back in March

237
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,780
My debit card expired and the way Google works is you can go add your new form of payment

238
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,540
Maybe you have a YouTube bread or a YouTube television or Google Play subscription

239
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,180
You can go add it back to one of those services

240
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,340
But it will not add the payment information to all of the services

241
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,980
So my Google Photos, for example like that stuff in there, which I still have those old photos on there

242
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,900
I want I still want them stored on there. That's why that number is so large

243
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:09,460
My YouTube premium my YouTube TV each one of them. I had to reactivate individually

244
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,660
I guess I just didn't think that I would need to go manually check on Drive

245
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,300
I thought I would get some sort of email saying hey, man

246
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,420
your Google Drive storage subscription is up and

247
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:27,460
You're using eight hundred and fifty gigabytes or eight hundred and seventy almost gigabytes of space and you're only you're only getting 15 right now

248
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,460
Can we do something about this? None of that. I didn't get none of that

249
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,340
I had no indication that duplicati wasn't saving to drive lesson

250
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,260
What we learned here never using Google Drive again. I was simply using it because I'd already paid for it ages ago

251
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,820
So why pay for something else? I thought so my backups are basically

252
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,540
Beginning of March for all of my configuration my plex history my smoke ping history

253
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,820
Configuration all of it is basically

254
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,580
March because nothing was generating errors neither duplicati nor Google Drive

255
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:10,460
So I don't have anything current so I'm gonna have to re stand up all the applications and

256
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
Recopy over all the media files

257
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,540
while I'm trying to get out of town and

258
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:23,340
it stinks because it's months and months and months and months of tweaking and perfecting and

259
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,700
Also kind of a blow to this is all of my documentation

260
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,940
Was on that system. Oh, no. Yeah, and I could restore like the March backups, which I will but anything you've done

261
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,220
You know all the helpful hints you've added. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

262
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,940
Ironically, I needed that documentation this morning and I had written it locally on on my desktop. So I just had it

263
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,300
But it was like here I was this morning

264
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,180
I already needed that documentation because I was installing software on Dylan's laptop remotely

265
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,260
and I you know needed my credentials and all that it's just such a shame because

266
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,340
it was such a dumb mistake ultimately my mistake was not using something like screen and

267
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,780
Then switching networks like that

268
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,980
And then I think you could back it up one level and saying I even had that moment of I'm not really at my best

269
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,500
Right now I can tell I'm a little tired a little punchy

270
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,540
but I had thought this through for days and I had it all written out all the steps that I was going to take and

271
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,220
I had it all just sort of by the numbers at this point that I thought I

272
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,100
Mean all I have to do is just follow my list of procedures

273
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,520
like I'd already kind of gone through and looked at all the commands I was gonna run and how I was gonna structure it on this

274
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,700
New machine and kind of just made notes for myself to follow. So I thought I'm good to go

275
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:39,760
But what happened was is I was that impatience and being under too much of a time constraint

276
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,900
And the slowness of the internet where I was at because I'm out of my fight. It was way throttled

277
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,180
I thought you know, I'll just switch over. I'll do show prep while this conversion goes for an hour or so

278
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:58,260
You were trying to optimize. Yeah, and I think the lesson learned there too is when you're doing something at the file system level is

279
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,700
Excruciating as it might be just I got other systems. I could have used I could have used other computers

280
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,940
I just that's a unit asker at that point

281
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,780
I think it's hard because we've done so much to move things off that sort of unit asker model and

282
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:16,260
Most of the operations you do I'm especially if you have backups, you know, they're not unreplayable

283
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,060
you can go back in time or you've you've got the backups for it, but a

284
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:28,180
Giant media filled file system is one of those. It's too expensive. You know, so you you have fewer copies of it

285
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,780
Yeah, I think I'm still going to go this route that I was set it out

286
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,260
I'm still gonna go with butter FS on this disk

287
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:41,820
because as Neil pointed out when I was comparing it to possibly using merger FS is it's pretty straightforward to take a new disc

288
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,520
Add it to the system and then just add that storage to an existing mount point

289
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,020
and you can do that with rate or without and

290
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,780
that to me is a very compelling way to just grow and grow a

291
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,800
Media storage pool by doing this butter fs volume ad or disk ad whatever it is when you look at

292
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,160
What is feasible on an ARM device like a Raspberry Pi or a pine 64?

293
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,040
the overhead of a file system like ZFS doesn't seem very reasonable and

294
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,760
Extended for an XFS are absolutely totally great and usable

295
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,800
But maybe you want something a little more like maybe you want snapshots

296
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,380
Or maybe you want this ability to just add additional disk storage and you want to integrate it at the file system level

297
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,820
Then butter fs becomes a pretty compelling option on something like the Raspberry Pi. And so I think

298
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,300
Even with this experience

299
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,020
I think I would I'm still gonna move forward if there was one thing that I wish butter fs could have done for me

300
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,140
Because this was really all 100% my fault

301
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,660
But if there's one thing is maybe that file system conversion tool could have had some

302
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,620
Checking because the file system was never usable like when it said all done everything good to go

303
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:56,700
It what it didn't leave me with a usable file system and maybe there could have been some kind of error checking or butter

304
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,940
Fs repair scan that happens in there or something to give the user feedback saying this isn't a functional file system

305
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,980
I just gave you it wouldn't have changed anything

306
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,700
But it seemed like an opportunity for the tooling to be slightly better in that regard right you were left thinking

307
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,420
Oh, yeah

308
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,220
I I have a usable file system that I can just go go work with now

309
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,380
Instead of having some sort of universal way to query like is there still a conversion in progress?

310
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,540
What's happening with my file system and should I touch it yet? Yeah

311
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,020
It's just oh, oh Wes. I'm so sorry, but that's enough

312
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,700
File system talk. Let's do a little housekeeping

313
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,580
Remember we're live every Tuesday although I'll be traveling like I mentioned earlier to Austin

314
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:42,140
So I there will be some time in there where we are not live, but we'll still have a show for you

315
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:48,380
In fact, there's a website you can use to find out more. That's right Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar

316
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,260
Where they'll be robots to convert it in your local time

317
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,900
How about that robots Wes and we didn't make them do what we asked and they said they'd be happy to because they are far

318
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:04,260
Superior to our limited human minds. Yeah, they've got plenty of time. So they figured why not what else we gonna do and

319
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,380
Little pay it for going on over at a cloud guru. They're giving away

320
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,080
1000 subscriptions, how about that link to that in the show notes go check that out

321
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:20,000
You can find out more information and I believe it's running until June. So for the end of June

322
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,640
Anyways, details are over there. They're awarding an annual subscription to those applying they'll receive a free ACG subscription

323
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:33,400
That's pretty awesome. What a great opportunity to skill up and link in the show notes to pay it forward at linux unplug.com slash

324
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,480
355 also a mention for the love plug happens every Sunday

325
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:45,400
Same bat time at noon Pacific just a different bat day. There's a chat room to on geek shed at IRC geekshed.net

326
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,920
pound love plug and

327
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,320
You can jump in there. We do it every Sunday, and that's when I decided

328
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,400
Well, I was gonna convert my cousin systems butter fest and I'd start with my own before I did his

329
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,720
Now I'm not so sure he'll be down for it, but stay tuned in the love plug for more and that my friends is the housekeeping

330
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:10,280
So as we had a discussion recently about different network troubleshooting techniques that we had been both recently employing

331
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,440
You've actually had opportunity to go through and fix up the home network and we thought well

332
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,760
What a great opportunity to share our recent experiences here on the show and this is one of those times

333
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Where we get to go with Wes

334
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,240
Into his home on a weekend. I

335
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,400
Imagine it's a rainy evening in Seattle. Am I right? Of course, it is. Yeah, it's just been raining. You've all seen tracer

336
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,680
It's pretty much true. It has been a rainy weekend and Wes discovers

337
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,920
Something strange. I think we've all been there. There's something strange

338
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,520
on my network an

339
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,080
Unknown device, you know, yes

340
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,480
We all have these projects that seem to crop up when you're trying to do something else. You're going about your day

341
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,600
And then you notice something's not quite right. I didn't ask for this really this all started over the weekend

342
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,720
But I noticed I was having some internet problems. I

343
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,840
Was trying to download a new steam game to well let off some steam with some friends

344
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,720
And I was pretty embarrassed when I found I was only getting about two mags down

345
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,240
Now sadly, I'm not on fiber at my current place

346
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,760
But I do have a pretty decent Comcast business connection that I can use to get to my network

347
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,920
But I do have a pretty decent Comcast business connection that reliably performs well above that

348
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:33,160
Now I should be the first to admit that my network. Well, it's not in the most pristine state

349
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:40,000
It's ever been I move more than I'd like and unfortunately that means things sometimes get messy

350
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,200
I'm well overdue for some firmware updates. I handed some password rotations

351
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,000
Since I was already over there and giving the modem a reboot. I thought

352
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,440
Well, I won't be playing this game anytime soon. I think it's time for a home network checkup

353
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,720
So he's a little embarrassing when you get all set with friends and then technical issues

354
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:08,080
Yeah, right like come on. I'm supposed to be a computer person and I can't make this work. Yep, and tip one in Wes's quest is

355
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,160
Check your logs. You may be surprised by what you find as I sat there doing the usual updates. I

356
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,720
Decided well, let's take a look at the log files

357
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,000
That's when I started noticing something wasn't right

358
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,080
They're right in the DHCP leases was a device. I didn't recognize

359
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,280
Now as I said, my network is messy and there's plenty of random

360
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,000
IOT gadgets wireless devices and just general computers plugged in

361
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,120
but this

362
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Well, this was really unknown. And of course, there's only one solution

363
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,200
It's time to break out the networking tools perhaps the king of the networking tools to get a better sense of things

364
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,280
And really because at this point and I was just a little nervous

365
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,160
I thought I'd fire up nmap and take a look at what responded on my network

366
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,020
And yep, there was the same anomalous MAC address

367
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:09,600
Nmap didn't know what it was and plugging that MAC address in online. No results there either

368
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,160
10 dot 1 dot 10 dot 2 1 2. What are you and

369
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,400
Where?

370
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,840
Your mind must have been racing at this point. Yeah, I mean come on. This is my home network

371
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,740
I've got VPN set up to several the key secure or supposedly secure locations. I can't have that

372
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,480
Did you go through like various ideas on what are my options on how to track this thing down now?

373
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,400
Yeah, you know, I was kind of just thinking like well, what can I find out about it?

374
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,600
what do I have that I can sort of eliminate from the list, but I was

375
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,560
Roving around my house looking at devices thinking like okay. Is there anything else I can unplug to try to discover if that's it

376
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,040
But no if you're in a situation now where maybe you're working from home

377
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,720
I've noticed this with a lot of the meetings that I've been in people that are working from home

378
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,840
Now all of a sudden they're a lot more reliant on that home network than they were before

379
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,600
And so you also wonder about the security of it

380
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:07,240
So these kinds of things really kind of can kind of nag at you. So I like I like the Westpain drastic action approach

381
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,800
Then map revealed the port 9080 was open

382
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,640
But unfortunately, it didn't respond to HTTP requests or anything over TCP

383
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,300
At this point I was getting desperate. I'd have to do something dramatic

384
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,920
It was time

385
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
to change my Wi-Fi

386
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
ssid

387
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,020
No going back

388
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:34,680
Having to manually set up all my connected devices again. It's the real scorched-earth approach there Wes

389
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,040
Yeah, right burn it all down. We'll start fresh and only the things I want will be at it

390
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,880
That's definitely a way to just guarantee that it's a it's a clean setup

391
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,160
Did you ever get a sense of what device it was after you did this?

392
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,640
Did you go around and find that something wasn't working? Oh my gosh. Yes. Okay, so this is also pretty funny here

393
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:01,560
I was frantically searching my house, you know for IOT devices rogue Google devices plugged in which let me just say

394
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,200
So many ports open. I'm a little disturbed, but I never thought to check the thermostat sitting behind the fridge

395
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:15,160
I mean, it's not plugged in I didn't plug it in. It's just a little wall ward, but of course it has Wi-Fi

396
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:23,360
So useful obviously too, you know, I actually I am glad that it supports Wi-Fi and there's a home assistant module for it

397
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,860
So honestly, that is something I will be playing with because well, I'm just curious even if I didn't need it over the winter

398
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,360
Yeah, and now you can put it on the Wi-Fi when you're ready. That is the one nice thing about changing the SSID

399
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,120
I've played around with like trying to do MAC address and matching it to a vendor

400
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:47,040
But I agree with past West from the weekend. This is his bit of advice. Don't let this happen to you

401
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,080
so there's a couple of tools and whatnot that I think could help in a situation like that a

402
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,880
Tried and true one that I know our friends at the Ubuntu podcast also love is net discover

403
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,160
Which is a really handy tool to take a look around your land and see what's going on

404
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,780
Yeah, that makes it so easy and it's a handy sort of, you know, just a little end curses interface

405
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:10,800
So it interactively keeps pinging out to your network and then updating with whatever it finds. I like that

406
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,940
So that's a really good one to get a lay of the land also nmap. You heard West use that tool in there

407
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,120
You could read a book on nmap there because there are several and it is totally worth it

408
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,320
but a really simple command is pseudo nmap tack lowercase s

409
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,200
uppercase s and then your IP space slash 24 or whatever your subnet is and

410
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,360
Just let it go to town and discover all the devices and talk to them and a lot of times it can tell you the operating

411
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,700
System and whatnot so that can help you get your arms around what's going on. I

412
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,680
Want to mention if you have Android you owe it to yourself to get Wi-Fi analyzer

413
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:51,080
It's such a great tool and you can look to see if there's maybe a channel that isn't quite as busy in your neck of

414
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,720
The woods and move your Wi-Fi network over to that if it's not doing that automatically and that may improve your signal

415
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,780
So that's something to consider. There's just maybe basics like that to help improve just Wi-Fi with something like Wi-Fi analyzer

416
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,480
Which is on f-droid?

417
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:12,120
Then on your Linux laptop take a look at wavemon and then cursors based monitoring applications for wireless devices and your network

418
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:18,440
Which is really useful and again another beautiful and curses interface. That's right. We love that end curses up in here

419
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:25,160
I use a W LAN scanner and that one also gives a nice overview of your

420
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,480
2.4 and 5 gigahertz on your Android

421
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,840
I'll also give a recommendation to a tool that Weston I'd love

422
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,840
West may be a little more than I net data which is useful for a lot of reasons

423
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:44,240
But one of the neat things that net data will do is it will generate errors and alerts if there's something funky going on

424
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,760
Packet-wise on your network. I actually had this happen

425
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,320
Ah, maybe a year or so ago when we first started playing with net data

426
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,360
It was really early into it cuz I didn't even really understand what it was telling me at first

427
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,040
It's just spewing errors and information about how broken your setup is. Yeah, and then I realized oh

428
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,440
It's telling me that there's a whole crap ton of discarded UDP packets on my network

429
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,800
That is way beyond the normal in a one-minute period and that began a journey of troubleshooting that eventually improved

430
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:18,520
The Wi-Fi network. Thanks so much Vizio. So tools like that even that aren't necessarily for network troubleshooting can help surface interesting information

431
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,720
Boy, that's the story for another time

432
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,440
I think what we're trying to advocate though if we just it could extract away from the individual tools

433
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,720
trying to advocate

434
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,360
being aware of what is on your network and how much resources is consuming and

435
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,640
What that might be from a security posture standpoint?

436
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:42,080
And I think what we're kind of suggesting you might consider doing is do it West did and just say hey

437
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:49,000
let's let's do a network checkup and let's go through and check the firmware versions on the Wi-Fi or on the router or on this

438
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,920
IOT device and maybe it means you got to go recover a password so that way you can log into the we things portal or

439
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,280
Whatever the hell they need you to do so that way you can manage your light switch, but do it

440
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,280
you know get those updates done or or maybe take a weekend and see if you can throw a few of those things in home assistant instead and

441
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,240
maybe reduce some of the internet traffic and

442
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Improve your Wi-Fi that way, too

443
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:18,040
Now as you dug out a few tips from Jim Salter over on ours technica on some simple ideas for reliable Wi-Fi

444
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,360
Yeah, I mean at the end of the day you've got to remember that Wi-Fi is it's a shared spectrum

445
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:28,800
So your performance is often the same or limited by the worst performing device on your network

446
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,120
So if you've got one AP sitting somewhere and you've got someone trying to stream YouTube across the house

447
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,120
That's gonna be a lot of retries and those are competing for your latency sensitive packets in your zoom call

448
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:46,960
so you've got to start thinking about things like where are your APs placed and when are you using it the most and

449
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,800
Who else is on your network? And what are they doing, right?

450
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:58,320
Also things like the layout of your house no more than two rooms and two walls is a pretty good rule of thumb

451
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:06,800
Also, don't necessarily get too hung up on transmit power too much transmit power can be a bug as a Jim says it and

452
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:13,600
Make sure you're really taking placement into advisement as much as possible. He suggests above your head height is

453
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,760
Actually the most preferable location, which I got to admit

454
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,080
most of my APs are down near like foot and leg level maybe knee level at best for a couple of them knee level what

455
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,600
Devices do you even have down there extenders that are plugged into outlets? Oh you although I will say, you know

456
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,800
Mesh I think gets maybe a bad name in in our circles here on Linux unplugged

457
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:44,540
but it can legitimately be useful especially in an environment where you don't want to run a bunch of Ethernet although I will say

458
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:49,940
If you can have a cabled connection, well, that's just gonna help everything. Okay now

459
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:56,140
Let's talk about the router. This is one where I think all of us have a lot of thoughts and

460
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,100
Wes and I are constantly debating

461
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,340
appliance versus hardware device versus

462
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Build it yourself Linux box. Yeah. Well, it's a tough question because different people have different needs

463
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:15,380
How much time do you want to spend babysitting it or having to migrate from backups like you've just experienced Chris?

464
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,060
but at the same time

465
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,980
Do you want to be familiar with how your network works and do you want to know the ins and outs and thankfully?

466
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,420
There's a whole bunch of solutions that range from something like open sense or PF sense

467
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:34,060
All the way down to just running an IP tables commands yourself, although I'd probably recommend firehole over doing that. Hmm

468
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,740
Okay. Well, let's take inventory here in a moment. See what everybody's using

469
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,420
I had this thought when all of this went down if I had some sort of QoS or

470
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:49,340
Something that was throttling all of the other devices and maybe I had priority like my my IP or whatever

471
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:54,060
Maybe I wouldn't have had this issue to begin with maybe I wouldn't have needed to switch Wi-Fi networks

472
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,340
And I wouldn't have disconnected that terminal session and lost the data

473
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,700
Yeah, you know that's a good question and a little bit of quality of service can go a long way

474
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,360
Obviously it can't repair problems that you're gonna have upstream, right?

475
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,500
I mean if you're just hitting a limit with what you can send or receive from your provider

476
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,820
Well, you're kind of stuck but for optimizing what goes in and out of your home network

477
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,140
Yeah, those tools can be really handy, especially if you're an environment where all right

478
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,980
Well, the kids are there streaming a movie

479
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:26,420
It's okay if they buffer a little bit, but I'd really not like to lose my connection to this conference call

480
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,700
That's pretty important. Yeah, exactly

481
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,380
All right. So just around the horn I've recently talked about mine

482
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:37,500
So I don't need to go into it too much, but I'm using that GE slate mobile router still love it

483
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,960
I think it's a great little device probably will replace it someday, but I haven't decided what yet. What about you Wes?

484
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,940
Are you replacing your router? Do you have a new one? What's what's that area of your network like right now?

485
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:56,260
You know, I was just thinking those might make a great little sort of just standalone guest or alternative network Wi-Fi

486
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,860
Where you're not too concerned about performance, but you just want to connect it up with your you know

487
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:06,020
Whatever whatever you've got upstream and then share it out, especially if maybe whatever you're using for Wi-Fi doesn't support multiple networks

488
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,300
If it does, you know

489
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:13,340
You've probably got ways to define more than one Wi-Fi network or set up a guest network and those can be useful, too

490
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:20,020
For me. Well, I'm just still using firehole because it's a great balance of configurability and programmability

491
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,940
but not having to dive into all the complicated mess of IP tables and

492
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:33,180
The intricate commands to really do a good job of being secure a deny first policy and making sure that you optimize things for performance

493
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:40,500
What would make that even better though is if it was on a low power low heat kind of quiet or even totally silent device

494
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,340
Yeah, that's true. I am using a not super powerful

495
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:52,300
But not arm level Celeron chip at the moment which meets my performance needs but does have a big old x86 style case

496
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,620
Well, let's ask drew and cheese. See what see what they're using cheesy

497
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,900
Do you have any particular router or firewall that you've put in or you got the ISP box?

498
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,940
I have a Netgear Nighthawk router that's been flashed with DD WRT

499
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,380
You know when talking about auditing your own network

500
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:14,620
One thing that a lot of consumer routers do by default is they turn on WPS

501
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
by default, which is something you should definitely

502
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,900
disable because

503
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:27,340
You could possibly have your network breached using WPS. And if you're still using web, there's something wrong with you. So

504
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:33,000
All right, drew. What about you? What are you rocking for your home router? Well for my router

505
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,900
I am running an edge router light the ER light 3

506
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,420
It's a few years old now at this point actually, I think like five or six

507
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,500
but it's still rocking great still getting support and

508
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,180
firmware updates and

509
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,020
it's

510
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,180
surprisingly versatile for essentially what is a Debian based router and

511
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:00,060
Then I've got the unify access points and a couple of different spots in my house

512
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,140
I am very impressed that you're sitting around five plus years now with this device

513
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,300
I mean, I think that's the stamp of success right there

514
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:12,460
I wonder how Bruce feels about this because Bruce you've been rolling a traditional Linux firewall since

515
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:18,820
1995 yeah, I was the year I graduated high school and one of my friends had gotten me into Linux and I set up a

516
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:26,100
Free BSD run-of-the-mill bare OS firewall just to do basket rating way back when and I've evolved since then and right now

517
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,820
I'm running PFSense. Okay

518
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:33,340
So what did you like about running a full Linux box as a firewall and why did you switch to PFSense?

519
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:39,180
So two questions there really well originally I just didn't like any of the existing, you know

520
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,700
Firewall things that you would get from an ISP provider or something like that

521
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,980
I wanted something I have control of all that kind of stuff

522
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:50,500
So the normal kind of ideas from you know, our kind of target audience, I guess and switching to PFSense

523
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,860
It was more just you know, generally not having to do IP tables and all that kind of stuff

524
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,860
You know

525
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,300
I have a point-to-point connection for VPN for work

526
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:03,420
Having all the graphing tools and stuff that it has although I'm seeing in the chat that open sense

527
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,740
Sounds pretty good. So I might be checking that out

528
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,280
Haha, yes, the call of open sense. I've heard that song as well

529
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,820
Well, that's interesting and I I think I kind of align with your thinking

530
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,640
We'll have some links in the show notes to fire hole

531
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,860
Of course other things that you're familiar with you can you can probably send us in a few ideas as well

532
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,780
Because there's probably more that we're missing at Linux unplug comm slash

533
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:32,180
Contact I'll do something soon. I'll do something I think for me key things. I want are

534
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:38,460
reliability wire guard at the edge the only place I'd like a gooey to really is just

535
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,500
for setting up simple DNS entries and

536
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:47,600
Maybe static DHCP mappings. That's what I really like about the piehole UI right now

537
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,140
Is it gives me that kind of stuff now, you know, piehole does a pretty good job and it's you know

538
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,540
It's built on top of their own fork of DNS mask

539
00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:01,340
So if you're already familiar with using that which is super handy, especially for doing like split horizon DNS setups

540
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,340
Or just any sort of DNS customization

541
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,660
Well, you can do all that same stuff on piehole either through the gooey or if you want on the command line

542
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,960
They're a couple other things before we get off Wi-Fi

543
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,920
Consider at least two or three Wi-Fi networks West you kind of touched on this

544
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,740
But maybe consider a kids network and IOT network and a guest network

545
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:28,660
And then of course the main production network where your your device is and maybe your spouse or whatever your significant others devices

546
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:34,060
Whoever might be family. I have not done the separate kids network, but after this experience recently

547
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,320
I'm considering it for the QoS X aspect of it

548
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:42,140
But I have done the guest and IOT network and I like that a lot. So for me

549
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,420
I put all those people on two four and it's a separate SSID with a separate password

550
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,020
It's a separate IP space nice

551
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:56,580
The IOT network can't talk to the guest network the guest network can't see any of my automation devices or any of my IOT devices

552
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,060
They just get a route out to the internet and that's it

553
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:05,700
And then I have a production SSID that I connect to that is the LAN that has all the devices that can talk to each

554
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:11,460
Other and I like that a lot. I think it it's a little additional complexity up front

555
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:16,220
But if you just do it in a really clear simple way, it's pretty easy to maintain and easy to explain

556
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,900
Alright, so West Payne's hot VPN tips hot VPN tips, you know

557
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,780
One thing I like doing for myself is if you have access to it at the router

558
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,980
You can set some of those things up so that if you've got multiple devices you need to use on the VPN

559
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:35,260
Well, you can set it up that way right just make sure that you only allow access to the VPN connection

560
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:41,460
Which you've established on your router from those particular devices and you don't have to fiddle with clients on each of those things

561
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,620
Configuring all of that now this could be a security risk

562
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,860
So make sure you've got your firewall configured correctly

563
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:52,660
But it can make things pretty nice and simplify a config where you might want to do something like a split horizon

564
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:59,780
DNS setup where instead of forwarding all your VPN traffic over to work and having everything resolved out that way

565
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:03,020
Well, just send things that you need over that network

566
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,900
And if you use something like DNS mask or many other solutions

567
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:13,820
You can have it so that DNS queries that are meant to be resolved on the VPN network go that way and everything else

568
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:19,260
Just uses your standard resolver that makes for a very slick setup where you don't have to worry that

569
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:24,900
Everything you do is going through the works network or just you know getting that delay some VPNs

570
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:32,460
Also, you know, you can you can specifically say just this IP block and only traffic to this very particular IP block goes over the VPN

571
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:38,260
Not true for all of them though. I think the first couple of times I ever really had a work VPN

572
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,940
It was one of those where there's a client piece

573
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,560
They'd have to install or one of these web things that have to go through like an ActiveX connection

574
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,360
It was the worst and it would just by default do all the traffic

575
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,480
It was just the worst it was always for doctors offices, too. If you are running a VPN

576
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,220
Locally just watch out for IP v6

577
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:04,640
Sometimes you'll get an IP v6 address, which is just totally fine on its own, but you'll have an IP v4 only tunnel configuration

578
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,120
So you'll think all your traffic is going over the tunnel

579
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:14,140
But in fact IP v6 is still going through your local gateway now a big plug again for the self-hosted podcast

580
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:20,900
this is table stakes for that show amongst many other things including running a bunch of services on your LAN and

581

I talk a little bit about more of my server setup in there. You mean just how many pies you have?

582
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,340
Yes, and I think you'd probably really enjoy it if any of this appeals to you

585

I've been primarily listening to other Linux broadcasts in the end in their telegram groups, but I switched to your telegram group in the last two days

Controversy, what could it be? And this is why we're reading this because

587

It seems that the closer we get to WSL to being released and the more software Microsoft open sources

591
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,920
The more hatred against Microsoft. I saw in other Linux groups

592
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,400
Ironically, it made me feel alienated and pushed me towards trying out Windows 10

593
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,960
You know, I can kind of understand that when like when group thing starts to set in I sometimes have like this rebellious

594
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,420
Nerve that just gets pushed on and then I go I rebel against it

595
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,620
but this is something that I said what happened in the post show last week and

596
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:41,400
It definitely bared out like I got a lot of people who are not happy about the way we talk about Microsoft

597
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,880
There has even been

598
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,560
clickbait blog

599
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:50,760
Articles that have been written attacking JB and me for talking about it. I mean, it's pretty intense and

600
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,440
You'll hear so much rhetoric about how this is the worst thing Microsoft has ever done

601
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,720
This is embrace extend and extinguish taken to the next level and it seems to be yet another divide

602
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:06,920
that is developing in our community and that makes me very sad because I

603
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,060
Think every situation with every company

604
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,400
should be taken on its own individual merits and

605
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:21,600
Any commercial company from Red Hat to Microsoft that is participating in this space has to be monitored with a certain level of suspicion

606
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,440
Although maybe that's a little extreme, you know

607
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:32,080
But you have to be aware and paying attention a recognition that they've got their own motives and their you know their own drives

608
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,960
And that's okay

609
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:40,240
That's part of the design of the whole open source ecosystem is that we all have those but we can agree that some things are better

610
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:46,040
Done shared and this truth is applicable to any company whose goal is to earn revenue

611
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,400
We kind of individually apply it in the Linux community

612
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:58,320
There's some groups and companies that get a blank check and really nothing is questioned. And then there's some who

613
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,960
Probably because of past actions. There's just a relentless suspicion now

614
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,760
That of course eventually had to result in

615
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,640
unfortunately division I'm trying to consider how we can

616
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,280
accurately and

617
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,280
level-headedly

618
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,280
cover this stuff without

619
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:23,000
Exaggerating that situation and causing more division and that's something I've been chewing on that I don't have a

620
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,800
Great answer for Michael continues. He says I've been using Linux since 1997

621
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:34,500
But when a community becomes all about hatred of something rather than the love of Linux then you push people away even your own community

622
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,740
I'm so glad that you guys have managed to create a healthy community that does not fall into that trap

623
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:43,460
I mean, I think we're struggling with it too. I wouldn't give us too much credit. We're struggling with it

624
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:48,160
Yeah, absolutely, and I don't know quite what the right answer is here

625
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,200
some of it

626
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,200
Feels like reasonable suspicion and some of it feels silly

627
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,500
The one that feels sort of silly to me is the embrace and extend an extinguished discussion that has cropped up around

628
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,600
Maui and

629
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:10,100
Around DirectX being available on the Windows subsystem for Linux. I think the premise is flawed

630
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:14,340
There's no embrace an extending of something that's never been a success

631
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:20,300
The Linux desktop is not a success that threatens Microsoft. In fact, it's entirely possible that

632
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:28,360
The quote-unquote vast success of the Linux desktop is barely even represented on any Microsoft

633
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:32,120
Market share chart now the server sure mobile. Absolutely

634
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:37,220
IOT yeah a desktop. I think people need a bit of a reality check

635
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:45,040
Microsoft is not embracing and extending the Linux desktop with adding DirectX api's to WSL to only on Windows

636
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,440
The entire premise is silly

637
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:53,600
But yet that doesn't prevent YouTube videos and blogs and people going on Twitter

638
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:58,480
Going on and on about how this is obviously Microsoft trying to extinguish Linux

639
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:06,480
It's a silly premise to begin with there is no threat from the Linux desktop. I'm sorry. I love it, too

640
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:13,540
But it is probably not even statistically measurable by Microsoft on the Windows market share bottom line. Let's be honest

641
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,080
The Mac it's good. Yeah, it gets a few percent

642
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,400
Chromebooks. Yeah, that sucks

643
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,160
Not Linux desktop. We're too busy fighting amongst each other

644
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:29,520
and they were the last thing they're worried about and WSL is absolutely more about taking on the Mac as a

645
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:37,040
Development platform than it is about Linux desktop, but people are so trapped in this bubble. They can't see it

646
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,960
They don't see the bigger picture. It's not some grand conspiracy to keep the Linux desktop down. It was never up

647
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,960
I'm sorry. I love it, too

648
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,920
But it never got up and it's going to be fine

649
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,440
This will just result in more Linux users and it's not going to stop the plasma or gnome shell developers

650
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,880
Certainly not and I mean if anything it's aimed at the success of Linux on the server, right?

651
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,800
It's a recognition that people are using Linux not on the desktop

652
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:09,760
But to deploy their production workloads and that's the world Microsoft wants to cater to yeah, and this isn't a defense of Microsoft

653
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
I think this is a defense of

654
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,640
rational thinking

655
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,960
And taking each individual situation on its own merits and evaluating it

656
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
That's all I'm advocating for

657
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,840
And I I just I plea

658
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,080
for this not to become a divisive issue in the community it would just

659
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,520
There's so many of them. It would just be so nice to have something that doesn't develop into this

660
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,960
We've got enough and a good time to practice acknowledging that

661
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I mean Microsoft has is built up of a

662
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,280
Bunch of people and they've all got their own opinions about open source and there is there is a company line

663
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,240
But I think we've seen how much that has changed even with you know, their president admitting as much

664
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,600
So it's a flexible universe and they are a company

665
00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:00,480
But it's they're made up of people who have different opinions about open source than maybe once they did. What are you?

666
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,240
Yeah, we don't know though, right that it's hard to evaluate how a company change

667
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,040
And over time. Yeah

668
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,120
That is part of it. Here's my pitch

669
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,640
Screw Microsoft. Who cares what Microsoft thinks or feels like?

670
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,240
I don't think that you have to be part of the consideration for the Linux community

671
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,800
It's probably good to do that. But roll with this for a second

672
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:26,320
Forget Microsoft forget what they're trying forget if they're open or forget any of it what the strategy is. Forget all of it

673
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,480
Here's the truth

674
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,920
They're going to be more people using Linux coming into our community

675
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,560
looking to connect with other individuals either for help for inspiration for guidance for mentorship and we should

676
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:45,120
Really try not to blow this we shouldn't let our prejudice and our feelings towards Microsoft, whatever they may be

677
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,840
We shouldn't take that out on these new users

678
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:53,680
We need to be welcoming to new people when they come into this community and show them that it's a collaborative space the true

679
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,160
True open source nature is here

680
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,520
Like you found something that is compelling that maybe draws you in that makes you want to go even further

681
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,080
And if we're just so close to blowing it

682
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:09,360
I think you've seen that with canonical support for Ubuntu on WSL right there. I mean they recognize it as a supported

683
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,800
Platform for their operating system to run on so we should do the same if people are coming in with you know

684
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,160
Questions about things we can't just disqualify them

685
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:24,080
Yes, there might be some caveats, but we shouldn't just outright disqualify them just because they happen to be running Linux on Windows

686
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,520
All right. Well, I never meant to talk about this this long. Michael just got us talking

687
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:34,400
That's what one of the great things about feedback. So my final thoughts on this are and I apologize this turned into such a soapbox. I

688
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,320
Would ask you to see if this all comes from a place of insecurity about Linux's future on the desktop

689
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,640
About the desktop in general about what it has still yet to get to

690
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,080
And if maybe that isn't influencing your reaction

691
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,100
wrapped up in moral superiority or technical advocacy

692
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,880
But the reality the nut of it

693
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,440
Might be insecurity. I know that's a harsh thing to say and a harsh thing to consider about yourself

694
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,600
But I mean people come after me they write articles about me about this stuff

695
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,920
And I think it has to come from someplace deep that is afraid of where this is going and I think that insecurity

696
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,560
while understandable

697
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,160
is misplaced

698
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:20,480
Windows is still Windows and you can try to run it if you're if you've been a longtime Linux or Mac user

699
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,880
You're still not going to find Windows satisfying. It's not going to destroy the Linux desktop. And I

700
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,200
I would encourage us to maybe consider what's driving this defensiveness

701
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,520
And try not to think about it from what's best for Microsoft or best for Linux or what canonical is doing and try to think

702
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,640
About it from here come the users. How can we make them successful? How can we welcome them to the community?

703
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,360
Yeah, really our goal is to convince them that Linux is a useful technology. They should be excited about learning

704
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:52,160
Yeah, and there's a community behind it that makes it kind of fun and and maybe something that the windows and commercial platforms

705
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,120
Don't really have in fact, I'd say they're kind of envious of

706
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,920
Come on over the water's fine

707
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,480
Most of the time in the right areas, maybe don't use butter fs

708
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,960
It's too soon less

709
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,400
It's too soon

710
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,360
All right. Well, that is it for this week's episode of the unplug program

711
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,200
We'd love to have you live next week because probably the week after that I'm going to be on the road

712
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,320
So if you want to make it to a live show, it's going to be one of your last chances Tuesday

713
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,880
At noon pacific jupyterbroadcasting.com

714
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:24,240
Slash calendar to get that converted in your time. Don't forget about the love plug on sunday coming up

715
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,180
We'd love to have you there and links to everything we talked about at linuxunplug.com

716
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:42,280
Slash 355 the show is at linuxunplugged on twitter at jupyter signal for the network. We'll see you back here next tuesday

717
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,420
So

718
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,140
No computer kid just no live shows while i'm driving to and from texas

719
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:27,540
No, you we're gonna miss it twice. You said we would never miss anymore. Oh, don't worry

720
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:32,660
It'll be like we were never gone for the download audience. I'm not the download audience. Well, you will be
