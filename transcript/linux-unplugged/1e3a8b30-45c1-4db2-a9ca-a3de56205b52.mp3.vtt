00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
There's one story I've seen going around more than any other this week, and it's the announcement

00:06.960 --> 00:13.560
of a new project that promises to create a Linux-compatible kernel completely written

00:13.560 --> 00:14.960
in Rust.

00:14.960 --> 00:19.960
The aim is not to replace Linux, but to create something written from scratch that aims to

00:19.960 --> 00:20.960
be ABI-compatible.

00:20.960 --> 00:26.840
In other words, it would support running unmodified Linux binaries.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.840
Wes, I think you're a little skeptical pants about this one.

00:29.840 --> 00:30.840
Oh, no.

00:30.840 --> 00:31.840
I don't know about that.

00:31.840 --> 00:36.820
I think what I like about this project is it's intentionally limited in scope.

00:36.820 --> 00:40.280
The project author is really just trying to make something that's Linux-compatible but

00:40.280 --> 00:46.000
that can run in a function-as-a-service runtime environment, actually using Firecracker VMs,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
also written in Rust.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.720
And so, you know, you don't have to worry about things like kernel crashes because it's

00:51.720 --> 00:54.160
not doing long-running workloads.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.840
That doesn't sound impossible, does it?

00:56.840 --> 01:01.920
I actually was thinking of this as more like a tiny VM environment host, our guest kind

01:01.920 --> 01:07.000
of a thing, or container runtime environment that's just this itty-bitty environment that's

01:07.000 --> 01:08.120
binary-compatible.

01:08.120 --> 01:14.200
But I liked that the motivation was the conversation around how could we use Rust in the Linux

01:14.200 --> 01:15.660
kernel?

01:15.660 --> 01:20.000
That kind of evolved into inspiration for this project to say, okay, well, let's take

01:20.000 --> 01:21.720
this all the way.

01:21.720 --> 01:26.360
And it seems like the exact kind of thing that Free Software lends itself to, where

01:26.360 --> 01:30.840
you can have just these, it's not, this isn't necessarily a fork, but you can have these

01:30.840 --> 01:35.600
side projects that may never really ship, may never go into production anywhere, may

01:35.600 --> 01:40.040
never even be a container runtime or a VM guest OS.

01:40.040 --> 01:45.040
But it can be an R&D factory for things that do actually make it in the mainline Linux

01:45.040 --> 01:46.040
kernel.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.400
Yeah, it teaches the person working on this, any contributors, and anyone along for the

01:49.400 --> 01:53.160
ride, you know, like, what does or doesn't work about doing it this way?

01:53.160 --> 01:58.080
And maybe it informs both future operating systems and the Rust language itself.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.520
Now, it is very, very early days.

02:00.520 --> 02:04.720
This isn't gonna, you know, this isn't gonna be like something you're gonna have some weird

02:04.720 --> 02:09.000
distro Frankenstein thing with, with this kernel, which I think is BSD licensed, like

02:09.000 --> 02:11.160
this isn't happening anytime soon.

02:11.160 --> 02:20.040
But I'll tell you what, if it does start to happen, we're gonna give it a go.

02:20.040 --> 02:27.040
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.040
My name is Chris.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.040
My name is Wes.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.040
And my name is Brent.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.280
Hello, you two.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.400
This episode is brought to you by the all new a cloud guru.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.120
You know, they are the leader in learning for the cloud Linux and other modern tech

02:36.120 --> 02:37.120
skills.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.440
They got hundreds of courses and 1000s of hands on labs get certified get hired get

02:40.440 --> 02:47.700
learning at a cloud guru.com Well, coming up on the show today, it's fedora 35 release

02:47.700 --> 02:50.700
day and we're making a whole theme out of it.

02:50.700 --> 02:54.880
We're gonna have a project check in with Matthew Miller.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.000
He's gonna tell us what's going on over there.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.160
We're then going to do our exit interview with fedora 34.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.480
We had an opportunity to give it a spin later in its lifecycle.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.980
And it's a totally different fedora.

03:05.980 --> 03:10.640
So I want to have that chat and then it's our review of fedora 35 will tell you what's

03:10.640 --> 03:14.200
new, what's different, what works, what doesn't work.

03:14.200 --> 03:18.240
And then we'll round out the show with some great emails, some pics, some follow up, you

03:18.240 --> 03:20.000
know, all that kind of stuff that we do.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.880
So before I go any further, I have to say time appropriate greetings, mumble room Hello

03:23.880 --> 03:24.880
virtual lug.

03:24.880 --> 03:25.880
Hello.

03:25.880 --> 03:30.320
Man, hello, everybody.

03:30.320 --> 03:33.680
It's nice to be back in the studio this week.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.680
Everything's back to normal.

03:34.680 --> 03:35.680
I'm no longer in the woods.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.720
I don't even think it's raining right now.

03:37.720 --> 03:38.720
You're right.

03:38.720 --> 03:39.720
It finally stopped.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.660
Oh, man, that's been nice, although it was raining on the drive in.

03:42.660 --> 03:44.960
So it's really only stopped while I'm in here.

03:44.960 --> 03:50.600
But that aside, I mean, the weather does suck, but I kind of have I kind of have an idea.

03:50.600 --> 03:55.120
Maybe this is stupid with with it getting close to the holidays and all of that.

03:55.120 --> 04:02.080
But there is an opportunity at the Museum of Flight here in the Seattle area to go see

04:02.080 --> 04:06.040
the new Mars rover and the Linux copter, you know, like their clones.

04:06.040 --> 04:09.840
They have a whole Mars set up right now at the Museum of Flight.

04:09.840 --> 04:13.680
And I thought, you know, maybe, maybe some in the audience might be interested in like

04:13.680 --> 04:17.080
a little micro meetup at the Museum of Flight where we go check this thing out.

04:17.080 --> 04:18.080
I don't know.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.080
What do you think?

04:19.080 --> 04:20.080
I'm in.

04:20.080 --> 04:21.080
All right.

04:21.080 --> 04:22.080
Sign me up.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.080
Yeah, you go.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.080
You go.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.080
I mean, we can't go to Mars yet.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.080
I don't I don't think Starship is ready.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.080
This seems like the next best thing.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.080
Yeah.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.080
Yeah.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.560
That would be nice one day to be able to go visit Mars and see the Linux copter.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.560
What a thought.

04:31.560 --> 04:34.800
I haven't really thought it all through yet, but here's what I do know.

04:34.800 --> 04:40.440
The copter and the rover will be there October 30th, so they're there now through April

04:40.440 --> 04:41.440
3rd, 2022.

04:41.440 --> 04:45.800
And I think maybe we should pick something in there sooner than later with the holidays.

04:45.800 --> 04:50.440
But let me know if you'd like to go and do a little micro meetup at the Museum of Flight

04:50.440 --> 04:55.680
Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact or the Jupiter broadcasting telegram group, Jupiter

04:55.680 --> 04:59.840
broadcasting dot com slash telegram or on Twitter at Chris Elias.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.800
Let me know if you'd be interested in a little hyper local meetup.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.240
I know this doesn't apply to ninety nine percent of you out there, but what an opportunity.

05:07.240 --> 05:11.080
I thought if some of us got together and went down there, Wes and I could bring our microphones,

05:11.080 --> 05:13.640
we could capture a little bit of it and we'd share it with you guys.

05:13.640 --> 05:17.320
So it kind of be like you went.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.040
But I don't really have any other details than that.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.720
I guess I've been back for what, two months and I'm jonesing for a meetup again already.

05:23.720 --> 05:29.200
I guess that's how long it takes to get back from the woods and I'm ready to see people.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.200
I guess that's a good thing.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.200
Well, I think it speaks well of our audience.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.200
Yeah.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.200
So let me know.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.480
Contact page is probably the best place.

05:36.480 --> 05:41.360
And once I hear from a few people, if I even hear from I'd say four or five people, really,

05:41.360 --> 05:42.360
it doesn't need to be a lot.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.920
It's just enough for like, you know, like a lunch crew so we can we can share all our

05:45.920 --> 05:46.920
fun learnings.

05:46.920 --> 05:52.240
Although I have to say, I'm a little upset because just about every week I get an email

05:52.240 --> 05:57.040
from somebody in the, quote unquote, Seattle area and I'm like, how come I've never met

05:57.040 --> 05:58.160
you?

05:58.160 --> 05:59.960
Why have you never been to anything we've done?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.160
Why don't you go to Linux Fest?

06:01.160 --> 06:07.080
Like there's a lot of people who listen in the West Coast area, secret Seattle JB fans

06:07.080 --> 06:08.080
out there.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.080
What are you doing?

06:09.080 --> 06:10.500
I think they're all hanging out with you downtown.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.500
That's what I think.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.500
And you guys just aren't sharing.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.500
But that's fine.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.500
That's fine.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.500
Well, I mean, we already had a crew.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.500
There's a lot to invite you.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.500
I'm so far away.

06:17.500 --> 06:21.160
You know, you got to wait like a half hour.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.160
Think of Levi.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.160
That's true.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.160
That's true.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.160
That is a good point.

06:25.160 --> 06:29.640
Well, this is our Fedora episode and we wanted to have a little project check in with Matthew

06:29.640 --> 06:30.640
Miller.

06:30.640 --> 06:35.000
He's the project leader, perhaps maybe better known as the real beefy miracle.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.760
Matthew, welcome back to Linux Unplugged.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.440
Hey, glad to be here.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.120
And thank you very much for taking the time to join us on release day.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.720
Yeah, absolutely.

06:43.720 --> 06:46.320
It's a little chaotic, but you know, I got some time.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.800
Well, we appreciate it.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.080
And we've been checking out the new release and I want to get there.

06:51.080 --> 06:57.400
But you know, trying out the last several releases of Fedora, I really felt like this

06:57.400 --> 07:06.920
trend picked up momentum in 33, then 34 brought us GNOME 40, now 35 is bringing us Wire Plumber

07:06.920 --> 07:08.920
and GNOME 41.

07:08.920 --> 07:13.200
Where I sit and having watched this stuff for a long time, I think there was a period

07:13.200 --> 07:17.920
of time where Ubuntu was really setting the tone for the desktop.

07:17.920 --> 07:22.760
And I feel like the transition of that baton has been completed with the last several releases

07:22.760 --> 07:28.840
of Fedora, and now it really feels to me like Fedora is leading the direction of future

07:28.840 --> 07:30.760
desktop Linux.

07:30.760 --> 07:35.200
And people are looking to the Fedora project to see what direction things are going in.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.840
And as a result of that, I think we're seeing some better traction with things like Wayland

07:38.840 --> 07:42.200
and PipeWire and the entire ecosystem is improving as a result of that.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.880
And I think it contributes to that momentum.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.720
And I'm curious if you see this from where you're sitting at in the project and what

07:48.720 --> 07:53.000
your, or maybe you think I'm wrong, but just what your observations are about this trend.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.480
I'll take it.

07:54.480 --> 08:00.160
I think people in Fedora have been working on these things for quite a long time, longer

08:00.160 --> 08:02.040
than that.

08:02.040 --> 08:05.920
I won't speak bad about the other Linux distributions at all.

08:05.920 --> 08:09.080
I'm going to try to just completely avoid the comparison.

08:09.080 --> 08:15.160
But I think it's often the case that we've had a hard time getting those out to users

08:15.160 --> 08:16.200
in a timely fashion.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.720
We struggled with meeting our own schedule for a while.

08:19.720 --> 08:24.920
And despite a one week delay this time, it's fine.

08:24.920 --> 08:29.480
We've really been meeting our six month schedules really reliably, which helps.

08:29.480 --> 08:33.880
And we've been doing a better job about kind of talking about the things we've done.

08:33.880 --> 08:38.000
There's been a lot of cases where people working in Fedora, people in the Red Hat desktop team

08:38.000 --> 08:44.040
like actually made stuff that ended up being headline features in other distros first.

08:44.040 --> 08:48.080
So we're actually getting it out and talking about it sooner.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.120
So I think that's part of it.

08:49.120 --> 08:54.800
I think that we generally have a lot of new positive growing enthusiasm and energy around

08:54.800 --> 08:56.640
Fedora as a project overall.

08:56.640 --> 09:02.240
And I think that reflects in what both the actual technical output of all the people

09:02.240 --> 09:06.480
working on it and just kind of all the polish around it that goes into making a release

09:06.480 --> 09:09.720
and then in delivering a good experience to everybody.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.400
So I'll get to my experience in a bit.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.040
But while we're on this kind of trend line here, I'm curious if you can fill in the details

09:15.040 --> 09:18.520
on how something like the following will work for Fedora.

09:18.520 --> 09:23.520
So I've been noticing that Red Hat's been making a lot of significant hires that are

09:23.520 --> 09:27.480
going to have a big impact on future desktop features at some point.

09:27.480 --> 09:31.080
You know, I mean, it's very early because they're just opening the positions.

09:31.080 --> 09:37.000
But I've recently seen positions open for HDR support on Linux.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.640
I've seen more positions open for improving 3D and Vulkan and video.

09:41.640 --> 09:48.320
I've seen hiring in all kinds of areas that are really like the low plumbing of desktop

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
Linux.

09:49.320 --> 09:54.040
And the Red Hat hires, but that work that's going to be developed, that must be happening

09:54.040 --> 09:55.040
in Fedora.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.040
Is that correct?

09:56.040 --> 10:00.560
Actually, generally, that work, we try to make it happen as far upstream as possible

10:00.560 --> 10:06.160
because it's the right thing to do and it's less work for Red Hat really in the long run,

10:06.160 --> 10:09.240
even if it sometimes feels like harder work up front.

10:09.240 --> 10:13.880
So a lot of that work actually will go into the upstream projects and then kind of by

10:13.880 --> 10:18.680
its nature, but also because the same people are working on it, we then try and bring those

10:18.680 --> 10:23.040
things into Fedora as features pretty quickly and soon.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.240
And it obviously helps when it's the same person working on the thing in an upstream

10:26.240 --> 10:28.800
and in the project itself.

10:28.800 --> 10:32.280
So like the pipewire stuff, I think is a good example of that.

10:32.280 --> 10:36.200
I wonder if you felt like I did over the summer as I saw these positions.

10:36.200 --> 10:41.200
I counted it up for Linux Action News a few weeks ago and I think it was like seven new

10:41.200 --> 10:44.580
positions that have been opened and since then, there's like another position.

10:44.580 --> 10:46.320
So I think in total, it's like eight positions.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.320
It just keeps going.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.320
Yeah.

10:48.320 --> 10:53.000
I saw that as, you know, there's been a lot of talk of post IBM acquisition.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
What's it mean for Fedora?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.200
What's it mean for some of their free software contributions that contribute upstream and

10:57.200 --> 11:01.080
some of us worried it could mean like the bean counters are going to get involved and

11:01.080 --> 11:04.040
dial that stuff down and we're now several years into this now.

11:04.040 --> 11:09.280
And it seems like there's actually increasing investment in this stuff that doesn't directly

11:09.280 --> 11:12.120
translate to a rail product.

11:12.120 --> 11:16.120
I mean, I acknowledge there is rail workstation and all that, but you know, I'm getting that

11:16.120 --> 11:20.920
like it feels like this is this is the actual walk that is matching the talk.

11:20.920 --> 11:21.920
Yeah.

11:21.920 --> 11:26.360
Some of that I got a very carefully bracket with, like I can't speak to IBM business or

11:26.360 --> 11:27.360
anything.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.640
I have no idea, let alone like even even if I knew I couldn't.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.720
But actually, the case is, I don't even know.

11:32.720 --> 11:38.000
And my question really is about is, does this feel to you like the real kind of validation

11:38.000 --> 11:40.960
that there is going to be continued investment here from just a personal feeling?

11:40.960 --> 11:41.960
Yeah.

11:41.960 --> 11:42.960
So, right.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.920
So, yeah, I can speak as a person and an employee.

11:44.920 --> 11:48.320
I think, you know, a lot of us at Red Hat were worried about this acquisition, what

11:48.320 --> 11:49.640
would happen.

11:49.640 --> 11:53.880
But we were assured at the time that, you know, well, like that was really important

11:53.880 --> 11:56.120
to them and they wanted to continue to invest in it.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.480
It wasn't it was not an extract money thing.

11:59.480 --> 12:03.920
I think we kind of see some validation in the spin off of Kindle.

12:03.920 --> 12:07.880
I don't know how much big boring business news you follow, but that's happening like

12:07.880 --> 12:13.440
this week, which is like the IBM managed service stuff is basically going away.

12:13.440 --> 12:18.520
So Red Hat is going to be a bigger chunk of the new IBM than it ever was before.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.880
So it's really significant.

12:20.880 --> 12:26.720
So yeah, Red Hat real success is very important to the future of IBM.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.680
And I think we're seeing that borne out.

12:29.680 --> 12:34.320
Another thing that's going on here, there's actually a lot of these things you're seeing

12:34.320 --> 12:39.880
are desktop related technologies, but they're actually hires related to an automotive initiative,

12:39.880 --> 12:44.120
which you'll see automotive keywords and a lot of these hires as well.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.480
And I don't have a lot of the details on that, but it is connected into things that

12:47.480 --> 12:53.320
are, you know, useful on the desktop, but also useful in other contexts as well.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.760
And, you know, the more we can find things that tie all these things together, the more

12:57.760 --> 12:58.760
we all benefit.

12:58.760 --> 13:04.440
It's funny, Wes and I were just kind of remarking about that off air yesterday that even some

13:04.440 --> 13:08.960
of the work in the pipeline is about to enable AV in automotive Linux.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.640
Yeah, exactly.

13:10.640 --> 13:11.880
And then that benefits us all.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.720
So yeah, that's awesome.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.240
I'm down for that, right?

13:15.240 --> 13:20.160
Like I think that's actually been one of the low key brilliant things about desktop Linux

13:20.160 --> 13:25.380
that we underappreciate is how we have been able to leverage where the business is willing

13:25.380 --> 13:28.520
to invest to also enrich the desktop and benefit from that.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.960
It's just like the next level of shared infrastructure, right?

13:30.960 --> 13:33.600
The kernel is doing that and the desktop is trying to do that, too.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
Yeah.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.120
Maybe Fedora is the king at that, really.

13:36.120 --> 13:38.000
Yeah, I hope so.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.880
Yeah, I think so, maybe.

13:40.880 --> 13:47.480
So this is, okay, so this is release day of Fedora 35 and GNOME 41 is in here.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.960
Fedora is going to be out ahead with GNOME 41 for a while.

13:50.960 --> 13:54.280
But when you look at the release overall, Matthew, I'm kind of curious, just personally

13:54.280 --> 13:57.200
as a longtime Fedora user, what's jumping out to you?

13:57.200 --> 14:01.320
So yeah, on the desktop, I switched to it when the beta hit.

14:01.320 --> 14:04.640
So I have to remember back to what's new.

14:04.640 --> 14:09.160
But I really do feel like this is a really like a polished release and not in a bad way

14:09.160 --> 14:14.600
where GNOME 40 had a lot of changes and then there's a lot of things that are responding

14:14.600 --> 14:16.400
to people's feedback about that.

14:16.400 --> 14:21.080
Like one of the things that's a big change that I appreciate is there's a setting for

14:21.080 --> 14:26.760
the multi-monitor workspaces now that wasn't there originally.

14:26.760 --> 14:30.360
And also a lot of little things like that were looked at and addressed, I think like

14:30.360 --> 14:34.160
the new power settings, things like those are some nice things that kind of build on

14:34.160 --> 14:38.600
features in GNOME 40 before, so I'm glad to see those things.

14:38.600 --> 14:42.360
I think there's also a lot of exciting things going on in the project, like the Fedora Cloud

14:42.360 --> 14:47.160
work in group is really energized and I was looking at the Fedora Linux 34 statistics

14:47.160 --> 14:53.560
and we have something like 15% of Fedora systems are Fedora Cloud when you look at systems

14:53.560 --> 14:57.800
that are installed over a period of time.

14:57.800 --> 15:03.160
So we don't track individual systems, but we have a thing where systems by default will

15:03.160 --> 15:06.360
report in once a week just with a count me.

15:06.360 --> 15:11.840
And so we can tell if a system, and there's no UID or anything attached to it, so we can't

15:11.840 --> 15:15.320
actually tell which systems they are, but we can kind of get a difference between the

15:15.320 --> 15:19.340
number of systems that just show up once, like test systems and so on, or systems that

15:19.340 --> 15:21.240
show up beyond that.

15:21.240 --> 15:26.640
So of those test systems, 30% of them are Fedora Cloud and like another big chunk of

15:26.640 --> 15:29.380
them are Fedora Container, not surprising.

15:29.380 --> 15:34.520
So it's interesting to see like how much non-desktop use is going on in Fedora as well,

15:34.520 --> 15:40.560
which I think is important because, okay, I was talking about that Synergy and Synergy

15:40.560 --> 15:43.980
is a terrible business word, but just that like thing we get when we've got lots of

15:43.980 --> 15:47.520
different things working together in the same project.

15:47.520 --> 15:52.920
If we were to become just a desktop OS, it's kind of harder to get all of the investment

15:52.920 --> 15:57.440
from Red Hat, but from everybody who has all these different interests working together

15:57.440 --> 16:00.260
in one thing that lists everything.

16:00.260 --> 16:04.680
So I think it's exciting to see, even though the cloud stuff isn't desktop focused, I think

16:04.680 --> 16:09.840
it will help lift up desktop Fedora and just like the enthusiasm around desktop Fedora

16:09.840 --> 16:15.720
and GNOME and so on kind of helps, I think, support that enthusiasm around our cloud offering

16:15.720 --> 16:16.720
as well.

16:16.720 --> 16:20.280
That wouldn't even be there if the desktop weren't there and people were not paying attention

16:20.280 --> 16:21.280
to that.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.400
So I think it all works together really nicely.

16:22.400 --> 16:27.780
Well, you can see that maybe with cloud shipping, ButterFS as the default file system now, right?

16:27.780 --> 16:29.920
After kind of having proven itself over on the workstation.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.960
Yeah, yeah, great.

16:31.960 --> 16:32.960
Exactly that.

16:32.960 --> 16:33.960
That's exactly what I was thinking, Wes.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.560
I wonder if some of that adoption is because of that ButterFS switch.

16:37.560 --> 16:41.840
I've never really thought about it in the use case of like on a VPS, but I actually

16:41.840 --> 16:44.800
now that I'm working through that, I could actually see the logic.

16:44.800 --> 16:49.520
Just like the data integrity stuff, I appreciate that from my photo collection, right?

16:49.520 --> 16:54.200
Like I want to know if some bit rot flipped, like that's important.

16:54.200 --> 16:59.240
And you like the send receive stuff is pretty nice as well for server uses.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.240
Yep.

17:00.240 --> 17:04.960
So I just overall I just wanted to this isn't really a question so much as I just wanted

17:04.960 --> 17:11.320
to pass along how impressed I was at how complete the arm ISO felt.

17:11.320 --> 17:16.920
This is the first opportunity I've ever had to download an ISO image of a Fedora arm release.

17:16.920 --> 17:21.640
Usually it's like I get an image file and I flash that to an SD card and I've never

17:21.640 --> 17:25.720
really gone through like the complete process like I would for a real x86 computer is how

17:25.720 --> 17:31.160
I put it where I get an ISO image and I run through the actual installer and I installed

17:31.160 --> 17:36.640
it on a computer, but I had a chance to run it in an arm VM and I don't think people would

17:36.640 --> 17:37.640
in fact.

17:37.640 --> 17:41.760
In fact, now that I think about it, my son didn't even realize he was on arm Linux at

17:41.760 --> 17:42.760
people.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.760
You just wouldn't know.

17:43.760 --> 17:48.840
It feels like a very complete implementation and you maniacs have all kinds of architectures

17:48.840 --> 17:49.840
you support.

17:49.840 --> 17:53.960
When I go and look in the in those download folders, I'm just amazed at the amount of

17:53.960 --> 17:55.680
ISOs you must be spinning out.

17:55.680 --> 17:56.680
Yeah.

17:56.680 --> 18:04.200
If you have an S390 mainframe, IBM Z, we've got you covered.

18:04.200 --> 18:12.280
I know some people who have power system workstations, is it a laptop, the Talos system?

18:12.280 --> 18:20.720
I've never actually seen one, but yeah, what you were saying, this has actually been somewhat

18:20.720 --> 18:24.760
hard for Fedora because this has always been our aspiration.

18:24.760 --> 18:29.520
When we have another architecture, we want to make it an equal thing and make it, like

18:29.520 --> 18:32.720
you said, you don't need to know you're in a different architecture.

18:32.720 --> 18:37.560
You get the full, powerful, complete operating system.

18:37.560 --> 18:45.200
Some of this stuff where other distributions have been content to have specialized kernels

18:45.200 --> 18:49.960
and stripped down versions, which there's nothing wrong with that.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.120
It's just a different approach.

18:52.120 --> 18:56.240
Sometimes we've been behind because we're not able to get everything out so quickly

18:56.240 --> 18:58.840
because we want it to be so complete.

18:58.840 --> 19:04.480
But then the final result, when it gets there, is you have an amazing, fully functional operating

19:04.480 --> 19:08.240
system that you can know and understand and treat like something else.

19:08.240 --> 19:13.320
ARM is now, I think there's the RISC-V stuff, which is pretty interesting.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.760
I'm talking to a lot of people about that as an emerging architecture.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.160
I'm not going to pick any winners, but I find it really fascinating.

19:21.160 --> 19:26.720
It's basically an open hardware implementation, open source hardware, and there's a lot of

19:26.720 --> 19:28.640
enthusiasm around that.

19:28.640 --> 19:32.680
That's not an official Fedora architecture right now, but there are some unofficial builds

19:32.680 --> 19:39.680
of it, and we're looking at bringing that on maybe at least as a shadow architecture

19:39.680 --> 19:42.520
and then maybe official sometime in the next few years.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.160
I think that's pretty cool.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.520
That is really exciting.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.520
I love to hear that.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.440
I love that you just got your eye on it.

19:48.440 --> 19:54.680
Well, Matthew, will you please relay our congratulations and our gratitude to the entire Fedora community?

19:54.680 --> 19:58.380
They've created another fantastic release, and thank you for taking some time to come

19:58.380 --> 19:59.380
join us.

19:59.380 --> 20:00.380
Yeah, absolutely.

20:00.380 --> 20:03.000
And I'll be very interested in hearing what your experiences are.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.320
So I'm going to run off and do some other things, but I'm going to listen to that later

20:06.320 --> 20:07.860
when I get a chance.

20:07.860 --> 20:11.480
Thank you very much.

20:11.480 --> 20:12.480
Leno.com slash unplugged.

20:12.480 --> 20:17.560
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you support the show, right?

20:17.560 --> 20:21.080
Just like saying, hey, thanks for supporting my favorite Linux podcast.

20:21.080 --> 20:25.240
It's really what makes this work is you guys go there and Linode is willing to offer you

20:25.240 --> 20:26.760
something pretty substantial in exchange.

20:26.760 --> 20:31.080
I mean, $100 that says go try it and go form a real opinion, right?

20:31.080 --> 20:33.240
Like they could give you $15 of credit.

20:33.240 --> 20:37.200
You could start to get a first impression, but they're giving you $100 to really go try

20:37.200 --> 20:38.200
this thing.

20:38.200 --> 20:42.920
They've been around for 18 years making this the best way to run applications on Linux.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.020
If it runs on Linux, you can run it on Linode.

20:46.020 --> 20:50.000
They are our infrastructure, and I suppose I could go get locked into one of the big

20:50.000 --> 20:55.140
huge hyperscalers who has a totally custom weird system.

20:55.140 --> 21:01.280
And I could just just spend money like crazy as people download podcasts, or I could go

21:01.280 --> 21:07.760
like buy some rack space somewhere and some colo, but I mean, that almost feels like caveman

21:07.760 --> 21:08.760
stuff.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.920
Like that's what we did back in the 90s, right?

21:10.920 --> 21:15.720
I mean, and when you look at Linode's pricing, it's 30 to 50% cheaper than any of those hyperscalers

21:15.720 --> 21:19.640
and you're going to get $100 from our offer to actually really try it out.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.400
It's a great way to try out new projects too as things come along.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.080
It's like my R&D place for sure.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.880
It's when you look at the invoice that comes in, like some months there's like all these

21:28.880 --> 21:31.760
weird R&D servers that come on the next month, they're all gone.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.700
And I'm just kind of messing around with stuff all the time.

21:33.700 --> 21:39.720
But I also noticed in the news today that Zoom announced the free versions of Zoom are

21:39.720 --> 21:45.560
going to get ads now, yay, ads in your Zoom meetings.

21:45.560 --> 21:51.800
And this is maybe just one of those windows of opportunity where you can say, hey, y'all,

21:51.800 --> 21:55.240
would you rather switch to something free that we can host ourselves and have control

21:55.240 --> 21:56.240
over?

21:56.240 --> 21:58.600
Because Linode's got a one click deployment for Jitsi.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.400
This could be your window of opportunity.

22:00.400 --> 22:04.840
You get the $100 credit, you deploy that thing, $100 means y'all could try that out for a

22:04.840 --> 22:07.460
while and not have to pay a dime.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.760
They also have lots of other one click deployments or you can go the whole DIY route.

22:10.760 --> 22:16.440
I mean, like nuke and pave and build up your own thing, like I have a crazy esoteric VPN

22:16.440 --> 22:19.120
distro for my PEP wave on Linode.

22:19.120 --> 22:24.320
My peplink router and it has this crazy combo LTE VPN.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.800
And of course, they have their own Linux distribution.

22:25.800 --> 22:29.480
Well, wouldn't you know it, Linode has so many great guides and tutorials, they've even

22:29.480 --> 22:31.640
got a guide on how to do that kind of thing.

22:31.640 --> 22:35.680
And they have super fast networking, incredibly fast rigs, they've just upgraded their MVME

22:35.680 --> 22:36.680
storage.

22:36.680 --> 22:41.080
They're just blazing fast and they support a lot of community projects.

22:41.080 --> 22:44.160
And they've made things like our Jupiter colony reunion road trip possible.

22:44.160 --> 22:48.180
I doubt that made them a ton of money, right?

22:48.180 --> 22:52.240
It's expensive to drive lady jips, but they wanted to make that community connection.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.000
They brought out their own people too.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.800
They were hanging out with us.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.080
It was pretty cool and it's pretty neat to see them do that kind of stuff.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.200
They don't have to do that kind of thing.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.080
So go sign up today and try it out.

23:02.080 --> 23:07.000
Linode.com slash unplugged get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account and your support

23:07.000 --> 23:12.800
in this here show Linode.com slash unplugged.

23:12.800 --> 23:18.920
All right, before we get to Fedora 35, all the hype, all the new things, let's conduct

23:18.920 --> 23:21.840
a Fedora 34 exit interview.

23:21.840 --> 23:26.120
This is something we'd like to do more of something like a chance to follow up on a

23:26.120 --> 23:28.760
distro a little later in its release cycle.

23:28.760 --> 23:33.940
And we should be clear about this too, just because 35 is out doesn't mean Fedora 34 is

23:33.940 --> 23:34.940
going anywhere.

23:34.940 --> 23:38.560
It's going to be with us for a bit longer.

23:38.560 --> 23:43.220
Actually the end of life is scheduled for May 17th, 2022.

23:43.220 --> 23:47.920
So let's see if you're a regular Fedora day to day user and you're not quite ready to

23:47.920 --> 23:51.440
try out 35, which just lands today.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.080
What's life like for you right now?

23:53.080 --> 23:57.200
Yeah, I recently had a chance to give Fedora 34 a go.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.880
And kind of like Matthew was saying, I never do this.

24:00.880 --> 24:06.400
I'm always trying out Fedora as it hits the beta cycle, that I really kind of get serious

24:06.400 --> 24:10.220
as it firms up and what you could kind of consider the RC phase.

24:10.220 --> 24:13.520
And then I'm always doing like fresh installs of the actual released version and I'm doing

24:13.520 --> 24:18.760
upgrades to the newly released version and I'm always kind of in that mode of Fedora's

24:18.760 --> 24:21.600
life cycle and I kind of live there.

24:21.600 --> 24:28.560
I almost never ever go back to a late stage distro, if you will, somehow you've moved

24:28.560 --> 24:29.560
on already.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.440
Yeah, I just don't normally have a reason to.

24:32.440 --> 24:37.560
But I've been thinking recently about how it'd be nice to move my son and then if that

24:37.560 --> 24:43.000
works for him, my daughters over to Fedora because then they'd be on what I'm using.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.920
I want to be able to recommend Fedora to friends and family, but I didn't feel like I could.

24:47.920 --> 24:54.520
And so I wanted to try giving a slightly older version a go and see if that changed my experience

24:54.520 --> 24:59.640
and what it might be for somebody who might have, like my son, a more gaming focused desktop

24:59.640 --> 25:00.640
setup.

25:00.640 --> 25:01.640
Yeah, that's a good question.

25:01.640 --> 25:06.320
Like what does the support life cycle of a Fedora family member actually look like?

25:06.320 --> 25:12.400
But beyond that, I think Fedora 34 in particular, it just had a lot of changes going on and

25:12.400 --> 25:18.420
something of an elephant in the room because when it landed, we were kind of still reassuring

25:18.420 --> 25:24.840
people that Fedora was OK after all the big CentOS news, plus GNOME 40 had just shipped

25:24.840 --> 25:29.380
and was brand new and had a ton of changes that were quite controversial.

25:29.380 --> 25:31.800
And we were switching to pipeline by default.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.640
And all of this was going to be the base for RHEL 9.

25:34.640 --> 25:38.960
I mean, it was just it was a lot of neat stuff and a lot to be excited about, but also a

25:38.960 --> 25:42.640
lot of stuff that had to be tested and maybe had some questions around it.

25:42.640 --> 25:43.640
Yeah.

25:43.640 --> 25:47.000
And so many like GNOME extensions were broken.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.880
PipeWire was causing issues for people that were joining like Zoom meetings.

25:51.880 --> 25:55.640
And so the question was, is what is this going to be like after things shake out?

25:55.640 --> 25:59.640
So we're six months into its life cycle now, pretty much right on the nose.

25:59.640 --> 26:05.160
And I did an update of a Fedora 34 install I did today, just a regular update.

26:05.160 --> 26:09.280
And yeah, sure enough, you know, there's still every few days fresh packages.

26:09.280 --> 26:13.240
In fact, I have to say, because they keep the kernel current and they keep pretty much

26:13.240 --> 26:17.520
everything else current, except for really they just iterate on the desktop environment.

26:17.520 --> 26:24.160
And up to date, Fedora 34 install right now, even as 35 releases, still feels quite modern

26:24.160 --> 26:26.400
in just about every way.

26:26.400 --> 26:32.480
But the thing that's kind of nice now is just about all the critical, if you will, for lack

26:32.480 --> 26:37.800
of a better term, GNOME extensions have caught up to GNOME 40 now.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.560
So the situation there is a lot better.

26:40.560 --> 26:47.040
And I noticed a significant improvement for third party software for Fedora 34.

26:47.040 --> 26:53.000
Like you can go find prepackaged RPMs for Fedora 34 for like a commercial application

26:53.000 --> 26:57.600
or a popular open source app, or they'll have their repository already updated.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
Yeah, exactly.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.880
All those things that you're kind of understanding when you're trying out the beta because of

27:01.880 --> 27:03.120
course they don't have support yet.

27:03.120 --> 27:06.240
And then, oh, yeah, eventually they do update.

27:06.240 --> 27:11.200
And the other thing too, Wes, is like a lot of the guides are just not all of them.

27:11.200 --> 27:15.200
Some of them are still horribly outdated, but a lot of guides have been refreshed for

27:15.200 --> 27:17.320
the new version of Fedora.

27:17.320 --> 27:19.960
And so by that point, six months into it, like if somebody is going to update their

27:19.960 --> 27:22.280
guide for Fedora, they've done it at that point.

27:22.280 --> 27:27.040
And that those all those things, they're like they remove paper cuts to switching.

27:27.040 --> 27:33.640
And I actually think a Fedora release six months into its release cycle is sort of sitting

27:33.640 --> 27:39.560
in a special sweet spot in the Linux ecosystem where it's got a lot of kinks worked out,

27:39.560 --> 27:43.160
especially if you grab fresh packages.

27:43.160 --> 27:47.280
It's got pretty good third party support and community support at that point.

27:47.280 --> 27:53.180
It's still because it's Fedora, a very modern install, and you've still got months of support.

27:53.180 --> 27:58.240
So you could just ride that for at least another six months and then upgrade to the next version

27:58.240 --> 28:01.320
that's now becoming the old version of Fedora.

28:01.320 --> 28:05.600
I think it makes a life a little easier and I think this is the one that's the version

28:05.600 --> 28:09.400
of Fedora, the one that's about six months into its life cycle that you can recommend.

28:09.400 --> 28:13.280
And I've teased people before that say, oh, wait a few months when you're looking at it

28:13.280 --> 28:14.920
for like a family machine.

28:14.920 --> 28:15.920
Just wait a release.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.920
That's what you're saying, huh?

28:16.920 --> 28:17.920
Yeah, right.

28:17.920 --> 28:22.120
Wait a release because each each release gets 13 months of support.

28:22.120 --> 28:26.280
So you got some buffer time for everything to kind of get worked out and they don't care

28:26.280 --> 28:28.240
if they're on the latest and greatest.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.240
That's just it.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.240
You're right.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.240
Most people don't care.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.200
I mean, we care, but it's not necessarily rational.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.200
Yeah.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.200
Yeah.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.160
Part of it's enthusiasm driven for sure.

28:37.160 --> 28:41.340
But you know, but it also means I could wait a little bit on my main machine, maybe three

28:41.340 --> 28:46.360
months after release, update a little bit before everybody, do a little checking around,

28:46.360 --> 28:47.520
see how things are going.

28:47.520 --> 28:54.360
You know, like there's I kind of I like this idea that maybe my main rig that I'm on, maybe

28:54.360 --> 29:00.180
three months into that final six months, I upgrade and I figure out what needs still

29:00.180 --> 29:02.640
to be fixed or what works fine.

29:02.640 --> 29:06.240
And then when the next release drops, I upgrade the kids machines.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.640
And then, of course, you've got you know, you've got stream in the mix, too.

29:08.640 --> 29:12.200
If you have something that might need to be even more stable than that down the road.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.200
Yeah, true.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.200
There that could be interesting.

29:14.200 --> 29:18.960
A sent us nine stream for a family, for family and friends, perhaps.

29:18.960 --> 29:23.440
But when we were trying this out, we wanted to give this an honest go like, can I give

29:23.440 --> 29:24.960
this to friends and family?

29:24.960 --> 29:30.660
And what I envisioned is bringing everybody to Fedora, put everybody on Fedora and put

29:30.660 --> 29:34.800
everyone on a tail scale network, which is a wire guard mesh VPN solution.

29:34.800 --> 29:35.800
All right.

29:35.800 --> 29:36.800
So you've got everyone there.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.760
You can access everyone machine just right over tail scale.

29:38.760 --> 29:39.760
That makes sense.

29:39.760 --> 29:40.760
Right.

29:40.760 --> 29:41.760
Super simple.

29:41.760 --> 29:45.960
And if they need support, I can SSH to their machine.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.120
But I wanted to go a little bit further than that.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.000
And I wanted to do remote desktop support.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.800
And I love Rust Desk, but Rust Desk is X11 only.

29:55.800 --> 29:56.800
No.

29:56.800 --> 30:03.920
And, you know, in Fedora 34 and in Fedora 35, on GNOME, the Wayland supports.

30:03.920 --> 30:04.920
It's really nice.

30:04.920 --> 30:09.440
It's you get a better experience now and I don't want to I don't want to go backwards

30:09.440 --> 30:10.440
for them.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.440
I know, right.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.440
Maybe in some ways.

30:12.440 --> 30:15.240
But when Wayland works, it works really well.

30:15.240 --> 30:19.360
Yeah, it's smooth as butter, but not butter, but butter.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.840
But so we were digging around.

30:20.840 --> 30:24.160
You and I were doing this, I think, after we did LAN one day.

30:24.160 --> 30:30.600
And we found that the recommended way to kind of do this now on Wayland with GNOME Shell

30:30.600 --> 30:36.420
is to use the RDP server that's built into GNOME Shell that I think uses pipewire and

30:36.420 --> 30:38.380
all this kind of stuff on the back end.

30:38.380 --> 30:42.880
But we discovered that it's not actually shipping yet.

30:42.880 --> 30:47.640
Some of the documentation talks about it like it exists, but it doesn't actually fully exist

30:47.640 --> 30:48.640
yet.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.640
Yeah.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.640
So, like, you might see this.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.640
You can enable the remote desktop stuff.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.400
But by default, it just exposes it over VNC.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.400
And we gave that a try.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.400
But it's a VNC.

30:56.400 --> 30:59.560
It's not going to be great over a remote network.

30:59.560 --> 31:04.920
But at some point they added via free RDP RDP support baked in as well.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.960
But yeah, there's just no.

31:06.960 --> 31:10.420
Because this is Linux, there's just nothing exposed graphically right now.

31:10.420 --> 31:14.840
And setting it up and enabling it and providing default credentials, well, there's a guide,

31:14.840 --> 31:16.480
but it's not exactly simple.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.040
It wasn't horribly bad.

31:18.040 --> 31:21.560
Like, I think we ended up pulling down a few things from GitHub and building them and then

31:21.560 --> 31:23.560
moving them around, right?

31:23.560 --> 31:25.920
Then maybe we had to start something with systemd.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.400
So there was some futzing.

31:27.400 --> 31:28.400
Yeah, you're right.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.400
We did have to.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.400
There's like a little script that's posted.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.160
We'll have it linked in the show notes that you got to compile and then that lets you

31:33.160 --> 31:38.440
configure like the credentials set up so that you can put a password on it and then you

31:38.440 --> 31:41.960
go in and modify with decomp some settings.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.680
And then I think, yeah, we just logged out, logged back in.

31:44.680 --> 31:48.200
It did work, though, at the end of the day, that that was the part that was pretty nice.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.200
It seemed decent.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.460
Oh, man, it worked really good.

31:51.460 --> 31:55.520
If you had the right RDP client, like we tried a couple of them and I wish I would have written

31:55.520 --> 31:57.920
down the one that didn't work very good.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.200
I want to say it was Romania, but I'm not sure.

32:00.200 --> 32:05.640
But if you got the right RDP client, like Microsoft's RDP client or there's there's

32:05.640 --> 32:09.440
like XRDP, there's a couple with the right settings.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.760
It's impressively high performance.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.640
It's much better than VNC.

32:14.640 --> 32:18.760
I think it was near real time because we had the laptop and we had the remote machine right

32:18.760 --> 32:19.760
next to each other.

32:19.760 --> 32:23.900
It was there's just a very, very slight lag, which makes me think that if I was supporting

32:23.900 --> 32:27.360
them over a remote link, it'd probably be fairly usable.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.480
Yeah, that's that's the test.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.160
But I just need this to work a little.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.640
And it would work for family support machine, I think.

32:33.640 --> 32:35.120
I think it would actually do the job.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.480
So the only problem is, and I haven't tested this yet, dang it.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.720
Now that I think about this, I wish I would have.

32:40.720 --> 32:46.200
I'm not sure if this is going to break when I go from GNOME 40 to GNOME 41.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.340
And I just did that on my machine that we we did this test set up on.

32:49.340 --> 32:52.160
So after the show, I'll see if RDP is still working on it.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.720
We've got some follow up to do.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.640
Yeah, I should have thought of that.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.880
I was just you know, I was so focused on getting the upgrade and so worried that it was going

32:59.880 --> 33:05.880
to break my Fedora 34 install, because as I was going through this little journey.

33:05.880 --> 33:08.520
To see if this was a usable setup.

33:08.520 --> 33:15.120
What I ended up with at the end of my Fedora 34 walk, if you will, is one of my all time

33:15.120 --> 33:17.560
favorite Linux installs.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.120
I really liked it.

33:19.120 --> 33:23.640
It doesn't happen very often anymore, but it became precious to me and I was worried

33:23.640 --> 33:25.760
that the upgrade would break it.

33:25.760 --> 33:31.600
I know that's how much I liked the 34 experience six months into its life cycle.

33:31.600 --> 33:35.000
I'd say I was impressed, but it felt early days when it released.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.080
But six months in, it became my favorite setup I've ever had on that ThinkPad.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.400
It really it really rocked.

33:42.400 --> 33:49.580
So yeah, I think this is a really capable family distro if you just give it a little

33:49.580 --> 33:52.040
bit for the community to catch up to it.

33:52.040 --> 33:56.320
As well, Fedora isn't as just crazy moving forward as Arch.

33:56.320 --> 33:58.800
It is fairly out there on the edge of things.

33:58.800 --> 34:04.040
So I don't know if this is just me being crazy, but Brian, I kind of actually feel like maybe

34:04.040 --> 34:06.880
we'll get into this in our review, but I kind of feel like this might be the perfect Fedora

34:06.880 --> 34:07.880
set up for you.

34:07.880 --> 34:08.880
Oh, tell me more.

34:08.880 --> 34:09.880
Why do you think that?

34:09.880 --> 34:13.880
Well, if somebody came to me like I have this, I have I always remember this conversation

34:13.880 --> 34:14.880
I had.

34:14.880 --> 34:18.680
There was this buddy of mine who was this big time PHP developer and he said, Chris,

34:18.680 --> 34:20.440
I am so frustrated with Linux.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.120
I just want to get my work done.

34:22.120 --> 34:25.160
And he said, I installed Ubuntu and I can't remember what it was.

34:25.160 --> 34:27.440
It was probably like eight, ten or something.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.520
It was a long time ago.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.600
And he said, you know, this isn't working.

34:31.600 --> 34:32.600
That isn't working.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.400
My PHP environment is broken and went on and on.

34:35.400 --> 34:41.640
And so I introduced him to the Ubuntu LTS model and I said, here's what you need to

34:41.640 --> 34:44.160
kind of whenever the LTS was kind of new.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.600
So I don't know how long ago this was.

34:45.600 --> 34:49.460
And I said, this is kind of what this is what you probably want to be running for your kind

34:49.460 --> 34:50.960
of workload.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.240
And Fedora doesn't offer anything like that.

34:53.240 --> 34:54.800
They don't have an LTS version.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.620
They have 13 months of support.

34:56.620 --> 35:00.600
And then, of course, there's sent off stream, but it's not really quite the same comparable

35:00.600 --> 35:02.840
desktop environment yet.

35:02.840 --> 35:08.160
But I think this this model that we're talking about here where you kind of you ride six

35:08.160 --> 35:13.600
months behind release is essentially as close to an LTS model as you're going to get with

35:13.600 --> 35:20.200
mainline Fedora, because the upgrade experience is pretty smooth and the reliability and community

35:20.200 --> 35:21.560
support is pretty high.

35:21.560 --> 35:26.240
So when you want to troubleshoot in the middle of the night, you can find a guide online

35:26.240 --> 35:30.300
and you can get it fixed instead of having to wait for somebody to, you know, like figure

35:30.300 --> 35:33.440
it out, who's still like maybe waiting for the bug report to come in.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.440
Right.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.440
Do you see what I'm saying?

35:35.440 --> 35:36.440
Like, it's those are all things I love for sure.

35:36.440 --> 35:37.440
Yeah.

35:37.440 --> 35:40.960
It's a more reliable target for the for if you wanted to be in the Fedora user land,

35:40.960 --> 35:44.280
but you wanted that kind of reliability, I think that's the target right there.

35:44.280 --> 35:48.560
Well, and to be fair, I do the same thing with the Ubuntu LTS right now.

35:48.560 --> 35:54.180
I wait a few I wait several months, actually, because the reality of how much engineering

35:54.180 --> 35:58.280
goes behind these things is that there's just inevitably some stuff that once you get it

35:58.280 --> 36:03.760
out to users, there's like thousands and thousands of users who find all these bugs and things.

36:03.760 --> 36:07.940
And then it's so three months later, six months later, of course, going to be more polished.

36:07.940 --> 36:13.480
So I think that's a good strategy for anybody who's risk averse.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.720
Maybe it's a good way to put it.

36:14.720 --> 36:17.400
Or the first job is that it's a work tool.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.080
The second job is that it's a tinker tool, right?

36:20.080 --> 36:23.600
Like my see my think a lot of times my ordering slightly different, like sometimes tinker

36:23.600 --> 36:27.380
tool is above work tool on some of my systems.

36:27.380 --> 36:31.020
But you don't have seven systems like I do, right?

36:31.020 --> 36:33.420
So you've got to you've got to narrow that focus a little bit more.

36:33.420 --> 36:37.400
So honest, what I'm saying is if you came to me, like we just met at an event and you

36:37.400 --> 36:40.080
and I didn't, you know, know each other and you said, Chris, what Linux should I use?

36:40.080 --> 36:43.920
I'm a photographer and I want to be very reliable and I have a lot of things going on right

36:43.920 --> 36:47.840
now and I need to be able to just open up my computer and have it work and perform well.

36:47.840 --> 36:50.720
I would today if you asked me that I'd say fedora 34.

36:50.720 --> 36:51.840
I don't think I'd say anything else.

36:51.840 --> 36:57.840
I'd say go get fedora 34 and bring it fully up to date.

36:57.840 --> 37:02.000
unpluggedcore.com want to support the show directly go to unpluggedcore.com and become

37:02.000 --> 37:07.380
a member you get the full live feed the very long version of the show if you'd like or

37:07.380 --> 37:12.440
you can get a nice cut down version with limited spots that Joe makes his full production you

37:12.440 --> 37:16.380
know it's got all the Joe quality it just a little bit shorter runtime which can be

37:16.380 --> 37:19.960
nice if you have a shorter commute but you also are supporting the show and on top of

37:19.960 --> 37:24.620
that you're going to get access to special promo codes when we have new merch if and

37:24.620 --> 37:29.760
when I'm not saying anything not announcing anything but I'm just saying if new things

37:29.760 --> 37:34.680
were in the works and they were going to be announced as a thank you to our members we

37:34.680 --> 37:40.200
offer discount codes so you can support the show get discount codes on new jb merch and

37:40.200 --> 37:44.480
of course you get access to the two feeds the live uncut feed or the fully produced

37:44.480 --> 37:48.520
shorter limited ad feed that's just a thank you for everyone out there who supports us

37:48.520 --> 37:56.000
at unpluggedcore.com okay I think we've stretched out long enough we got to talk about fedora

37:56.000 --> 38:02.680
35 it lands today and the way the fedora release cycle works is they kind of have some target

38:02.680 --> 38:08.800
weeks and they release when the blocking bugs have been fixed or a solution is in place

38:08.800 --> 38:14.200
it's not so much a date driven release as it is things aren't broken so we can ship

38:14.200 --> 38:18.480
release and I have to say I'm I'm actually completely fine with that model and we just

38:18.480 --> 38:22.120
kind of watch the bug tracker because it's all out in the open and you all can kind of

38:22.120 --> 38:25.800
just follow along and find out when they're gonna release and yeah you know we get it

38:25.800 --> 38:30.760
when it's ready why not yeah no rush and this version features gnome 41 which has been

38:30.760 --> 38:37.840
out for a little bit in fact it looks like gnome 41.1 is just about just about out and

38:37.840 --> 38:42.840
it includes in gnome 41 some improved power management options which we can touch on in

38:42.840 --> 38:49.760
a little bit also like Matthew was saying those new controls for how the virtual desktop

38:49.760 --> 38:54.320
layout I guess is how I'll say it works with virtual monitors and some more work on that

38:54.320 --> 38:59.040
RDP back end that we were talking about and I have to say the thing that I'm most excited

38:59.040 --> 39:05.480
about is the continued evolution of pipe wire in fedora and wire plumber as the session

39:05.480 --> 39:13.400
manager so in fedora 34 we got pipe wire and under the hood it was kind of just using some

39:13.400 --> 39:18.760
some default hard coded logic but pipe wire can do a lot more than that and so what wire

39:18.760 --> 39:24.560
plumber is is it's a session manager that's going to enable future customizing that we

39:24.560 --> 39:27.840
might use here in the studio of routing audio and setting things up in a very particular

39:27.840 --> 39:32.560
way eventually there'll be things that sit on top of wire plumber there's some graphical

39:32.560 --> 39:38.680
applications in the works right now one called hell VM I think that is a GTK patch bay it

39:38.680 --> 39:43.080
really actually kind of replicates the patch bay of the early days of the music industry

39:43.080 --> 39:47.040
where you're taking a wire from one device and you're running it to another device and

39:47.040 --> 39:50.920
that's in the works right now and underneath that will be wire plumber and you'll be able

39:50.920 --> 39:55.920
to save different sessions so you could maybe have like this is my jitzy meeting session

39:55.920 --> 40:00.800
where my audio comes from my microphone and I also am taking audio from my other browser

40:00.800 --> 40:05.800
so maybe like you have Firefox as your second browser like I do you could have a wire plumber

40:05.800 --> 40:12.820
session that brings audio from your USB microphone and from Firefox and sends it in as an input

40:12.820 --> 40:17.240
device that you have selected in your video meeting so you could play audio from your

40:17.240 --> 40:21.960
web browser into the meeting or from VLC it's it's going to give you this kind of flexibility

40:21.960 --> 40:25.800
so when you hear us talk about pipe wire and you hear us mention wire plumber the session

40:25.800 --> 40:29.560
manager what you're going to get as an end user for you never going to do audio production

40:29.560 --> 40:34.560
is you're going to get that kind of flexibility you can do a you know a VoIP call with somebody

40:34.560 --> 40:37.860
and route audio in there and have your own soundboard if you want and have your own wacky

40:37.860 --> 40:43.340
zoo thing or maybe you want to screen share your web browser and you want to play a presentation

40:43.340 --> 40:46.440
and you want to capture the audio from that as well now you're going to be able to do

40:46.440 --> 40:52.400
all that kind of stuff and what wire plumber does is it lays down the session manager piece

40:52.400 --> 40:56.560
of this that's going to manage how this stuff works Wes am I explaining this appropriately

40:56.560 --> 41:00.560
yeah I mean I think so because I feel like I'm kind of not doing a very good job explaining

41:00.560 --> 41:04.400
it wire plumber replaces the you know some of the stuff that was built into pipe wire

41:04.400 --> 41:09.400
by default that was kind of a just a simple bare bones version and but you can think about

41:09.400 --> 41:12.920
you know pipe wire has all these facilities but you kind of have to make actual configurations

41:12.920 --> 41:17.500
of those actual sessions actual arrangements of everything and you need something that

41:17.500 --> 41:21.520
can help manage that and provide tools for other things to interact with it and that's

41:21.520 --> 41:25.960
basically the layer where wire plumber fits so yeah as an end user unless you get into

41:25.960 --> 41:29.980
the details of pipe wire you probably won't care about this but this is one of those pieces

41:29.980 --> 41:33.760
I mean like I play around with pipe wire all the time building it from source I hadn't

41:33.760 --> 41:37.560
set up wire plumber I was still using the other stuff this is like the area where fedora

41:37.560 --> 41:41.380
is taking these disparate pieces and really thinking about it and building something more

41:41.380 --> 41:45.820
coherent together yeah I'm looking forward to it Neil give me an idea of what we're going

41:45.820 --> 41:48.560
to get down the road in the future like wire plumber is going to enable a lot more than

41:48.560 --> 41:52.440
we have today but I don't think I'm giving it justice here the biggest thing you want

41:52.440 --> 41:57.100
to think about when it comes to wire plumber and pipe wire is that what pipe wire actually

41:57.100 --> 42:02.580
does is quite a lot more than what people see right now so pipe wire can manage audio

42:02.580 --> 42:07.400
sources and audio syncs we're all familiar with that part we introduced that in 34 and

42:07.400 --> 42:11.000
the other part that it has that we've had for quite a light longer but we've just really

42:11.000 --> 42:16.420
not talked about it is the fact that can manage video sources and video syncs so this means

42:16.420 --> 42:22.140
for example if you do a screen share through the pipe wire portal api to redirect an application

42:22.140 --> 42:27.360
or whatever like you know how that apex rdp window fx i for remote fx thing that windows

42:27.360 --> 42:31.400
has you can do something similar with this and the cool bit is because wire plumber is

42:31.400 --> 42:36.860
a session manager for pipe wire that can manage sync sources and sites you can do programmatic

42:36.860 --> 42:42.580
redirection of those things too so you can do things like orchestrate the connecting

42:42.580 --> 42:47.480
of various different syncs and sources for video as well as audio from various sources

42:47.480 --> 42:53.200
like a camera if they're going through lib camera into pipe wire out or a screen share

42:53.200 --> 42:57.580
or an application share or any of these other things like for example you were talking earlier

42:57.580 --> 43:02.680
about remote desktop through rdp and yes it does use pipe wire underneath pipe wire and

43:02.680 --> 43:06.520
wire plumber contribute to supporting the ability to do these sorts of things in the

43:06.520 --> 43:11.000
future if there's interest and development around this you could also see things like

43:11.000 --> 43:18.440
an implementation of something like windows's remote effects which does you can do per application

43:18.440 --> 43:24.400
shares and screen sharing or replication on like remote connections to applications you

43:24.400 --> 43:28.520
know like you have a more powerful server computer running gnome on it with the application

43:28.520 --> 43:32.440
running there and then you could screen share the application itself back to a weaker thin

43:32.440 --> 43:36.560
client those kinds of things become possible there's all kinds of interesting things that

43:36.560 --> 43:43.000
you can do for vdi use cases for instructor cases for screen shares for video conferencing

43:43.000 --> 43:50.960
for music production for concerts for whatever you want when it comes to av there's a pipe

43:50.960 --> 43:57.840
wire pipeline in there i love the sound of that and we're going just a little bit at

43:57.840 --> 44:01.760
a time but overall when you look at other initiatives in the past i think i'm pretty

44:01.760 --> 44:06.260
happy with the with the rate of progression there is a known bug right now some people

44:06.260 --> 44:11.040
have no sound after they upgrade we'll have a link about that in the notes essentially

44:11.040 --> 44:15.280
maybe for some reason wire plumber didn't start appropriately so if you have that problem

44:15.280 --> 44:19.160
after you upgrade there is a note about it it's a known problem and a note on how to

44:19.160 --> 44:23.240
just quickly start it up it's not that bad i guess i lied you should know about wire

44:23.240 --> 44:29.080
plumber yeah maybe so so i did the upgrade on that fedora 34 install on my thinkpad

44:29.080 --> 44:33.080
and overall things went really smooth you know it really didn't work as expected were

44:33.080 --> 44:37.820
a few gnome extensions a lot of them actually have updated for 41 that's nice to see but

44:37.820 --> 44:44.180
not all of them so you know you're gonna get that if you upgrade on day one but and i'm

44:44.180 --> 44:50.440
really happy to see this if you have that new gnome extensions app when you log in for

44:50.440 --> 44:55.480
the first time to gnome 41 on your recently upgraded fedora session or whatever it might

44:55.480 --> 45:01.080
be in the future maybe it's a bunt or debian or whatever arch um that extensions app will

45:01.080 --> 45:06.040
give you a notification that says hey man some of your extensions have updates and aren't

45:06.040 --> 45:10.240
loaded and if you click it it launches the extensions app and that extensions app gives

45:10.240 --> 45:15.240
you an overview of which extensions have been disabled which ones have updates again and

45:15.240 --> 45:19.520
then it puts a banner along the bottom of the application that says the next time you

45:19.520 --> 45:23.740
log in i'm gonna update some of your extensions for you would you like to log out now and

45:23.740 --> 45:28.200
you hit that and it logs you out you log back in they're up to date and if they're compatible

45:28.200 --> 45:33.380
they're up and going my doc extension for example hasn't been updated my tray icons

45:33.380 --> 45:38.560
i had tray icons reloaded that hasn't been updated yet but anything that's pretty essential

45:38.560 --> 45:42.280
to the use of gnome shell for me that's been updated which is a pretty minimal set now

45:42.280 --> 45:47.200
and then i have like a nice to have set so that's good i mean outside of that really

45:47.200 --> 45:52.880
no issue i haven't tried rdp yet but all of my apps work i think flat pack's doing a fair

45:52.880 --> 45:57.240
amount of the heavy lifting there a dream of containerized applications alive in fedora

45:57.240 --> 46:03.560
35 yeah and i think it's i think it's a good use case for things like slack and discord

46:03.560 --> 46:07.800
and element and all the other there's a few other ones that are electron base that i have

46:07.800 --> 46:12.080
to have open and you know shipping them as flat packs kind of makes sense i kind of like

46:12.080 --> 46:17.560
having them sandboxed as well and so that just all goes really smooth works pretty well

46:17.560 --> 46:23.040
for me but i didn't have quite the same experience brent did because i think brent you tried

46:23.040 --> 46:28.180
out the plasma spin right yeah we were talking about you know last week talking about which

46:28.180 --> 46:33.400
one i should try and we kind of went back and forth you said oh you got to try the gnome

46:33.400 --> 46:37.760
implementation because it's fabulous obviously you're a big fan of it i actually decided

46:37.760 --> 46:44.560
to try the kde spin because i'm super familiar with kde and i have to say that i hardly spent

46:44.560 --> 46:50.260
any time in modern gnome so i thought i don't want it to be so different of an experience

46:50.260 --> 46:56.000
that i'm not really focusing on the usability of it or the distribution itself so i decided

46:56.000 --> 47:03.640
to try the kde spin and as some context i will admit neil that i haven't used fedora

47:03.640 --> 47:09.260
for more than like a few minutes ever so this was my chance to really dive in and and chris

47:09.260 --> 47:15.360
has been basically talking really positively about it for a few years now so i thought

47:15.360 --> 47:23.760
okay now's my chance so if you want to find uh what i ran which was fedora 34 five's pre-release

47:23.760 --> 47:29.040
the kde spin it's actually a little confusing to find uh if you go to fedora project.org

47:29.040 --> 47:34.880
it just kind of redirects you to the main releases so you have to go to spins.fedora

47:34.880 --> 47:39.720
project.org i found that as a someone who wasn't that familiar with fedora to be kind

47:39.720 --> 47:46.440
of confusing to find and i tried it on some bare metal i had a have a thinkpad x240 that

47:46.440 --> 47:52.960
i guess i found in my basement that i wasn't using and so i decided to uh throw that on

47:52.960 --> 48:00.740
a usb and give it a go directly on an SSD i didn't know anything about fedora so i did

48:00.740 --> 48:06.760
dive into the docs first which i think is probably a good idea um one the most uh worrisome

48:06.760 --> 48:12.720
thing was about how to update packages i know it used rpms but i didn't quite know how to

48:12.720 --> 48:19.280
go about doing that and i loved the documentation it was good enough like it went into enough

48:19.280 --> 48:22.800
detail to get you where you wanted to go or i should say get me where i wanted to go with

48:22.800 --> 48:28.440
my level of um knowledge about linux and stuff but it wasn't so exhaustive that it was hard

48:28.440 --> 48:33.240
to find what i needed so kudos there for whoever's writing the documentation i really really

48:33.240 --> 48:41.080
appreciated it i also uh here's a skill testing question for you chris and us um do you know

48:41.080 --> 48:49.920
what dnf actually stands for oh man yes i do but now i've forgotten now that you asked

48:49.920 --> 48:54.480
i feel like i could like stall and be like well you know it was uh inspired by yum which

48:54.480 --> 48:59.680
was the yellow dog update manager isn't it like the dandafied package manager or something

48:59.680 --> 49:04.840
like that right yeah i chuckled there and so i thought okay the door is gonna be fun

49:04.840 --> 49:08.560
i really appreciate this and i know yum has a lot of history and i don't really know it

49:08.560 --> 49:16.200
that well but i've heard a lot of good things about dnf so use the kd live disk and uh usually

49:16.200 --> 49:21.680
my typical method to do this is i have my main laptop in front of me and then i have

49:21.680 --> 49:26.360
some friend's laptop or family member or some laptop i'm playing with and i like to use

49:26.360 --> 49:32.920
my main system and just do a vnc session over to that other system so i have the keyboard

49:32.920 --> 49:37.440
that i'm used to and all of the programs and i can look up you know notes in my regular

49:37.440 --> 49:44.920
applications and from the live disk uh that didn't really work for me and i was sort of

49:44.920 --> 49:50.200
i was like okay well it presented a black screen i was like okay this is likely a wayland

49:50.200 --> 49:56.760
thing because i knew that was an issue in the past so i can do without that so i continued

49:56.760 --> 50:01.020
with the anaconda installer and i know a lot of people say it's kind of clumsy and stuff

50:01.020 --> 50:06.280
and i thought it was fine it was actually kind of nice and it was pretty visual which

50:06.280 --> 50:12.780
i appreciated uh i did notice there's encryption as an option disk encryption which i love

50:12.780 --> 50:16.080
and i always put that on laptops because i do a lot of traveling and stuff so that was

50:16.080 --> 50:21.360
a really important thing for me another thing i appreciated was that it told me my password

50:21.360 --> 50:28.040
was awful by doing a dictionary word check which is such a small little thing but i think

50:28.040 --> 50:32.320
for new users chris like you're suggesting for family and stuff that's actually really

50:32.320 --> 50:36.960
nice um i was using a terrible password because i didn't care to you know it's just a testing

50:36.960 --> 50:41.360
machine but um that was actually a really nice thing that i think everyone should have

50:41.360 --> 50:47.360
so uh there was one question or a warning that i didn't understand and i'm gonna read

50:47.360 --> 50:53.360
it to you guys and even on mumble i want you to try to figure out what it means so this

50:53.360 --> 50:59.480
was in the encryption section so i was encrypting doing some disencryption and it said warning

50:59.480 --> 51:03.880
you won't be able to switch between keyboard layouts from the default ones when you decrypt

51:03.880 --> 51:10.960
your disk after install so what are they actually trying to communicate there okay okay you

51:10.960 --> 51:20.560
won't be able to switch between keyboard layouts when you decrypt your disks after install

51:20.560 --> 51:25.360
i think i know what this is okay what are they saying wimpy if you've used special

51:25.360 --> 51:34.480
characters in your encryption passphrase using say a french canadian keyboard and then try

51:34.480 --> 51:39.600
to decrypt that using a u.s english keyboard those special characters are not going to

51:39.600 --> 51:45.480
align it's got to be it he's got it and i have run into this previously and i think

51:45.480 --> 51:50.880
anyone who's spent enough time with decrypting disks at boot you will eventually run into

51:50.880 --> 51:56.960
this but anyways i thought that was worded a little confusingly maybe visually it's a

51:56.960 --> 52:01.280
bit different than than that but anyways it all worked fine and it only took about eight

52:01.280 --> 52:07.600
minutes to install which was really uh lovely actually but that's where things started going

52:07.600 --> 52:14.720
poorly for me on the first boot you get the background of fedora and i am a visual person

52:14.720 --> 52:19.160
and i thought the background they chose which is not a technical thing but i thought it's

52:19.160 --> 52:28.200
like this teal almost like seafoam green pool reflections photograph i believe and it just

52:28.200 --> 52:35.140
made me feel a little queasy i think guys what was your take on that with all due respect

52:35.140 --> 52:42.240
to the to the art team yeah because i often like what they do um literally on every single

52:42.240 --> 52:46.640
install of fedora 35 i've done the very very first thing i did was change the background

52:46.640 --> 52:51.720
i find it kind of jarring i know west did you have that i bet if anybody's gonna be

52:51.720 --> 52:55.840
chill about it no i had to say i had the same reaction i've really liked some past ones

52:55.840 --> 53:01.640
i was trying to give it an open mind but now that this default background is i mean i generally

53:01.640 --> 53:06.800
don't bring it up but yeah i i agree i first impressions are important right yeah doesn't

53:06.800 --> 53:12.160
speak to the rest of the release yeah yeah so then i thought okay well i'm gonna try

53:12.160 --> 53:16.040
you know i've installed it i'm gonna i'm gonna try this vnc thing again because i really

53:16.040 --> 53:24.440
want to use that um so i'm used to using the krfb which is a kde um i guess vnc server

53:24.440 --> 53:29.080
uh has worked amazingly for me in the last several years um and i went to use the menu

53:29.080 --> 53:34.920
launcher and it just didn't do anything and i thought oh that's odd i'll just ignore that

53:34.920 --> 53:40.040
for now and actually now that i'm thinking about vnc maybe it's a wayland issue and i

53:40.040 --> 53:47.040
i knew that uh so maybe i'll try x11 so i logged out and uh logged into x11 and the

53:47.040 --> 53:52.560
krfb menu launcher worked fine um and then i tried to connect to vnc from my other laptop

53:52.560 --> 54:03.080
and uh that just crashed krfb oh so i certainly wasn't going to use my preferred vnc methods

54:03.080 --> 54:10.760
yeah i'm sorry brad i'm so sorry yeah so i decided to unplug my main laptop you know

54:10.760 --> 54:15.960
from all of my stuff and switch the two and just focus on the fedora stuff which is fine

54:15.960 --> 54:20.840
so i thought okay well the next thing i like to do typically on a system is play with some

54:20.840 --> 54:27.800
of the uh you know install some minor things like htop and i don't know sometimes you have

54:27.800 --> 54:33.720
to install ssh server and stuff like that so i'm going to do these um basic applications

54:33.720 --> 54:39.280
that i like having so dnf is the first time i use it fair enough uh but it's super simple

54:39.280 --> 54:43.160
so i just did dnf install htop that simple because i wanted to see okay what's it going

54:43.160 --> 54:49.740
to do how's it going to work and it started downloading a package but it wasn't very descriptive

54:49.740 --> 54:54.400
and then it just kept going and going and i thought okay htop i know is very tiny what's

54:54.400 --> 55:01.440
going on over here um and so the description it gave was fedora 35 x86 64 and that's it

55:01.440 --> 55:07.320
and it was just downloading it downloaded 61 megs of stuff and i was quite confused

55:07.320 --> 55:13.040
because i knew that was unlikely wow where are you seeing the 61 megabytes if you've

55:13.040 --> 55:17.840
used apt or most other you know it lists a package on the left and then gives you a progress

55:17.840 --> 55:22.000
bar of how much is downloaded on the right hand side it gives you the total download

55:22.000 --> 55:26.480
or how much time is going to you know be left in your download fair enough i don't have

55:26.480 --> 55:30.520
a great internet connection here so 61 megs actually was kind of depressing here's what

55:30.520 --> 55:34.600
i'm wondering you know because when you are on fedora brent for the and you install something

55:34.600 --> 55:40.400
using dnf for the first time if you haven't first updated the repositories it will do

55:40.400 --> 55:43.520
that for you automatically because that's actually one of the things that drives me

55:43.520 --> 55:47.060
crazy about apt is it will actually let you go ahead and install something even though

55:47.060 --> 55:50.240
it's looking at all old versions of the packages because you haven't updated the repositories

55:50.240 --> 55:54.880
yet so what dnf will do is it will say okay now actually i have to first refresh the repositories

55:54.880 --> 55:59.280
but on a new install it might be pulling that stuff down for a long time and because you

55:59.280 --> 56:03.360
know i notice it takes forever to update the repos when i'm on a bad connection too and

56:03.360 --> 56:08.880
that and because dnf does do that so frequently it makes the overall experience feel kind

56:08.880 --> 56:15.400
of slow you know i think that's a great insight and i can't remember and my notes aren't good

56:15.400 --> 56:22.160
enough to tell me if i did update um sort of the indexes beforehand i typically do because

56:22.160 --> 56:26.440
that's my process with apt and this seemed like a very easy translation from one to the

56:26.440 --> 56:30.960
other um but i kind of wish it just described that a little bit better it was a bit cryptic

56:30.960 --> 56:36.720
to me yeah yeah after it continued sort of doing a bunch of stuff it did eventually change

56:36.720 --> 56:45.960
that to suggest fedora 34 x86 64 updates but even that was kind of cryptic and so i didn't

56:45.960 --> 56:51.480
love it but anyways it did ask me about downloading htop so after you wait for all of the refresh

56:51.480 --> 56:58.160
of the repos and all the dependencies to be met you get your 170 kilobyte application

56:58.160 --> 57:04.880
yeah that's that is sometimes the dnf experience so after all of that i decided okay well i

57:04.880 --> 57:08.200
know i want to try wayland because i haven't tried it that much so i'm gonna i'm gonna

57:08.200 --> 57:14.040
log out and go back and um when i logged in back to the wayland session krfb decided to

57:14.040 --> 57:19.640
crash again just on login so i knew that wasn't gonna be any hope i did decide to change the

57:19.640 --> 57:26.600
desktop as you guys did but i ran it immediately into some weird issues uh i was changing the

57:26.600 --> 57:33.400
wallpaper and the apply button never appeared so i couldn't actually make that change commit

57:33.400 --> 57:38.560
and like that's such a small weird basic thing and it made me really worried actually about

57:38.560 --> 57:42.120
all of the other things i was gonna want to try because it's like one of the simplest

57:42.120 --> 57:47.000
things and so i had to quit the settings application come back and then it worked but it was like

57:47.000 --> 57:53.160
okay well what else am i gonna run into um so i decided to do a system update because

57:53.160 --> 57:58.400
i knew okay well i'm on i'm on a pre-release and i downloaded a few days ago maybe some

57:58.400 --> 58:03.840
people have you know i knew the release was going to be today but immediately i typed

58:03.840 --> 58:08.080
dnf upgrade and it gave me a little bit of information it said there's a problem with

58:08.080 --> 58:14.420
some of your packages so i hadn't done any updates yet and already there was some conflicts

58:14.420 --> 58:21.080
that specifically being a kwin common requires kd decorations conflict it said it was trying

58:21.080 --> 58:28.960
it cannot install 523 and 522 at the same time and literally this was a brand new system

58:28.960 --> 58:35.400
i hadn't done a single thing so that too worried me because what was gonna happen next i bet

58:35.400 --> 58:40.560
you got caught right in the switch over to the newer version of plasma perhaps that's

58:40.560 --> 58:44.920
definitely a beta thing that couldn't what can happen sometimes although it's not common

58:44.920 --> 58:49.360
is some of the packages land but not all of the packages land for the next version of

58:49.360 --> 58:54.240
plasma that could potentially be what happened there right and and now that we explore this

58:54.240 --> 59:01.120
here i'm seeing how this likely led to all of the other issues i ran into so i updated

59:01.120 --> 59:07.200
the whole system that way and rebooted and then things just things just did not work

59:07.200 --> 59:14.240
like abysmally did not function properly oh no i hate to say that because i was so excited

59:14.240 --> 59:19.800
about this but upon reboot i tried to log into wayland and i just got this login loop

59:19.800 --> 59:27.360
and it never ever would log into the desktop so i was like okay i know i can try the x11

59:27.360 --> 59:32.600
session so i did manage to get logged into the x11 session and i thought okay i'm gonna

59:32.600 --> 59:36.200
get some work done so i plugged in my external monitor and this was the beginning of the

59:36.200 --> 59:44.120
end the super key on my keyboard didn't even open the menu which is really frustrating

59:44.120 --> 59:50.360
and then the taskbar was on one monitor but then the menu when i clicked on it appeared

59:50.360 --> 59:56.680
on the other monitor and none of the window controls were available on any of the windows

59:56.680 --> 01:00:02.280
which is probably that conflict that i ran into uh because it had to do with kd decorations

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:09.400
so that's likely the issue but then i thought okay well it's been 12 hours and it's release

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:14.920
day etc etc maybe i'll just bring up a terminal and try to like update again and maybe some

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:19.640
of these things will be resolved and so i you know control alt t to bring up a terminal

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:26.920
and i literally got only the toolbar functions i did not get a terminal i did not get window

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:32.320
decorations to move things around so i it was just that was the point where i said i

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.500
can't go on that i can't there's nothing i can do i can't even troubleshoot this thing

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:42.960
is like uh so i had to give up and that made me really really sad oh no there's a lot to

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.960
this and there's several i think really important lessons here and one of them is this is why

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:53.480
betas are not like for production use fair enough there was a warning sticker on it but

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:57.240
still oh yeah and we know that right when we're going into this we have we always have

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:02.560
that in the back of our mind we know that in fact you know like if if you were to install

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.280
today and had these problems i'd say okay well it's time to start you know making out

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.080
some bug reports but i think what you got caught in is a beta transition that does happen

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.880
but i think that's a good thing for people to know listening to this that if if if say

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.000
someone is basing their impressions on that they got to give it a little bit uh and this

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.200
goes back to what i was saying about if you caught this say six months in you you installed

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:29.240
fedora 35 in six months i bet you this entire experience would be smooth as butter for you

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.680
all that stuff's completely worked out and that's where i think it makes that that's

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.980
where it's really in a sweet spot it's in a special kind of place it's in a special

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:41.880
sweet spot for desktop linux six months into its release cycle and right now it's still

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:46.320
early i think too one of the other things you probably got bit by is there was some

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.760
and i have a vague recollection one of the blocker bugs was related to something in plasma

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:55.720
and it was one of the things they had to fix right before release and it may have may have

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.680
been this conflict i looked at some of the common bugs and didn't see any of those but

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.280
maybe that is just for the main release not the spins and i think you're right like i

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:10.080
liked the experience errors aside enough to give it another try after you know maybe in

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.360
a few months wouldn't that be an interesting thing to do is do a follow-up review with

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:17.560
it in a bit and try it again and see what it's like well how about we do that okay all

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.900
right we do that but one thing that i worried about and maybe that will change my perspective

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:29.560
in a few months is how distributions treat their you know this is this is an official

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:37.600
spin and it seemed pretty officially busted like maybe i'm one of the only people who

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.440
ran into that but i i really hope that the next test in you know a few months is very

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:49.640
different because i worry that the spins don't get the attention that the main release does

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:55.200
the plasma spin has been on a on a trajectory of becoming more and more serious for the

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:02.480
fedora project like now for example a a serious bug in the plasma spin is a blocker for the

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.880
entire fedora project right that means that they're not going to release the gnome version

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.200
if something's wrong in the plasma version so they are they are taking it very serious

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.160
now but and they might they might push back on this but i'd kind of argue that wasn't

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:19.600
always the mindset uh but i think what you have here is sometimes very late in the in

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.800
the phase they have to fix something and that was something they were working on but we'll

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.840
do the follow-up and we'll see how it is in a little bit and you know when at some time

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.080
one of these days i'll get you to try out my gnome setup the way i have it and see if

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.640
you like it yeah i could use it to her i'd appreciate that oh yeah maybe you you bake

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:39.680
him an image you just ship it over there brent flashes it on tries it chris's way could do

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:44.000
so mr pain you got your hands on fedora 35 would you try would you think yeah well i

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.800
played around with the uh you know the main gnome version a little bit but then i thought

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:54.960
i'd i'd go even more out there than brent i played with kina white oh yeah right there's

01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:01.400
silver blue version that's plasma based yeah come on immutable desktops for everyone including

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.360
plasma and flat packs for days it's been a while you know i have played with silver blue

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:11.160
but it's been a while i was at 33 i don't think i tried it for 34 so it has been a little

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:17.140
bit but i i was pleasantly surprised now you know i love don't love anaconda but it does

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:21.880
work it works just fine did seem like the kina white install took a little bit longer

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:29.240
but other than that it felt just like a normal fedora install of course things get a little

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:34.920
bit more interesting when you have to do some updates or start messing with the file system

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:41.740
or packages or anything like that because it's immutable rpm os tree based system it's

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:47.880
it's really neat i i think this could be a great development workstation for me personally

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:54.720
as um you know someone who tinkers maybe a little too much with some of my systems there

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:59.320
probably be one too many roadblocks but but for like a software development workstation

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:03.760
admin workstation just getting work done where you don't have to do a ton of packages or

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:09.140
customizations or you're fine with doing most of your things in flat pack and toolbox it's

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:13.920
really nice i was impressed how well this just worked in the katie environment i mean

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:20.040
it's not perfect discovers lacking some support for really working with rpm os tree for instance

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.120
but the flat hub support and discover was really nice because i you know i can just

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:29.440
turn flip that on and i got everything i need it is uh encouraging to see that kino night

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:34.600
development because i don't know if it's necessary that silver blue and kino night be two separate

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:40.440
projects but i think you're you're never going to have silver blue that can support both

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:46.640
plasma and gnome unless kino night exists it has to kind of be the project that keeps

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.040
the plasma torch burning so that way that silver blue doesn't become just a gnome thing

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.660
yeah you need somewhere to organize the the effort of all the little details that need

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:59.920
to get changed or fixed or packaged to make it a good katie experience and the idea west

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:05.960
of that i got a really rock solid workstation that has this os tree approach to very careful

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:13.280
updates and that combined with something like plasma and you know butter fs potentially

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:18.040
like i mean i'm really seeing some seriously awesome workstation potentials just around

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:21.360
the corner in the future plus it comes with you know a bunch of the latest stuff like

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.560
python 310 which just recently came out that's here like if you're using fedora you're up

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:30.000
to date which which is you often want for development yeah all right well i'm glad you

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.480
had a chance to kick the tires one question i have for you west and maybe chris you have

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:39.480
some insights or someone in mumble is um why make this if they have silver blue why put

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.680
some effort into something like this as well what's the what's the reasoning behind it

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.360
i think it is mostly just right now silver blue has always kind of been built with a

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.480
gnome first kind of perspective and so you do your software management through gnome

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:56.120
software and it's kind of using that entire pipeline and there hasn't been a bit much

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:01.720
focus on making sure that a system like silver blue will work with something like plasma although

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:07.560
it should right but and that would be the time now to start validating that out and

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:12.720
not years down the road when perhaps silver blue starts to become pushed as the predominant

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:17.880
workstation spin maybe of fedora could happen yeah i mean these these big desktop environments

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:22.080
really do have their hooks into a fair bit of how the system works and so yeah it ends

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.160
up being that there are things you need to think about when you've so radically changed

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.860
the system with these immutable variants so while we're talking about this a big thing

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:33.600
that makes all of this work is a lot of your application all your applications right are

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:40.820
flat packs and flat hub integration with gnome software landed for all the different versions

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:44.520
of gnome that use it so including the just a standard workstation version but it's not

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:50.800
like the full flat hub but it's pretty close but it's not full flat hub explain this yeah

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.660
so i mean you can still of course enable flat hub as you always have you know by manually

01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:03.240
doing that but but now fedora's providing a filtered list of stuff from their own repository

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.560
that they've sort of gone through and approved and made sure that doesn't cause them problems

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.560
to include it's an interesting start and it means that that some of these applications

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:16.240
that you might want are already there without having to do anything that's that's really

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:21.000
nice for a new user yeah and of course they do have that filter public which we'll link

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.240
to in the show notes if you're curious i was like well what are they filtering out uh it's

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.760
in there there's nothing really all that surprising in fact it mostly just seems like obvious

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:33.760
organizational stuff but it's nice to see them including the flat hub because flat hub

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:39.040
has really grown uh it has if you haven't been over there in a while go pop it up in

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.880
your browser flat hub.org and take a look at just like the new app section or something

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:48.880
like that so having that built in to gnome software is a pretty solid experience and

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.520
i'm glad they did it even if they have to take out some stuff for platform reasons or

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:58.840
legal reasons or or whatever it might be and once you noted we've got butter fs on fedora

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:05.020
cloud now that's good to see yeah right marches on go go a little butter fs go and nice to

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:09.960
have if you are using um fedora cloud does seem like a good sort of polished release

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.920
all around there's other stuff in this this release that we talked about like um making

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.940
sure that user services are restarted after upgrades which is especially important when

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.740
you're doing all kinds of audio stuff like pulse audio or pipeline running in the system

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:26.060
d user level instead of at the system level they've also started shipping the power profiles

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:29.920
daemon in fedora workstation enabling it by default and it's just those little things

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:34.200
you know those little things that the distro is thinking about for you that make fedora

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.400
you know a little more like a mainstream desktop and a little less like an arch setup yeah

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.720
real quick this power profiles thing's interesting and a lot of us are going to have a different

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:49.320
experience because the way it's integrated with gnome settings in your power area you're

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:53.480
going to see different stuff depending on what your hardware supports and it's even

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.400
integrated in with your thermal sensors and whatnot so for example if your laptop's running

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.840
super hot it doesn't make high performance mode available it'll even have a little grayed

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.840
out text that says we gotta wait here your laptop needs to cool down something to that

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.120
effect but if your hardware doesn't support this stuff you see limited reduced options

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:15.240
so they're only revealing stuff that your hardware has support for but it also means

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.900
that a lot of us see different things and i know this is true because i've tried it

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:25.220
out now on vms and several different physical boxes they're all different the thinkpad has

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:30.020
the sweetest integration like i i think wes i sent you a screenshot where it's like high

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:35.920
performance mode has been disabled while the laptop is in your lap what yeah it's impressive

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:40.680
honestly i mean this also kind of speaks to the added challenge that these you know desktop

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.200
environments linux distros have to to work on all kinds of hardware and make an interface

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:49.820
that can work in all the situations so we have the link in the show notes to go download

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:54.160
plus a link to some of the common problems people are hitting right now but we'd also

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.440
love to hear your experience what you did to make things go smoother i'd also like to

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.440
know what didn't work so we can put the word out head over to linux unplug dot com slash

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:08.340
contact and fill us in on your experience and your tips and your tricks now we are kind

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:12.120
of running out of time so we're gonna just do the pics really quick because we got something

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:18.280
super cool i think wes found it it's a nintendo switch emulator and i gave it a go oh you

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:22.680
did yeah you jinx i don't know how to say it but it's an experimental switch emulator

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:29.480
written in c sharp it's in the a u r as you would expect uh and so i gave it a go on the

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:33.880
arch box and um i immediately started getting error messages that i knew not what to do

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.660
with it's something about some some file missing that you have to go get but they're being

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:44.240
cagey about you anyways it is legitimate though and the gooey works and it promises

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.200
pretty good compatibility and what's cool about this project and we have it linked in

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:54.960
the show notes as i said um it is emulating the hardware really like accurately of the

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.320
switch so game compatibility is good it's like pretending to be the right arm cpu and

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:04.840
the right gpu and it's getting a lot of that right so even things like the newest metroid

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:10.040
game that just came out appear to be working in it i kind of got to give it a go it recommends

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.680
you have a system with at least like 8 or 16 gigs of ram which probably most of us do

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:17.640
and you know some cpu yeah this is really neat and it looks like they've got a pretty

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.520
nice website set up as well as a blog and i always find that the work that goes on behind

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:26.840
the scenes to make this kind of stuff possible just fascinating it's worth worth worth a

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.640
read i have to be honest when you linked it i was like oh another one of these huh you

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:36.560
know how's that guy but then i wouldn't check it out and i'm like this looks legit and so

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.440
i went the next step and gave it an install and i mean sure enough it installed and i

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:45.680
got the gooey launch but then it just sort of uh it just sort of broke on us um all right

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.440
we gotta wrap it up there because we're going kind of long uh i i'd love to have you join

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.960
the love plug we do that on sunday every sunday at noon pacific in our mumble room you can

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:59.600
get the time at jupyterbroadcasting.com calendar and remember it is time zone wonkiness because

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:04.840
europe does the daylight savings now ahead of the u.s so keep that in mind that's why

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.120
i just say go to the calendar page and you can get our mumble server details at linuxunplug.com

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:13.520
mumble we'd love to have you join the love plug and then who knows maybe you got a tuesday

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:18.720
sometime you can join us live because we do the show live on a tuesday see you next week

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:25.960
same bat time same bat station yeah that's right noon pacific 3 pm eastern jblive.tv

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:31.840
you got it you know it wes knows it linuxunplug.com slash matrix if you'd like to join our matrix

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.840
community and we'll have links to everything we talked about today at linuxunplug.com slash

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:43.440
four three zero including all kinds of extra goodies in there you never know you never know

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.400
it's like we back it up with the links we got the documents to prove it it's all over

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:52.320
there plus our contact page or subscribe the whole shebang and it's going to render in

your web browser it's incredible thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:23.640
of the unplug program and we'll see you right back here next tuesday!

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:43.880
all right way too long i declare there is no posho today posho's been cancelled we've got to

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.480
cancel it what you're hearing right now this is not a posho don't think of it a posho we're not

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.200
doing a posho it's not that we don't love you it's just that you know we don't want to kill joe

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:56.280
so this isn't a posho there's no posho can i still have my dessert yeah of course i

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.160
ice cream for everybody
