WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
We're introducing Chromecast Ultra, our most premium TV

00:04.720 --> 00:06.800
streaming device today.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.240
Chromecast Ultra brings everything

00:08.240 --> 00:10.640
you already love about Chromecast,

00:10.640 --> 00:14.680
plus even crisper picture and better performance.

00:14.680 --> 00:18.240
You will now be able to cast your favorite content in up

00:18.240 --> 00:23.920
to 4K Ultra HD resolution with HDR and Dolby Vision support.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.920
I'm just going to say, this might be the coolest runs

00:25.920 --> 00:27.800
Linux of the day, right there.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.000
Right, don't you think?

00:29.000 --> 00:30.440
That's pretty neat.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.800
That is pretty neat.

00:32.800 --> 00:38.560
This is Linux Unplugged episode 165 for October 4, 2016.

00:38.560 --> 00:52.560
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

00:52.560 --> 00:54.240
that's full of possibilities.

00:54.240 --> 00:55.080
My name is Chris.

00:55.080 --> 00:55.840
My name is Wes.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.200
I don't know what that means, but I'm going with the Wes.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.120
We're going to find out today.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.580
We do have a lot of possibilities.

01:00.580 --> 01:03.360
Coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged program,

01:03.360 --> 01:06.360
major updates from our favorite open source projects,

01:06.360 --> 01:07.280
at least some of them.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.440
We'll give you a rundown of the news and updates

01:09.440 --> 01:11.060
that I think you're going to care about,

01:11.060 --> 01:13.620
including some really cool tools and something

01:13.620 --> 01:17.320
that I've been geeking out about since Wes linked it to me.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.720
You know it.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.760
Then we'll tell you a little bit more about our trip

01:20.760 --> 01:23.040
to the Open Daylight Summit.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.840
I'm going to try to also pick Wimpy's brain

01:24.840 --> 01:26.920
about his usage of Open Media Vault.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.600
This is kind of a follow up to an episode

01:28.600 --> 01:29.840
we did a little bit ago.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.160
And then we have a couple of interviews

01:32.160 --> 01:34.440
from the Open Daylight Summit.

01:34.440 --> 01:38.640
And this time, since we talked about this in the past,

01:38.640 --> 01:41.960
we tried to wrap our head around how a major company like Ericsson

01:41.960 --> 01:45.500
is using it to roll out 5G networking.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.720
How many Gs is that?

01:46.720 --> 01:47.720
Five.

01:47.720 --> 01:51.240
And we'll tell you what 5G networking is

01:51.240 --> 01:54.120
and why software-defined networking and open source

01:54.120 --> 01:55.120
standards are important.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.200
Yeah, don't run away.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.500
Don't run away.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.200
I hope it may be applicable to your life.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.120
And then we'll have an interview with Heather and Chris.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.440
Heather's from the Linux Foundation,

02:02.440 --> 02:03.560
and Chris is from Ericsson.

02:03.560 --> 02:08.800
I think he's also sits on the Open Daylight project board.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.040
And they talk about why the Linux Foundation cares

02:12.040 --> 02:15.080
about this and a really cool continuous testing environment

02:15.080 --> 02:15.600
they set up.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.080
Remember that?

02:16.080 --> 02:17.040
Oh, yeah.

02:17.040 --> 02:17.640
That was cool.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.360
Yeah.

02:18.360 --> 02:22.120
Yeah, and that is it's geeky, it's nerdy, and it's so neat.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.760
So we'll be talking about that on today's episode

02:24.760 --> 02:25.960
of the Unplugged program.

02:25.960 --> 02:31.080
But before we go any further, we must bring in that mumble room.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.520
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.020
Hello.

02:34.020 --> 02:34.760
Time appropriate greetings.

02:34.760 --> 02:35.260
Hello.

02:35.260 --> 02:36.760
I secretly use Arch Linux.

02:36.760 --> 02:37.640
Hello, guys.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.000
It's good to have you here.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.380
Now, I don't know how many of you

02:40.380 --> 02:42.760
were able to make it last week because I couldn't hear you.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.520
Oh, I love you, Noah.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.680
But I did want to give a shout out to Noah for episode

02:46.680 --> 02:48.560
164 of the Unplugged program.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.480
Dial up Linux.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.980
Thanks, Brown Bear.

02:51.980 --> 02:54.360
Yeah, that was great because we were down at Open Daylight.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.080
And just as we were sort of wrapping up,

02:56.080 --> 02:57.480
I tuned in to the very end of the show.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, me too.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.480
And I think he was in full swing by then.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.600
Now, a lot of you have written in and said you loved it.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.880
Some of you have written in and said that, oh, my god,

03:06.880 --> 03:07.640
my head hurts.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.560
Don't ever change my Unplugged show again,

03:10.560 --> 03:12.360
which I thought was kind of funny because it's

03:12.360 --> 03:14.360
sort of a no-format show to begin with.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.600
I mean, we kind of have a formula we follow a bit,

03:16.600 --> 03:17.680
but that's just out of habit.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.480
It's about the closest to the actual, I mean.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.360
Yeah, but I thought that was pretty neat.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.160
Anybody in the mumble room, anybody have any directors

03:24.160 --> 03:26.320
hats that where they were wearing their hat?

03:26.320 --> 03:28.320
They're like, gosh, from a director's perspective,

03:28.320 --> 03:30.520
from a production perspective, or even

03:30.520 --> 03:32.760
from a listener's perspective?

03:32.760 --> 03:35.040
Do you have any feedback from the dial-in episode,

03:35.040 --> 03:37.280
the call-in edition of the Unplugged show?

03:37.280 --> 03:40.480
And keeping in mind that I think NOAA would very much

03:40.480 --> 03:43.180
like to spin this off into its own show one day.

03:43.180 --> 03:46.240
So this could eventually become its own separate additional

03:46.240 --> 03:47.340
Linux program.

03:47.340 --> 03:49.240
So if you have any thoughts on that, too, I'd like to hear it.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.640
I open it up to you, mumble room.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.320
There was only a few issues.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.200
The main thing is that the mumble group

03:55.200 --> 03:57.080
couldn't say anything.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.200
Right, yeah, there was.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.600
And I think he already has that figured out.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.800
So that tech problem is solved.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.560
I think he's got like a whole new audio rig to do it.

04:05.560 --> 04:06.720
He went all in.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.920
Other than that, it was great.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.600
Yeah, I thought what was really exciting about it

04:11.600 --> 04:15.080
is it really could potentially become, well, first of all,

04:15.080 --> 04:17.640
we have a pretty big base to pull from just by people

04:17.640 --> 04:19.920
that email into our shows asking us questions all the time.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.800
And if we just write back, yeah, that's a great question.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.400
Why don't you call in on Tuesday?

04:23.400 --> 04:25.360
Because a lot of the questions, there's

04:25.360 --> 04:27.000
one or two follow-up questions we have.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.360
You need a little dialogue, and you can really

04:28.360 --> 04:28.840
get to the heart of it.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.360
So there's already a good base there

04:30.360 --> 04:32.200
to pull from for calls.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.880
And then on top of that, the word

04:33.880 --> 04:35.440
could start spreading around that, hey,

04:35.440 --> 04:38.400
if you switch to Linux and you end up having a problem,

04:38.400 --> 04:40.320
there's this guy you can call, and he

04:40.320 --> 04:42.400
is all about getting people to use Linux,

04:42.400 --> 04:44.160
and he will totally help you.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.640
And that could be a really good thing for Linux.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.440
Probably got other people to do some time

04:49.440 --> 04:50.600
on there answering questions.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.640
Let's put it another way.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.520
The business side of Linux was interesting to me.

04:54.520 --> 04:55.800
Yeah, that's true.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.600
Now let's put that, here's another way to think of that.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.320
Imagine when you switch somebody to Linux.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.040
There could now be a support number

05:03.040 --> 05:04.760
that you could give them for them to call

05:04.760 --> 05:06.520
when they have problems.

05:06.520 --> 05:07.800
That would be pretty nice.

05:07.800 --> 05:08.800
Isn't that great?

05:08.800 --> 05:10.760
I really think the show has some potential

05:10.760 --> 05:12.600
to offer some benefit.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.000
So I thought, there's a lot I liked, a couple of things.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.720
I've already given Noah my feedback.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.320
So thank you to Noah for doing that.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.560
It's a 164 if you haven't heard it yet.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.920
Noah hosted while Wes and I were down to the Open Daylight

05:24.920 --> 05:26.200
Summit.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.800
And he took calls, answered questions.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.720
He had a call screener with a queue.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.160
I mean, he really went all out.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.240
And the other thing that's really cool about it

05:34.240 --> 05:36.200
is he's using free Linux software to do it all.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.080
Exactly.

05:37.080 --> 05:40.080
Now unless anybody else, I don't want to cut anybody out.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.840
Any other thoughts in the Mumble Room before we go?

05:42.840 --> 05:43.360
Yeah.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.320
OK.

05:44.320 --> 05:49.040
Like, I just want to reiterate what Michael said.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.880
Without the Mumble Room participating,

05:51.880 --> 05:54.960
it kind of felt boring to me.

05:54.960 --> 05:59.000
And I'm not saying the show is bad.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.680
I think if the Mumble Room was participating and helping Noah

06:02.680 --> 06:05.200
out, or they had some insight on it,

06:05.200 --> 06:07.800
it would have been a lot better of a show.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.480
If it was its own show, I could see people tuning into it

06:10.480 --> 06:12.920
for sure.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.840
Yeah, I mean, just for having the backup support,

06:14.840 --> 06:16.280
I think it's a good idea to have the Mumble Room there.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.000
And extra color.

06:17.000 --> 06:17.720
Yeah.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.560
Yeah, and just to break up the voices a little bit,

06:20.560 --> 06:22.720
Rekai points out, and I think this is something I think

06:22.720 --> 06:25.680
I mentioned to Noah myself, is voicemail during the week.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.920
So if calls run low or something like that,

06:27.920 --> 06:29.440
maybe we could just have voicemails

06:29.440 --> 06:30.400
that people can play.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.920
Noah definitely wants for live calls,

06:31.920 --> 06:34.080
so that way he can ask them back and forth questions.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.520
So that's a key thing.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.400
Maybe adding like a SIP endpoint so people

06:37.400 --> 06:38.680
can call directly over SIP.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.160
He could totally do that.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.320
That would be really nice and save some money.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.800
Because he was paying for, it was a 1-800 number,

06:45.800 --> 06:49.160
but that means he pays for the time.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.720
Which we'd have to figure that out too.

06:50.720 --> 06:51.960
So this looks really exciting.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.960
I think I've already got it downloaded on my machine,

06:54.960 --> 06:56.640
just not quite installed yet.

06:56.640 --> 07:00.440
KDE at 20 years old has released Plasma 5.8,

07:00.440 --> 07:02.520
and it is a long-term support edition.

07:02.520 --> 07:03.240
LTS.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.920
An LTS.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.680
Today, KDE releases its first long-term support edition

07:07.680 --> 07:09.680
of its flagship desktop software, Plasma.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.880
This marks the point where the developers and designers

07:11.880 --> 07:13.880
are happy to recommend Plasma for the widest

07:13.880 --> 07:16.840
possible audience, be they enterprise or non-techy home

07:16.840 --> 07:17.560
users.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.600
If you've tried a KDE desktop previously

07:19.600 --> 07:22.800
and have been moved away, now is the time

07:22.800 --> 07:26.480
to reassess Plasma is simple by default and powerful

07:26.480 --> 07:27.200
when needed.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.520
That feels like it's almost written specifically to me.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.040
Yeah, right?

07:30.040 --> 07:30.680
I think so.

07:30.680 --> 07:31.360
Yeah.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.200
I think that's that.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.920
You're one of those people that could be easily corded right

07:34.920 --> 07:35.440
back.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.880
Yeah, and I have tried it before and sort of walked away

07:38.880 --> 07:41.280
like a little, oh, well, I have this issue.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.040
I have that issue.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.160
I'm a little disappointed.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.240
And so they are kind of like, if you've been moved away,

07:45.240 --> 07:46.280
which is a good way to put it, too.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.320
Yeah, that is a good way to put it.

07:47.320 --> 07:47.920
Yeah.

07:47.920 --> 07:51.360
Anybody in the moment room have the 5.8 release yet?

07:51.360 --> 07:51.880
Yep.

07:51.880 --> 07:52.400
Really?

07:52.400 --> 07:52.880
You do.

07:52.880 --> 07:53.840
Welcome, Mr. Tonello.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.880
Tell me, what distro do you have it on,

07:55.880 --> 07:58.600
and what are your thoughts so far?

07:58.600 --> 07:59.520
Neon.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.440
Oh, yeah, of course.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.720
Yeah, that's what I've downloaded, too.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.120
Yeah.

08:02.120 --> 08:05.040
And what do you think so far?

08:05.040 --> 08:06.240
I think it's awesome.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.520
Like, Arch hasn't had it yet, so I couldn't test it on that.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.760
But Neon, it was like the day of immediately.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.880
It was actually available this morning

08:13.880 --> 08:16.000
before the announcement even happened.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.720
So I tested it on that.

08:17.720 --> 08:18.840
And it's really good.

08:18.840 --> 08:23.760
Like, it's very similar to 5.7.5, which I had on that Neon's

08:23.760 --> 08:25.720
install as well.

08:25.720 --> 08:29.120
But the upgrade from 5.7 to 5.8 was awesome,

08:29.120 --> 08:30.120
because it was super easy.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.080
It was just basically just an app upgrade, and that's it.

08:34.080 --> 08:38.000
But the coolest thing about it is just

08:38.000 --> 08:39.960
that there's nice polish now.

08:39.960 --> 08:43.360
Like, it's not like they added a ton of new features.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.640
It was mostly just polish.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.960
Yeah, I think that shows in the release notes.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.600
Yeah, they addressed a lot of things

08:48.600 --> 08:51.160
that are complaints from most people,

08:51.160 --> 08:53.760
like the whole MetaKey-only thing,

08:53.760 --> 08:59.160
or fixing some widgets controls for the audio controllers

08:59.160 --> 09:00.360
and stuff like that.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.280
And they added a lot of cool, interesting things,

09:02.280 --> 09:03.920
like the effort.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.680
Why would you want it, other than just being awesome,

09:06.680 --> 09:08.440
a video playing in the background when

09:08.440 --> 09:11.480
you log into your computer?

09:11.480 --> 09:13.360
But that is kind of one of those cool polish,

09:13.360 --> 09:16.360
you know, show off the Linux desktop, which we need sometimes.

09:16.360 --> 09:21.200
It's totally cool, and I did use it, and it is fun.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.520
It's not necessary, but it is really cool

09:23.520 --> 09:26.280
that you could change it in that extreme.

09:26.280 --> 09:26.920
Yeah, that's fair.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.520
Yeah, I agree.

09:29.520 --> 09:34.960
I had some idea of what the headline features would be,

09:34.960 --> 09:38.420
because I recorded the voiceover for the video weeks

09:38.420 --> 09:42.120
ago, and so I had an idea of what they were focusing on.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.840
And it was a good list of stuff, and I

09:43.840 --> 09:46.280
think it kind of does echo something

09:46.280 --> 09:47.640
they've been saying for a while.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.040
We will tell you definitively, because they've been saying this

09:50.040 --> 09:51.660
now for a little while, we will tell you definitively

09:51.660 --> 09:54.440
when it's ready for the average folk.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.480
Should I play the video?

09:55.480 --> 09:55.760
Sure.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.360
Even though it's myself, which is kind of weird?

09:57.360 --> 09:58.000
I'd say do it.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.560
Yeah, the EQing they've done is a little differently,

10:00.560 --> 10:02.040
so it doesn't quite sound.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.400
I don't know if it even quite sounds like me.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.440
You can be the judge.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.080
But I thought it was a great video that

10:06.080 --> 10:08.640
highlighted a lot of their features, which I kind of ribbed

10:08.640 --> 10:11.440
them about in the past when Five 7 or whatever came out.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.960
I said, you know, you really kind of need it.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.680
It's 2016, it's time to have a video.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.440
Up to production.

10:15.440 --> 10:19.280
Yeah, so they made me put my foot in my mouth,

10:19.280 --> 10:20.280
or what's that saying?

10:20.280 --> 10:22.000
What's it called when somebody calls you on your bus?

10:22.000 --> 10:22.760
Money where your mouth is.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.080
Huh?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.640
Money where my mouth is, yeah, except there

10:24.640 --> 10:25.920
was no money transaction here.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.080
But your video production skills where your mouth is.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.080
Metaphorical money.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.280
This was just done for the project.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.080
There was no money.

10:31.080 --> 10:34.120
So it's more like, yeah, internet cookie in my mouth

10:34.120 --> 10:35.080
or something like that.

10:35.080 --> 10:35.640
In my mouth.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.240
After a few hard months of work, the KDE community

10:38.240 --> 10:42.400
is pleased to announce Plasma 5.8 Long Term Support Edition.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.880
This version will be supported for at least 18 months.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.760
So if you haven't tried Plasma Desktop yet,

10:46.760 --> 10:50.460
take a look at some of its unique features.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.760
With desktop widgets, you can easily organize your files,

10:52.760 --> 10:57.240
monitor the system, and quickly launch favorite apps and more.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.320
Plasma lets you easily search your desktop

10:59.320 --> 11:01.880
for applications, folders, music, video files,

11:01.880 --> 11:04.520
everything you have.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.000
Plasma's default theme breeze has a unified look

11:07.000 --> 11:11.120
across all common application toolkits.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.760
Download wallpapers, window styles, widgets, desktop effects,

11:13.760 --> 11:15.720
and many other resources straight to your desktop

11:15.720 --> 11:18.760
from the KDE store.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.320
Using KDE Connect, you'll be notified on your desktop

11:21.320 --> 11:24.140
about text messages, can easily transfer files, and even

11:24.140 --> 11:25.720
use your phone as a remote control.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.680
Plasma is simple by default, but you

11:30.680 --> 11:33.240
can customize it however you like with new widgets, panels,

11:33.240 --> 11:34.440
screens, and styles.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.040
But this isn't all.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.000
Plasma 5.8 brings even more features and improvements

11:41.000 --> 11:41.800
to your desktop.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.120
This release brings an all-new artwork design,

11:47.120 --> 11:48.720
giving you a complete breeze startup

11:48.720 --> 11:51.920
to shut down experience.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.000
Support for Semitic right-to-left written

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.640
have been greatly improved.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.760
Plasma wallpaper plugins, such as slide shows

12:00.760 --> 12:03.560
and animated wallpapers, can now be used on the lock screen.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.400
Yeah, they did a rickroll.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.560
You can watch the whole video in the show notes

12:06.560 --> 12:08.280
if you want, it's a couple minutes long.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.600
So a pretty nice release.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.440
So I think I got it downloaded, and I

12:12.440 --> 12:14.480
think Noah's got it downloaded, and he's an LTS guy

12:14.480 --> 12:15.160
to begin with.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.360
This seems perfect for him.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.120
So I think we're going to give it a review on Sunday's

12:19.120 --> 12:20.720
Linux action show.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.040
Something to look forward to.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.000
Now we have kind of an interesting news item.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.720
It's a little name collision today.

12:27.720 --> 12:30.120
We're introducing Pixel, but not the Google Pixel,

12:30.120 --> 12:31.560
not the Google kind.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.960
No, this is the Raspberry Pi kind,

12:33.960 --> 12:36.480
and it's their new fancy-schmancy desktop

12:36.480 --> 12:38.880
environment.

12:38.880 --> 12:39.380
Where does it?

12:39.380 --> 12:40.720
I have a little definition somewhere here.

12:40.720 --> 12:41.880
What did Pixel stand for?

12:41.880 --> 12:42.640
Because I have the.

12:42.640 --> 12:43.320
Oh, here we go.

12:43.320 --> 12:47.320
Pi improved xWindows environment, comma, lightweight.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.000
Yeah, Pi improved xWindows environment, lightweight.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.680
And my main takeaway from it is it's not

12:53.680 --> 12:55.520
like it's some new X server or something like that.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.840
It's essentially a set of changes

12:56.840 --> 13:00.080
that entirely are around the appearance of the desktop.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.040
The first thing you'll notice when you reboot

13:02.040 --> 13:04.200
is they now have a nice, pretty splash screen

13:04.200 --> 13:05.880
that they say they've done a lot of work

13:05.880 --> 13:07.200
to not slow down the Pi.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.200
Once the desktop appears, you'll notice

13:09.200 --> 13:12.560
a nice, stunning background taken by one of their very own,

13:12.560 --> 13:14.480
and there's several of them preloaded.

13:14.480 --> 13:17.240
You'll also notice that the icons on the task bar menu

13:17.240 --> 13:19.600
and file manager have gotten a big makeover.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.760
Big improvement there.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.640
Sort of spiffing it up a little bit.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.880
If you open up a window, you'll see the window frame design

13:25.880 --> 13:27.240
has changed significantly.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.860
The old window design always looked a bit dated

13:28.860 --> 13:31.440
compared to what Apple and Microsoft are now shipping.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.440
So they were keen to update it.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.860
Windows now have subtle curves on the corners,

13:34.860 --> 13:38.400
clear title bars, new icons for the open, minimize,

13:38.400 --> 13:39.360
and close.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.520
Fonts have gotten improved, even with a mention to Steve Jobs.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.280
And this is an interesting one.

13:44.280 --> 13:48.780
On, I guess, request by a lot of Raspberry Pi users,

13:48.780 --> 13:51.440
they want to be able to shut off the wireless from within the UI.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.900
So now there are options in the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth menus

13:53.900 --> 13:55.920
to turn off relevant devices.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.040
Works with Pi 3's onboard wireless hardware.

13:59.040 --> 14:02.960
And should work on most external Wi-Fi and Bluetooth dongles.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.200
I like this.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.480
They're packaging in Chromium for the Pi

14:07.480 --> 14:09.600
with hardware acceleration.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.880
Yeah, so they're switching out from Epiphany to Chromium.

14:11.880 --> 14:14.520
Chromium for the Pi, which is the Pi's hardware

14:14.520 --> 14:16.380
accelerated playback for streaming content.

14:16.380 --> 14:17.080
That's pretty slick.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.200
Yeah, they're also including uBlock origin,

14:19.200 --> 14:22.440
adblock by default, H.265 extensions,

14:22.440 --> 14:24.320
which force YouTube to serve videos

14:24.320 --> 14:26.400
in a format which can be accelerated by the Pi's

14:26.400 --> 14:27.000
hardware.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.680
And it's available for download right now.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.280
That's awesome.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.160
Yeah, it is.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.660
It seems to be trying to make it a more user-friendly,

14:34.660 --> 14:35.880
out-of-the-box OS.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.760
But doesn't that sort of suggest?

14:40.520 --> 14:42.800
I guess one of the things I liked about Raspberry Pi

14:42.800 --> 14:45.640
was that it truly was divorced from any.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.020
I know that there's always been Raspbian and they've been close,

14:48.020 --> 14:51.680
but it always feels like there's been

14:51.680 --> 14:54.880
a divorce there between a distance,

14:54.880 --> 14:56.680
a separation of church and state, if you will,

14:56.680 --> 15:00.280
between the OS you run on and the Raspberry Pi hardware.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.120
I understand that they ship it sometimes

15:02.120 --> 15:05.720
with an SD card preloaded, but that didn't necessarily

15:05.720 --> 15:08.280
mean that there was an OS all of a sudden that they were

15:08.280 --> 15:10.400
going to start throwing in behind to try to promote

15:10.400 --> 15:14.120
as the primary OS you run all the time on a Raspberry Pi.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.160
Maybe I misunderstood?

15:15.160 --> 15:17.160
I mean, I guess that's true, but I

15:17.160 --> 15:19.440
don't know if that is really changed with this.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.680
I mean, maybe it feels more that way,

15:21.680 --> 15:24.320
but I feel like a lot of people who use it who aren't more

15:24.320 --> 15:26.280
experienced, aren't the power users,

15:26.280 --> 15:29.040
aren't using it in a project that they know right away,

15:29.040 --> 15:32.000
or maybe using it more just to play with, or there's a desktop,

15:32.000 --> 15:33.240
they're going to follow one of the guides that

15:33.240 --> 15:35.400
has them install one of the easier operating systems.

15:35.400 --> 15:39.640
So in that effect, there kind of is already a default.

15:39.640 --> 15:43.040
But I mean, there's not really because of the,

15:43.040 --> 15:45.920
this doesn't change anything as far as how stuff is installed,

15:45.920 --> 15:48.400
because most people are still going to use Noobs,

15:48.400 --> 15:51.680
the Noobs installer, because it's such an easy process

15:51.680 --> 15:53.120
to get installed.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.320
And this is not going to be like only this,

15:56.320 --> 16:00.600
and just they're still having OpenELEC, and PyDora,

16:00.600 --> 16:02.400
and all this other stuff, and Noobs.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.200
And it is nice that this will be better.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.160
I mean, just making it look better

16:07.160 --> 16:09.400
for having LXDE, because LXDE is about to fall.

16:09.400 --> 16:09.880
Sure, yeah.

16:09.880 --> 16:10.520
I mean, I agree.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.720
And that is a good thing, absolutely.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.720
I'm not by any way saying that's not a good thing.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.200
But Wimby, I'm kind of curious what your thoughts are,

16:16.200 --> 16:19.040
because I know that Ubuntu Mate is extremely popular

16:19.040 --> 16:20.000
on the Raspberry Pi.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.160
So it's a device you probably have some experience with.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.000
Does this seem like a good move, something

16:24.000 --> 16:26.960
that's worth their time?

16:26.960 --> 16:31.480
Yeah, well, how do I answer this without coming

16:31.480 --> 16:33.840
across overly negative?

16:33.840 --> 16:38.080
The first thing is I think that the browser work with Chromium

16:38.080 --> 16:42.080
and the video acceleration is probably

16:42.080 --> 16:45.320
the most relevant and interesting stuff

16:45.320 --> 16:47.160
come out of this initiative.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.280
I think that's brilliant.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.640
And I'm looking forward to finding the time

16:50.640 --> 16:52.560
to have a little look around and see

16:52.560 --> 16:55.880
how that's been implemented to see what I can borrow

16:55.880 --> 16:58.720
from what they've done there.

16:58.720 --> 17:02.440
The name collision is unfortunate.

17:02.440 --> 17:07.320
And how that happened, I just can't imagine that seems.

17:07.320 --> 17:09.560
Yeah, we've known the name Pixel now for.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.040
I know.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.400
We had the Google Pixel as a re-envision

17:14.400 --> 17:16.040
of the already existing Google Pixel,

17:16.040 --> 17:18.800
so they didn't really need to do that.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.440
And they chose the, it was a backer in it,

17:21.440 --> 17:23.200
they picked Pixel in the first place

17:23.200 --> 17:24.480
and tried to make it work.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:25.800
Yeah.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.240
So that's.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.600
Still, though, that doesn't necessarily

17:29.600 --> 17:30.520
mean you have to go with the name.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.880
But yeah, the naming collision is confusing.

17:33.880 --> 17:38.000
Yeah, and the thing I'm a little bit perplexed about,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.200
if you read the blog post, there's a couple of things

17:40.200 --> 17:42.120
that stand out from this.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.760
And that's that the guy that's done this,

17:43.760 --> 17:45.840
and he's clearly put a lot of work into it,

17:45.840 --> 17:49.280
he acknowledges that when he started on this,

17:49.280 --> 17:55.080
he had little to no experience with Linux and X and X

17:55.080 --> 17:57.280
desktops and all the rest of it.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.320
And it looks like two years of effort

18:00.320 --> 18:03.640
have gone into this based on LXDE

18:03.640 --> 18:05.880
that people in the Linux community

18:05.880 --> 18:11.720
know is yesterday's news is the thing that's being replaced.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.400
So they've poured effort into this,

18:14.400 --> 18:18.640
and it's immediately laden with technical debt.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.160
And I think that that's really unfortunate that they've

18:22.160 --> 18:27.680
built this around something that is effectively obsolete now.

18:27.680 --> 18:31.440
And I think the art and the fonts and the icons

18:31.440 --> 18:33.480
all look really good.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.760
But there are also open source licensed theme packs

18:36.760 --> 18:41.640
and icons out there that are also very, very good.

18:41.640 --> 18:42.800
They're free to use.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.800
It felt like, to me, it was a lot of work

18:44.800 --> 18:48.080
on a system that doesn't have a lot of legs.

18:48.080 --> 18:52.680
And it sounds to me also like it is the beginning of something

18:52.680 --> 18:53.520
much larger.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.800
Because the way they phrase it in the blog post is,

18:55.800 --> 18:58.440
currently we focused on appearance.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.880
But it sounds like the overall goal

18:59.880 --> 19:02.760
is to make a faster, more dynamic desktop.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.960
And part of the name, part of the backronym

19:04.960 --> 19:07.640
includes the X to the.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.000
It felt to me as if they were going

19:10.000 --> 19:14.760
to do everything they could to make it faster on X with LXDE.

19:14.760 --> 19:18.960
And I thought to myself, well, why LXDE and why X11?

19:18.960 --> 19:20.920
Why are you going to invest in these things?

19:20.920 --> 19:23.400
Why is that where you standardize, where you focus?

19:23.400 --> 19:25.440
And that new boot screen they worked on,

19:25.440 --> 19:27.240
it probably took a hell of a lot of work.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.660
Because like Wimpy said, they spent a lot of time working

19:29.660 --> 19:30.760
on that particular thing.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.320
It's a very X-focused project.

19:33.320 --> 19:38.640
So it does feel like investing on the past of Linux

19:38.640 --> 19:41.720
when the Raspberry Pi is such a future-looking device, when

19:41.720 --> 19:45.180
it comes to resources, availability, the ARM

19:45.180 --> 19:47.800
platform, the price.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.160
Right, yeah, exactly.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.880
It seems to be sort of a mismatch.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.920
It does seem like a mismatch.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.840
Or perhaps just like things that could have been efforts

19:55.840 --> 19:58.200
that perhaps would have been better in projects more

19:58.200 --> 19:59.780
tightly knit with the community or that

19:59.780 --> 20:02.120
have existing communities.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.780
It kind of feels like they chose LXDE because just

20:04.780 --> 20:07.920
for the sake of lightness, not for like,

20:07.920 --> 20:11.480
basically ignoring everything else.

20:11.480 --> 20:12.720
Yeah, you could be right.

20:12.720 --> 20:15.320
Yeah, or just momentum.

20:15.320 --> 20:16.440
They have momentum there.

20:16.440 --> 20:17.400
That could be that.

20:17.400 --> 20:22.720
It's weird because LXDE is only like 10% lighter than MATE.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.920
Yeah, we've had that debate.

20:23.920 --> 20:24.520
And I agree.

20:24.520 --> 20:27.880
I think it also, you could make a lot of different desktops

20:27.880 --> 20:30.720
lighter or heavier depending on how you configure them.

20:30.720 --> 20:33.040
And also, we've been looking at LXQt

20:33.040 --> 20:34.640
and looking at where its resources are.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.200
And yeah, there's a little more there.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.680
You're looking at a Raspberry Pi 3.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.900
That's the desktop to watch right now.

20:40.900 --> 20:41.400
I agree.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.440
Really, really interesting.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.400
Besides MATE, MATE.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.000
Well, all Unity.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.040
Yeah, apparently, maybe there's hope for Unity after all.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.220
All right, well, I want to move into something

20:55.220 --> 20:57.640
that I know Wimpy is going to be fired up about, real fired up

20:57.640 --> 20:58.280
about.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.440
So before we get there, before we go too much further,

21:00.440 --> 21:01.860
we've got a big show coming up.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.860
And I want to thank DigitalOcean for making it possible.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.400
I want to thank all of you who use our promo code DOUNPLUGED.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.360
It's one word.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.640
Lowercase, you apply it to your account,

21:08.640 --> 21:09.800
you get a $10 credit.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.840
That's a vote to keep us on the air.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.760
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider

21:13.760 --> 21:16.340
dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you

21:16.340 --> 21:18.840
to spin up a server on their crazy great infrastructure.

21:18.840 --> 21:19.920
Their pricing is nuts.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.760
It's super valuable for the kind of rigs you get

21:21.760 --> 21:22.960
and the performance you can get.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.680
They've got data centers in New York, San Francisco,

21:24.680 --> 21:27.240
Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, Germany, India.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.840
I think I'm even missing one in there now.

21:28.840 --> 21:29.600
Any more data centers?

21:29.600 --> 21:30.920
You're going to run out of breath there, Chris.

21:30.920 --> 21:31.480
No.

21:31.480 --> 21:32.520
No, bring it.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.280
Bring it!

21:33.280 --> 21:34.120
Bring it!

21:34.120 --> 21:36.000
Also, their interface, it's the best.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.920
They have a really great intuitive control panel.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.080
It gets me fired up about DigitalOcean.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.160
Go over there and try it.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.040
And then one of the nice things is

21:43.040 --> 21:47.240
they have a really beautiful, well-documented, elegant,

21:47.240 --> 21:49.000
listen to me, let me throw, what else can I throw in there?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.280
Come on, give me another word, Wes.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.320
Elegant.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.160
Simple.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.160
Well-designed.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.800
Oh yeah, there you go.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.280
Kind of need another, I need another buzz term.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.120
Blue.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.360
Blue, sure.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.840
No, that's not, no, that's not good.

21:59.840 --> 22:00.920
Cloudy, oh, cloudy.

22:00.920 --> 22:05.360
Yeah, cloudy, manageable, scalable.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.080
Oh, I'm on fire, Wes, I've got it.

22:07.080 --> 22:07.960
I'm back in the flow.

22:07.960 --> 22:08.920
Enterprise-friendly.

22:08.920 --> 22:12.000
Yeah, ready, secure, implementable, auditable.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.440
Oh, measurable!

22:13.440 --> 22:15.200
I got it all, Wes.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.160
But really, the DigitalOcean API, what's great about it

22:17.160 --> 22:19.720
is it's well-documented and there's a ton of code

22:19.720 --> 22:21.520
already written you can take advantage of.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.080
In fact, when you look over there

22:23.080 --> 22:24.680
at their community projects page,

22:24.680 --> 22:27.640
one that might jump out at you if you are a Unity user

22:27.640 --> 22:29.640
is the DigitalOcean indicator.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.480
This indicator allows you to manage and manage

22:31.480 --> 22:34.480
your droplets directly from your panel, fool.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.320
You can quickly see which droplets are active.

22:36.320 --> 22:39.040
You can reboot, power on, power down your droplets.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.960
You can copy your droplet's IP like a boost for easy access.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.040
And of course, there's all kinds

22:44.040 --> 22:45.920
of other great code already written.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.840
You can just take advantage of it.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.760
Use our promo code DOUNPLUG, get a $10 credit.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.920
Go spend up a $5 rig, guys.

22:50.920 --> 22:53.160
$5 dollar dollar rig over at digitalocean.com.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.720
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG and a big thank you

22:56.640 --> 22:58.480
to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

22:58.480 --> 23:00.520
the Linux Unplugged program.

23:00.520 --> 23:01.360
Woo-woo.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.120
All right, Wimpy, don't lie.

23:03.120 --> 23:08.120
You're totally stoked about Jah-kasha?

23:08.800 --> 23:09.640
Jahshaka.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.480
Jahshaka!

23:10.480 --> 23:11.320
Who now?

23:11.320 --> 23:14.480
Now, this is a VR world creator that allows.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.800
Oh, move on.

23:15.800 --> 23:19.400
All right, and it's GPL, moving on.

23:19.400 --> 23:23.320
So, this is actually a story that's worth talking about.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.960
Unsafe at any clock speed, the Linux security,

23:25.960 --> 23:29.160
the Linux kernel security needs a rethinking.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.400
This is ours reporting

23:30.400 --> 23:33.320
for the Linux kernel security summit.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.560
And here is how they start it up.

23:35.560 --> 23:36.600
This is how they spin it up.

23:36.600 --> 23:40.040
The Linux kernel today faces an unprecedented safety crisis.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.280
Much like when Ralph Nader famously told

23:42.280 --> 23:44.840
the American public that their cars were unsafe

23:44.840 --> 23:46.880
at any speed back in 1965,

23:46.880 --> 23:49.320
numerous security developers told the 2016 Linux

23:49.320 --> 23:52.080
security summit in Toronto that the operating system

23:52.080 --> 23:57.080
needs a total rethink to keep it fit for its purpose.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.320
AKA, not fit for the gerb.

23:59.320 --> 24:00.520
Strong words.

24:00.520 --> 24:05.040
Cars were designed to run, but not to fail.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.120
This is Kees Cook.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.640
He's the head of the Linux kernel self-protection project

24:08.640 --> 24:12.960
at Googs, and he's an employee that's working at Googs

24:12.960 --> 24:16.240
on the future of internet things security,

24:16.240 --> 24:17.200
whatever that means.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.520
And he said at the summit that while it's very comfortable

24:20.520 --> 24:22.120
while you're driving to go down the road,

24:22.120 --> 24:25.120
as soon as you crashed, everybody died in these old cars.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.680
That's not acceptable anymore, he added.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.000
And in a similar fashion, Linux kernel needs to deal

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
with attacks in a manner where it actually is expecting them

24:34.000 --> 24:36.680
and actually handles them gracefully in some fashion

24:37.760 --> 24:39.360
when it's being attacked.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.740
Like don't just do your, he goes to point out

24:41.740 --> 24:43.920
we approach security today as though we are just still

24:43.920 --> 24:47.000
living in the world of the 1990s and 2000s.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
Computers in a data center managed by knowledgeable people.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.680
But most computers today, laptops, smartphones,

24:55.680 --> 24:57.580
and internet of things devices are not managed

24:57.580 --> 24:58.880
and secured by internet.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.560
Boy, that last category. By IT professionals.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.560
Especially, right?

25:01.560 --> 25:02.400
Yeah.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.280
And he points out that so the kernel has to be designed

25:06.280 --> 25:07.800
in a way that it assumes it's going to be attacked.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.800
And then he kind of rubs it in with some stats and details

25:10.800 --> 25:13.220
and ours sort of does a beautiful job of summarizing this

25:13.220 --> 25:15.140
if you guys want to check out the link in the show notes.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.160
The clear consensus at the Linux Security Summit

25:17.160 --> 25:21.120
was that the squashing of bugs is a losing strategy.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.600
Many deployed devices running Linux will never receive

25:23.600 --> 25:26.940
security updates and patching a security hole

25:26.940 --> 25:30.200
in the upstream kernel code does nothing to ensure

25:30.200 --> 25:32.080
the safety of an internet of things device

25:32.080 --> 25:34.080
that could be used for a decade

25:34.080 --> 25:37.240
and may forever be ignored by the manufacturer.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.260
Exactly, right.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.480
We've seen this with routers,

25:40.480 --> 25:42.240
we see this with Android devices.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.240
There's only going to be more.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.600
I'm sure Chromecast will be like,

25:44.600 --> 25:46.200
we started the show talking about Chromecast,

25:46.200 --> 25:48.840
I'm sure Chromecast will be in this category one day.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.560
Worse, the average lifetime of a critical security bug

25:52.560 --> 25:55.920
in the Linux kernel from introduction during a code commit

25:55.920 --> 25:58.960
to public discovery and having a patch issued

25:58.960 --> 26:02.800
averages three years or more.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.180
This is why everybody should be rolling.

26:04.180 --> 26:05.940
According to Cook's analysis,

26:05.940 --> 26:07.760
critical and high severity security bugs

26:07.760 --> 26:12.760
in the upstream kernel have lifespans of 3 to 3.3 years

26:12.760 --> 26:16.380
to 6.4 years between commit and discovery.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.600
That's kind of a long time to be out there circulating.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.520
That's a new graph we've got here too though.

26:20.520 --> 26:25.520
Yeah, including they have some pie charts here

26:25.520 --> 26:27.500
where they're looking at Android security bugs

26:27.500 --> 26:29.640
and they're looking at where most Android

26:29.640 --> 26:30.920
vulnerabilities come from

26:30.920 --> 26:34.140
and this is an interesting statistic.

26:34.140 --> 26:37.020
Only 15% of vulnerabilities in Android's kernel

26:37.020 --> 26:40.920
came from upstream, only 15%.

26:40.920 --> 26:44.240
85% of the bugs in the Android kernel

26:44.240 --> 26:47.120
came from device driver manufacturers.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.360
Sounds just like Windows.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.560
It does sound the other way.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.740
So he says the kernel maintainers

26:52.740 --> 26:54.360
have to get ready for this kind of thing.

26:54.360 --> 26:57.720
They have to build Linux to be expected for attacks.

26:57.720 --> 26:59.200
To get it ready, you're gonna get attacked,

26:59.200 --> 27:01.280
so just design in a way

27:01.280 --> 27:03.600
where it can sort of manage that situation.

27:03.600 --> 27:07.000
It's funny how much this is a symptom of Linux success.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.800
Now that it's everywhere, you have to start designing

27:08.800 --> 27:10.480
for that and it will be used in situations

27:10.480 --> 27:11.440
where people don't understand it

27:11.440 --> 27:12.560
or really know what's happening

27:12.560 --> 27:14.720
and you have to plan for all of that.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.220
And especially when you're gonna be in these,

27:16.220 --> 27:18.540
they're gonna be built in so many embedded devices

27:18.540 --> 27:19.880
that just sit on the shelf.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.920
I think the line in there that sort of hit me the best

27:24.920 --> 27:27.720
is that bug fixing is just not enough.

27:27.720 --> 27:31.600
And because of enterprises where they have slow patch cycles

27:31.600 --> 27:35.680
and device manufacturers who don't properly update,

27:35.680 --> 27:38.160
we have Linux out there in these devices

27:38.160 --> 27:41.000
where there's this really long tail of production

27:41.000 --> 27:42.760
because they just work.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.440
They just frickin' work forever.

27:44.440 --> 27:46.280
Yeah, you don't need a super RAM upgrade

27:46.280 --> 27:47.360
or whatever in your tiny...

27:47.360 --> 27:49.160
And so that just means it's hanging out there

27:49.160 --> 27:51.260
with its fly down for years.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.880
It's got its D swinging in the wing.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.560
I think it's nice to see more talks about this

27:55.560 --> 27:57.200
because obviously a couple years ago,

27:57.200 --> 27:58.660
there's lots of complaints in the community

27:58.660 --> 28:01.680
and from outside people just about, you know.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.360
It did feel like it was like the 90s or 2000s,

28:03.360 --> 28:04.720
like it was a bunch of people just making this kernel,

28:04.720 --> 28:05.560
they were just making it work

28:05.560 --> 28:08.160
without really considering the full market effect.

28:08.160 --> 28:09.520
And obviously that's hard when it's built

28:09.520 --> 28:10.480
in this open source way,

28:10.480 --> 28:12.120
but it's nice to see that people

28:12.120 --> 28:14.160
are really paying it full attention.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.240
Yeah, and what kind of changes will Linux have to make

28:16.240 --> 28:17.240
in order to stay competitive?

28:17.240 --> 28:18.360
If it doesn't make those changes,

28:18.360 --> 28:19.620
will another kernel come along

28:19.620 --> 28:21.080
for these types of devices that does?

28:21.080 --> 28:22.280
And I hope they can do a good job

28:22.280 --> 28:23.640
of looking at other kernels,

28:23.640 --> 28:25.520
other projects that are more security focused.

28:25.520 --> 28:28.400
OpenBSD comes to mind or GR Security people

28:28.400 --> 28:30.320
and try to incorporate some of those approaches.

28:30.320 --> 28:33.000
Yeah, and what are they doing that is more proactive

28:33.000 --> 28:34.240
and not just squashing bugs?

28:34.240 --> 28:35.620
Exactly. Yeah.

28:35.620 --> 28:39.200
Inigo says, this seems like bad journalism

28:39.200 --> 28:40.960
and thinking that developers are robots.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.080
Well, it's coming from the developer community

28:43.080 --> 28:44.980
and they're just saying, we need to rethink,

28:44.980 --> 28:46.800
we can't just treat fixing bugs as...

28:46.800 --> 28:48.080
So Linus was quoted as saying,

28:48.080 --> 28:49.500
he doesn't look at security bugs

28:49.500 --> 28:50.880
and regular bugs separately

28:50.880 --> 28:52.680
because they're all just bugs that need fixed.

28:52.680 --> 28:57.040
And there is absolutely some nice sound logic behind that.

28:57.040 --> 28:59.560
But at the same time, there is also a conversation,

28:59.560 --> 29:03.060
I think a conversation worth having around,

29:03.060 --> 29:07.240
how do we design this thing to be planned to get attacked?

29:07.240 --> 29:08.160
How does this thing operate

29:08.160 --> 29:09.400
when it knows it's gonna get attacked?

29:09.400 --> 29:11.360
It's not just, it's gonna assume

29:11.360 --> 29:13.120
that once you're inside, everything's trusted.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.600
How do we design this thing a little bit differently?

29:14.600 --> 29:15.560
What can we tweak?

29:15.560 --> 29:17.520
I think that might be worth discussing.

29:18.860 --> 29:20.180
We'll see.

29:20.180 --> 29:21.560
Yeah, I agree. A lot coming out of Google,

29:21.560 --> 29:22.700
security wise.

29:22.700 --> 29:25.920
Project Zero, they have their own fork of OpenSSL.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.640
They have this guy who's working

29:27.640 --> 29:30.040
on the Internet of Things future security.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.300
And they're attending Linux events.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.280
I mean, there's a lot, Google's really focused

29:34.280 --> 29:35.240
on this right now.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.440
They're putting some money in this.

29:36.440 --> 29:38.480
Well, I feel like they're trying to be

29:38.480 --> 29:40.360
in the consumer space and the vendor space

29:40.360 --> 29:42.400
and people say, security is a huge thing

29:42.400 --> 29:43.720
that you can be audited for,

29:43.720 --> 29:45.600
you need to have to do this yourself.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.000
All right, I wanted to ask the mummer room

29:47.000 --> 29:48.640
because there was a thread on RLinux

29:48.640 --> 29:52.440
submitted a few days ago by Dark Delta or something like that.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.640
I can't remember the guy's name.

29:53.640 --> 29:54.720
Darko Delta or something.

29:54.720 --> 29:57.040
And he asks, what are things that you would do

29:57.920 --> 29:58.760
to change Linux?

29:58.760 --> 30:00.280
Like if you could just snap your fingers

30:00.280 --> 30:01.320
and change something about Linux.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.640
So we were just talking about the security thing

30:02.640 --> 30:05.200
and that's what made me think about this.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.080
If you could change anything,

30:06.080 --> 30:08.040
and I want to really throw it to the mumble room,

30:08.040 --> 30:10.600
but I'll give you an example.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.660
Like it was pointed out,

30:14.560 --> 30:16.320
this security thing could be something that you have.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.680
If you could just snap your fingers

30:17.680 --> 30:19.360
and change how a security is done, would you change it?

30:19.360 --> 30:20.200
What about you, Wes?

30:20.200 --> 30:21.480
If you could snap your fingers,

30:21.480 --> 30:23.760
is there something you would change about Linux?

30:25.760 --> 30:26.660
Hmm.

30:26.660 --> 30:27.500
You like it.

30:27.500 --> 30:28.640
I mean, I do like most things.

30:28.640 --> 30:32.060
I think there could be something to said about a better,

30:33.160 --> 30:35.600
not closeness, but there's something about right now,

30:35.600 --> 30:37.040
I feel like, especially just like the,

30:37.040 --> 30:40.360
even though there is like the core funding initiatives

30:40.360 --> 30:42.160
and that kind of stuff, there's this disconnect.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.960
Like I feel like we talk about the kernel a lot,

30:43.960 --> 30:47.000
but are we excited as about like core utilities development

30:47.000 --> 30:49.440
or a lot of the other parts of the user land?

30:49.440 --> 30:51.640
And then the BSDs kind of have that a little more rolled in.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.840
It's just cohesive.

30:52.840 --> 30:53.800
And I wouldn't say that change that

30:53.800 --> 30:55.200
because I think in some ways it's really cool, right?

30:55.200 --> 30:57.080
We have different C libraries.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.440
Over the long haul could be good, but yeah.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.280
Okay, I follow.

31:00.280 --> 31:01.400
I wonder if there could be a better ecosystem in there.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.720
All right, let's pull the crank and ask the mumble room.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.400
Mr. Tanel, I believe I heard you.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.640
Did you have something you wanted to mention

31:09.640 --> 31:10.480
you would change?

31:11.480 --> 31:13.960
Yeah, the most important first thing

31:13.960 --> 31:15.760
that came to mind is universal apps.

31:17.400 --> 31:18.680
Snap packages for all.

31:18.680 --> 31:19.800
Ooh, yeah.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.240
App pack and flat pack.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.080
Haven't you heard of Docker?

31:22.080 --> 31:22.920
You don't even care.

31:22.920 --> 31:23.740
He actually doesn't even care.

31:23.740 --> 31:25.120
He just wants everybody to use it, right?

31:25.120 --> 31:26.960
I don't care which one is successful.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.720
I just want one to be successful

31:28.720 --> 31:32.720
so that game developers, software developers,

31:32.720 --> 31:33.680
doesn't matter.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.040
They all have one thing to work on.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.120
And no matter what distro you choose,

31:37.120 --> 31:40.000
you can use the software that's made for the ecosystem.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.040
Let's see, I wanna ask William if he's near his mic,

31:43.040 --> 31:44.280
but I'll give him a chance to think about it.

31:44.280 --> 31:46.520
I'd like to hear from WW too, but Wimpy,

31:46.520 --> 31:48.260
I gotta go to you since you're a distro maker.

31:48.260 --> 31:49.720
You know I was gonna ask you this.

31:49.720 --> 31:51.400
If there was something you could snap your fingers

31:51.400 --> 31:53.920
and change, would it be something about Linux itself?

31:53.920 --> 31:55.680
Would it be something about the community,

31:55.680 --> 31:57.400
the way we collaborate?

31:57.400 --> 31:59.200
What would you change?

31:59.200 --> 32:00.840
This is a really tough question.

32:00.840 --> 32:01.680
I agree.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.640
To think of one thing.

32:04.600 --> 32:09.440
I'll be honest, I've got nothing solid in my mind

32:09.440 --> 32:11.680
that I'm just gonna say this is the one thing.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.000
I can think of lots of little things,

32:14.000 --> 32:15.920
but no one big thing.

32:15.920 --> 32:18.720
So ask around and if I come up with something,

32:18.720 --> 32:19.560
I'll let you know.

32:19.560 --> 32:20.800
That's how I actually feel myself,

32:20.800 --> 32:22.360
is I don't have one thing.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.320
I could think of the way the community interacts

32:24.320 --> 32:27.320
from time to time, the way we process information.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.900
I suppose, okay, I have one.

32:30.900 --> 32:31.740
I have one.

32:31.740 --> 32:32.560
All right, I have one.

32:32.560 --> 32:33.400
I'll save it.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.440
William, do you happen to have one by any chance?

32:36.360 --> 32:37.320
I don't think so.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.320
Go on once, go on twice.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.480
What about you, Mr. WW?

32:39.480 --> 32:41.360
Do you have one by any chance?

32:41.360 --> 32:44.200
I do have one and it's kind of been a pet peeve of mine

32:44.200 --> 32:48.520
since like the 90, well, since I first started

32:48.520 --> 32:52.680
in getting into Linux with my friends back in the 90s.

32:52.680 --> 32:56.360
And that is, I would remove the mindset of people

32:56.360 --> 32:59.680
that they think that they should be running Linux

32:59.680 --> 33:01.720
on old hardware all the time,

33:01.720 --> 33:06.720
or this is the best way to do things because it's not.

33:06.920 --> 33:11.560
This old hardware is holding us back and supporting it

33:11.560 --> 33:15.520
and just keeping it around and it's just,

33:15.520 --> 33:19.480
it's an old kind of way of thinking about the kernel

33:19.480 --> 33:23.620
and development of Linux and not really letting us focus

33:23.620 --> 33:24.460
on newer things.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.280
So it's a mindset.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.120
Yeah, a mindset.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.920
All right, okay, I can follow that.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.680
Mohs and Rath, you had one around collaboration.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.680
Yeah, I was thinking that it'd be nice if,

33:34.680 --> 33:37.160
because if you take a look at, say, DistroWatch,

33:37.160 --> 33:39.960
all those different distros that you could say

33:39.960 --> 33:40.960
didn't make it.

33:40.960 --> 33:44.720
If you could somehow, I guess you would need

33:44.720 --> 33:47.640
the most powerful in the universe, right,

33:47.640 --> 33:50.640
American greenbacks, go and hunt down,

33:50.640 --> 33:54.720
say like 50, 100 of those people worked on these things

33:54.720 --> 33:55.920
and it just never really took off.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.360
You get all of those people,

33:57.360 --> 33:58.760
because they all had ideas.

33:58.760 --> 34:02.000
Maybe they didn't have quite the chops individually,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.040
but you get a legion of them, right?

34:04.040 --> 34:07.480
And you just put them on to, say, different distros

34:07.480 --> 34:10.440
which have made it, say like one of the top 20.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.720
Not necessarily one of the top 10,

34:11.720 --> 34:13.680
because those ones are usually backed by companies,

34:13.680 --> 34:16.160
but you say one of the top 20 that doesn't have

34:16.160 --> 34:17.960
a huge company behind it,

34:17.960 --> 34:21.360
and you just have that legion of, literally,

34:21.360 --> 34:23.720
of wisdom, of experience, of knowledge,

34:23.720 --> 34:26.320
all focusing together in terms of,

34:26.320 --> 34:28.120
hey, my project didn't work,

34:28.120 --> 34:29.960
all of our projects individually didn't work,

34:29.960 --> 34:32.520
but we get together as a team.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.360
It's sort of like when you're lifting a log,

34:34.360 --> 34:36.720
one person by themselves, that's gonna be real difficult.

34:36.720 --> 34:39.200
You get 10, 20 of them, all of them,

34:39.200 --> 34:42.280
also a couple of them say, dig a hole here,

34:42.280 --> 34:44.000
couple of them say, get some rope here,

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
and all of a sudden, you can lift a whole bunch of logs

34:47.000 --> 34:49.680
and make a nice little anything that you want with them,

34:49.680 --> 34:54.080
because now you have a team of people all in one,

34:54.080 --> 34:57.520
as the song says, one pimped-struck groove

34:57.520 --> 34:59.000
to actually make it work.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.120
Oh, I'm getting a little inspired.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.840
Mozenrath, that open-sauce runs deep.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.920
That's a good one, I like that.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.480
I'll give you mine.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.840
I got two, I was thinking about it.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.800
Number one is not a huge one,

35:10.800 --> 35:12.720
but I think it would better serve the Linux community

35:12.720 --> 35:15.520
how they inform themselves, how they come to opinions,

35:15.520 --> 35:17.720
and about what technologies they'd back

35:17.720 --> 35:19.960
if we could get our heads out of our ass

35:19.960 --> 35:22.600
and drop the whole cult of personality.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.060
It's something that Aaron Seigo wrote about years ago.

35:25.060 --> 35:26.600
I continue to think about it.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.180
There are personalities out there

35:28.180 --> 35:29.960
that people believe the things they say

35:29.960 --> 35:32.440
simply because they have a name they've heard of

35:32.440 --> 35:35.480
or somebody they've, that thing drives me nuts

35:35.480 --> 35:38.280
because it allows people to get led around like sheeps.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.720
And all of it, even people who are technically proficient,

35:40.720 --> 35:43.080
like somebody I respect, like Lenart,

35:43.080 --> 35:46.800
who I thought made a lot of great cognitive arguments

35:46.800 --> 35:48.820
for System D, there were still people

35:48.820 --> 35:49.840
who would just pick up pitchforks

35:49.840 --> 35:52.200
because Lenart was for something or because,

35:52.200 --> 35:53.720
on either side.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.480
So that would be one thing I would change.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.440
The other thing I would like to change, I think,

35:57.440 --> 36:01.120
is how involved the community is with funding.

36:01.120 --> 36:04.160
They're very involved with code, documentation,

36:04.160 --> 36:06.200
and especially evangelism.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.520
I would really love to see more money where our mouths are

36:09.520 --> 36:11.760
in terms of funding open source projects,

36:11.760 --> 36:16.360
contributing to them, and allowing the public

36:16.360 --> 36:18.980
to fund things that deserve better focus,

36:18.980 --> 36:21.880
better surfacing, so that way the projects

36:21.880 --> 36:23.200
and the outlets that are funded

36:23.200 --> 36:25.680
by maybe certain media backers

36:25.680 --> 36:27.140
or certain corporate sponsors

36:27.140 --> 36:28.420
that currently have a louder voice

36:28.420 --> 36:29.920
or currently have a larger presence

36:29.920 --> 36:32.200
could be more properly competed with

36:32.200 --> 36:34.760
by smaller independent news outlets

36:34.760 --> 36:36.540
and open source projects

36:36.540 --> 36:38.280
in a way that's on a more competitive advantage

36:38.280 --> 36:40.640
and it's up to the audience to kind of step up for that.

36:40.640 --> 36:44.160
And if I could change one damn thing,

36:44.160 --> 36:46.000
it would be to have more Linux users

36:46.000 --> 36:48.720
and more open source users contributing money financially

36:48.720 --> 36:50.760
back upstream to the projects

36:50.760 --> 36:52.540
and the things that they use,

36:52.540 --> 36:54.340
and maybe the content they consume.

36:55.260 --> 36:57.800
You kind of get a nice perspective for it all

36:57.800 --> 36:58.920
when you look at this website

36:58.920 --> 37:01.240
that I've sort of been obsessed with

37:01.240 --> 37:03.520
that Wes linked to me.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.720
It's github.audio, and you're hearing it

37:05.720 --> 37:07.160
in the background right now.

37:07.160 --> 37:09.640
It's a sonification of what goes on at github.

37:09.640 --> 37:12.080
Yeah, and there's representations with different tones

37:12.080 --> 37:13.320
and blips on the radar.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.640
Well-chosen, artfully chosen.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.360
There's a big one.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.280
That's a big one right there.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.280
Something just dropped.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.640
So you visualize commits to github, right?

37:20.640 --> 37:22.680
That's what this is, is a perspective

37:22.680 --> 37:24.800
with their size and whatnot.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.040
It reminds me of something,

37:28.040 --> 37:30.200
I don't know if you ever saw it for Bitcoin.

37:30.200 --> 37:31.400
Did you ever see this for Bitcoin?

37:31.400 --> 37:32.560
Oh yeah.

37:32.560 --> 37:33.400
Yeah.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.880
Visualize it or find blockchain.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.960
And I left it up in a tab

37:36.960 --> 37:38.000
while I worked on the show today

37:38.000 --> 37:40.280
because it's just nice and peaceful.

37:40.280 --> 37:43.280
It has like an organic kind of, you know, sounds natural.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.160
Plus there's something sort of inspiring to know

37:45.160 --> 37:47.800
that every one of those dings is a commitment of code.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.360
Look at the community go.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.200
That's kind of inspiring.

37:52.200 --> 37:53.680
When you're working and you keep hearing people

37:53.680 --> 37:55.560
that are committing something to projects

37:55.560 --> 37:56.960
all over the world.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.320
Open source projects.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.880
Yeah, just run it in your tab.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.000
github.audio.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.200
You might even be able to find some projects this way,

38:06.200 --> 38:07.040
right?

38:07.040 --> 38:07.880
You're like, oh, these guys are just doing

38:07.880 --> 38:08.720
a lot of cool stuff.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.360
Maybe I'll check out that repo.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.960
Yeah, I agree.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.040
And also, like xMetals says in the chat room,

38:14.040 --> 38:15.640
I could totally fall asleep to that.

38:15.640 --> 38:16.480
You know what?

38:16.480 --> 38:17.840
I might try that tonight.

38:17.840 --> 38:20.040
I've been looking for things to leave on as background

38:20.040 --> 38:20.880
for my dogs.

38:20.880 --> 38:22.080
There goes a big one.

38:22.080 --> 38:22.920
Look at that.

38:22.920 --> 38:23.760
Big one.

38:27.280 --> 38:28.200
Come on now.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.120
Even if you just have the sound muted,

38:30.120 --> 38:31.720
it's still kind of neat from a visual standpoint.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.560
For those of you in the audio audience,

38:33.560 --> 38:35.200
there are blips.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.560
So how would you describe that, Wes?

38:36.560 --> 38:40.400
Sort of like pings on a map that sort of expand

38:40.400 --> 38:42.520
in proportion and their color and their size.

38:42.520 --> 38:43.400
Like a 2D ripple.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.520
Yeah, a 2D ripple and it's proportionally

38:45.520 --> 38:47.640
to the size of the commit and all of that.

38:47.640 --> 38:48.480
It's very fancy.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.400
So look at you.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.400
Look at you sending me a link that I love.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.400
I know you so well.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.480
github.audio.

38:53.480 --> 38:58.040
And I have bookmarks for some old Bitcoin ones,

38:58.040 --> 39:00.400
but they got bought out and now they serve malware.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.920
So that's no good.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.720
Hey, malware as a service is an important part of the book.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.000
Malware as a service.

39:05.000 --> 39:05.840
Yeah.

39:05.840 --> 39:06.660
You know what?

39:06.660 --> 39:07.500
Speaking of important services,

39:07.500 --> 39:09.320
I want to tell you about my mobile service provider

39:09.320 --> 39:10.160
and that's Ting.

39:10.160 --> 39:11.800
Once you go to linux.ting.com,

39:11.800 --> 39:14.000
linux.ting.com to learn more,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.520
get a $25 discount off your first Ting device.

39:16.520 --> 39:20.480
Or if you're like Ninja level and you bring a Ting device,

39:20.480 --> 39:22.600
then you'll get $25 in service credit

39:22.600 --> 39:25.960
and an average monthly Ting line is about 23 bucks.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.040
So your service credit is going to pay for more

39:28.040 --> 39:28.880
than your first month.

39:28.880 --> 39:29.720
It did for mine too.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.520
And that's kind of nice because Ting has CDMA

39:31.520 --> 39:32.520
and GSM networks.

39:32.520 --> 39:33.640
I'll say it again.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.680
Ting has CDMA and GSM networks.

39:35.680 --> 39:36.500
That's right.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.340
CDMA and GSM.

39:37.340 --> 39:39.080
So you get to pick which one works better for you

39:39.080 --> 39:40.240
and bring a device.

39:40.240 --> 39:41.940
They have radically good customer service.

39:41.940 --> 39:42.840
Super good.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.200
You get to speak to a real human being.

39:44.200 --> 39:45.320
They can help you out,

39:45.320 --> 39:47.660
but they back it up with an incredible dashboard

39:47.660 --> 39:49.640
and an app for your mobile device.

39:49.640 --> 39:54.640
You know, I laugh because Mr. Tonell

39:55.400 --> 39:57.360
in the Mamba Room, Producer Tonell,

39:57.360 --> 39:59.640
he had a really funny comment today.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.560
He's like, hey, you ought to mention this in the Ting spot.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.920
People could go pick up the LG Tribute 5,

40:03.920 --> 40:06.640
which just landed on Ting for $121,

40:06.640 --> 40:09.960
no contract, no termination fee,

40:09.960 --> 40:12.160
and then go over to Amazon

40:12.160 --> 40:15.160
and pick up a Rebel T5 digital SLR

40:15.160 --> 40:16.360
and still spend less money

40:16.360 --> 40:18.980
than you would spend for the new Pixel.

40:18.980 --> 40:20.320
See, I think he was just trying to make fun of me

40:20.320 --> 40:21.240
because I might buy a Pixel

40:21.240 --> 40:22.680
and I'm buying a new camera this week.

40:22.680 --> 40:23.720
Really?

40:23.720 --> 40:24.560
Yep.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.400
It's going to be an expensive week, Chris.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.040
That is going to be a very expensive week.

40:27.040 --> 40:30.120
So yeah, the Tribute 2 was kind of a famous phone

40:30.120 --> 40:32.120
and the Tribute 5 is back and bigger

40:32.120 --> 40:34.080
with a bigger display, bigger battery,

40:34.080 --> 40:37.040
front-facing cameras, all this business.

40:37.040 --> 40:40.400
It's actually a pretty decent phone for 121 bucks

40:40.400 --> 40:41.640
and you'd have enough money left over

40:41.640 --> 40:43.160
to get yourself a SLR.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.760
Kids' phone, grandma's phone,

40:44.760 --> 40:46.920
you know, they want Instagram and they want email.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.520
Or if you just don't find yourself

40:48.520 --> 40:50.840
all that enthused about phones anymore.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.260
If smartphones are just not what floats your boat

40:53.260 --> 40:54.120
and you just need something

40:54.120 --> 40:56.280
that can do the basic things you want,

40:56.280 --> 40:58.460
run a recent version of Android,

40:58.460 --> 41:00.840
and no contract nor the termination fee.

41:00.840 --> 41:02.720
Just having a recent version of Android,

41:02.720 --> 41:04.080
that's pretty much everything you need.

41:04.080 --> 41:06.520
And 121 bucks, no contract nor the termination fee.

41:06.520 --> 41:07.640
That's a really great deal.

41:07.640 --> 41:10.600
I want you to go over to linux.ting.com.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.640
You get to put Linux in your URL bar,

41:12.640 --> 41:14.760
which is good because you want Linux in your history,

41:14.760 --> 41:15.600
let's be honest.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.440
You want that in there.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.080
You got to stuff that URL history bar.

41:18.080 --> 41:20.280
I know what you've been up to, linux.ting.com.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.700
They give you a discount off a device

41:21.700 --> 41:23.300
or they'll give you a discount off service

41:23.300 --> 41:25.680
if you decide to switch and they got a savings calculator.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.200
I recommend you check it out.

41:27.200 --> 41:30.680
linux.ting.com.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.400
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring

41:32.400 --> 41:33.640
the Unplugged program.

41:35.640 --> 41:38.620
Wubba-dub-bub, wubba-dub-bub, wubba-dub-bub, wubba-dub-bub.

41:38.620 --> 41:41.200
So I thought before we got into talking about

41:41.200 --> 41:43.480
the Open Daylight Summit and our interviews,

41:43.480 --> 41:44.700
rolling our interviews that we had

41:44.700 --> 41:46.740
with some of the folks at Open Daylight Summit,

41:46.740 --> 41:48.600
we should give one more crack at explaining

41:48.600 --> 41:51.480
what the F, software-defined networking is.

41:51.480 --> 41:53.000
JB does SDN.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.520
Yeah, and why it matters.

41:54.520 --> 41:56.800
And it is hard to describe

41:56.800 --> 41:59.960
because it is literally a nascent industry

41:59.960 --> 42:02.640
that is in flux and a lot of people

42:02.640 --> 42:04.880
that are involved with it barely understand it.

42:04.880 --> 42:05.720
Yep.

42:05.720 --> 42:06.540
Well said, Chris, well said.

42:06.540 --> 42:07.380
So it's really hard.

42:07.380 --> 42:08.200
They won't say that, but it's true.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.360
Yeah, so for us coming here

42:09.360 --> 42:11.480
and then relaying the information to you,

42:11.480 --> 42:12.900
we kind of look like we're jackasses,

42:12.900 --> 42:16.520
but software-defined networking itself isn't,

42:16.520 --> 42:18.760
Open Daylight isn't the only

42:18.760 --> 42:21.540
software-defined networking controller game in town.

42:21.540 --> 42:24.860
It is one of the more open and community-based ones

42:24.860 --> 42:27.000
with multi-industry support,

42:27.000 --> 42:28.720
and it's one that the Linux Foundation

42:28.720 --> 42:30.060
has thrown their weight behind.

42:30.060 --> 42:32.800
And as we've shown, has a active community.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.800
So there's others, though, like OpenFlow, right?

42:34.800 --> 42:36.840
That would be, would that be considered?

42:36.840 --> 42:39.160
OpenFlow is the,

42:39.160 --> 42:41.680
that's what is controlled by Open Daylight.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.940
Okay, so this is like the controller-level stuff.

42:43.940 --> 42:45.520
Yes, but there are several other,

42:45.520 --> 42:46.880
like Big Switch has one,

42:46.880 --> 42:48.520
there's a few other proprietary implementations

42:48.520 --> 42:50.540
of OpenFlow controllers

42:50.540 --> 42:52.560
or things that interact with OpenFlow hardware.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.640
And so OpenFlow is able to be a controller

42:55.640 --> 42:57.440
that plugs in with Open Daylight

42:57.440 --> 42:59.760
because it follows a series of standards set forth

42:59.760 --> 43:02.280
by Open Daylight and software-defined networking.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.480
Like it follows these, it speaks these languages, correct?

43:05.480 --> 43:08.120
Yeah, so OpenFlow is, as a protocol then,

43:08.120 --> 43:11.080
it separates the control plane from the data plane

43:11.080 --> 43:13.960
so that you can have this centralized,

43:13.960 --> 43:16.520
standardized Open Daylight provides this

43:16.520 --> 43:18.080
as the OpenFlow controller,

43:18.080 --> 43:19.560
which then sends configuration

43:19.560 --> 43:21.660
to all the OpenFlow devices

43:21.660 --> 43:23.280
that actually end up switching your packets.

43:23.280 --> 43:24.120
And then that gets,

43:24.120 --> 43:26.160
that programs the ASICs and other forwarding paths

43:26.160 --> 43:29.080
on the hardware to then implement your VPNs,

43:29.080 --> 43:31.160
implement your layer two switches,

43:31.160 --> 43:32.000
implement your routers.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.800
Yep, yep, yep, your routes, your VLANs, all that stuff.

43:34.800 --> 43:38.640
So we, to try to better understand what the F

43:38.640 --> 43:39.600
all of this means,

43:39.600 --> 43:43.040
we decided we would take a very precious Tuesday,

43:43.040 --> 43:45.760
which is, you know, Wes has this time carved out

43:45.760 --> 43:48.680
from his day job, we have this time set aside

43:48.680 --> 43:50.240
with the mumble room to do this show.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.120
It's not just like, it's not just a thing

43:52.120 --> 43:53.760
we're flipping about, like we're gonna go somewhere

43:53.760 --> 43:54.920
during Linux Unplugged,

43:54.920 --> 43:57.000
it really kinda needs to be worth it.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.640
And so we decided to go down to Bellevue and check it out.

43:59.640 --> 44:02.560
And it was, the whole event itself was,

44:02.560 --> 44:04.200
it felt like it was really something set up

44:04.200 --> 44:06.460
for professionals that are in this industry

44:06.460 --> 44:07.680
that wanna get information,

44:07.680 --> 44:08.800
hey, this is what I'm working on,

44:08.800 --> 44:10.000
this is what we're working on.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.320
It was also, people were giving talks

44:12.320 --> 44:14.160
that were sort of highlighting the fact

44:14.160 --> 44:16.060
that we were two separate open source projects

44:16.060 --> 44:17.200
kind of working on the same thing

44:17.200 --> 44:20.200
and now we've come together as one open source project.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.040
That was kinda neat to see.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.680
I think that was a pretty neat theme

44:22.680 --> 44:25.240
and it was interesting to see just how it kinda,

44:25.240 --> 44:27.080
you know, it took the Linux community kind of a while

44:27.080 --> 44:28.840
to get to this like different corporations

44:28.840 --> 44:30.360
working together setup,

44:30.360 --> 44:32.400
and that's where Open Daylight is right now,

44:32.400 --> 44:33.960
where they're, you know, I think it's like different,

44:33.960 --> 44:35.520
different interest groups all seeing like,

44:35.520 --> 44:36.700
we have this shared interest

44:36.700 --> 44:38.240
that we can all work on together.

44:38.240 --> 44:41.800
Now, just from like our experience standpoint,

44:41.800 --> 44:44.720
I have not stopped thinking about that burger I ate.

44:44.720 --> 44:46.640
I'm like still thinking about that burger I got.

44:46.640 --> 44:47.560
Oh man, right?

44:47.560 --> 44:50.360
So I got, it was an homage to Dick's,

44:50.360 --> 44:53.120
which Dick's is a burger restaurant here in Seattle

44:53.120 --> 44:54.840
that is sort of famous.

44:54.840 --> 44:55.680
Yeah, I think so.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.400
And I think most people, when they come to Seattle,

44:57.400 --> 44:59.320
they like to get, they like to go to Dick's

44:59.320 --> 45:01.640
and get themselves a ridiculous Dick's burger.

45:01.640 --> 45:02.840
They're super greasy burgers

45:02.840 --> 45:04.560
and so this place made an homage to Dick's

45:04.560 --> 45:06.140
and I decided I gotta give it a try.

45:06.140 --> 45:08.960
It was really, really good.

45:08.960 --> 45:12.960
But the bacon salt was impressive,

45:12.960 --> 45:15.200
but damn, if Wes's burger,

45:15.200 --> 45:16.960
and I have a picture of this in the show notes

45:16.960 --> 45:19.840
if you're listening, you've gotta see this thing.

45:19.840 --> 45:23.100
This thing is nearly as tall as,

45:23.100 --> 45:25.040
this thing stands taller than your cell phone.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.160
So imagine a burger that is literally taller

45:27.160 --> 45:28.160
than your cell phone.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.160
It's probably taller than a can of Coke, right?

45:30.160 --> 45:31.000
It's taller than a can of Coke,

45:31.000 --> 45:31.840
it's taller than your cell phone.

45:31.840 --> 45:32.660
I think so.

45:32.660 --> 45:35.320
It is a legit, do you remember what was on this thing?

45:35.320 --> 45:36.640
Like there's egg and ham.

45:36.640 --> 45:39.840
There was ham, egg, a burger, hash browns,

45:39.840 --> 45:41.560
I think a hollandaise sauce was involved.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.400
Is that coleslaw?

45:42.400 --> 45:43.720
What's over here on the side?

45:43.720 --> 45:45.000
That's a good question, I'm not sure.

45:45.000 --> 45:45.840
Is it pulled pork?

45:45.840 --> 45:48.280
I can't tell because it's, and then there's a sauce,

45:48.280 --> 45:50.680
it's literally sitting in a pool of its own sauce.

45:50.680 --> 45:53.640
Yeah, sauce, egg, there's a big bowl of tater tots

45:53.640 --> 45:55.440
in the background there, slightly out of focus.

45:55.440 --> 45:56.280
Yeah, yeah.

45:56.280 --> 45:57.200
It was really a wonderful meal.

45:57.200 --> 45:58.660
Perfectly out of focus, you might note.

45:58.660 --> 45:59.500
Oh yes.

45:59.500 --> 46:00.320
You might note.

46:00.320 --> 46:01.320
Depth of field, lovely.

46:01.320 --> 46:02.680
Depth of field without two cameras,

46:02.680 --> 46:03.520
somehow I managed to pull it off.

46:03.520 --> 46:05.700
How did you do that?

46:05.700 --> 46:09.560
Yeah, so we had, I think it was neat to go down there,

46:09.560 --> 46:10.440
it was neat to talk to people,

46:10.440 --> 46:12.840
and we had a great chance to do some interviews.

46:12.840 --> 46:17.160
It was fun to kind of just be outsiders

46:17.160 --> 46:18.880
trying to understand this whole community.

46:18.880 --> 46:20.300
There was definitely moments where it's like,

46:20.300 --> 46:22.640
boy, some of this is going way over our head,

46:22.640 --> 46:24.680
and it was kind of hard to follow,

46:24.680 --> 46:26.200
but there were other moments where like,

46:26.200 --> 46:29.880
these are just struggles that all open source projects have,

46:29.880 --> 46:32.800
or these are common problems with organizing people.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.920
How do you build this kind of community, this movement?

46:34.920 --> 46:37.400
Yeah, so that kind of stuff was clear

46:37.400 --> 46:40.680
and it was easy to sort of identify with and see.

46:40.680 --> 46:42.840
So I had a good time going down there.

46:42.840 --> 46:44.640
I really enjoyed the trip,

46:44.640 --> 46:46.060
I enjoyed the opportunity to learn more,

46:46.060 --> 46:48.360
and so I wanted to kind of relay to some of you

46:49.760 --> 46:51.740
our experience, and I tried to do that

46:51.740 --> 46:53.460
in the Linux Action Show last week,

46:53.460 --> 46:55.720
and then I wanted to follow up on this episode

46:55.720 --> 46:57.640
with a couple of more interviews

46:57.640 --> 46:58.960
to kind of help you better understand

46:58.960 --> 47:00.960
of how large enterprises are using this

47:00.960 --> 47:03.320
and how open source projects are using this.

47:03.320 --> 47:07.560
So, let's start on the business side of things.

47:07.560 --> 47:10.160
Let's start with the enterprise side of things,

47:10.160 --> 47:12.840
because this will be the most high level interview

47:12.840 --> 47:15.440
that we have, the real big picture perspective.

47:15.440 --> 47:18.440
And what's great about it is, this is Balaji,

47:18.440 --> 47:21.420
and he starts out by explaining what 5G is,

47:21.420 --> 47:24.720
what's 5G networking, and why software defined networking

47:24.720 --> 47:26.520
is important in a 5G network.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.640
So not only do you get to learn about 5G networking,

47:28.640 --> 47:31.200
but you get to learn how this all comes together

47:31.200 --> 47:32.960
to support 5G networks.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.200
So that'll be Balaji,

47:34.200 --> 47:36.040
and then we'll have one more after this,

47:36.040 --> 47:38.440
and that'll be more of a, the next interview

47:38.440 --> 47:41.280
will be more of like a community, real life testing project,

47:41.280 --> 47:42.200
stuff like that.

47:42.200 --> 47:44.240
All right, so here we go with the high level.

47:44.240 --> 47:49.240
Yes, thanks for asking, that's a great question.

47:50.640 --> 47:53.440
So 5G is, some people think 5G is,

47:53.440 --> 47:55.920
okay, we upgrade from 4G to 5G.

47:55.920 --> 47:58.460
But actually, it's partially true.

47:58.460 --> 48:01.320
But 5G encompasses much bigger than that.

48:01.320 --> 48:05.240
5G includes our access, as well as the transport,

48:05.240 --> 48:06.800
and the data center, the cloud.

48:06.800 --> 48:10.400
So pulling all together, more of a holistic view.

48:10.400 --> 48:13.320
And then on top of that, also, in 5G,

48:13.320 --> 48:16.360
you know, the logical slicing of the network,

48:16.360 --> 48:18.120
it was already there in IP world,

48:18.120 --> 48:20.200
what we call virtual private network.

48:20.200 --> 48:22.480
In 5G, what we call network slicing,

48:22.480 --> 48:24.440
it's on a whole new level.

48:24.440 --> 48:27.000
So you slice the entire slice, network slice,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.460
on an existing network, logically separated,

48:29.460 --> 48:33.360
secured, isolated, to deliver, for example,

48:33.360 --> 48:37.040
to automobile industry, or to a healthcare industry.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.600
But it's all connected over the 5G network.

48:38.600 --> 48:41.120
Exactly, it's all part of the 5G network.

48:41.120 --> 48:43.720
And also, we also on the top,

48:43.720 --> 48:45.420
how do you do the life cycle management

48:45.420 --> 48:46.880
of the whole network slice?

48:46.880 --> 48:48.960
So you have the management layer, which is key,

48:48.960 --> 48:50.560
should be agile as well.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.480
That management layer consists of management,

48:52.480 --> 48:54.760
and orchestration, and analytics.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.760
So analytics will use it to close the loop.

48:56.760 --> 48:58.200
If there is a problem in the network,

48:58.200 --> 49:00.200
you can dynamically close the loop.

49:00.200 --> 49:02.480
Now you may ask me, what's the role of SDN?

49:02.480 --> 49:03.320
Yeah, I'm curious.

49:03.320 --> 49:05.920
Well, software-defined network goes across the board.

49:05.920 --> 49:08.200
So you can have an SDN for transport.

49:08.200 --> 49:11.800
So basically, the 5G requires to deliver services

49:11.800 --> 49:13.660
faster, time to market.

49:13.660 --> 49:15.640
And also, from design of your service,

49:15.640 --> 49:17.640
if a customer asks, if a vertical industry,

49:17.640 --> 49:19.960
like automobile industry, come to an operator,

49:19.960 --> 49:22.400
hey, I need a service, network slicing,

49:22.400 --> 49:23.860
sorry, I need a service.

49:23.860 --> 49:26.420
So we could actually create, design the service,

49:26.420 --> 49:28.760
create the service from the entire, you know,

49:28.760 --> 49:31.200
the process, business process, service fulfillment,

49:31.200 --> 49:33.120
all the way to delivering services.

49:33.120 --> 49:36.200
All these things should happen in a few days.

49:36.200 --> 49:37.880
I can't wait for a few months, right?

49:37.880 --> 49:39.480
That's what the agility we're looking at.

49:39.480 --> 49:41.160
So with, like, SDN, you kind of have the ability

49:41.160 --> 49:42.920
to reprogram on the fly.

49:42.920 --> 49:43.760
Yes.

49:43.760 --> 49:44.720
SDN is a cornerstone.

49:44.720 --> 49:47.120
It really is a catalyst, I call it,

49:47.120 --> 49:50.120
catalyst to enable that 5G transformation,

49:50.120 --> 49:52.200
and, you know, for network slicing.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.480
For example, SDN applies in many areas.

49:54.480 --> 49:57.120
For example, to set up end-to-end service,

49:57.120 --> 50:00.340
connectivity service, for in-transport network,

50:00.340 --> 50:02.800
you need to have a SDN-enabled transport network,

50:02.800 --> 50:05.360
so I can dynamically set up the connectivity.

50:05.360 --> 50:07.800
Also, you need to, you know, in 5G slicing,

50:07.800 --> 50:10.740
you need to have this mobile core, which is virtualized.

50:10.740 --> 50:12.840
So you need to connect all the VNFs.

50:12.840 --> 50:15.960
The VNF could be virtual machines, or it could be containers.

50:15.960 --> 50:18.460
So you need to make intra-data center connectivity.

50:18.460 --> 50:20.280
SDN plays a role on that.

50:20.280 --> 50:22.400
So orchestration, what the orchestration will do

50:22.400 --> 50:23.960
is it will connect all the dots.

50:23.960 --> 50:24.800
Sure.

50:24.800 --> 50:25.620
So it's all-

50:25.620 --> 50:26.460
And actually make it manageable.

50:26.460 --> 50:27.300
Exactly manageable.

50:27.300 --> 50:29.000
The full life cycle management.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.560
So since you did a great point talking about manageable,

50:32.560 --> 50:36.120
because any service is cradle to grave, right, the service.

50:36.120 --> 50:39.500
So the dynamic nature of service is very critical.

50:39.500 --> 50:42.780
So for example, if you create a mobile broadband service,

50:42.780 --> 50:45.980
and the consumer are consuming that service,

50:45.980 --> 50:48.720
and we are monitoring that, you apply the analytics,

50:48.720 --> 50:50.720
something happens to the mobile broadband slide.

50:50.720 --> 50:52.620
Remember, it's all virtual, right?

50:52.620 --> 50:54.680
So what we can do is, using the orchestration

50:54.680 --> 50:56.840
and analytics, and also leverage SDN,

50:56.840 --> 50:59.360
you can actually create another network slice,

50:59.360 --> 51:03.080
move your traffic, move the users, so you can-

51:03.080 --> 51:03.920
Exactly.

51:03.920 --> 51:05.440
This could be a stadium event.

51:05.440 --> 51:09.120
Imagine if there's a stadium and they want a new,

51:09.120 --> 51:10.840
you know, the network and services, right?

51:10.840 --> 51:11.680
Even events like this.

51:11.680 --> 51:13.120
Events like this, you want to build the whole thing

51:13.120 --> 51:15.080
that'll cost time and money, right?

51:15.080 --> 51:15.920
Absolutely.

51:15.920 --> 51:16.740
This one is pretty easy.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.880
Maybe in 30 minutes, you can create a mobile core

51:18.880 --> 51:20.920
using orchestration and SDN, so.

51:23.400 --> 51:26.080
Yeah, that is, what's really neat about that

51:26.080 --> 51:28.000
is what we're talking about here is,

51:28.000 --> 51:29.960
you could see how vendors could slice out

51:29.960 --> 51:32.960
their whole network that would span across multiple systems,

51:32.960 --> 51:33.840
multiple networks.

51:33.840 --> 51:34.920
And I think he kind of highlights

51:34.920 --> 51:36.600
how you can dynamically change it, right?

51:36.600 --> 51:39.160
So you don't have to go back and change your switches,

51:39.160 --> 51:40.360
or update the configs, or be like,

51:40.360 --> 51:41.640
oh no, now I need a router here,

51:41.640 --> 51:43.200
and we need switches all this way,

51:43.200 --> 51:44.400
and we need all these access points.

51:44.400 --> 51:47.040
You can fill places with generic hardware,

51:47.040 --> 51:48.080
and then on the fly, you can be like,

51:48.080 --> 51:50.400
nope, I need two network partitions of VPN connection

51:50.400 --> 51:51.840
bridging these two networks,

51:51.840 --> 51:53.840
and it just all gets programmed out there.

51:53.840 --> 51:56.020
Right after that, I asked him, I said,

51:58.160 --> 52:01.640
be honest with me, how hard was it for Ericsson?

52:01.640 --> 52:02.920
They're a big telco vendor, for sure.

52:02.920 --> 52:04.400
How hard was it for you to switch over

52:04.400 --> 52:05.320
to something like this?

52:05.320 --> 52:07.360
Like, was this one of those things

52:07.360 --> 52:09.800
where your company fought this tooth and nail?

52:09.800 --> 52:12.200
And he says, no, it actually,

52:12.200 --> 52:13.800
it just makes a ton of sense for them.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.120
It turned out it was obvious for them

52:15.120 --> 52:19.240
because there's been enough left by open daylight,

52:19.240 --> 52:21.600
and there's enough ambiguity

52:21.600 --> 52:23.200
around software-defined networking

52:23.200 --> 52:24.680
that there's a real need for people

52:24.680 --> 52:26.820
that understand huge networks and expertise

52:26.820 --> 52:28.400
to bring all this stuff together.

52:28.400 --> 52:30.440
And so for Ericsson, they don't feel like

52:30.440 --> 52:32.840
they're competitively disadvantaged

52:32.840 --> 52:34.560
working with the open daylight platform.

52:34.560 --> 52:36.560
They feel like, well, we've learned this thing,

52:36.560 --> 52:37.840
and we know how to make all of them connect.

52:37.840 --> 52:39.640
Like, I got a sense from them,

52:39.640 --> 52:41.280
they're truly, they had a lot of people there.

52:41.280 --> 52:42.120
They were really investing in something like this.

52:42.120 --> 52:44.200
It seemed very legitimate.

52:44.200 --> 52:46.160
And I was surprised because it seemed like

52:46.160 --> 52:47.760
there's companies that would traditionally

52:47.760 --> 52:48.880
be competing with each other,

52:48.880 --> 52:50.520
like Ericsson and like Cisco,

52:50.520 --> 52:52.140
and other switch manufacturers,

52:52.140 --> 52:53.720
they traditionally are competing with each other,

52:53.720 --> 52:54.560
and here they all are.

52:54.560 --> 52:56.760
With vertically integrated platforms trying to lock,

52:56.760 --> 52:57.600
you know?

52:57.600 --> 53:00.360
Yeah, yes, with these massive vertical platforms

53:00.360 --> 53:02.280
that have these huge support contracts,

53:02.280 --> 53:04.040
and here they are all giving each other

53:04.040 --> 53:06.320
these back-and-forth tips on how to make everything

53:06.320 --> 53:08.000
work better with these different summits.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.520
It's just unbelievable.

53:09.520 --> 53:11.440
It's kind of a great compromise where it's like,

53:11.440 --> 53:13.000
yes, there's still money in you

53:13.000 --> 53:15.200
and providing solutions that can manage this stuff,

53:15.200 --> 53:16.680
and at the same time building communities

53:16.680 --> 53:18.560
to have a common foundation that anyone can use.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.400
Yeah, if this stuff gets your interest going

53:20.400 --> 53:23.040
or just building networks, building systems,

53:23.040 --> 53:25.000
solving problems, solutions,

53:25.000 --> 53:27.400
I encourage you to check out our sponsor, Linux Academy.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.840
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.880
They have labs and hands-on exercises

53:31.880 --> 53:35.020
that give you scenario-based labs with real experience.

53:35.020 --> 53:37.480
They have instructor mentoring from humans when you need it.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.400
It's not some sort of digital bot.

53:39.400 --> 53:41.480
It's not some sort of AI assistant.

53:41.480 --> 53:42.900
It's real human beings.

53:42.900 --> 53:44.760
Note cards that you can fork and make your own

53:44.760 --> 53:46.760
or look at community versions of them.

53:46.760 --> 53:48.240
Nuggets for when you don't have a lot of time.

53:48.240 --> 53:50.120
You can deep dive into a tiny bit of wisdom

53:50.120 --> 53:51.480
about a singular topic.

53:51.480 --> 53:54.040
Video courses with self-paced, in-depth video courses

53:54.040 --> 53:56.880
for every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

53:56.880 --> 53:58.640
Of course, they've got Courseware on OpenStack,

53:58.640 --> 54:00.400
which plays well with Open Daylight,

54:00.400 --> 54:02.200
and obviously Azure as well.

54:02.200 --> 54:04.640
Check them out at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

54:04.640 --> 54:05.900
to support this show.

54:05.900 --> 54:08.400
Get yourself a great price and learn more.

54:08.400 --> 54:11.560
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

54:11.560 --> 54:12.800
and a big thank you to Linux Academy

54:12.800 --> 54:14.800
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

54:14.800 --> 54:16.040
This is a great time to tie that in

54:16.040 --> 54:17.400
because if any of this kind of stuff

54:17.400 --> 54:18.600
is over your head a little bit,

54:18.600 --> 54:20.680
there's great Courseware on all of this stuff.

54:20.680 --> 54:24.080
So, I want to talk about Heather and Chris's experience.

54:24.080 --> 54:25.040
They were great to talk to.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.400
Heather's from the Linux Foundation,

54:26.400 --> 54:27.480
Chris is from Ericsson,

54:27.480 --> 54:30.320
and also works with the Open Daylight project.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.120
And they talk about real world,

54:32.120 --> 54:34.360
how they use it, why the foundation cares,

54:34.360 --> 54:35.880
and all of that kind of stuff.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.320
I'm here with Chris and Heather,

54:41.320 --> 54:43.080
and Chris is from Ericsson,

54:43.080 --> 54:45.240
and Heather is from the Linux Foundation.

54:45.240 --> 54:48.080
And I'm hoping they're gonna fill in a few dots for us

54:48.080 --> 54:48.900
from both cases.

54:48.900 --> 54:50.160
So, Heather, let's start with you.

54:50.160 --> 54:52.560
I'm really kind of looking forward to picking your brain

54:52.560 --> 54:54.160
because I know a lot of folks listening

54:54.160 --> 54:55.580
have heard of the Linux Foundation,

54:55.580 --> 54:57.480
they've heard of Open Daylight,

54:57.480 --> 54:59.120
maybe they don't know how the two are connected

54:59.120 --> 54:59.940
and where you fit in.

54:59.940 --> 55:00.960
So, fill them in.

55:00.960 --> 55:04.240
Yeah, so the Linux Foundation has started doing

55:04.240 --> 55:06.460
what they call collaborative projects,

55:06.460 --> 55:09.560
where they are providing sort of the framework

55:09.560 --> 55:12.960
for other open source communities

55:12.960 --> 55:15.840
to sort of come together and form their project

55:15.840 --> 55:18.760
and be affiliated with the Linux Foundation,

55:18.760 --> 55:21.800
take advantage of the expertise that the LF has built up

55:21.800 --> 55:25.160
over the years around open source governance,

55:25.160 --> 55:30.160
communities, IPR, licensing, events,

55:30.940 --> 55:31.800
all that kind of stuff.

55:31.800 --> 55:35.680
And so, the Open Daylight was one of their very early

55:35.680 --> 55:39.200
projects that they did in the networking space.

55:39.200 --> 55:41.760
And that has been an area that has been growing a lot

55:41.760 --> 55:44.440
for the LF in the past several years.

55:44.440 --> 55:49.320
So, as sort of the networking industry is looking to both,

55:49.320 --> 55:51.780
I think, take advantage of advances in software,

55:51.780 --> 55:53.660
as well as sort of open source

55:53.660 --> 55:56.400
as a sort of development strategy,

55:56.400 --> 55:59.120
a lot of projects have been flocking to the LF.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.980
So, it seems like the Linux Foundation

56:00.980 --> 56:02.600
really made this connection at the right time

56:02.600 --> 56:05.440
because this is an area that's growing like crazy.

56:05.440 --> 56:07.160
So, do you have a project that's connected

56:07.160 --> 56:09.440
with Open Daylight, where's your role in there?

56:09.440 --> 56:13.560
Yeah, so I head up a project called OPNFV,

56:13.560 --> 56:17.880
which is focused on network function virtualization,

56:17.880 --> 56:20.040
which you may have seen in sort of Nila's keynote

56:20.040 --> 56:23.140
this morning, but it's a big use case for SDN.

56:23.140 --> 56:26.360
And it's the way the sort of the global operators

56:26.360 --> 56:28.960
are modernizing and transforming their networks

56:28.960 --> 56:30.760
to be more virtualized, more agile,

56:30.760 --> 56:32.560
and more software based.

56:32.560 --> 56:35.320
And so, we are a sister project to Open Daylight,

56:35.320 --> 56:39.560
work with them quite closely, as well as other LF

56:39.560 --> 56:41.720
and other open source organizations like OpenStack

56:41.720 --> 56:43.720
and things like that that aren't affiliated with LF.

56:43.720 --> 56:45.600
So, are you building on top of Open Daylight

56:45.600 --> 56:48.720
to, for your project, is that my understanding?

56:48.720 --> 56:51.480
So, our project is actually very interesting.

56:51.480 --> 56:53.620
It's a systems integration project, really.

56:53.620 --> 56:55.640
So, as an open source project.

56:55.640 --> 56:57.560
And Chris is our technical steering committee chair,

56:57.560 --> 57:00.440
so he can probably get into more details about that.

57:00.440 --> 57:02.400
But what we do is we actually compose

57:02.400 --> 57:05.920
sort of an end to end NFV platform based on components

57:05.920 --> 57:08.320
that sort of fulfill different parts of the stack.

57:08.320 --> 57:10.100
So, that could be Open Daylight

57:10.100 --> 57:12.760
or other open source SDN controllers.

57:12.760 --> 57:15.020
It could be OpenStack.

57:15.020 --> 57:18.600
There's a new LF project called FD.io

57:18.600 --> 57:20.720
that we also sort of integrated in this time.

57:20.720 --> 57:25.480
We work with OVS, which is now newly a Linux Foundation CP.

57:25.480 --> 57:28.600
And so, we sort of do that work of building

57:28.600 --> 57:31.240
sort of a composed platform, doing system level tests,

57:31.240 --> 57:33.720
and then taking feedback back to those upstream

57:33.720 --> 57:35.880
organizations to make all of their components

57:35.880 --> 57:37.000
more NFV ready.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.360
Wow, that's super important.

57:38.360 --> 57:40.760
So, Chris, how does this sort of translate

57:40.760 --> 57:43.000
to real world things that matter to Ericsson?

57:44.400 --> 57:46.660
So, the NFV journey affects everyone,

57:46.660 --> 57:48.280
from the vendors to the operators.

57:48.280 --> 57:49.680
It's obviously an operator journey

57:49.680 --> 57:51.800
that the vendors need to be participating in.

57:51.800 --> 57:55.000
When it comes to the NFV platform and how it's built,

57:55.000 --> 57:58.600
for us being able to work collaboratively on,

57:58.600 --> 58:01.120
for instance, bringing Open Daylight into an OpenStack

58:01.120 --> 58:02.880
enabled end to end solution,

58:04.080 --> 58:06.560
providing a framework for applications to run on,

58:06.560 --> 58:10.560
for network orchestration, to overlay.

58:10.560 --> 58:12.560
It's extremely important for us to be part of that,

58:12.560 --> 58:14.760
to help facilitate how that's gonna work,

58:14.760 --> 58:16.960
how it best serves the operators needs.

58:16.960 --> 58:19.760
And of course, as a vendor, it provides us

58:19.760 --> 58:23.240
with that foundation on which we can provide our product.

58:23.240 --> 58:25.680
So, Ericsson has a booth here, right?

58:25.680 --> 58:26.500
Yes, we do.

58:26.500 --> 58:27.440
And there's several staff members here.

58:27.440 --> 58:28.880
It seems to be something that's getting

58:28.880 --> 58:30.560
an area of a lot of focus.

58:30.560 --> 58:33.280
What's Ericsson's history with Open Daylight?

58:33.280 --> 58:34.600
So, we are a founding member.

58:34.600 --> 58:37.120
I have been serving on the Technical Steering Committee

58:37.120 --> 58:40.800
myself for Open Daylight for the period that it's existed.

58:42.640 --> 58:44.440
So, that's, well, yeah.

58:45.400 --> 58:49.160
And he has been serving as RTSC Chair at OPNFV

58:49.160 --> 58:50.560
since it has existed.

58:50.560 --> 58:51.900
Exactly.

58:51.900 --> 58:52.920
So, from an Ericsson perspective,

58:52.920 --> 58:54.840
we see Open Daylight as extremely important.

58:54.840 --> 58:57.260
When it comes to transforming the network,

58:57.260 --> 58:59.320
when it comes to enabling new use cases

58:59.320 --> 59:01.600
and new capabilities in a carrier environment,

59:01.600 --> 59:03.120
it is our platform of choice.

59:03.120 --> 59:06.680
It's what we believe is the best long-term

59:06.680 --> 59:09.200
and short-term bet to really bring that out

59:09.200 --> 59:14.200
and leverage a cohesive and diverse ecosystem.

59:15.520 --> 59:18.280
It fits into OPNFV projects.

59:18.280 --> 59:20.320
It fits into the whole ecosystem

59:20.320 --> 59:24.120
and provides not just a vertical piece.

59:24.120 --> 59:26.280
A lot of components and a lot of CPS

59:26.280 --> 59:28.760
will solve a specific problem and do it very well.

59:28.760 --> 59:30.720
Open Daylight's a platform that provides you

59:30.720 --> 59:35.520
with the freedom to iterate and to sort of throw something

59:35.520 --> 59:38.160
on the side that can then interwork

59:38.160 --> 59:40.040
with what's sort of there.

59:40.040 --> 59:41.800
Provides a place to innovate

59:41.800 --> 59:43.320
within the context of a broader network.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.800
So, for us, it's extremely important

59:44.800 --> 59:46.640
that Open Daylight is healthy,

59:46.640 --> 59:48.680
that it feeds the whole ecosystem,

59:48.680 --> 59:51.040
and that it enables us, our competitors,

59:51.040 --> 59:53.040
and our customers to really just innovate

59:53.040 --> 59:55.160
and create that new network.

59:55.160 --> 59:57.200
So, what drew you to get involved personally

59:57.200 --> 59:58.600
with the project so long ago?

59:58.600 --> 01:00:03.200
So, I was actually doing network management

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.480
back in the day when Open Daylight started.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.640
And what we were finding in network management

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.960
is that we were trying to propose new capabilities

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.680
that we saw were really needed.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.400
And something like Open Daylight comes along

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.160
and it's like, we're gonna build these capabilities.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.400
And it's like, aha, okay, this is where we need to be.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.320
And it was really clear.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.760
And Open Daylight brings the ability

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.680
to modernize existing networks

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.120
and adopt new technologies at the same time.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.800
So, it's not just the, here's the new technology

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.800
or here's an old NMS or something.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.760
It finds that difficult place in between

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.880
that allows you to move forwards.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.120
So, what's next in your eye for Open Daylight?

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.000
More of the same.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.800
Well, no, not more, more.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:45.640
Just more.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.120
More adoption, more involvement.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:47.960
More.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.800
More is more.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.000
More is more in this case.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.920
More momentum, all that stuff is in there.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.880
So, Open Daylight grows.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.320
Release over release over release.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.200
Every release I've been participating in,

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.880
the things are more stable,

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.000
the community's bigger,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.040
there's more commercial engagement.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.240
So, from that perspective,

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.280
this is what I think is next for Open Daylight as well.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.840
What we see coming in the industry

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.000
that can take advantage of that momentum

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.280
is the ability for Open Daylight to work

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.720
very smoothly with OpenStack,

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.360
to extend OpenStack capabilities,

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.800
bring in carrier and access technologies

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.000
into that environment,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.800
and also work with how containers

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.920
are gonna integrate into that environment as well.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.000
Can you elaborate on that a bit?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:27.840
No.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.680
No.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.000
I don't want to be here.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.520
Just Docker, I don't know.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.360
Nobody uses that.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.200
So, here's a plug.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.280
So, in the Colorado release,

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.080
which we released yesterday.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:37.920
Yesterday.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.760
It's still yesterday.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.600
Wow.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.560
Our third release, exactly.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.320
On schedule, no, I missed that.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.720
On schedule to the day that we had agreed to,

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.640
like eight months ago, or seven months ago.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.600
Seven months ago.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.000
So, in that release, the Colorado release of OPNV,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.440
we have an NFV environment

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.520
which contains LXD containers and VMs,

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.920
and you can plug Open Daylight into that,

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.240
and you can use Open Daylight

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.800
in order to be able to network

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.000
between the containers and the VMs.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.720
So, you can then orchestrate your whole network.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.800
Exactly.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.800
End-to-end, front-to-back, you know,

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.680
and that's why we're in OPNV,

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.640
because we're able to bring these technologies

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.760
on board, new concepts,

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:23.520
provide a platform upon which Open Daylight

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.600
and others can integrate, build out,

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.480
and test new capabilities, and prove them.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.240
So, not just write a bit of code

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.440
and put it through their compiler

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.360
and have a thing at the end,

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.880
but actually prove and test end-to-end use cases.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.720
That's the real value.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.720
Seems like you're modeling that way,

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.600
like kind of how it's necessarily going to end up

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.800
being deployed in the real world.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.320
That's what we're trying to do, exactly.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.800
I mean, we have, in OPNV,

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.280
we have things like the Pharos tests.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.120
I'm gonna let Heather talk.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:45.960
I talk too much.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.800
But, Pharos.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.800
I talk too much, too. Tell us about Pharos.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.640
Yeah.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:52.080
So, Pharos is our federated community test lab project

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.080
where both end users and vendors are bringing test labs

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.240
in different environments.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.880
So, different hardware from different vendors

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.800
and hardware across different architectures.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.000
And it's tied into our CICD pipeline

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.280
so that we actually are deploying

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.760
sort of various flavors of an NFV platform

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.960
into multiple environments on multiple hardware.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:16.640
And we do that many, many, many times

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.040
heading into a release.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.440
So, not only do we feel fairly comfortable,

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.280
we've gotten, say, OpenStack and ODL

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.440
working with each other.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.880
We know that OpenStack and ODL

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.080
are working with each other on, you know,

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.760
sort of the OEMs that folks like Ericsson

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.800
or Huawei or Cisco are using or Intel Whitebox

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:35.120
or this time we added in ARM architectures

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.160
or Dell or HPE.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.120
So, you know, we're really sort of, yeah.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.920
And it's, you know, and tied in and automated.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.960
So, we actually are sort of both scaling

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.720
our ability to do testing,

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.360
but then also sort of doing

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.840
a lot of the vendor interoperability testing

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.600
sort of just as part of our development process.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.440
Wow.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.520
So, if I wanted, if I'm listening,

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.200
I want to learn more about OPNFV,

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.040
where would I go?

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.160
Wiki.opnfv.org.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.400
Easy peasy.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.400
So, they were both great to talk to

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.400
and we chatted some more.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:08.400
And we wrapped up,

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.400
there'll be some other stuff

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.400
you might hear from them in the future,

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.400
but a little bit after that,

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.400
you had a chance to go to a conference

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.400
and talk a little bit more about

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.400
what's going on with OPNFV

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.400
and what's going on with OPNFV.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.400
So, if you're interested,

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400
you can go to OPNFV.org

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.400
and find out more about OPNFV

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.400
and you had a chance to go to another session.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.400
Yes, I did.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.400
And which was that?

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.400
I went to a talk about bringing some Scala

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.400
into the Open Daylight code base.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.400
Right now, it's mostly a Java code base

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.400
and then I guess it's mostly configured in XML,

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.400
which are not everyone's favorite things.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.400
I'm sure Linus would not love that.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.400
Not everyone's favorite,

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.400
but they're obviously very much used

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.400
in enterprise environments.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.400
And the talk was kind of interesting.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.400
There's not a large deployment of Scala right now,

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.400
but I know some companies involved in Open Daylight

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.400
are kind of playing with it.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.400
It brings a more elegant approach.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.400
It's kind of a merged language

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.400
that has both object-oriented

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400
and functional design patterns included in it.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.400
So, it can be scaled a little bit nicer.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.400
They showed some really interesting examples

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.400
showing like, here's all this Java boilerplate.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.400
The Scala language also includes a lot of type inference,

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.400
that sort of thing.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.400
So, you can save on boilerplate code.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.400
Nice.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.400
As well as, at least for the current version of Scala,

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.400
the XML parsing,

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:16.400
XML is pretty much integrated into the language.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.400
So, it kind of makes it very elegant

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.400
to work with the configurations

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.400
when it's already valid Scala code.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400
Yeah, not to mention if you've already got

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.400
a lot of time spent with Scala.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.400
It's really nice that then you can move that time,

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.400
that investment, and that knowledge over.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.400
And then, at the same time,

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.400
the Scala code base can very,

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.400
or at least somewhat easily,

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.400
reference Java code bases, Java libraries.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.400
Oh, yeah, okay.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400
Saves a lot of time.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.400
Yeah.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.400
Now, that is our experience.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.400
That's our Open Daylight Summit experience.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.400
We might have some future clips coming up

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.400
that aren't exactly Open Daylight Summit related.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.400
They were recorded there,

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.400
including creating a new distribution around this

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.400
and also managing community and infrastructure around this.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.400
But those felt more like those could be applicable

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.400
to a lot of different open source projects.

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.400
So, I think we'll probably play those

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.400
in future episodes of The Unplugged Show.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.400
Now, Wes, flash check there.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.400
Mr. Wimpy, are you still on the line over there?

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.400
Over.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.400
I see that name that I love.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.400
Yeah.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.400
Wimpy, hello, Wimpy.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.400
This is even cooler.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.400
Wimpy, I wanted to ask,

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.400
what are you learning now about Open Media Vault

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.400
and sort of your reactions and follow-up

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:22.400
to the review we did recently on the Linux Action Show?

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.400
I know starting with perhaps your thoughts

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.400
on how to actually get UPS monitoring working,

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.400
which was a complaint I had in my review of Open Media Vault.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.400
Okay.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:38.400
So, I have decommissioned my Open Media Vault 2 servers

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.400
and now have Open Media Vault 3 servers in place.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.400
All in.

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.400
Nice.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.400
Not even stable yet and you're all in.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.400
Yeah.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.400
Yeah.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.400
And I did that with 2 as well, actually.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.400
I was running 2 whilst it was in beta for some time.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.400
Nice.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.400
And that's really because I have faith in the project

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.400
and the plug-ins that I need are available,

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.400
so I'm making the switch.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.400
Yeah.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.400
I've got a simple UPS.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.400
It's connected via USB.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:09.400
And the plug-in in Open Media Vault is the NUT plug-in,

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.400
which is the...

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.400
Oh, okay.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.400
It's the network UPS tool or something like that.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400
Right.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.400
I did see that, but that seemed like that was only applicable

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:20.400
to UPSs connected by IP that manage multiple machines.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.400
Yeah.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.400
It's, I think, a misnomer from the heritage of the project.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.400
It's been called NUT forever, but in actual fact,

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:32.400
it can monitor UPSs that are plugged in over RS232 and UPS.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.400
Oh, that's great.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.400
Okay.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.400
I have one of those.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.400
So, yeah, if you've got a UPS that is compatible with NUT,

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.400
it will work with Open Media Vault.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:45.400
And, yeah, the configuration changes that you might stick in

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:50.400
Etsy default, there's a little text dialog within Open Media Vault

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.400
to send your UPS any additional config should it need it

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.400
for listening to the data.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.400
So there's some specifics allowed there.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.400
That's nice.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.400
Yeah.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.400
And then you can hook that up.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:06.400
So the network piece is that you can have one box monitor the UPS,

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.400
and then you can have other boxes monitor that machine,

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.400
or that machine tell the other boxes.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:18.400
So in my case, when that main server detects the UPS has gone active,

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.400
it then tells everything else to shut down.

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.400
Yeah.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.400
Right.

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.400
So if I had multiple servers, I could use that.

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.400
That is nice.

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.400
Yeah.

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.400
That is really nice.

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.400
Okay.

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:29.400
That's worth spending some time setting up then.

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:30.400
Yeah.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:35.400
And then generally speaking, I've got the Plex plug-in up and running.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.400
That's doing all of that.

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:44.400
I use NFS because I've got all of my local stuff sitting there running.

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.400
I access that way.

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:49.400
I've got one Samba share for when family visit,

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.400
and they might want to deposit some photos somewhere.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.400
So I just have a general purpose Samba share up and running for them too.

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.400
It's actually very useful.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.400
Data into.

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.400
Yeah.

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:05.400
And then without using Open Media Vault itself, I have a Dropbox,

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:08.400
headless Dropbox running.

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:14.400
And I do that so that I have an always LAN sync copy of my Dropbox on the network.

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:15.400
I've done that too.

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.400
That makes sense, yeah.

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:22.400
But then what I also do is I do an R snapshot backup of that Dropbox.

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:27.400
So if Dropbox ever go away for whatever reason,

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.400
I actually have a full offline copy of my Dropbox.

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.400
I should relook at how I do that.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.400
I kind of do something similar, but I'm not using R snapshot,

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.400
and that would be a good tool for that.

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:38.400
Yeah.

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.400
And then I also have Act Cacher NG, which again is just installed

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.400
because it's Debian at the back end.

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.400
It's not through Open Media Vault itself,

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.400
and that's so all of the machines I have on my network here,

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:55.400
when they do their apt updates, they go through this caching proxy

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.400
rather than all sucking stuff down over the network each time.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.400
Now, boy, that is something we should – let's talk about that more next week.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.400
Let's talk about how you do that next week,

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:11.400
because I think that's like digital ocean level local speeds there.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.400
I've got to talk about that.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.400
Yeah, and when you're connected to the internet with a radio connection,

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.400
you want that kind of stuff.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.400
Suddenly these optimizations become important.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.400
You know, I wasn't sure if the review was fair or not.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.400
I had a really hard time afterwards.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.400
I wasn't clear because I think it's a really good project,

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:29.400
and I think it is much more competitive than people give it credit for,

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.400
or really like the name recognition.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.400
It doesn't get the name recognition it deserves.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.400
Yeah, it's bulletproof.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.400
I mean, your criticism was you had a specific use case,

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:46.400
which was connecting a server to another server over NFS.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.400
Or potentially a couple of back end.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:54.400
Yeah, and I'd suggest that maybe iSCSI is the better tool.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.400
I think you're right.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.400
If iSCSI is supported by these storage appliances,

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.400
that would probably be a better tool, and that would work.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.400
And it would show up in all of the applications as volume.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.400
Yeah.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.400
That would be nice.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.400
I think what I walked away with was a sort of relief.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.400
I know that sounds weird, but I have been feeling anxious

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.400
that Linux didn't have a FreeNAS competitor.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.400
Yeah, no, that's very well said.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.400
We don't have a great solid PF sense, at least in my estimation so far.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.400
We don't have a great solid PF sense competitor,

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.400
and I thought the same was true with FreeNAS.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.400
And then I looked at Open Media Vault,

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.400
and I realized it's a pretty damn good product.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.400
In some ways, the way it is right now kind of echoes

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:44.400
how it is the Linux version of the way FreeNAS is more compared to FreeBSD.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.400
And those things I like.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.400
I like those things about it.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.400
I like that it's based on Debian.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.400
I like GrayHole.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:56.400
I like the idea of managing my storage with GrayHole.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.400
That really solved a problem for me that I had

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.400
that I couldn't quite figure out how I was going to solve.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.400
And so it's a pretty competitive product, and it has a great heritage,

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.400
and it's based on a solid Debian base.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.400
And I wasn't sure how the review came off, but then we got the emails.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.400
The emails started coming in, and I got a few emails where people said,

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.400
Hey, after your review, I decided to give it a try.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.400
I'm switching over.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.400
I decided to give it a shot.

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.400
And that feels good because I didn't want to discourage people from trying it.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.400
Yeah.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.400
Because I'm actually going to put it into deployment at Angela's house,

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.400
and if you think about it, that's sort of the most trusting scenario because I –

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.400
You do not want to have to go deal with that.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.400
Exactly.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.400
I want to set it up.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.400
I want to give her a UI for it to work, and I want it to be bulletproof,

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.400
and I want to learn from that over time, and I'm going to manage it,

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.400
but I want it to be really self-reliant.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400
Yeah, exactly.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.400
And so that's where we're going to go next.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:58.400
I was surprised to see that one of my coworkers had an open media vault with ZFS set up.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.400
Oh, yeah?

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.400
And he's fairly technical but doesn't have a huge Linux history,

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.400
so I was like, well, that obviously works pretty well for you if you can get that going.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.400
He's had it for a number of years.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.400
Well, if you don't know what we're talking about because – who was – Mosinrath.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.400
Mosinrath, if you don't know what we're talking about, open media vault,

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.400
go check out the recent episodes of the Linux action show.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.400
If you go to jupitabroadcaching.com and you go to the Linux action show page,

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.400
we did an open media revolt just like two weeks ago, episode 436 of the Linux action show.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.400
We did open media vault versus FreeNAS because bump, bump, bump.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.400
Versus sells those clicks, man.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:35.400
It does, and both Noah and I have a lot of experience with FreeNAS,

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:38.400
so it just made sense that we would be comparing it constantly to FreeNAS.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.400
It's what the market, you know.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.400
And it's what people are curious about.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.400
So that was episode 4, Hyundai, and 36 of the Linux action show,

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.400
which is ridiculous that that number starts with a 4.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.400
That's awesome.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.400
That's crazy.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.400
Linux action show is ridiculous.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:55.400
And also, if you want more open daylight summit or software-defined networking

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:59.400
or just want to get a better feel for what it's like to go to a summit like that,

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.400
if you've never been, definitely check out the most recent episode,

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.400
437 of the Linux action show, or go to our YouTube channel,

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.400
youtube.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.400
There's a mini rover log posted of our trip to the open daylight summit.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.400
Pretty fun.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.400
Yeah, it was fun.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.400
And we did a little video at that place that had the best burgers out.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.400
Okay.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:24.400
Now, you can stop me at any point if a lie is coming out of my mouth.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.400
Okay, I will.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.400
I absolutely will.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:34.400
At the lunchbox, while we were sitting there, an intelligent, well-spoken,

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:41.400
attractive, well-dressed young lady came up and started a conversation with us.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.400
And why did she do that, Wes?

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.400
That would be my Linux action show T-shirt.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.400
Is it?

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400
It was legit.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.400
For the first time ever.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.400
I couldn't believe it.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.400
That was great.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.400
And we didn't have it on camera.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.400
But we actually got approached because we were wearing a Linux shirt by a girl.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.400
And she was there, a lady, a woman.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.400
I believe it was Intel.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.400
Yeah, I think she was there as, you know, she was there.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.400
But she was just, she loved Linux.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.400
And she came up and said, hey, I saw you had a Linux shirt on.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.400
I just want to talk.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.400
Where can I find out more information?

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:10.400
So if she happens to be watching this episode of the Linux action show, I don't remember

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:11.400
your name.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.400
So be sure to tweet me at Chris LAS.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.400
Yeah, please.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.400
We'd love to have you as part of the community, part of the Mumble Room here.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.400
You should join our Mumble Room.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.400
We're over at jblive.tv.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.400
And here's the nice thing.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.400
The Mumble Room is open to anybody.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.400
So you could join us.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.400
And I have been hoping to get a female voice on this show for a long time.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.400
We get them from time to time when we invite them directly.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.400
But I know our community has, yeah, it would be wonderful to have more.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:34.400
I have a feeling that you just, you know, don't worry.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.400
Don't worry.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.400
It is a totally low pressure environment.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.400
You come hang out with us.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.400

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.400
Check out this Sunday's Linux Action Show.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.400
Do it.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:01.400
We're going to have our review of Plasma 5.8, the long term support edition.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.400
We'll tell you how that goes.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400
I'm excited already.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:08.400
Also, I'm sure in future episodes of the Unplugged program, we'll have a little more interviews

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.400
from the floor of Open Daylight Summit.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.400
So look forward to that, too.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.400
More community stuff, technical stuff, good stuff.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.400
Thanks for being here.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.400
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:17:06.400
All right, guys, head over to JBtitles.com right now and get your submissions in and

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.400
vote, vote, vote.

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.400
You heard it right.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.400
That's banksuggest.com.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.400
That is just how I say it.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.400
That was good.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.400
JBtitles.com.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.400
Go there now.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:23.400
For a second, I thought it was Chris.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.400
Hey, is that Chris?

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.400
That's not Chris.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.400
For a second there, they thought it was.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.400
JBtitles.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.400
I mean, you already fooled them with that Plasma video that only kind of sounded like

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.400
you.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.400
Who knows?

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.400
We keep you guessing on this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.400
So, Mr. Wimpy, are you employed, unemployed, employed again?

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.400
What's your status right now?

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.400
I am employed.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.400
I'm in my second week in the new job.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.400
And how is it going?

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.400
Yeah, going very well.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.400
Thank you.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.400
Congratulations.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.400
Glad to hear that.

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.400
And already hard at work?

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.400
Yes.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400
Yes.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:05.400
So I've been getting to know the team and I've been assigned some stuff to get on with

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:12.400
and 1610's around the corner, so everyone's working on fixing the last bits and bobs for

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.400
that.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.400
Huh.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.400
That sounds delightful.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.400
And do you get to share what bits and bobs you get to work on?

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:25.400
Well, I'm on the desktop team, so I'm working on desktop stuff.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:35.400
So at the moment, for 1610, I'm mostly working on some fixes for Unity 7.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:42.400
But then in a couple of weeks, all of the Ubuntu engineering staff are getting together

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:51.400
for a sprint to plan out the next six months and snaps, Snappy and Unity 8 feature in all

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.400
of that work.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:58.400
I just saw a news item go by that the software center got support for screenshots of Snap

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.400
packages.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.400
So Snap packages can have screenshots in the software center, which is really nice.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.400
Yeah, they're just nice.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.400
Yeah.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.400
So the sprint that's coming up is an internal company one, but I was looking through.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:16.400
There are some guests and some of the same community contributors that were at the Snappy

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.400
sprint are being invited back again, so that's good to see.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.400
And are you able to work from home, Wimpy?

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.400
Are you going into an office?

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.400
I work from home all the time.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:29.400
So one of the things I've been busy with is actually building my home office.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.400
Oh, I would love to hear about that.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.400
Yeah, so that's finished now.

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.400
What do you mean when you say build?

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.400
What's the extent of that?

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.400
Did you build a new room or did you redo a room or did you set up a desk?

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.400
What's that?

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.400
When you say build an office.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.400
Yeah, I redid a room.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.400
So I used to have an office in the house years ago, and then after my daughter was born,

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:55.400
that room sort of became the room of crap and boxes and everything that sort of gets

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.400
displaced when children enter a house.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:01.400
And there are things that come in so many boxes, really.

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.400
Oh my goodness.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:08.400
So it was just like six years worth of clutter and mess.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.400
So yeah, it took about five weekends to clear it all up, redecorate.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:19.400
So I've got three desks in here and two racks and several servers.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.400
Oh, that's great.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.400
Lots of laptops and computers all set up, all easy access.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.400
So I've got lots of space to do my work.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:31.400
Were you able to make any accommodations for that podcasting thing that you find yourself

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.400
doing so much now?

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:38.400
Yeah, so the desk I'm sat on here has got a Rode arm on it with the mic on it so that

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.400
can swivel away out of the way when I'm not using it.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.400
And the mixer's on the desk here.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.400
So yeah, it's all nicely arranged.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.400
It's very comfortable.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:51.400
It's nice when you get a chance to redo all that, when things have transitioned and you

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:54.400
do new things and you kind of have new things that you need to accommodate.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.400
It's a great time to be able to redo the home office.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.400
Yeah, it really is.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.400
And I was reading about working from home, and one of the bits of advice was make sure

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:07.400
your work environment is comfortable and a nice place to be.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.400
So I've worked hard on that.

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.400
My wife's helped as well.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:14.400
So my wife has made this contraption where I've actually got a pull-down green screen

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.400
from the ceiling as well now.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.400
Now look at this.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.400
Now what's the green screen for?

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:25.400
Well, occasionally I do video stuff and green screen's handy for that.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.400
Yeah, I've noticed.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:32.400
Also, my wife is a little bit privacy conscious, so putting the green screen up means that

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.400
you can't see anything on her side of the office.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400
Oh, that's nice.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400
That is nice.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:41.400
Yeah, so she's put this green screen so I can pull the green screen down from the ceiling

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.400
and tuck it away again when I don't need it.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.400
That's nice.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:49.400
I was thinking about doing something kind of like that in a workspace that I'm thinking

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.400
about using.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:57.400
So was that actually like a kitsch you bought or how did you get a tuck away green screen?

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.400
My wife made it.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.400
That's awesome.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:04.400
So she bought the fabric a while ago and then she's bought all sorts of bits and pieces

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.400
and actually constructed it herself.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.400
So I went away.

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:12.400
So one of the things I was doing a couple of weeks ago is I went to give some presentations

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:18.400
to some charities in this country about Linux and open source and the role it might play

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.400
in their organizations.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.400
And whilst I was away doing that for a few days, I came back and found this green screen

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:27.400
hanging from the ceiling when I came back.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.400
So yeah, that was her little job whilst I was away, which is pretty cool.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.400
I didn't know she was going to do it.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.400
That's awesome.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.400
So you got the new computers.

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.400
You got a new workspace.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.400
That's a good setup.

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:37.400
Yeah.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.400
Yeah.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.400
I'm all.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.400
Yeah.

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:41.400
Yeah.

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.400
Yeah.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.400
Yeah.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.400
Well, that sounds really cool.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.400
I would love to.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.400
Do they take.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:47.400
Do they have guests over there?

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.400
Of course, you don't.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.400
Have you ever.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:50.400
Have you gone to their officials?

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.400
So how did that work?

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.400
Like when your first couple of days and orientation, did you travel?

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.400
You traveled to an office.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.400
You spent time there.

01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:01.400
And then once your actual day to day work started, you went back to your home and started

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:02.400
working.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.400
Nope.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.400
Nope.

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.400
It was all done remote.

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.400
So I have been to the.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.400
Yeah.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.400
Yeah.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.400
It was.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.400
Yeah.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.400
So I have been to the office once before, but that was, you know, as a community contributor,

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.400
right?

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:20.880
You might remember I took part in the user testing studies for Unity eight a while back.

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:25.040
So that's the only time I've been to the, to the main office.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:33.160
But no, they the various departments liaise with you remotely and leading up to it, you,

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:37.480
you do things like sorting out your payroll and all of that with the HR departments.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.480
Right.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:46.600
And then on day one, you get all of your accounts allocated and you through launch pad you log

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:51.080
in and then you're able to access an area where you can access all of your credentials.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:57.240
And then the first day is basically setting up all of your, you know, access to everything.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.240
Yeah.

01:23:58.240 --> 01:23:59.240
Yeah.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:03.320
And and then as you access things, you then find out it's like, it's a bit like a, um,

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:07.560
an adventure game, you know, as, as you set up an account and access something, you then

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:12.280
find all those, all of these extra things you need to do first few days is sort of,

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:17.760
you know, chasing around and getting yourself set up on all the systems and everything is.

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.480
But yeah, that all happens, all happens remotely.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.480
It's like.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.480
Wow.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.480
Impressive.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.480
Yeah, it is.

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.480
Actually, it's, it's fairly impressive.

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:28.200
I guess, I guess that is probably, they've probably worked in a mode where so many of

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:32.880
their workers are remote for so long that they, that's exactly what you do.

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.080
And you think, you know, it's kind of, it's kind of funny because that's kind of becoming

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.000
more and more common because they've been kind of common for us.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.280
We work with probably more people remotely than we do.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:45.200
So yeah, I guess it's just kind of becoming the way more modern businesses is happening.

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:51.600
So you should get like a 4k video wall and it's like everyone's in the same room.

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.440
I just settle for mumble.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.440
I'll settle for mumble.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:03.520
Yeah, I have, I have put a TV up on one of the back walls in the office with a Roku attached

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:09.280
to it to have bits and bobs playing in the background whilst I'm working, you know, stay

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.960
up to speed on the news and things and listen to podcasts.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:22.000
I have gotten a lot of distance out of a Roku and now the Android TV to the point where

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:32.320
it sort of changed the way I do my own content because it is, the YouTube algorithm is once

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:39.360
you start feeding it properly is actually pretty good in a weird like, it manages every

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:43.560
day now to expose something that I find interesting to watch on YouTube and now it's all just

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.640
sort of integrated into my television.

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:52.520
So I listen to a lot more YouTube shows than I used to and then I have ways from pocket

01:25:52.520 --> 01:26:00.240
cast directly on my TV to Chrome casting it or whatever, you know, whatever method you

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:03.760
want to get the audio to move around so I can listen to podcasts on my TV too and then

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.920
continue to play them on my phone later.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:12.360
It is getting to the point now where when I first started doing podcasts, the only people

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:16.880
that were listening were people that were downloading the files and then syncing them

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.880
to a device of some type that was capable of doing a playback of some kind and maybe

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:25.760
through like a tape adapter in the car or something like it's legitimately like it was

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.480
there wasn't really there wasn't Bluetooth in the cars, there weren't smartphone apps,

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:35.000
there weren't internet connected TV set top boxes and it was and now like you can get

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.740
the JB Roku app or the or the JB Cody add on which Rob Loach is working on right now.

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:43.800
You can get and then you can just like you can just watch all our stuff like it's just

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.100
it's just it's on this there's a there's a here's an icon for Jupiter broadcasting here's

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:51.480
an icon for CBS News it's like it's we're all like the same playing field you just have

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:55.200
to know about it we're not on the same just like discovery is still a challenge but the

01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:00.320
availability from where it was eight nine ten years ago oh my god yeah so I love the

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:09.320
Roku I love the Android TV not huge on the fire but yeah yeah I've kicked my Amazon fire

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:16.840
TV into touch now it lasted about a year before the Roku the the new Roku just yeah surpassed

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:22.680
it in terms of media playback yeah the the gaming aspect of the fire TV was fun but it

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:30.240
wasn't enough to keep it keep it in the room that is that is a surprising that is coming

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:37.840
so I you know I have the shield TV at the RV and the kids are driving more gaming oh

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.160
really and I wasn't really something so that when you buy an Android shield TV thing whatever

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:48.080
it's called a video Android shield TV whatever it comes if you get the cheap one the one

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:54.080
that I actually I paid full price for it comes with a game controller and not a remote and

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.240
I thought and it's a it's a decent like Xbox 360 knockoff game controller I thought that's

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:05.520
weird and then if you get like the pro version it comes with a remote and a controller and

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:11.320
so they really put an emphasis on the controller and I I now have started to realize that what

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:16.600
Nvidia is doing is they're combining like a curation of really good Android games like

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:20.880
the really good ones the ones that like don't I don't even I don't even really know I didn't

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:23.760
know some of these games are even available for Android plus they're combining with like

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:27.900
some sort of remote GPU streaming service that they offer that was like online see that's

01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:33.240
really nice I haven't tried that yet but so you can get all kinds of regular desktop games

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:39.160
for a $7 a month subscription and the kids that sounds great is for them it's it's it's

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:42.560
fantastic and so we're getting price there's probably a lot of games for them to try and

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.200
so like right now on the from the shield TV we have like a Mickey Mouse game and a Ducktales

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:53.080
game and Raymond runs games you know just really basic games but for for young kids

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:58.160
that can they can now get to play their their experience of gaming so far has been on an

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:06.760
iPad or an Android tablet like it's very it's very like it's a very vertical you know personal

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:10.480
gaming experience it's not a collaborative gaming experience it's not a whole the whole

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.800
family sitting on the couch all yeah all trying to figure it out and that's what's been really

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:19.120
interesting is now all of a sudden we've we've just sort of stumbled into this because the

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:24.440
shield TV has all this gaming capability just and we started you know a while ago on the

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:27.160
Roku with some of the simple games like Angry Birds and stuff like that and that's kind

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:30.240
of where I had a sense that they would be into it but I don't have the funds to buy

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:35.480
a gaming console but the shield TV has some legitimate graphics multi-purpose trying to

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:40.360
which I realize is not the newest game but oh my god just trying to look at 1080p on

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:44.160
your television I've had older laptops that struggle with that we just sit there with

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:49.560
our get with our mouth gaping it's so gorgeous it's just it's just really really really beautiful

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:56.200
and it's 60 frames a second smooth you know really nice and that has been a surprise is

01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:01.400
because now it's dad can we dad can we not what do we want to watch but what we can what

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:06.620
can we play and what's been interesting is how adorable they all are working together

01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:11.240
trying to solve the problem you know which is yeah that's that's that's the nice thing

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:16.720
about having on a TV that a console kind of brings into a family that having a computer

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:37.240
or a tablet doesn't really and just sort of fumbled into it a little bit yeah well
