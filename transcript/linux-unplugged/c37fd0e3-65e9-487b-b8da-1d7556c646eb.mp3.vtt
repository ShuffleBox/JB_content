WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
Oh hey, Mumble Room, before we get started, this is going to be an official thing we do

00:03.280 --> 00:08.220
in the show, but I just wanted to introduce you all to L, who has just joined the Jupiter

00:08.220 --> 00:09.220
broadcasting team.

00:09.220 --> 00:10.220
Hey, L.

00:10.220 --> 00:11.220
Hey, everyone.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.220
Hey, everyone.

00:12.220 --> 00:13.220
Hey, L.

00:13.220 --> 00:14.220
Hey.

00:14.220 --> 00:15.220
Hello.

00:15.220 --> 00:16.220
And what will L be doing?

00:16.220 --> 00:33.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 286, for January 29th, 2019.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.720
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that actually isn't having too much

00:37.720 --> 00:38.720
caffeine.

00:38.720 --> 00:39.720
I don't know what's going on.

00:39.720 --> 00:40.720
My name is Chris.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.440
My name is Wes, and I'm plenty caffeinated.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.440
Don't you worry.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.440
Good, good.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.340
We're just like fired up today.

00:46.340 --> 00:47.500
It's been a really good day.

00:47.500 --> 00:52.720
We did some live streaming, and today on the show, I have an opportunity to introduce a

00:52.720 --> 00:57.900
new member of our team who's been working on a super secret project for about the last

00:57.900 --> 01:00.760
month that we get to announce on the show today.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.580
So I'm pretty, pretty amped.

01:03.580 --> 01:08.180
But on top of that, we have some fantastic community news for you Firefox users.

01:08.180 --> 01:12.120
Pretty significant update on the Librem 5 and the PureOS Store.

01:12.120 --> 01:16.280
We have some details, a new Kodi, a little details in the canonical corner we'll get

01:16.280 --> 01:17.680
to later on.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.660
And then we'll do that introduction with our new team member, tell you about what we're

01:21.660 --> 01:26.080
going to be working on, what's coming down and the new study groups that we're launching,

01:26.080 --> 01:27.680
which are going to be awesome.

01:27.680 --> 01:32.420
And they'll be right after Linux Unplugged starting next week, involving our virtual

01:32.420 --> 01:38.100
lug and taking questions directly from the training architects that make the course material.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.100
We tell you more about that.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.100
I'm just very excited.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.800
It's going to be something, just a little thing we're doing and it's going to be just

01:43.800 --> 01:47.640
something totally free, not even part of the show, just something we do for the community.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.280
It's pretty exciting to get to do that kind of stuff, but I'll tell you more about that.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.480
I'm very excited.

01:51.480 --> 01:56.440
So before we get going, before I spoil everything, let's bring in our virtual lug.

01:56.440 --> 02:03.960
Time, appropriate greetings, mumble room, hello, hello.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.640
This is a show and we've got Brent is in there.

02:06.640 --> 02:07.640
Bruce is in there.

02:07.640 --> 02:14.400
Bruce is back, El's in there, ooh, iBitten, Eric, MiniMech, Sean and Mr. Wimpris returns.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.920
It is good to see you again, Wimpy.

02:15.920 --> 02:16.920
Hello, sir.

02:16.920 --> 02:17.920
How have you been?

02:17.920 --> 02:18.920
Yeah, I've been very well.

02:18.920 --> 02:23.960
You know, busy, you know, Christmas, New Year and then off to South Africa and back.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.400
So I haven't been around much recently.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.800
Well, I'm glad to have you back.

02:28.800 --> 02:33.360
It's good to hear your voice and Mr. Payne, what do you say we kick things off with some

02:33.360 --> 02:41.200
Firefox news, version 65.null is out and sort of great timing with the messaging on this

02:41.200 --> 02:42.200
one.

02:42.200 --> 02:46.400
One of the headline features enhanced tracking protection and improved performance and web

02:46.400 --> 02:49.640
compatibility, including the WebP image format.

02:49.640 --> 02:54.000
But I want to talk about stack smashing here for a second, because this is the big headline

02:54.000 --> 02:55.800
for us Linux users.

02:55.800 --> 03:02.120
Enhanced security for macOS, Linux and Android users via stronger stack smashing protection,

03:02.120 --> 03:05.380
which is now enabled by default on these platforms.

03:05.380 --> 03:06.640
What stack smashing, Wes?

03:06.640 --> 03:07.640
What is this?

03:07.640 --> 03:10.000
Well, so really, really, it's just been compiled now.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.400
We've got some new defaults on Firefox so that, well, stack is a region of memory that

03:15.400 --> 03:18.640
programs can use to write to that's sort of pre allocated.

03:18.640 --> 03:23.040
And there's various techniques that you can have bad assumptions made or just, you know,

03:23.040 --> 03:28.180
common errors in programs, especially low level programs like you might find in a browser.

03:28.180 --> 03:32.240
These compiled time protections make sure that it's a lot harder for people trying to

03:32.240 --> 03:38.200
trigger on your untrusted input, triggering bad actions that might harm all your precious

03:38.200 --> 03:39.200
files.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.200
I knew you'd have the answer.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.200
I knew you'd know.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.000
There's a few other new features as well, aren't there?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Oh, yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Easier performance management.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.040
They've got a revamped task manager pane.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.640
That's just over at about performance.

03:49.640 --> 03:54.080
If you want to go take a look and an improved pop up blocker to prevent multiple pop up

03:54.080 --> 03:57.840
windows from being opened at the same time, which, you know, that doesn't happen to me

03:57.840 --> 04:01.400
very often, but I imagine I would be very annoyed.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.740
And it's worth noting for you enterprise users that are deploying Firefox.

04:05.740 --> 04:10.660
There's now 32 bit and 64 bit MSI installers for easier enterprise deployment.

04:10.660 --> 04:16.300
And I've been in the chat room is pointing out that the Android and iOS versions of this

04:16.300 --> 04:19.760
will be released on January 30th as we record.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.440
Only the desktop versions were released today.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.440
Thanks, Benton.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.200
That's a good clarification.

04:24.200 --> 04:30.160
So version 65.0 of the little browser that still can and hopefully still will for a very

04:30.160 --> 04:36.560
long time, there was a scathing article recently suggesting that Mozilla should just dump Gecko

04:36.560 --> 04:43.600
and switch over to Blink and just stop fighting the tide, stop fighting that wave of change

04:43.600 --> 04:52.480
from WebKit over to WebKit and instead embrace it and attempt to impact its development.

04:52.480 --> 04:56.200
And their core argument, I'm curious what your thoughts are on this, Wes.

04:56.200 --> 05:01.160
Their core argument really was that the web is becoming more like a runtime now.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.840
It's more of an applications platform.

05:03.840 --> 05:08.960
And the applications can be much, much better if they can be built assuming you're using

05:08.960 --> 05:10.780
one rendering engine.

05:10.780 --> 05:16.480
And he argues that it's not like Internet Explorer because unlike Internet Explorer,

05:16.480 --> 05:20.520
it's all open source and people can participate in the development of it.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.120
They can have their own forks of it, et cetera.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.400
What do you think of that argument?

05:24.400 --> 05:26.540
There's certainly true things in that argument.

05:26.540 --> 05:28.020
There's lots about that.

05:28.020 --> 05:33.560
And you also see that particular platform often having stuff first or implementing test

05:33.560 --> 05:36.000
APIs that end up getting supported.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.380
You and I sometimes use some stuff that requires Chrome in order to function properly.

05:41.380 --> 05:44.320
And so you can sometimes build some really rich experiences.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.360
And they're right that, yes, it's open source.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.360
It's not.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.360
It is not.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.040
It's fundamentally different than Internet Explorer.

05:50.040 --> 05:54.700
But I think we need multiple implementations and we should be coding against a standard

05:54.700 --> 06:00.560
and not just what becomes ossified in the default implementation of the web.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.560
Right.

06:01.560 --> 06:02.560
Right.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.560
Yeah.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.560
Otherwise, what's the point of standards?

06:04.560 --> 06:05.560
Yeah.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.100
Otherwise, it's just whatever this one project does is all we have as an option.

06:08.100 --> 06:12.660
And I think the thing that was frustrating me about the core of the argument is it's

06:12.660 --> 06:16.440
an interesting idea except for we've been there, done that, and it was horrible and

06:16.440 --> 06:22.160
the web stagnated badly when Internet Explorer 6 and et cetera were dominant.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.820
And it, I think, set the web back many years.

06:24.820 --> 06:30.780
And it wasn't until we started to see that monopoly over the web get cracked by Chrome

06:30.780 --> 06:34.960
and Firefox that the web started to get better.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.760
It's still crap, but it got a lot better.

06:36.760 --> 06:42.480
And so it's sort of a failing to learn from past mistakes kind of argument, I think.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.120
I have actually even more pragmatic view on this.

06:45.120 --> 06:55.440
So yes, Internet Explorer did meant that we stalled innovation until we got some competition.

06:55.440 --> 07:00.680
But I don't want to have a meltdown of the browser or a specter of the browser.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.240
And it's just more likely if you all is using the same.

07:03.240 --> 07:07.540
I mean, even Microsoft's browser is going to be using Chrome as a base.

07:07.540 --> 07:10.720
So yeah, we kind of have enough Chrome around.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.280
It's everybody, really.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.400
Let's have one that is not.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.520
Yeah, please.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.160
Speaking of maybe not learning from past mistakes, but we just don't know yet.

07:21.160 --> 07:26.800
We have some firm details from Purism on the Librem 5's hardware.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.320
And this is pretty nice because they haven't given details on some of these things.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.120
And some of these things we've known for a long time.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.040
And it's looking like it's going to have a pretty competitive feature set.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.200
It will have 802.11 BG and end Wi-Fi.

07:40.200 --> 07:45.160
The display will be 720 by 1440 with a high DPI screen that's glossy.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.960
Three gigs of RAM could subject to change.

07:47.960 --> 07:53.160
Micro SD card slot, a loudspeaker as they put it, a headphone jack,

07:53.160 --> 07:57.840
one SIM card slot, a camera front and back, replaceable battery, tools required,

07:57.840 --> 08:01.080
and a smart card reader that is OpenPGP compatible.

08:01.080 --> 08:10.720
And the key detail is the CPU, the NXP-IMX8M quad or quad mini CPU.

08:10.720 --> 08:15.400
Now, I saw some feedback that came into Linux Action News, I believe it was,

08:15.400 --> 08:18.000
where we were looking at an image of the development board.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.040
And we noticed that the developer of Post Market OS had

08:22.040 --> 08:25.640
rigged a way to get a fan over the CPU to cool it.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.400
Now, he wrote in and

08:27.400 --> 08:31.920
clarified a little bit that the CPU does run extremely hot right now,

08:31.920 --> 08:33.760
even using the standard tools.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.840
And so that's an area that likely is going to be tweaked over time or

08:36.840 --> 08:38.440
hopefully be tweaked over time.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.360
That's a little concerning.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.320
Yeah, and he says different people with different dev kits have rigged different

08:43.320 --> 08:44.600
ways to cool that CPU.

08:45.720 --> 08:50.600
He just rigged up some stiff wire and got like a little tiny like 20 millimeter fan

08:50.600 --> 08:54.000
or whatever, just even smaller than that, just one of those real noisy suckers

08:54.000 --> 08:58.760
right over the CPU to try to keep it cool like when doing software builds and stuff.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.160
It's early days though, right?

09:00.160 --> 09:03.320
I mean, that could probably get fixed.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.760
I feel like out of the group here, Wimpy probably has some of the most experience

09:06.760 --> 09:07.800
with this.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.320
Have you seen this picture, Wimpy, and

09:09.320 --> 09:11.840
are you following any of the Librem 5 news?

09:11.840 --> 09:14.960
I did look at this picture weeks ago when it was first out.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.800
And I'm following along with Librem stuff when podcasts cover it, but

09:18.800 --> 09:23.080
I've not followed any of the blogs myself.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.720
I think you know my position.

09:24.720 --> 09:29.480
I'm very skeptical that they'll ship a device this year.

09:29.480 --> 09:34.440
They feel like they're a long, long way off and perhaps we'll see this in 2020.

09:34.440 --> 09:39.840
Yeah, I follow it with some interest mostly because I still see the Librem 5

09:39.840 --> 09:47.760
mentioned almost on a daily basis online as a possible solution to all of our woes.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.720
There's a lot of hopes and promises that are being pinned on this.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.960
And I think Purism is pretty aware of that.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.760
And they're trying to message, they're trying to keep that interest up.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.360
They're trying to actively communicate.

09:57.360 --> 10:01.880
And one of the things they've been talking about is the Pure OS store.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.920
So of course, if you're going to create your own phone operating system,

10:04.920 --> 10:07.200
you then also need to create your own store.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.080
And they're giving us details on that.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.480
It's going to be based around flat packs.

10:12.480 --> 10:16.920
Yeah, so they announced the Pure OS store, you gotta have your own store.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.960
That's just, you're right, that's how it has to work.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.160
But there's no other way to do it.

10:20.160 --> 10:23.040
At least they're going to use some sort of the underlying technology

10:23.040 --> 10:25.760
we're all becoming more familiar with.

10:25.760 --> 10:29.560
Now they've already got a very first application and that's going to be Lollipop.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.680
The Lollipop application is of course a GNOME music player.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.880
Yeah, that's not a bad first choice, I suppose.

10:35.880 --> 10:39.600
And I can see why Flatpaks makes a good choice for them

10:39.600 --> 10:43.920
because they can have a self-hosted repository that they manage and curate

10:43.920 --> 10:47.840
and have like that can be the backend to their own store.

10:47.840 --> 10:53.080
It seems like a, I don't know, it seems like maybe not a format

10:53.080 --> 10:56.320
that was specifically designed for this kind of use.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.960
But if you're going to be so GNOME heavy as they seem to be, it kind of makes sense.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.840
I mean, it might be an interesting thing to reflect on, right?

11:01.840 --> 11:04.480
We'll see how well this goes and how well Flatpak meets that need.

11:04.480 --> 11:08.240
Yeah, and it may be a great highlight of some of some GNOME apps

11:08.240 --> 11:11.000
that do really good at refactoring their screen sizes

11:11.000 --> 11:13.840
or their application window sizes and whatnot.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.160
So yeah, there you go. There's a little Librem 5 update.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.760
I know there's a lot of interest out there, so I wanted to cover it.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.080
Still not backing it myself.

11:20.080 --> 11:24.840
But if they do get a shipping sellable product that I can buy, yeah, I think I will.

11:24.840 --> 11:27.880
Now, something that I'm all in on, though, is Kodi.

11:27.880 --> 11:31.680
Love it. Love it, especially since they released an Android version

11:31.680 --> 11:34.960
that runs on Android TV set-top boxes like the NVIDIA Shield.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.120
Just such a great open source media center.

11:38.120 --> 11:42.200
And after another long development period,

11:42.200 --> 11:45.600
this week the team has released Kodi 18.

11:45.600 --> 11:50.000
Immediately available on all of the supported platforms.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.840
Approaching nearly 10,000 commits.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.280
Nearly half a million lines of new code

11:55.280 --> 11:58.280
and nearly the same amount removed from the project.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.880
36 open source contributors.

12:00.880 --> 12:06.200
Many, many, they say quite literally many cases of beer and wine.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.280
Well, I mean, that's pretty much just what it takes, right?

12:08.280 --> 12:10.280
Especially when you're developing an open source project.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.720
Quite literally.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.280
Now, OK, one thing I was really curious to see,

12:14.280 --> 12:16.440
and it is a pretty big feature release.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.880
They've now got support for gaming emulators,

12:18.880 --> 12:22.160
ROMs and controllers to go along with those games.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.520
Yeah, like retro game playing built right in.

12:25.520 --> 12:28.440
Right from the same interface that you're already using for your media center.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.440
Mm hmm.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.120
One of the more controversial things they've added is support

12:32.120 --> 12:35.880
for digital rights management decryption.

12:35.880 --> 12:40.280
Which that's, you know, that is that's a real contentious topic

12:40.280 --> 12:44.080
with our audience and one that I have very many mixed feelings around.

12:44.080 --> 12:48.480
But it seems like in the set top TV market.

12:48.480 --> 12:53.920
You have to because every other single application on that device supports it,

12:53.920 --> 12:58.280
so you would literally be the only video playing app that doesn't.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.440
And that's just a really tough position to be in. Right.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.440
And when you when you're in when you're making something

13:02.440 --> 13:05.320
that then just can't play content that a lot of people want,

13:05.320 --> 13:06.720
it doesn't look good.

13:06.720 --> 13:11.080
Speaking of Android TV, Cody can now show its library contents on the main screen.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.920
And this is kind of a neat feature that Netflix and Plex and other apps

13:13.920 --> 13:17.040
take advantage of its you get these ribbons of content

13:17.040 --> 13:20.960
and and it's a great way to quickly restart a show.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.040
So I watch Deep Space Nine quite a bit and it's always right there.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.200
The next episode is always right there on the front of the Android TV screen.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.360
So I don't even have to launch the app.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.000
I just click it.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.480
It launches the connected app and starts playing that episode.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.600
So not only are they introducing that support,

13:34.600 --> 13:37.680
but they're also introducing full voice functionality.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.720
This is a big aspect of these things is the Google assistant is baked in

13:41.720 --> 13:46.240
and you can use that now to search for content like whatever you want

13:46.240 --> 13:52.360
or to fill in the on screen keyboard and it will search encoding and play it.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.280
Pretty, pretty nice.

13:53.280 --> 13:59.440
And I also notice they have some updates in here for improved RTMP stream support.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.920
Yeah, right. That's one thing about Cody is it doesn't matter what you're trying to play.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.200
They probably already have support or a plug in to support it.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.120
So you just throw whatever media you want at it and you can watch it.

14:09.120 --> 14:13.760
Yep. Yeah. And I think that is I think that is looking like a very solid update.

14:13.760 --> 14:18.640
I'm going to make sure I have that updated version as soon as I get home.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.520
Let's head over to the canonical corner for a moment.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.800
I just can't quit 1904.

14:37.800 --> 14:42.440
I've been running the daily now for weeks since after Christmas.

14:42.440 --> 14:47.240
And I mostly wanted to just soak in the new Gnome and see how it handled

14:47.240 --> 14:50.680
my multi monitor set up on my ThinkPad versus Plasma,

14:50.680 --> 14:56.320
which was causing significant performance issues on my vertical 27 inch screens

14:56.320 --> 15:04.040
and moved over to Ubuntu 1904 Disco Dingo and installed the Gnome desktop.

15:04.040 --> 15:10.040
And oh, man, oh, man, have those have those they were butter smooth.

15:10.040 --> 15:14.480
And I've only I've only been able to use it a little bit because I'm in Texas right now.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.200
But man, has it been good. And so I haven't been able to quit it.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.520
I thought I would actually Nuke and Pave and put Fedora on there

15:21.520 --> 15:25.480
and give the Fedora implementation a spin and maybe try out Pantheon

15:25.480 --> 15:29.080
because I've been told by Neil that if you're on Fedora Rawhide,

15:29.080 --> 15:31.360
you can install Pantheon on Fedora.

15:31.360 --> 15:35.560
And I thought that might be fun, but I can't quit.

15:35.560 --> 15:43.280
I can't quit 1904. So I feel like just a super, super quick take.

15:43.280 --> 15:48.480
I feel like I'm right back where I was ages ago when I used Ubuntu

15:48.480 --> 15:50.640
and one of the things that kind of made me move to Arch.

15:50.640 --> 15:54.320
And I'm so frustrated and yet happy to have goodies.

15:54.320 --> 16:01.320
And the issue simply is that Canonical is back to making each point release compelling.

16:01.320 --> 16:09.000
And makes me want to jump off of an LTS, off of a beautifully well-supported LTS

16:09.000 --> 16:14.400
onto the latest release that has, you know, much less support cycle

16:14.400 --> 16:16.640
simply because the new goodies are irresistible.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.080
Yeah, that does keep happening, right?

16:18.080 --> 16:23.560
Because for a while, the LTS is still so fresh and it does have that nice taste of stability.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.920
You're back in the mode of trying to just get work done and it's perfect.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.880
And then suddenly the grass really does grow greener.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.680
And you want the shiny new thing.

16:31.680 --> 16:35.880
That's the problem. The grass is greener. It is actually greener grass.

16:35.880 --> 16:40.600
And I like green grass. Wimpy, you're asking if the fractional scaling has landed yet.

16:40.600 --> 16:44.400
I don't actually have high DPI on the T480.

16:44.400 --> 16:49.680
I opted to just avoid that problem for a while and went 1080p.

16:49.680 --> 16:55.960
But I'm wondering how 1904 is shaping up from an Ubuntu Monte perspective.

16:55.960 --> 17:00.480
If it's a very radical change for you guys, if it's business as usual, that kind of stuff.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.440
Well, for Ubuntu Monte, it's business as usual.

17:03.440 --> 17:11.480
Hopefully, the new version of Monte desktop upstream will land in time that we can ship that.

17:11.480 --> 17:16.760
So I'm just looking at that at the moment, building the interim development snapshots.

17:16.760 --> 17:22.280
So that will be the main change should it all come together.

17:22.280 --> 17:27.040
But most of my focus is on Debian at the moment because Debian Buster is just around the corner

17:27.040 --> 17:32.000
and I'm helping the Monte guys in Debian get a new version stitched together there.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.120
But yeah, I was talking to Will a couple of weeks ago.

17:36.120 --> 17:42.160
And in GNOME for 1904, you'll find fractional scaling,

17:42.160 --> 17:47.880
but also fractional scaling in Xorg as well as Wayland Sessions.

17:47.880 --> 17:53.080
And also being able to scale monitors independently of one another,

17:53.080 --> 17:58.560
regardless of whether you're running Wayland or Xorg that will work in both display servers now.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.880
Oh, my goodness.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.480
Did we suddenly hit the future? What's happening?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.600
That is fantastic.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.760
I literally thought that would never come to X11.

18:07.760 --> 18:08.840
I had just given up hope.

18:08.840 --> 18:15.560
Yeah, so I know that Marco has been working on that and that's all submitted upstream and is in review.

18:15.560 --> 18:22.000
But I believe that we're going to be carrying that as vendor patches in 1904 if it doesn't land upstream in time.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.080
Right. That would be very interesting.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.360
I've been following it.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.200
I may still try Fedora out for a bit.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.920
I want to give the rawhide experience a go.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.360
But like Wes said, it's like the issue has been is now I got it set up.

18:34.360 --> 18:42.280
I'm getting work done and I still have all my machines except for this one on Plasma.

18:42.280 --> 18:46.280
However, I really have not had very many troubles.

18:46.280 --> 18:51.960
But I never really do on an all Intel setup where everything's Intel and I don't have a whole bunch of crap installed.

18:51.960 --> 18:54.040
I just have my basic work tools installed.

18:54.040 --> 18:57.800
I haven't tried to make it into a mobile audio production mixing workhouse yet.

18:57.800 --> 19:03.360
Right. It's usually when I start going off into these edge cases that it starts falling apart for me.

19:03.360 --> 19:09.040
So if I just kind of keep it simple and just using the Intel stuff, it's been fantastic.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.480
So we'll see what happens when I hook it up to the NVIDIA dock.

19:11.480 --> 19:18.960
Maybe that's the key to a long term gnome for you, Chris, is we just got to have one system that you use for nothing else but light work.

19:18.960 --> 19:33.080
Maybe, maybe. Speaking of upgrading to new Ubuntu releases, some news on the 25th of this week that Ubuntu users can now keep PPAs and third party repositories enabled when upgrading to newer versions.

19:33.080 --> 19:38.440
Oh, yeah. I mean, so it's kind of there's a couple of things here.

19:38.440 --> 19:45.960
One change in particular, make sure that third party repositories support the release to what you're actually trying to upgrade to.

19:45.960 --> 19:52.080
And then optionally, if it doesn't, disabling the repository if it doesn't support the version that you're about to be at.

19:52.080 --> 20:01.520
Now, there's another option that just sort of allow keeping PPAs and third party repositories installed instead of the old way where they would just disappear.

20:01.520 --> 20:11.840
So it's basically Ubuntu growing a little smarter at doing this, trying to hit the right balance between not wanting to break your upgrade, which can be something of a dangerous process,

20:11.840 --> 20:18.560
but not confusing end users who suddenly find that they no longer get updates or just don't have access to a whole bunch of software they'd already installed.

20:18.560 --> 20:27.840
It's kind of nice to see them giving it a go and it's already going to be available for Ubuntu 18.10 users that go to 19.04.

20:27.840 --> 20:33.080
That's kind of cool. And it looks like they're also proposing it for 18.04 to 18.10.

20:33.080 --> 20:36.680
Not landed yet, but it is in the proposed repository.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.080
Expect to see it on OS near you.

20:39.080 --> 20:47.920
Yeah. And then right before we get out of the canonical corner, why don't we talk just about why everybody needs to update their rigs this week if you're on Ubuntu.

20:47.920 --> 20:58.080
There's several security issues that were discovered in the Linux kernel and on 18.04 by Onyx Beaver affecting all of the derivatives based on 18.04, too.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.640
It's quite a bit. You want to break some of these down for us, Mr. Payne?

21:00.640 --> 21:03.320
Yeah, right. OK, so eleven total.

21:03.320 --> 21:17.040
They range from just like a use after free and sort of standard buffer overflow to some kind of more dangerous out of bound rights that could allow attackers to maybe execute arbitrary code or just crash your system and cause a denial of service.

21:17.040 --> 21:24.120
A lot of these involve problems over in our favorite ext4 file system.

21:24.120 --> 21:28.040
Yeah, that's the thing, isn't that? Like, that's the vector here.

21:28.040 --> 21:36.720
You know, some of these are kind of interesting. So if you are, one, make sure you do update, but two, you know, just go see kind of the day to day fixes that have to go happen to keep the kernel secure.

21:36.720 --> 21:43.520
Like there was a race condition in the VSOC address family implementation, which could also cause use after free condition.

21:43.520 --> 21:50.320
So they're all just little things. There's also some updates over in the over in KVM, which that's good. We want KVM to be secure.

21:50.320 --> 21:56.960
Yeah, Mr. Wu's name is on a lot of these bugs. He's been he's been really cracking. He's a Chrome developer.

21:56.960 --> 22:06.000
And Jan Horn of Google's Project Zero also discovered an issue in the kernel's ProcFS file system implementation.

22:06.000 --> 22:14.920
And so that's also in this fix. Like these aren't necessarily Ubuntu specific bugs, but these are bugs that will impact anyone on 1804.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.560
And these are the fixes that Canonical is shipping for now.

22:17.560 --> 22:27.800
And I think it's it's probably worth pointing this out from time to time because I just had somebody write into the show and argue the case for the studio systems never being updated.

22:27.800 --> 22:33.600
And they just basically said, install them, install all the software once, never install updates.

22:33.600 --> 22:38.800
And it was, you know, they tried to make a compelling case for it. And I just I can't wrap my head around that.

22:38.800 --> 22:45.080
I feel like if you if your operating system can't handle these important updates and there's something wrong, I'm not saying that is the case with with our studio systems.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.840
But like this just right here shows you why you need to stay up to date.

22:48.840 --> 22:53.400
And I mean, if you're you know, if you're using the LTS, you don't have to update kernels that often.

22:53.400 --> 22:58.680
You know, you're not doing this every other day. So you could have a little it's OK to reboot your system now and again.

22:58.680 --> 23:02.720
And actually, you should just test that it's going to power on again.

23:02.720 --> 23:06.600
Yeah, that's a good validation test right there.

23:06.600 --> 23:13.280
So links to that stuff, if you want to know more, if you got to manage some boxes in the show notes, nothing too unusual there.

23:13.280 --> 23:21.040
So why don't we do a bit of housekeeping? The cone of silence.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.560
All right, this is obviously stuff we don't want anybody to know.

23:23.560 --> 23:27.440
We're only telling you guys super secretly, we should probably whisper while we're doing this.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.840
I know. Well, we're in the corner silence. We don't need to. Oh, perfect. Let's yell.

23:30.840 --> 23:36.000
Yeah, that's why that's the way to go. That's why that's why the cone of silence is so great.

23:36.000 --> 23:42.160
So just a really quick mention, we are going to be at scale 17 X, March 7th through the 10th.

23:42.160 --> 23:49.200
And there's some great talks going on, including one that we're going to tell you about from one of our own team members here in a few minutes,

23:49.200 --> 23:54.880
as well as our buddy Stuart Langridge will be giving a talk called privacy could be the next big thing.

23:54.880 --> 24:01.840
And the whole bad voltage crew, at least some of them, if not all of them, will be doing a bad voltage live.

24:01.840 --> 24:07.200
And we have links to all of that stuff linked in the show notes if you want to go check that out.

24:07.200 --> 24:11.840
And I'll be there unless I think you're going to go to. Yes. Heck, yeah. Yeah.

24:11.840 --> 24:15.200
So come say hi to Wes and I will be down there.

24:15.200 --> 24:19.160
We'll talk more about what we're doing at scale when we bring on our new team member.

24:19.160 --> 24:22.360
But I'm pretty excited about that. So, yeah, check that out.

24:22.360 --> 24:25.560
And then also just a little public service announcement here.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.800
Two things to know about that are coming down the pipe.

24:28.800 --> 24:35.400
Number one is over the next. I don't know who knows what these things could be a month or more.

24:35.400 --> 24:41.680
We're going to start rolling out artwork updates for the shows like the album art.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.200
Not really going to impact anything else. It's just the look of the album art and stuff like that.

24:45.200 --> 24:49.480
And that's because we're part of a larger organization now and they have a design team.

24:49.480 --> 24:52.600
So we can go to them and say, hey, can you create us something really cool?

24:52.600 --> 24:54.240
And they're working on it right now.

24:54.240 --> 25:00.760
And, you know, we're going for something that's clean and easy to read and something bold and classy.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.760
Not over the top so far. That's kind of like the general direction.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.640
And it feels like a small thing and in some ways maybe it is.

25:06.640 --> 25:12.000
But I think also to us it's kind of a big thing because we put in a lot of hard work trying to make other aspects of the show.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.360
And for a long time this wasn't one that we had easy direct control over.

25:15.360 --> 25:18.000
So it's nice to be able to put some shine on it.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
Especially when you don't have a lot of extra capital to spend on hiring designers.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.880
So, and to get it right, it's got to be designed.

25:25.880 --> 25:30.560
And we're finally there as part of Linux Academy and it's exciting to have them work on that.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.400
So I just want to make you aware of it.

25:32.400 --> 25:38.400
That way you can prepare yourself because there is one universal truth about new logos.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.480
Nobody likes them.

25:40.480 --> 25:44.440
Nobody likes them. Nobody, nobody likes them. Nobody does.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.840
And then they grow on you and over time they just become normal and then you learn to love them.

25:47.840 --> 25:51.040
In some cases, I mean I shouldn't say nobody, in some cases of course they click with people.

25:51.040 --> 25:55.720
But it's very, it's very, very common for people to have a strong negative reaction.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.360
And so I wanted to prepare you for that.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.760
So when it does roll out, you're not shocked.

26:00.760 --> 26:09.360
And then last but not least, if you've got time next Tuesday, February 5th, after Linux Unplugged, almost immediately after Linux Unplugged,

26:09.360 --> 26:13.000
we're going to hold a study group with our virtual lug.

26:13.000 --> 26:21.120
We will stream the visuals on jblive.tv. People in the virtual lug in the mumble room can ask questions and participate with us.

26:21.120 --> 26:25.680
And I wanted you to know about it now. We're going to talk about it again here in just a moment.

26:25.680 --> 26:30.640
But I felt like it was important while we're in the housekeeping section to tell you about that.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.880
So that's what's going on in the near term.

26:32.880 --> 26:36.920
The scale coming up soon. Some friends that are giving talks will have links in the show notes.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.000
If you're going to scale, a couple of recommendations for you to check out.

26:40.000 --> 26:46.000
Our new artwork is coming down the pipe and the study group, February 5th, that will be streamed after Linux Unplugged.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.960
And maybe that's where we should start now.

26:47.960 --> 26:56.480
So let's talk about something pretty exciting that's going on that has been in the works for about a month now.

26:56.480 --> 27:01.840
And I haven't really been able to talk about it because I didn't I didn't even know.

27:01.840 --> 27:07.680
How the hell any of this was going to be possible because there's so much going on

27:07.680 --> 27:10.880
and I already have quite a bit that I'm responsible for.

27:10.880 --> 27:16.240
And it required it required somebody who knew how to dig through the company,

27:16.240 --> 27:21.160
ask the right people the right questions, get information that we needed,

27:21.160 --> 27:27.240
and then just take action and come up with ideas of of theming it and integrating it.

27:27.240 --> 27:32.640
And it was just all stuff that I just didn't have the mental CPU cycles for.

27:32.640 --> 27:36.880
But it's been something since I joined the company I've wanted to do.

27:36.880 --> 27:43.480
And that is release some of the Linux Academy content for free to the community.

27:43.480 --> 27:45.520
Stuff that's behind a paywall now.

27:45.520 --> 27:48.040
Take a look at some of that stuff and release it free.

27:48.040 --> 27:55.920
But I hadn't clicked with how I was going to actually physically pull that off until a new member joined our team.

27:55.920 --> 28:00.040
So I want to take a moment and introduce you to L. Marquez.

28:00.040 --> 28:05.840
I've been dropping hints for weeks because I'm really excited about a new team member who's joined the community department.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.360
That's what Jupiter Broadcasting is within Linux Academies.

28:08.360 --> 28:11.640
We are the community department and we do things for the community.

28:11.640 --> 28:18.080
And there's someone inside the company that I think if she had been hired after we had a community department,

28:18.080 --> 28:19.240
she would have come directly here.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.760
But she gave her a chance to do a bunch of other great things in the company,

28:22.760 --> 28:24.640
which I'll let her tell you about in just a moment.

28:24.640 --> 28:29.560
But I'm super excited to officially welcome L to the team.

28:29.560 --> 28:33.800
L Marquez, welcome to Linux Unplugged and welcome to Jupiter Broadcasting.

28:33.800 --> 28:34.560
Thanks so much.

28:34.560 --> 28:40.120
I'm excited to finally be something more than that other team member that you keep referring to in the last couple of weeks.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.880
I've been slipping it in. I have.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.320
You've actually been super busy, though.

28:45.320 --> 28:49.200
So it we were going to kick things off kind of at the beginning of the year,

28:49.200 --> 28:56.640
but we started a few other projects and you were wrapping up a course that's actually launching this week at Linux Academy,

28:56.640 --> 28:58.640
which is the Docker Quick Start, right?

28:58.640 --> 29:04.640
Yep. I don't know how it happened, but somehow I just got a little bit obsessed with the container world

29:04.640 --> 29:08.600
and was lucky enough to get involved with Docker specifically.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.200
So I got to do Terry's course.

29:11.200 --> 29:15.960
If anybody's done the Linux Academy courses before, Terry is one of the most famous course authors.

29:15.960 --> 29:19.760
And he gave me a chance to redo his Docker Quick Start course.

29:19.760 --> 29:27.520
But like I was saying, L is really perfect for this role because she travels more than I do, which that's really saying something.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.400
You're going to events all the time.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.520
What are the next couple of community events you're going to in just like the next few months?

29:33.520 --> 29:36.240
So I get to hang out with you guys at scale.

29:36.240 --> 29:42.680
And after that, I have talks out to both the OpenStack or now it's the Open Infrastructure Summit and DockerCon.

29:42.680 --> 29:45.120
So that's going to be a really hard choice.

29:45.120 --> 29:49.640
Yeah, so that's going to be pretty great because we're trying to up our game at events and stuff.

29:49.640 --> 29:55.760
L is pushing all of us to have like go and give talks at these events.

29:55.760 --> 30:03.400
So we're setting up a Jupyter Broadcasting Linux Fest Northwest track where like several of us now are including L.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.480
L is giving like three talks.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.440
I'm giving like one talk.

30:05.440 --> 30:06.560
Wes is giving a talk.

30:06.560 --> 30:10.480
Alan is going to give a ZFS talk, of course.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.400
And same at scale, like L, you're giving a talk at scale, too.

30:13.400 --> 30:19.160
Yeah, I get to talk at the Container Days portion of scale and teach people what containers are.

30:19.160 --> 30:23.920
Like not anything specific, just open source technology and container basics.

30:23.920 --> 30:31.560
So I want to talk a little bit about one of the things that you and I have been working on that's kept you busy before we've gotten on air together.

30:31.560 --> 30:39.120
And that is releasing new courses and some really great beginner courses for free at Linux Academy.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.840
Now, I want to back up here for a moment.

30:40.840 --> 30:41.920
This isn't a plug.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.320
Nobody's asked us to talk about this.

30:44.320 --> 30:49.000
L and I have this is something that we've just been working on that we wanted to share with you guys.

30:49.000 --> 31:01.120
And it's pretty exciting because we are now the community department inside Linux Academy are taking charge of releasing content for free on a regular basis.

31:01.120 --> 31:13.120
And we're refreshing some of the courses that will remain free and introducing some new ones, some courses that I am personally really excited about because I've taken them and I know they're really good.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.440
It's not an advertisement.

31:15.440 --> 31:21.840
It's just something that we've been working on that we think is a great opportunity for Linux Academy to give back to the community.

31:21.840 --> 31:32.040
So with all of that sort of preface, whatever preface, whatever it is I wanted to get out of the way, I want to tell you about what we're doing and what you can expect.

31:32.040 --> 31:37.160
We are adding a series of free cloud training and Linux Essentials training and many more.

31:37.160 --> 31:41.280
We'll tell you about them here in a moment to Linux Academy's free community edition.

31:41.280 --> 31:45.840
Each month, additionally, we'll be kicking out new content for the community.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.120
And this is all L's idea, but I love it.

31:48.120 --> 31:53.560
We are going to do a study group after Linux Unplugged.

31:53.560 --> 31:56.240
Initially, we're going to start with YAML Essentials.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.400
What happens if you're working on YAML and you've broken something?

31:58.400 --> 31:58.920
How do you fix it?

31:58.920 --> 31:59.720
That kind of stuff.

31:59.720 --> 32:04.480
We'll be bringing on the training architect who's volunteering their time.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.360
They're volunteering their time.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.280
They'll come on after Linux Unplugged.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.640
It's not part of the show.

32:08.640 --> 32:13.120
We're not at least currently planning to release it, but they'll join the Mumble Room

32:13.120 --> 32:16.680
and they'll hang out with our virtual lug and they'll teach a subject.

32:16.680 --> 32:20.760
We're going to start with YAML Essentials just because YAML powers like so many things.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.680
It's like the config language for so, so many things.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.040
And it's just getting more and more popular.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.040
And the data at Linux Academy shows us people like that course too.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.200
So we're starting with that one as our study group.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.120
But then after that, we're going to open it up for vote.

32:32.120 --> 32:38.000
We'll have a link in the show notes this week where you can vote on what you would like to have a study group on.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.360
And if we get enough votes, we'll do another study group and we'll connect with that training architect

32:42.360 --> 32:45.160
and ask them to come on and chat with us a bit.

32:45.160 --> 32:51.360
But Ellie, you came up with a really great formula of like different types of content for beginners

32:51.360 --> 32:53.640
and intermediary and experts that we're going to be releasing.

32:53.640 --> 32:57.800
Plus, we've got some of the stuff that's always going to be free.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.640
Why don't you talk a little bit about your formula that you came up with?

33:00.640 --> 33:06.040
So one of my ideas was, you know, the big message that I always have is that it's OK to be new,

33:06.040 --> 33:08.240
that it's OK to tackle new technologies.

33:08.240 --> 33:13.800
However, people see that as someone who is just new to the tech sector, perhaps new to Linux.

33:13.800 --> 33:19.000
But we can have somebody who's had, you know, like me, five years worth of Linux experience or even more,

33:19.000 --> 33:24.440
who has never tried AWS or who's never even attempted containers.

33:24.440 --> 33:27.240
So in that sense, they're new to that technology.

33:27.240 --> 33:33.120
And I thought that if we broached a bunch of different subjects, we talked about AWS, we had some Azure training,

33:33.120 --> 33:40.160
we had container and we had Linux fundamentals, we could reach a broader community than what we might be doing otherwise.

33:40.160 --> 33:44.560
Yeah, and some of this stuff is just great for people that want to have a basic understanding.

33:44.560 --> 33:48.360
They don't even need a full fledged membership yet, but they want to learn some essentials.

33:48.360 --> 33:54.160
Like getting started with Git is going to be one of the courses that comes out, an Ansible quick start guide.

33:54.160 --> 33:58.320
But I want to take a moment and Ellie, you just talked, you just touched on it here.

33:58.320 --> 34:06.840
The Linux operating system fundamentals that Kenny did is kind of special because it goes into the history of operating systems

34:06.840 --> 34:09.440
and it goes into the history of the Canoe user land.

34:09.440 --> 34:14.640
And you could even you could show it to somebody who doesn't know what an operating system is,

34:14.640 --> 34:16.920
like they're not familiar with the concept.

34:16.920 --> 34:21.680
And by the end of it, they'll understand Richard Stallman's contribution to Linux,

34:21.680 --> 34:25.000
will understand what the Linux kernel is versus the rest of the stack.

34:25.000 --> 34:31.080
And and the other the other Unix's and Unix eyes that existed before Linux was the dominant one.

34:31.080 --> 34:34.000
And it's like it's like an hour and a half course or something like that.

34:34.000 --> 34:41.000
I mean, it's just it's a gem for anybody who is self-taught like I was where I miss certain gaps.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.840
And this filled in a lot of things, even things I kind of know, but it was good to hear again.

34:45.840 --> 34:50.440
And it's going to be free. And this is the kind of stuff that we're going to be working on to keep like these kinds of courses

34:50.440 --> 34:53.520
we're going to be watching for and trying to release them to the community as much as we can.

34:53.520 --> 34:58.960
You know, one of the things that I really loved about that course being free is I have so many people that don't understand what I do,

34:58.960 --> 35:02.760
whether that be family members or people that I went to school with.

35:02.760 --> 35:06.080
So I think I'm just going to be sending them links and going, watch this.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.640
This is what Linux is. And that's what I do for a living.

35:08.640 --> 35:17.280
Yeah, right. The other one that's coming out for February is one that has been super popular and it just launched.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.720
And I'm really impressed that we got this in there because, you know, I mean,

35:20.720 --> 35:26.600
they just got done investing all of the time and money to build this whole course out and we're releasing it for free.

35:26.600 --> 35:32.800
And it's subnetting fundamentals. And I thought, OK, you know, it's kind of a dry topic, you know, learning network subnetting.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.240
But it's it's again, it's a pretty short course.

35:35.240 --> 35:40.640
And the early data and feedback from students has been like, this is super crazy, great, valuable.

35:40.640 --> 35:44.000
And so we looked at that and we thought, well, let's put that one out there, too.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.400
People, you know, you've got to deal with networking of all kinds of circumstances.

35:48.400 --> 35:54.680
If you're working with Linux and computers or trying to set up a home network, it's why not understand the basics?

35:54.680 --> 36:01.240
That's great. And then there's a couple other classics in there, like a Jenkins quick start, Vim, a Vim guide.

36:01.240 --> 36:04.600
If you want to learn Vim or LXD, there's a whole bunch.

36:04.600 --> 36:10.480
We we will have a blog post linked in the show notes that outlines all of the courses that are coming out because there's a bunch.

36:10.480 --> 36:14.000
I mean, I think it is. Is it 20 almost now?

36:14.000 --> 36:17.200
I think we've gone over 20. We just keep giving things away.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.600
And it's going to be our job now is we're going to watch this kind of stuff.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.160
And anyways, again, I know it sounds like an advertisement.

36:23.160 --> 36:27.200
It's not. This is just something that Elle and I are really passionate about.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.560
My story, I don't know, I want to ask you yours.

36:29.560 --> 36:36.480
I want to talk about that a little bit. But my story is I took a really meandering path to get where I'm at today.

36:36.480 --> 36:40.960
I started working at a school district in education.

36:40.960 --> 36:48.440
Doing I.T. and I liked that work because I felt like and I thought about it frequently, even when I was young, just out of high school.

36:48.440 --> 36:59.920
I thought about how when I fix a computer lab, like I enable classes full of students to learn and like I make a direct impact by by knowing computers.

36:59.920 --> 37:02.280
I can improve lives. And that felt really good.

37:02.280 --> 37:11.800
The problem was is that it was horrible pay and it was grinding bureaucracy and it was all the things that just drove all the other characteristics of my personality absolutely crazy.

37:11.800 --> 37:14.440
And I bailed and I went into the private sector.

37:14.440 --> 37:23.800
And then over time, I became a podcaster, but I still talked about Linux, like it was still Linux that I was in the schools or when it was in the private sector.

37:23.800 --> 37:28.480
Or when I became a podcaster, it was all about Linux and open source.

37:28.480 --> 37:36.360
But when I and in podcasting, I thought to myself, well, I'm kind of making a difference in people's lives by spreading the word and information about open source.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.520
Maybe maybe I'm getting people excited to try this stuff.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.120
Yeah, maybe that can change lives a little bit.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.520
And we've gotten emails that people say, yeah, you know, you got me excited in Linux and I got it.

37:44.520 --> 37:47.920
I got it as to a career, but it wasn't enough, really.

37:47.920 --> 37:57.240
Like it just wasn't quite that same direct connection that I had when I was working for a school district and I could fix a student's computer and that student was enabled to learn.

37:57.240 --> 38:09.960
And somehow now I've ended up back in this role here at Linux Academy, where I can do things like work with L to release content for free to people and make shows about these things that are free for people.

38:09.960 --> 38:16.640
Like it's all it's a whole new way to combine the two areas of interest that I've had my entire life, really.

38:16.640 --> 38:19.840
What about you? How does you seem super passionate about this, too?

38:19.840 --> 38:24.160
I'd like to know that story. So not to go too far down the rabbit hole with my origin story.

38:24.160 --> 38:31.240
But I think one of the reasons I started working at Linux Academy was the mission value or the goal that we change students lives.

38:31.240 --> 38:36.480
When I found out about Linux, I went through a program called Linux for Ladies.

38:36.480 --> 38:41.040
And at the time, I was in a place where I didn't have a job.

38:41.040 --> 38:48.600
I had a degree that I couldn't use and I was about to lose my home, leaving myself and my kids living out of our van.

38:48.600 --> 38:54.720
And through Linux and being able to become a Linux system administrator, I completely turned our lives around.

38:54.720 --> 39:00.880
And, you know, in that I was able to start mentoring other moms who were looking for career changes.

39:00.880 --> 39:04.400
And eventually it just became mentoring people as a whole.

39:04.400 --> 39:14.280
And so when I talk to my mentees and they start telling me how they went from making seven dollars an hour to now making six figures in one or two years, it's just astonishing.

39:14.280 --> 39:18.920
You know, you really can change not just someone's life, but a whole family's future.

39:18.920 --> 39:22.160
Yeah, that that is pretty powerful and pretty motivating.

39:22.160 --> 39:27.040
There we go. There is a we got deep here on the unplug program for a little bit.

39:27.040 --> 39:34.800
But I'm again, I'm just I'm really excited because not only are you and I going to work on this stuff, but you're going to be joining us on the shows from time to time.

39:34.800 --> 39:39.320
Because like like else, like I just said, she's got a background in this stuff and she's active.

39:39.320 --> 39:46.160
She's very active in the community, so she's going to join Joe and the gang on user air this week.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.840
And I think that's going to be on Friday.

39:47.840 --> 39:52.280
I think that comes out. So I don't know what you guys are going to talk about, but I always love user air.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.360
So that's going to be really good. You're going to be at events.

39:54.360 --> 39:57.080
A lot of you and I will be a lot of the same events, which will be cool.

39:57.080 --> 40:02.000
I have a travel buddy and you'll get to come hang out with L and I at Linux Fest Northwest or scale.

40:02.000 --> 40:08.880
But even more immediately, next week, February 5th, immediately following well immediately ish following Linux unplugged.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.800
We're going to hold a study group on YAML Essentials.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.400
We're going to kick off that first study group.

40:12.400 --> 40:15.960
They're going to get two L's for the price of one there at that at the study house.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.600
I get joined by L Prime.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.200
Yeah, the YAML Essentials course author, right?

40:20.200 --> 40:27.120
So, yeah, immediately following Linux unplugged both L's and hopefully myself, although I'm remote and Mr.

40:27.120 --> 40:32.040
Payne will be joining whoever from the virtual lug wants to join us next week.

40:32.040 --> 40:38.800
So come for the show or come after the show and you can just hang around and we'll have I think what we're going to do is we'll have a little classroom section.

40:38.800 --> 40:42.400
In the mumble, so just get mumble installed, get your audio set up and join us.

40:42.400 --> 40:48.480
You can hang out for Linux unplugged next week and stick around and learn YAML Essentials and then go over to the show notes for this week's episode.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.960
You can do it right now. You don't even have to wait for next week.

40:50.960 --> 40:54.520
Just go to this week's episode and go vote for what you'd like to see us do.

40:54.520 --> 41:00.480
Future study groups on Linux unplugged dot com slash two eight six for that.

41:00.480 --> 41:04.560
We have the link in there. I also just dropped it in the IRC chat room.

41:04.560 --> 41:09.000
And, you know, one thing we didn't talk about was how you are currently doing.

41:09.000 --> 41:14.720
I think you're still currently doing the elementary OS challenge that Jason Evangelo has been running.

41:14.720 --> 41:18.200
And I'm curious, how is that going for you so far?

41:18.200 --> 41:26.680
It's been an adventure. I think I maybe veered from the challenge because I did cheat and start using the command line.

41:26.680 --> 41:31.240
It's kind of my saying it's not Linux if I can't actually install things through the command line, right?

41:31.240 --> 41:38.760
Fair enough. I actually completely 100 percent agree. I mean, I'll all I'll do credit to App Center, which is fantastic.

41:38.760 --> 41:43.960
I just something about seeing the packages that I'm updating and whatnot on the command line.

41:43.960 --> 41:47.240
It makes me feel better about the whole about the whole process.

41:47.240 --> 41:54.880
So Jason has launched a new podcast with Joe Resington called Choose Linux.

41:54.880 --> 42:03.320
And I saw you and he were tweeting back and forth about the next challenge, which is going to be OpenSUSE.

42:03.320 --> 42:06.520
I know you've ran OpenSUSE plenty before. Are you going to take that challenge?

42:06.520 --> 42:09.440
So I'm still not convinced you didn't have a part in this.

42:09.440 --> 42:14.760
OpenSUSE was what I was running right before I moved over to elementary OS.

42:14.760 --> 42:19.120
And I took the challenge because I managed to kernel panic OpenSUSE twice.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.640
And that's twice within a one week period.

42:21.640 --> 42:28.640
Now, were you doing something I mean, were you doing something like with a virtual machine or crazy with the graphics?

42:28.640 --> 42:32.720
Like what causes OpenSUSE to the kernel? I haven't seen a kernel panic.

42:32.720 --> 42:36.520
I can't remember. I mean, it may have been many years now.

42:36.520 --> 42:44.000
So I actually wrote a blog post about it that I'm sure we can share where I took a picture of the screen because I'm still not convinced I did anything to cause it.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.440
But that's everyone who causes a kernel panic.

42:47.440 --> 42:52.600
I think I got just a little bit too curious with installing different package managers.

42:52.600 --> 42:56.280
And I think I may have you know what? I don't know.

42:56.280 --> 43:01.200
I think I may have installed packages that may be contradicted one another.

43:01.200 --> 43:04.520
But I guess I'll get to learn when I re-kicked OpenSUSE again in a few days.

43:04.520 --> 43:13.840
Well, there you go. You know, one thing I know sometimes that got me in the past was I just ate up a lot of disk space with all of the snapshots that happens when you install packages and stuff.

43:13.840 --> 43:18.520
Oh, that's a cheap shot right there. Taking some of their best features there.

43:18.520 --> 43:22.080
No, no. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying you got to plan for it.

43:22.080 --> 43:26.000
Like you got to go in making sure you got the space for it. That's all I'm saying.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.600
Yeah, prune in your old snapshots. Yeah, of course. That's true.

43:28.600 --> 43:33.400
Yeah. Well, I'm really looking forward to the three of us getting to hang out at scale.

43:33.400 --> 43:36.960
That's going to be a ton of fun. And then Elle's going to fly up here for Linux Fest Northwest.

43:36.960 --> 43:39.840
Up here. I say up here as if I'm in Washington.

43:39.840 --> 43:41.280
I mean, you're honorary. Yeah, it's fine.

43:41.280 --> 43:45.600
Yeah, that's where my heart is, Wes. That's where my heart is now that I got a fish tank in the studio.

43:45.600 --> 43:49.440
By the way, everybody, I got a fish tank in the studio. It's pretty great.

43:49.440 --> 43:53.480
It's a little boy. It's just a little tiny little fish tank, little little sucker, just a little one.

43:53.480 --> 43:58.200
But it's it's pretty cool because it's it sort of floats on a stand.

43:58.200 --> 44:01.160
And anyways, it looks neat, right? I mean, I'm not just tooting my own horn here.

44:01.160 --> 44:04.600
A mini ocean oasis. Yeah, it's got some nice lights in there, too.

44:04.600 --> 44:08.800
So just kind of a quiet, calm, collected focus point.

44:08.800 --> 44:13.040
I got to dress it up now, you know, because because I don't want Elle coming over and seeing the studio without a fish tank.

44:13.040 --> 44:16.360
That'd be embarrassing. So I had to dress it up a little bit.

44:16.360 --> 44:23.840
So I got a fish tank. I figured that would make up for the eight year old carpet and the horrible state of everything else.

44:23.840 --> 44:27.640
Elle, you're already making us set higher standards for ourselves here.

44:27.640 --> 44:30.880
So thank you. I'm classing up the joint. I like that. That's true.

44:30.880 --> 44:36.120
I mean, you kind of are, though, like we've always kind of known in the back of our minds that, you know,

44:36.120 --> 44:40.840
maybe we should be a little more active at these conferences we go to, like maybe we should give some talks.

44:40.840 --> 44:48.440
And I have been going to Linux Fest Northwest for, I think.

44:48.440 --> 44:56.240
I think 19, 19 years or so, maybe 20 years, I may have gone all 20 years, but I know I've definitely solidly in the 17 year.

44:56.240 --> 45:04.280
And the reason why I know that is because when I first started going, I went with my high school teacher who was Jim Bassett,

45:04.280 --> 45:10.520
just a great guy, great teacher and a great computer teacher and a software developer as well.

45:10.520 --> 45:15.640
And he was in the Linux and I was one of the kids at the school that was in the Linux.

45:15.640 --> 45:18.560
And so we were like, well, let's let's go to Linux Fest.

45:18.560 --> 45:21.840
And that's how I started when I was still in high school. I started going to Linux Fest.

45:21.840 --> 45:26.680
So it must have been it must have been towards the end of my my last few years high school,

45:26.680 --> 45:29.840
considering how long I've been out and this is their 20th anniversary.

45:29.840 --> 45:32.360
So it's going to be a hell of a party. So Elle's flying in.

45:32.360 --> 45:37.480
I am I am hoping and praying that Wimpy and Popey make it. Signs seem to be yes, Mr.

45:37.480 --> 45:40.600
Wimperis, it seems like things are trending in that direction.

45:40.600 --> 45:51.640
We're working on it. So Ubuntu became lanyard sponsors this week and somebody's got to mule the lanyards to Linux Fest Northwest.

45:51.640 --> 45:59.480
And we've Popey and I have both submitted talk and workshop proposals. So we'll see how that goes.

45:59.480 --> 46:02.840
You, by the way, are welcome if you want to.

46:02.840 --> 46:06.320
We're thinking about having a room and we have a track already.

46:06.320 --> 46:09.120
And if you want to be in our room, you're welcome.

46:09.120 --> 46:12.240
And you can just switch. You can put yourself on that track if you like.

46:12.240 --> 46:18.800
You don't have to. OK, but if you would like the luxury of the Jupiter broadcasting arrangements, you are welcome to.

46:18.800 --> 46:23.000
Is it big enough for all of the all of the crowds we're going to attract?

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
Well, I suppose they will determine the size of the room based on the amount of talks.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.280
I think I think it could be a good setup, too, because we will have enough people to man the booth from time to time.

46:32.280 --> 46:35.160
And they can be sending people over to the room to tell them where we're at.

46:35.160 --> 46:38.040
And the room can be sending people to the booth to get like swag and stuff.

46:38.040 --> 46:42.600
And I think we might we might keep some one or two exclusive swag items in the room, too.

46:42.600 --> 46:46.960
And then we'll just have a day a day, a day long of talks, basically, I think.

46:46.960 --> 46:50.840
I don't know. It's all still kind of for me, but that's sort of what we're thinking about going all out this year.

46:50.840 --> 46:54.880
And we wouldn't be doing any of that if it wasn't for L.

46:54.880 --> 47:01.080
I mean, we've wanted to do it. We might, you know, we might try to up our game a little bit just because it's it's a big year for us.

47:01.080 --> 47:09.960
But the but doing all of the talks and stuff, if it wasn't for L showing up, I'll submit three talks right now, which totally set the bar for everybody else.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.280
So thank you, L. That's been something we've needed to do for a long time.

47:13.280 --> 47:17.760
Now, I love it. And I mean, we're at a point now where I'm trying to get us to organize our own conferences.

47:17.760 --> 47:21.280
This is going to be great. Yeah, that could be. Yeah, we'll we'll talk more about that.

47:21.280 --> 47:25.680
And one last little plug for the study group. You just need mumble if you want to talk.

47:25.680 --> 47:31.080
But if you don't want to participate, if you just want to watch and learn, you just go to JBLive.TV.

47:31.080 --> 47:39.160
We will be streaming it. There will be a visual component on the JBLive TV stream, which will also be simulcasted on the other places that we stream.

47:39.160 --> 47:50.920
And you can join the Mumble Room, be part of the virtual lug, and you can ask questions to the L's directly about YAML, which is a very, very useful skill set to have these days.

47:50.920 --> 47:55.080
So check that out. And, L, welcome again. It's great to have you aboard.

47:55.080 --> 47:59.400
And thank you so much for all of your hard work so far on freeing that content.

47:59.400 --> 48:09.240
And don't forget, we have a blog post, too, linked in the show notes, linuxunplugged.com slash 286 that outlines the over 20 courses now that we've been able to free, including.

48:09.240 --> 48:17.960
Oh, man, I can't believe I almost didn't mention this, including that Linux Essentials course that I've talked about before that just teaches you the history of Linux.

48:17.960 --> 48:21.400
Go check that out. Go, go, go check that out. It's so good.

48:21.400 --> 48:26.320
And Kenny's an awesome dude, and I believe he's going to be at Linux Fest Northwest, too. Boom.

48:26.320 --> 48:29.080
So we're going to we're going to have a heck of a party.

48:29.080 --> 48:34.920
God, I'm just so excited about this. This is something I've been working on since I started here.

48:34.920 --> 48:42.160
And one of those things that isn't really about making a podcast isn't so it's not like something that is audience facing.

48:42.160 --> 48:49.200
So it's just one of those things that we tool away at that nobody really knows about until it's here. And so I had to have had to take a moment talk about it.

48:49.200 --> 48:58.160
And with that, before we go, it is way, way, way past time for us to do some pics.

48:58.160 --> 49:05.240
I've never installed GNU slash Linux. Yeah. Well, if you do install GNU slash Linux, you need to install some apps.

49:05.240 --> 49:08.880
You know, you want some stuff. You want some stuff on that Linux box.

49:08.880 --> 49:15.800
And in the spirit of Westpain fixing our jblive.fm stream, fixing it up real good, too.

49:15.800 --> 49:20.160
I'll say this real, real top, top grade work there, Mr. Westpain.

49:20.160 --> 49:24.120
Tell the folks now what's so about the auto transitions and the high quality streams.

49:24.120 --> 49:28.960
Just tell them a little bit. Oh, yeah. I mean, so before it was pretty slow when it did work.

49:28.960 --> 49:35.560
It was pulling off something that had already been restreamed several times, then transcoded, then sent over to an ice cast server.

49:35.560 --> 49:42.360
Now it's just a lot shittier. It's a lot faster. So it's got it's got push whenever anyone updates anything, whether we're streaming here on the studio,

49:42.360 --> 49:48.120
maybe we're doing a live show from a conference somewhere or Alan's doing one of those crazy BSD now streams.

49:48.120 --> 49:52.920
Doesn't matter. You can always find it or some reruns at jblive.fm.

49:52.920 --> 49:57.440
Yeah. And so that plays right into our first pic. It's called Shortwave.

49:57.440 --> 50:09.080
And it is a remake of a online radio stream player for the gnome desktop that is written in rust because got to rust all the things these days.

50:09.080 --> 50:12.320
And you need you need your streaming player to be rock solid.

50:12.320 --> 50:18.320
So you can pop jblive.fm in there. And yeah, they look at this.

50:18.320 --> 50:24.320
They talk about this is what I'm talking about here, like right here in their FAQ for shortwave.

50:24.320 --> 50:30.080
The question will shortwave be compatible with the Librem 5? Yes, exclamation mark.

50:30.080 --> 50:33.720
You see what I'm saying? Like it's everywhere. It really is a buzz, man.

50:33.720 --> 50:39.760
They have managed peak hype with that. I'm impressed. I don't think you could really expect more this day and age.

50:39.760 --> 50:46.520
And now now something that may have felt a little bit like a hole in Firefox's heart.

50:46.520 --> 50:52.200
The one thing that Chrome makes stupid easy. And if you've ever bought a Chromecast, you know what I'm about to say.

50:52.200 --> 50:58.560
It's sending things to your television from Chrome. And it is more times than I'd like you.

50:58.560 --> 51:04.600
Very, very useful. And it's one of the reasons I've kept Chrome installed on my machine.

51:04.600 --> 51:09.200
That was until one of us can remember now who might have been me.

51:09.200 --> 51:13.360
It was both of us. Was it that happens very frequently, you know?

51:13.360 --> 51:19.720
And that's good. We have good coverage. And every now and then, very frequently, Wes will find things that I didn't find and I'll find things he didn't find.

51:19.720 --> 51:24.360
And it's great. And this one is one that everybody should know about. It's called FX cast.

51:24.360 --> 51:29.240
It's Chromecast for Firefox. It enables Chromecast support.

51:29.240 --> 51:34.600
And you can cast things like Netflix or the BBC iPlayer, HTML5 video.

51:34.600 --> 51:39.960
There's just one little thing you got to know. It's it's it's like a two parter.

51:39.960 --> 51:46.080
It's an extension that connects to a software bridge that you have to install.

51:46.080 --> 51:50.200
Now, they do make an RPM and a deb available, and it's all open source.

51:50.200 --> 51:56.080
So you could probably build it. Oh, it's available for Macos, Macus.

51:56.080 --> 51:59.800
That's one of those proprietary operating systems. I'm not sure if you're familiar.

51:59.800 --> 52:03.400
And then, no, you cannot use it for Windows, which I don't know.

52:03.400 --> 52:07.080
You can't. How can you run anything on Windows that goes in your house?

52:07.080 --> 52:11.200
Yeah, OK. So they got it for Macos. Oh, geez, I did not mean to download that.

52:11.200 --> 52:15.080
And they got it for Linux as a deb and RPM. And this is just a thing of beauty.

52:15.080 --> 52:18.080
This is this has been a hole in my Firefox usage.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.920
One of the things that's kept me going to Chrome from time to time.

52:20.920 --> 52:26.000
And now it's here. And it's kind of nice. Did you have a chance to try it, Mr. West?

52:26.000 --> 52:32.960
Oh, yeah, I tried it right after I first saw it, because I'm in the same position as I don't Chrome's fine.

52:32.960 --> 52:38.360
I do use it for some things, but I love Firefox and I do and I use Firefox for most of my browsing.

52:38.360 --> 52:43.240
But I watch a lot of content on the Chromecast just because I mean, like everything interrupts with it these days.

52:43.240 --> 52:46.280
They've been around for so long. Most of my friends and family have Chromecast.

52:46.280 --> 52:50.960
So it's just kind of ubiquitous. Unfortunately, FX cast and you should know this.

52:50.960 --> 52:56.400
There's no public release yet. It's all just sort of pre-release beta version and is definitely a little buggy.

52:56.400 --> 53:00.480
So I've only got it to work a couple of times. It's not it's not quite reliable.

53:00.480 --> 53:09.320
It can find that their back end program, but the connections up to Firefox and getting it to work on on all the variety of sites that you might actually want to use it on.

53:09.320 --> 53:15.440
Not quite there. So your mileage may vary, but that doesn't surprise me at all that it's still very early.

53:15.440 --> 53:23.240
This is like their very first release. It's it's got a little while and there's probably some finessing to make that work pretty good.

53:23.240 --> 53:28.000
But they're they're doing they're doing good work over there and it's really nice to see it.

53:28.000 --> 53:34.600
Oh, yeah. And it's exciting. And, you know, as with so many of these projects, give it a little time to bake and soon you'll be relying on it.

53:34.600 --> 53:40.800
Yeah, that's exactly how it works. OK. And then, you know, we all we're here we here at the Linux Unplugged program.

53:40.800 --> 53:45.480
I'm just going to make this claim. We say it's OK to use the terminal.

53:45.480 --> 53:53.240
The terminal doesn't have to be scary, especially when you can make a little more user friendly with things like the fish shell or nano.

53:53.240 --> 53:56.840
Not Vim, but nano, which is the best text editor on Linux.

53:56.840 --> 54:00.120
I mean, I'm just going to go with that. Don't don't even argue.

54:00.120 --> 54:06.520
But what about what about what your face holes looking at? Wouldn't it be nice if you could make that a little more fun?

54:06.520 --> 54:11.720
We've talked about this app once before and they just had a great release after a nice long while for many months.

54:11.720 --> 54:21.000
Cool retro term one dot one dot one is out and it's combining two years of upstream Qt widget work.

54:21.000 --> 54:30.040
So like things that just make the terminal look nicer and resize nicer, big performance improvements, lower resource consumption.

54:30.040 --> 54:33.160
New shiny frame, literally a new shiny frame.

54:33.160 --> 54:42.360
And they now support your system fonts and they make it all look like you're using a old CRT old style terminal.

54:42.360 --> 54:45.640
You can you can actually there's all kinds of different looks you can play around with.

54:45.640 --> 54:50.160
And there is also an app image available if you just want to get started.

54:50.160 --> 54:54.920
And there is some Ubuntu packages in the works right now.

54:54.920 --> 54:58.880
I think we should be clear. You know, these are the effects are really pretty astounding.

54:58.880 --> 55:05.920
That's why I like it. I mean, I thought it would be a little too distracting to use for, you know, kind of all the time stuff or even just like regular work.

55:05.920 --> 55:10.080
But no, it's so pretty. They've gone to a lot of work to make it really shine.

55:10.080 --> 55:20.840
Yeah. And I maybe wouldn't use it for everything just because it's like you don't need something that's even eating, you know, a half of a percent more CPU usage than your terminal needs to be.

55:20.840 --> 55:23.000
That's not what the job of the terminal is.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.720
But like there is times where you just want your machine to look really bad ass and awesome.

55:27.720 --> 55:32.800
And, you know, you bring this up and then you put H top on there and I can confirm that looks bad ass and awesome.

55:32.800 --> 55:54.160
And there was there was times when I would swear I was looking at an old, old system that I used to have that would hook up to a monitor over coax and the image would look just like this retro term that did with a little bit of a little bit of that snow in the background, just a really light sort of wave that goes through it every now and then.

55:54.160 --> 55:58.600
I mean, it just nails it. It's like when you smell something and it brings you back or you hear a song.

55:58.600 --> 56:02.040
This was like one of those visual experiences for me. So I think it's a lot of fun.

56:02.040 --> 56:14.840
We'll have it linked in the show notes. And if you've got if you've got a really good app pick, tweet it at us or go to Reddit dot com slash r slash Linux unplugged and submit it there because we try to keep the app picks up.

56:14.840 --> 56:17.440
But we want we want high quality pics.

56:17.440 --> 56:24.880
You know, we're not just trying to do low budge pics. We want high quality pics. So we don't always have the pics unless it's something that's that's sort of noteworthy.

56:24.880 --> 56:33.640
We want, you know, well, only the good stuff. And speaking of the good stuff, go check out Choose Linux, the new show turned out really great.

56:33.640 --> 56:38.880
First episode is out. Choose Linux dot show and go listen to episode one.

56:38.880 --> 56:41.320
It started right at the beginning. It is pretty awesome.

56:41.320 --> 56:50.720
Jason Evangelo from Forbes switched to Linux about six months ago, and he's just going through that that that new experience, that rush you get.

56:50.720 --> 56:53.560
And he's extremely intelligent and he's very articulate.

56:53.560 --> 57:01.320
So it's a great experience and it's a great show because you have Jason who is going through this and it has that that that new love feel of everything.

57:01.320 --> 57:03.560
And you have Joe, who's been a Linux user for a decade.

57:03.560 --> 57:07.960
He's kind of been there seeing that and they really balance it out really well.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.520
It's a clean format.

57:09.520 --> 57:14.560
It's an easy listen and it's about 30 minutes and it's totally, totally worth checking out.

57:14.560 --> 57:17.680
Choose Linux dot show. Go give that a play.

57:17.680 --> 57:21.040
I think you're going to love it. We are. We are so excited.

57:21.040 --> 57:26.280
If that wasn't enough, we have recently introduced a new full time co-host with Wes.

57:26.280 --> 57:35.080
So Wes Payne does TechSnap. And Jim Salter, a writer from Ars Technica, has joined as Wes's co-host.

57:35.080 --> 57:39.880
They've just put out their first episode over at TechSnap dot systems and it's great.

57:39.880 --> 57:42.800
Like it's so and then it's just it's so good.

57:42.800 --> 57:47.960
That's why it's going to be a really great Linux fest, Wes, because it's like things are happening at a level they've never happened before.

57:47.960 --> 57:50.600
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's hard to keep up. It's just flying by.

57:50.600 --> 57:54.400
There's so much stuff getting made all the time. It's true. That's true.

57:54.400 --> 57:56.920
All right. Well, that will bring us to an end.

57:56.920 --> 58:01.200
The Ubuntu podcast is on season break. Will they come back?

58:01.200 --> 58:06.400
We don't know. But in the meantime, you can go check out their back catalog at Ubuntu podcast dot org.

58:06.400 --> 58:09.200
I have a little exclusive about the Ubuntu podcast.

58:09.200 --> 58:14.440
Oh, go on. There will be a short podcast released this Thursday.

58:14.440 --> 58:17.560
So what I should do is I should go subscribe.

58:17.560 --> 58:20.680
So that way when it's out, I have it immediately. That's what I should do.

58:20.680 --> 58:23.200
Yeah, it's an exciting announcement.

58:23.200 --> 58:30.760
So, yeah, everyone needs to subscribe to the Ubuntu podcast to hear the short episode, which is being published on Thursday.

58:30.760 --> 58:33.040
There you go. Very good.

58:33.040 --> 58:35.080
Hot tip. Hot tip right there for Mr.

58:35.080 --> 58:39.680
Martin Wimpress, one of three presenters on the Ubuntu podcast.

58:39.680 --> 58:48.960
And I will have links to El's social media profile information and the blog posts that cover the content that we're releasing now in February,

58:48.960 --> 58:55.320
as well as the study group voting sheet where you can vote on the next study group.

58:55.320 --> 58:57.360
These study groups are kind of a work in progress.

58:57.360 --> 59:06.840
If next Tuesday on the fifth, if that turns out to be well attended and well liked and we get a decent amount of votes on future study group topics,

59:06.840 --> 59:11.520
we'll start scheduling these maybe on a monthly or more basis.

59:11.520 --> 59:17.240
We're just going to kind of gauge what the audience interest is and then we'll we'll kind of build it out from there.

59:17.240 --> 59:25.800
So I'm pretty interested to see where this goes because we have a lot of source material to work with and it's really kind of nice because you could show up.

59:25.800 --> 59:32.920
I mean, I would love it if you showed up for Linux unplugged, just hung out with us in the mumble room or in the chat room and watch the stream and enjoy the show

59:32.920 --> 59:36.560
and hang around for the study group and learn some yaml basics.

59:36.560 --> 59:39.840
It's just I think so awesome. I think it's an awesome opportunity and I'd love to see more of it.

59:39.840 --> 59:43.800
So I hope you guys love it and I hope you can make it next Tuesday.

59:43.800 --> 59:51.000
You can go to Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar to get the start of the show times converted to your local time zone.

59:51.000 --> 59:58.680
If you want to ask questions in the IRC, we will have that going IRC dot Geek Shed dot net pound Jupiter broadcasting to get in that room.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.480
The live video stream will be at JBLive dot TV.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:06.720
And if you want to join the mumble room, just Google search Jupiter colony mumble.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.880
And there is a setup guide right there that you can follow to get in that mumble room.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.520
We'll do an audio check to make sure you're using push to talk.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.000
You have headphones and we can hear you. OK.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.960
And you pass those checks and you are in our virtual lug.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.160
Wherever you are in the world, you can be part of a lug.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.400
And we have literally people from all over the world in there.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.840
And you can be part of that. And now you can also learn with us, too.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.760
All right, Mr. Payne, I think that just about checks all the boxes for this week's episode.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.840
What do you say we get out of here? Are you ready to conclude?

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.400
We managed to do it. There was so much content and I didn't think we would.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.760
We've got Elle now. Maybe she can help us get out of here.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.760
Yeah. Why don't you say see you next Tuesday.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.800
All right, guys, I guess I'll see you next Tuesday.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.160
Boom. That's nice.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.520
Couldn't have done it better ourselves. Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.480
I mean, she might not be here. She can.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.440
She's welcome. But we will.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.840
In fact, I think I will be on the road back to Washington by the next episode.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.960
That's going to be pretty crazy. I'll be attempting to pull that off from the road.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.840
Although at this point, the RV is basically a mobile studio.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:12.200
So I should be able to manage that. It should be a successful broadcast.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:16.360
Tune in next week to find out how good his LTE signal might be.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:21.600
Yeah, if you can pull it off. Thank you very much for tuning this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:51.520
And like Elle just said, we'll see you next Tuesday.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:02:02.240
All right, I already know what title I like.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.160
I've already I've already iced by the title that I think I want to go with.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.640
Thank you, everybody. No way. No. Yeah.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.040
Yeah. You know which one it is, too.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.360
Elle, yeah, I was thinking I was thinking like I didn't mean to like say you had to be on the show,

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.320
but then I realized we are you are going to see them next Tuesday because it's the study group.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.920
So that's happening. Yeah. That's what I thought you were referring to.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.960
I was like, I'll be here. I'm slow. I'm slow to my own to my own my own schemes, I suppose.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:28.320
It takes me a little while. You get there eventually. Yeah.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.320
I mean, Wes can teach him YAML, I'm sure. Do you have any YAML skills?

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.160
I mean, how do you how do you avoid YAML? Like you said, you can't.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:39.040
Of course, everyone has YAML skills. It's like essential for creating snaps.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:43.520
Therefore, everyone knows YAML. You know, that was part of what played into the decision.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.760
I was like, you know, this is something that's happening more and more.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.200
Snaps are using YAML files. Yeah, let's do YAML essentials. Wise.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.480
I think really Wes probably has, you know, like one of the things that Wes doesn't really share much on air

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.800
because it doesn't really come up topically is that he's a pretty big math nerd.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.080
He's also quite a reader. Most I mean, you're would you say voracious is overstating it, Wes?

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:06.920
But you're a pretty consistent reader, too. Oh, yeah, of course. It's a big part of my life.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.520
Yeah. These things Wes never talks about and we never get a chance.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.520
That's why I need to have a show every now and then where we just talk about absolutely nothing and nobody would listen.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.360
But we would at least get it out there on the record.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:24.200
JB radio hour. Yeah. Mr. Wimpris, it's been a little while since we've got an update on the hardware situation.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.000
Any any new changes on the workstation front?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:35.600
I have hand built my own desktop workstation for the first time in 15 years over Christmas and New Year.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.760
What made you decide to hand build? Because I mean, as you know, tons of pre-built systems pretty solid these days.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:46.240
We going for something special? Well, you know, I've been doing the whole NUC thing, an external GPU thing.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:54.080
And I was curious. I wondered how much performance I was giving away by going with a small form factor.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.800
And there's lots of interesting technology around at the moment around the PC space.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:05.120
And I thought, you know, it's time I refresh my skills and build a PC from scratch.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.000
Yeah. And budget plays a part in this because, you know, I did look at pre-built systems.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.160
I was really taken by the Corsair one. But then when you go and look at what you can build yourself,

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:22.560
then it gets a whole lot cheaper really fast. So that's true. I decided to build it myself.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:29.200
So what did you build? Well, it's based around an i9 9900k CPU. Oh, all right.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.920
And I've gone with a gigabyte Designair motherboard,

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:39.680
which has a couple of interesting properties that I found appealing.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:47.840
Oh, yeah. Such as? The two NVMe slots on it, the M.2 slots are directly connected to lanes on the

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:54.960
CPU. They don't go through the PCH chipset. So they're super fast. Yeah, that's great.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:03.040
Yeah. So, yeah, all the storage is fast lined. And this particular motherboard has full blooded

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:08.800
Thunderbolt ports on it. So I don't have to give up on my external GPU dream,

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:13.520
which sounds a bit strange, you know, because I've got a desktop and I've got the GPU on the

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:23.120
board. But for the first time, I can do objective comparisons of the same GPU in the same computer on

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:29.360
the PCI Express bus internally and in an external enclosure and actually accurately measure

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:38.000
what the performance cost is. So I'm gonna I'm gonna have some fun, you know, playing with that.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.720
But yeah, I've water cooled this one and I've been doing a bit of overclocking for fun and lulls.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.280
Making us drool.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:54.640
You went the whole water cooling overclocking route and stability has been good. It must have

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.440
been a bit of finessing to get it right. Actually, I was dead surprised. I put it all together and

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.400
because of the build and, you know, water cooling and what have you, I kind of had to assemble the

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:10.640
whole thing and then turn it on and it worked first time. And turns out overclocking on Linux

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:18.720
is way, way easier than overclocking on Windows. So with not messing with the BIOS at all,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:27.920
you just switch the performance governor on and immediately you get five gigahertz all core turbo

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:34.960
with no messing about. So it was really easy to get loads of performance off the off the CPU.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.200
And I've been overclocking the GPU as well. So I've been playing around with overclocking

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:45.200
Nvidia GPUs on on Linux. That does sound like a good use of holiday time.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:52.080
Yes, lots of fun. Yeah, that's nice. So how much storage total did you end up in the system?

01:06:52.080 --> 01:07:00.640
I've got two and a half terabytes of NVMe. I've got a one terabyte, two and a half inch SSD

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:08.560
and six terabytes of spinning rust. And so did you take the GPU? Is that the main GPU from the

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.240
enclosure for the Thunderbolt, the Thunderbolt enclosure? And did you put that in the workstation

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:18.800
case for now or what are you doing? Okay. Yeah. So I took the 1080 TI out of one of the enclosures

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:26.240
and that's inside this chassis. The Vega 56 is still in one of the external enclosures so I can

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:34.880
still tinker with that. But I'm going to get a 2080 TI soon so I can do some testing with that.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.000
Well, I can't wait to hear how that goes. That's great.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.120
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I'm in full PC enthusiast mode at the moment. I'm having lots of fun tinkering

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:50.400
with stuff and even overclocking the memory and all that sort of thing, which doesn't get you all

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.840
that much gain, but it's fun to tinker with. Any stability issues or anything like that?

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:03.440
No, it's been rock solid. So I obviously run it without all of the performance tuning as my day

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:11.920
to day workstation, although I have got a permanent overclock. So the CPU will boost to 4.3 gigahertz

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:18.720
by default and I've changed that in the BIOS to go to 4.7. So that's a 4.7 default boost.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:28.000
And then I've just got a little toggle in my panel to turn on performance mode, which ramps up

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.480
the GPU and the CPU overclock. And that's enough to make a considerable difference.

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.520
I've managed to get my 1080 TI performing just shy of what a 2080 can do.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.080
Get it out of here.
