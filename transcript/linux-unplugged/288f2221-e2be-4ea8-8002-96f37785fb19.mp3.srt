1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hey, Popeye, do you have cupcakes ready? Are you celebrating the 10th birthday or the 11th birthday?

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,040
It's the 11th birthday of Ubuntu over at OMG Ubuntu. They have a picture of Ubuntu cupcakes up.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,400
They look pretty good.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,200
They say it's been 11 years and 22 releases of Ubuntu since Mark Sutter sat down

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,080
and typed the first ever Ubuntu announcement. Of course, in there

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,400
he says, an extraordinary breadth of Debian with a fast and easy install,

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,680
regular releases every six months, a tight selection of excellent packages installed by

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,080
default, and a commitment to security updates with 18 months of security and technical support

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,840
for every release. And the first version I think I ever tried was Ubuntu 4.10.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,280
And I remember very, very, very, very much embarrassingly one of the very,

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,160
very first big pieces of feedback we ever got on the Linux action show, one of my first nice

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,440
public screw ups was about Ubuntu. First of all, the name Ubuntu, Ubuntu. But the other one was,

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,480
and I just was a total brain fart, is we couldn't figure out what the versioning system meant. We're

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,440
like, 4.10? What is that about? And then like, we were looking at the, we just couldn't get it.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,720
We were too dumb. And then we had to get, we had to get a whole bunch of emails are like,

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,760
it's based on the date, October, 2010. We're like, oh, right.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,120
And that's really bizarre because the US are the king of making stupid date formats.

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,320
Yeah, that's like our thing.

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,320
I know, I know. I just, it totally escaped me. And I was like, I don't get it. I don't,

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,480
is it based on the Debian version? Like, I just couldn't, I just was not thinking dates

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,520
for some stupid reason.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,520
Also, there's all that brown.

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,040
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,160
Look back on those screenshots. There's a whole hell of a lot of brown.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,680
But you know, when this ship, this is when I started running Gnome as, this is when I switched

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
from my first time switching from KDE as a KDE user, because when I first started using Linux,

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,560
I came with Frontman Drake, which was a KDE desktop. And then I went to SUSE, which was a KDE

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,200
desktop. And so when I went to Ubuntu, it was also really going to Gnome 2 for the first time

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,160
and finding and discovering the likey Gnome 2, which then afterwards I went away from. But I

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,360
just thought that was kind of interesting too, is it's been a long time since I switched to Gnome

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,280
and then went back to KDE and I'm back on Gnome.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,600
I did the same. I was on Xfce on Debian. And then when I discovered Ubuntu, I just switched

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,160
to Gnome and I stayed on that until Unity came along.

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,480
Yeah, I think a big part of it was what Mark says there is the selection of apps.

35
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,520
Yep.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
It wasn't that uncommon back then when you installed like, you know, different. One of the

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,280
things that was nice about SUSE is it was a good collection, a selection of apps. One of the nice

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,800
things about Mandrake, again, a good selection of apps, but there were some distros you'd install

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,280
them and they'd have like two mail clients and three web browsers and all this stuff. And Ubuntu

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,880
was like one web browser, one mail client, one editor, one terminal application.

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,920
Made it very stored.

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,160
Distros today, though, that have multiple apps doing the same thing.

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,120
Hope you guys should bring back the brown.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,040
Yeah, do a retro edition. We'll spin for it.

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,960
There's a niche for some people who want an ISO image or a DVD image or, you know, a gigantic USB

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,840
stick image that has everything installed. There are certainly some people who want that. But I

48
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,920
think we, Mark, figured out early on that not everyone wanted that. People wanted it.

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,280
Someone else to make an opinionated decision to say, this is the best browser, this is the best

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,640
email client, this is the best text editor. Take those and then provide some way of installing

51
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,600
other ones if you want something different. It's not like it's mandated. It's not like Chrome OS,

52
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,840
where there is one browser and that is it. There's one browser on the ISO, but feel free to go and

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
change it to something else.

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:43,600
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 115, for October 20th, 2015.

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is broadcasting on Back to the Future Day Eve.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Man, that's heavy. My name is Chris, and I'm here to talk to you about the future of Linux Unplugged.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm here to talk to you about the future of Linux Unplugged.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is broadcasting on Back to the Future Day Eve.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,360
Man, that's heavy. My name is Chris, and I'm here to talk to you about the future of Linux Unplugged.

60
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,240
My name is Wes, and I'm here to talk to you about the future of Linux Unplugged.

61
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,720
Wes, Back to the Future Eve Day is legit, right?

62
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh yeah, 100% legit.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,600
Okay, thank you, yeah. Everybody knows that tomorrow's the big day, but we couldn't move

64
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,400
the show just for that.

65
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
A little, you know, it's a solemn day tomorrow, but today we can be a little excited.

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,600
It's a solemn day. Yeah, no, today, on Back to the Future Eve Day, we're really pumped up because

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,920
we're going to do something that is a lot of fun on this particular show. We're going to have a

68
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,280
little Lug session right here in the show for you. So think about this. If you were going to a Lug,

69
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,440
like a good Linux user, every now and then they would have talks on how to do something,

70
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,400
how to accomplish something under Linux. Well, today our Lug is meeting together to discuss

71
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,640
how to do great podcasting with the Kubuntu podcast. They're five episodes into their new

72
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,800
podcast. They've showed up here. They're going to get real wisdom advice from Poppy and Wimpy,

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,520
and then Wes and I are going to throw in a few things here and there.

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,400
You probably shouldn't listen, but...

75
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,440
Mostly about the way they look. That's mostly what we're going to focus on because

76
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
that's how we roll. The important stuff.

77
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,440
Later in the show today, we're going to give a lot of love to an open source project.

78
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,520
OpenStreetMaps is amazing, and some of the data they have is incredible,

79
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,840
and some of the projects being built on top of that data are astounding. All of those things

80
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,160
are true, and we're going to tell you why, point you at some tools to use that makes it even cooler,

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,760
and how you can make the data even more relevant. And I'm going to tell you about the new open

82
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,280
source project that is launching today, or actually I think this week, to really,

83
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,840
really challenge Google Maps, and Google Maps' routing and directions and that kind of stuff.

84
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,000
You know, the really nice stuff that you get from Google.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,200
And then at the end of the show, we got two boxes right here in studio.

86
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,160
Ooh, special boxes.

87
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,600
Very, very excited to say in studio with us today, we have the Steam Link and the Steam

88
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,360
Controller, both of which I have been keeping in the box, despite my little boy inside me that

89
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,560
wants to rip it open and play with it.

90
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,440
That is very impressive.

91
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,600
We're going to unbox the Steam Controller live on the show and see if we can hook it up

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,720
to my rig and play Race the Sun with it. Steam Controller, Steam Link,

93
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,320
happening up in this business right now. Very exciting. We'll be doing that.

94
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
You have to stick around just for that.

95
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,760
It's going to be a live demo fail on air, and those are always worth watching.

96
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,600
Yeah, 90% chance it just won't work.

97
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,360
Totally, because I've got a kernel that doesn't have support for it built in,

98
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,480
so we're doing it live. But before we get into that,

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,600
I want to do a little follow-up from this week's Linux Action Show.

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,280
It was a big show. It was over a two-hour show.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
Ridiculous.

102
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,280
And it was an oversized show, but we had to talk about replacing LastPass.

103
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,160
That LastPass and getting bought out by LogMeIn basically meant it was time to find something

104
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,080
to replace it. So we covered all these different solutions.

105
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,640
And one story that we covered, I think it was in the feedback segment of the show,

106
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,000
that I wanted to bring a little more attention to in this episode,

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,040
is an open-foss training Indiegogo campaign.

108
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,120
And it's pretty neat. And the guy that's working on it right now has joined us in the Mumble Room.

109
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,440
And one of the reasons I want to bring attention to this is because actually the money is going

110
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,240
to a good cause. So, Matthew, are you in the Mumble Room right now?

111
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,800
Yes, I am, Chris.

112
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,680
So tell us a little bit about why you launched an Indiegogo campaign

113
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,880
and where the money is going towards and sort of what the end goal is here.

114
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:24,000
Well, it all comes down to I want to try to improve documentation for the new user out there.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,200
I remember back in my early days and kind of running face-first into the RTFM brigade and

116
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,640
want to make it an easier time for people who are new than what I had when I first came in.

117
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:43,200
And the money is going towards building the production system I need to improve the videos

118
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:53,600
I'm producing now. And kind of the big reason I'm doing the Indiegogo is a lot of people who

119
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:00,560
know me through social media and the Linux ecosystem know that I've been fighting cancer

120
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:08,240
for the last year and a half, two years. And so it's just my personal funds are really tight to

121
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,040
be able to afford to pay for that. So the title is Open FOSS Training,

122
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:21,840
and it's on Indiegogo, open-foss-training, and 33 days left. And $1,000 has been raised,

123
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,800
44% funding. And I love the idea of targeting new users for this specifically kind of thing,

124
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,920
and the money sounds like it's going to a good spot. So I will have a link in the show notes

125
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,240
if you guys want to check it out. Yeah, definitely check it out.

126
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,520
It's a good cause. We could definitely use more high-quality training like this.

127
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,040
Yeah, absolutely. So good luck, sir. And thank you for letting us know about it.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,600
And stick around too, because if you're going to be doing production, today's episode is going to

129
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,680
give you some great tips and tricks for doing that production under Linux. We're going to have an

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,040
interesting discussion around that. And it's something that you guys know we have struggled with

131
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,120
over the years, and we've done it in different approaches. We've done production under Linux,

132
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,680
where we've gone on location and done production under Linux. We've done it where we'll work

133
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,640
offline and do something that's post-edited and put together and produced under Linux.

134
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,840
And each time, there is lessons we've learned, little tools that we've picked up along the way,

135
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,240
and little things that now looking back at it, we realize, oh, we had to at least try it this way to

136
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,360
see what worked or didn't work. And so when the guys from the Kubuntu podcast came along and they

137
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,320
said, look, we're five episodes in, and we want to get your tips and tricks on how to produce it

138
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,880
even better using free software, but also just some other production elements and things like that.

139
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,680
And I thought the reason why this might be an interesting topic that's more applicable

140
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,160
to everybody is because there is a certain set of categories of software and functionality

141
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200
that Linux gets a really bad rap for.

142
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,760
Yeah, it does.

143
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,600
And this is definitely one of them. And the truth of the matter is I actually think the state of

144
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,320
things is better than most people think. I think over the last few years, the tools out there,

145
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,160
some of which are not free software, but work under Linux, and some of which that are free

146
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,720
software and work under Linux, have gotten a lot better. And I think so much so that if you knew

147
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,000
how close they were, you might consider trying to do things differently. I'm seeing a lot of podcasts

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,360
that are launching right now, especially ones that try to produce under Linux that are using tools

149
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,800
that in my estimation are easy to use under Linux, but they do not provide a very good listening

150
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,240
experience for the user, for the listener. Might work at first, but it's not something

151
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,800
you want to invest in for the long haul. Yeah. And I think it's just because people

152
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,960
are not aware of how good the state of some of these tools are and what some of the options are.

153
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,200
So I want to talk about that a little bit today. And then I'm hoping that those of you who are

154
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
maybe not interested in actually producing your own podcast or something like that,

155
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,720
will walk away from the conversation, walk away from the discussion with a pretty good idea of

156
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,400
the state of this for your favorite platform, because this is a pretty good measuring stick on

157
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,720
how your platform is doing. And I'm hoping that you'll walk away with a bit of an idea

158
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,120
of what that's like. So that's sort of my goal today when we're talking with the Ubuntu UK podcast

159
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,600
guys and our Ubuntu Kubuntu podcast. Geez, now I'm all getting all mixed up. Wes, that's what happens

160
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,960
because there's so many different podcasts these days. But some of them are all making the same

161
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,880
mistake. Some of them aren't. I don't know. I don't know, Wes. It's not that we're experts on

162
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,880
the topic, but people ask. Stay tuned. So we'll share. Chris has opinions, everyone. Turns out.

163
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,680
And I just think like if this was a real lug, if we were really, if we were really like...

164
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,360
We are a real lug. I know. There you go. Thank you. Come on. I don't need this attitude. Thank you,

165
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,240
sir. Because, OK, what I meant to say is if we were meeting in a place like a building and we

166
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,120
were doing like on a Tuesday night once a month, this would come up. This would be something. Also,

167
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,560
there's other things like workflow things we could talk about. So I think this is an interesting

168
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,320
idea. The more practical side. Bring something into the lug and we'll talk about it. We could

169
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,960
do this every now and then. That's a great idea. Now we have our lug sessions on Tuesdays,

170
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,320
every single Tuesday, but maybe once a month we could do something like this. Yeah. It's

171
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,760
a possibility. It's an idea to play with. I'm just putting it out there. I'm an idea guy.

172
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,680
All right. Let me tell you about another idea. DigitalOcean. Go over to digitalocean.com and use

173
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,320
our promo code DOUNPLUGGED to get a $10 credit. DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider

174
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,320
dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up an awesome Linux rig. And

175
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,200
Wes, I don't care if they have FreeBSD. I don't want you looking at it. That's hard to stop.

176
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,640
Listen, here's what I did. I went over to DigitalOcean. I deployed in like less than 55 seconds

177
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,360
an Ubuntu droplet, a run and sync thing for me. I've got a run and sync thing and a couple other

178
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,320
things that are doing my password management. I'm not telling you about these other things,

179
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,680
Wes. I'm going to say it's GPG and stuff like that, but you knock it off. Stop pressing me

180
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,840
for information. Chris, what kind of connectivity do you have on there? Oh my God, it's so fast.

181
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,360
I'm glad you asked. That's just the great kind of question there, Wes, because I'll tell you what,

182
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,200
I put it in San Francisco, but they got data centers in New York, Singapore, Amsterdam,

183
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,040
London, Toronto. Yeah, I got 512 megabytes of RAM. It's a brand new one in Toronto, 20 gigabyte SSD,

184
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,640
one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer. A terabyte of transfer. And I tell you what, I tell you what,

185
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,880
I have never hit test ceiling. I tried to use it. It's hard to hit. Yeah, and they got a great

186
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
interface too. It makes it really easy to manage all of this, but yet extremely powerful and a

187
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,160
straightforward API. Check them out. And when you just need to go roll your own solution for

188
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,320
something, testing, hosting, production, use back-end infrastructure, digitalocean.com,

189
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,800
use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, and then you go deploy yourself a Linux rig up in the cloud.

190
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,760
It's crazy fast. I love it. digitalocean.com, DOUNPLUGGED, support this show and get yourself

191
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,080
a $10 credit. Okay, so to reset, here's how it went down. We got an email that came into the

192
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,240
show. It says, hello, I'm one of the hosts of the Kabuntu podcast, big fan of your shows.

193
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,840
Currently, we publish our shows only on YouTube, and it links us to that. We'll check that out in

194
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,120
a second. It says, and sometimes audio only using Google Drive. Since we're big fans of

195
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,280
Jupyter broadcasting, we look to you guys as mentors on how to organize our podcasts. However,

196
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,200
there are many things we don't know or unsure how to do better. Currently, we use Google Hangouts

197
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,280
to record our podcasts, but we're looking into OBS. Could you give us some feedback and tell us

198
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,040
how to organize your, how you organize your podcast? Maybe a video call to discuss things

199
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,120
in more detail. And so we talked about it, obviously off air, and we're like, yeah, we could

200
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,920
do a video call with these guys, or we could do this in the show and just sort of share the

201
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,000
information with everybody. And that seemed like maybe a better way to go because there's probably

202
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,200
a lot of other people that'd be interested in this. And like I said earlier, it's sort of a

203
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,360
state of affairs of where Linux is at. So it's the Kabuntu podcast, and I'll pull up just a couple

204
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:24,880
of seconds of episode five. Glad you can join us. My name is Rick Timmis. I'm Ovidio Florin.

205
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,680
Aaron Honeycutt.

206
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,160
And Aaron is joining us as well. Aaron Honeycutt. Okay, so I'm just grabbing that cup of coffee

207
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,440
there and having a quick look at the show notes. So we've got a few things coming up for you. We've

208
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,520
got a special guest coming up on the show a little bit later, so do stay with us.

209
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,080
And they had a guest on which you said was from the Kabuntu project, correct? Or was that right?

210
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,440
I believe it was a KDE dev.

211
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,680
Oh, KDE dev. That's right. Yes. So it's an interesting idea. And it's obviously an area

212
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,840
that could definitely have its own podcast when you're a KDE fan. That's really cool.

213
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,320
So we have two gentlemen on from the show. Guys, welcome to Linux Unplugged. It's good

214
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,960
to have you here.

215
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,480
Thank you.

216
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,520
Absolutely, absolutely. And what are your names?

217
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,640
I'm Ovidio, but my full first name is Ovidio Florin.

218
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,880
And we have also...

219
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,520
I'm Aaron.

220
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,080
Hello, Aaron.

221
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,640
Greetings.

222
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,480
So, guys, a couple of things. First of all, thanks for emailing in and reaching out. And

223
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,000
it's cool that you guys are starting a new show. And so both Wes and I checked you out

224
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
before you came on today. And I know some of your general questions were around actual

225
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,160
organizing the podcast itself. And I wanted to start there, but I also want to start talking

226
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,400
about some of the software and tools you guys use. And anybody's welcome to jump in from

227
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,720
the Mumble Room and go along. But I'll jump in. I want to say, you know, congrats for

228
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,160
just getting off the ground and doing it.

229
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Yeah, definitely. That's the hardest step right there.

230
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,440
It really is. And the fact that you did it five times in a row is exceptionally harder

231
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,400
than you'd think it would be to get several people together at the same time five times

232
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,640
in a row. So congrats on that. You probably got from my intro that I teased earlier. I'm

233
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:16,560
not a huge fan of podcasts that are using Google Hangouts. And some of my favorite podcasters,

234
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:24,480
unfortunately, and they make plenty of money, use Google Hangouts. I just happen to think

235
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,640
it sounds horrible. And so I'm just going to start right there. Actually, here's the

236
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,600
bigger picture that I wanted to bring to you guys. So you're thinking about where to organize

237
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,320
the podcast. One of the first things that came up when we started talking about your

238
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,680
podcast in the pre-show with the guys in the Mumble Room, where do I find an MP3 for download?

239
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,580
And so your show here is an hour and five minutes long. And so the number one question

240
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:51,080
I would ask you is who is the target audience? Is it people on YouTube or is it actually

241
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,320
people that maybe would be commuting that are more likely to listen to longer form content?

242
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,400
The answer is probably somewhere in between. There's some on YouTube, but there's probably

243
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,360
a lot more for a show that's an hour long that are probably more likely to listen. So

244
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,120
in my estimation, there is a bit of a mismatch because the people that are likely to consume

245
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,600
your type of content are more likely not to be staring at the screen for that long.

246
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
They're probably working on something else. They need background.

247
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,200
Yeah. For example, like Wes wanted to listen on his drive up here today. And how did you

248
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
pull that off?

249
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,320
Well, since you guys have it on YouTube, I was able to use YouTube DL, download it and

250
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:32,160
extract the MP3. But I'm in the whatever 2% of people who know how to do that. And I enjoyed

251
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
listening to it.

252
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,480
And how did you get it on your phone?

253
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,840
And then I, well, I use Netcat, but that's another story.

254
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
There you go.

255
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,720
Right, right. But if there's an easy download link, then that could go a long way for discoverability.

256
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,400
So there's a couple of things that jump out at me. I don't think the Google Hangouts audio

257
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,920
quality is very good. I think it's worse than Skype and worse than Mumble.

258
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,280
I think it's also seemingly exceptionally bad with connection problems. Other platforms

259
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
seem to do a little bit better with spotty connections.

260
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,440
Yeah, for sure. So just from that very beginning standpoint, that would be sort of the first

261
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,400
thing that jumps out at me. Now, if your audience is YouTube, then I would say stick with it

262
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,400
and just keep refining it a bit.

263
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,480
And then the other thing is, is there's other solutions that maybe would have less latency

264
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,320
too, depending on your connections. So that would be sort of my first impressions. And

265
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,680
then the second impression walking away from that would be, if possible, and this might

266
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,280
take maybe another dozen episodes or so where it's worth the investment, if possible, it

267
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,000
would also be really nice if everybody had the same microphone as I smack Wes's microphone,

268
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,800
which is identical to my microphone, but I just smacked it. Because one of the things

269
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,920
that's damaged now, one of the things that jumps out at me is there's quite a bit of

270
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,200
difference in the different persons presented.

271
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,160
This is the Kubuntu podcast. Glad you can join us. My name is Rick Timmis.

272
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm Ovidiu Florin.

273
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,560
Aaron Honeyfoot.

274
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,860
And Aaron is joining us as well. Aaron.

275
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,320
So it's not bad, but there is a noticeable difference between the mics. So that was,

276
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,740
so I guess my question to you would be consider that and you don't have to answer me right

277
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:12,080
now, but it's just something to think about is if you want people maybe listening on the

278
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,640
road more or people on YouTube and then target it towards that.

279
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,920
There's also the problem of the environment. For example, right there, I was in Berlin

280
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,800
with the KD sprint, so my feedback was way off.

281
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,000
You could tell that you were in a larger echo-y room.

282
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah.

283
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,400
Rick has his home studio. I also have some kind of setup at home, but still we need to

284
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,800
work on that and improve it.

285
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,040
Yeah, that's kind of stuff that you just work out over time. You know, you guys will refine

286
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,760
that over time. That's pretty normal when you start out figuring out what sounds good

287
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,080
and what works good. And you know, you get surprised about what it'll throw off a webcam

288
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,120
or throw off a mic. But the reason why I brought it up now is because you're early enough in,

289
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,800
you could decide to double down on the audio quality or you could decide to double down

290
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,880
on the video production, but you kind of have a couple, you're kind of at a fork in the

291
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,280
road. So it'd be a good time to think about how you consume podcasts and how the target

292
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,960
audience that you, how they might consume podcasts, and then deliver it to them that

293
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
way.

294
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,640
I mean, this is one thing to consider is putting out as an RSS download so that way it's easy

295
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,360
to throw in a podcast catcher.

296
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,680
Well, basically we just need the video mostly just for some screen sharing so we can do

297
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,200
some presentations. Hey, this is how the app works. This is how it looks or some kind of

298
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,480
what's new and all that. But to show ourselves, that's not really very important.

299
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I tend to agree. That's usually my approach as well. Just in how I

300
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,320
implement it tends to be a little bit different. So guys, that was sort of my opening impressions

301
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,080
and stuff like that. But if you have any specific questions, feel free to throw them out there.

302
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,480
I can jump in with some other things, but I'm sure there must be some things that are

303
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
kicking around in your minds.

304
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
Microphone choice to begin with.

305
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,560
That's always a really hard question. So the microphone thing is really going to depend

306
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,680
on how much money you can spend. But you know, what I would say is get something in USB and

307
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,880
there are some pretty good ones out there. We did about a month ago a Linux action show

308
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,360
where we linked to a bunch of stuff. I like the USB stuff. I don't like coming in over

309
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,080
the sound interface. And there's better mics than the RODE Podcaster out there, but the

310
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,080
RODE Podcaster is a pretty good one for vocals.

311
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
One that works on Linux.

312
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,560
Yeah, that works on Linux. Yeah. But we also linked to like some Audio Technica.

313
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,320
I bought that Audio Technica one that you linked to. Linux support is flawless. It just shows

314
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
up as a new sound device.

315
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,680
Yes, and that's absolutely a good one. Or you can go all the way in and get an XLR mic

316
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,720
that comes in through a USB audio interface. The mic question is kind of tough too because

317
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:55,560
it kind of depends on your voice a bit. So I would just say my floor would be no headsets,

318
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,360
no headphones that are like the mic for your phone. No, what do you call those? Just like

319
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,160
you know, the ones that are built in.

320
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,240
Those are terrible. Worse than webcam.

321
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,840
Right. And no webcam audio. Yeah. So no headsets, no webcam audio, and you know, the cell phone

322
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,800
things. Yeah, there you go. Rekai links to it. It was Linux Media Production. It was

323
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:20,160
Linux Action Show Episode 355. And we linked to the pre-Sonos hardware. I also linked to

324
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,480
the microphone that I do use. Because I'd like to tell you, I mean the audio, so it's

325
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,480
the Audio Technica, but I'd like to say, you know, get a much nicer microphone. But you

326
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,960
just get whatever you can afford to get.

327
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,760
Maybe put a link to that show, that episode in the show notes, to this one.

328
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,880
You will find it in the show notes, sir. You will. Yeah. And there's other people in there

329
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,600
recommending. Now, Popi and Wimpy, you guys jump out. Do you guys have specific microphones

330
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,320
that you use on your shows that you're big advocates of? Or where do you fall down there?

331
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,440
Well, I know you hate my microphone.

332
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,520
No, I like your mic. No, I like yours. You have the snowball and you're the one person

333
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
who thinks it sounds good.

334
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
Oh, the snowball. Nice.

335
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,880
He's the one person I think sounds all right. I don't know. Must just be, I think it's his

336
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,000
lovely voice. I think that's what it is.

337
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,080
Oh, thank you so much. So I, you know, when we started the Ubuntu podcast, eight years

338
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,480
ago or so, we thought long and hard about what hardware to buy and what to do. And we

339
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,200
were all sat in the same room. So it was very different, you know, because we all drove

340
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:26,800
to one location. Now that we're doing it online, and we're using things like mumble or Skype,

341
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,440
and you know, recording locally and editing and all that kind of stuff is quite a burden.

342
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:39,680
So you know, while I agree with Chris that it would be preferable to use better tools

343
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:48,840
and to create audio that that you can put on a stream or on a an RSS feed like a traditional

344
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,280
podcast so other people can get it very easily and download it and consume it in the way

345
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,680
they want to rather than having to watch a YouTube video, right? That that puts a burden

346
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:06,480
on you. And you you have to commit to a certain amount of time each week or every other week

347
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,640
or every month or however often your release schedule is to actually record it, edit it,

348
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,840
fix the audio and publish it. And that's quite commitment.

349
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,800
It really is. And so you're saying anything you can do to make it easier if it's Google

350
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,000
Hangouts is okay?

351
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,940
Well, I'm not necessarily I I would do whatever you can to make it easier. But don't compromise

352
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,320
on the quality. I mean, you can compromise on the quality to some degree. And you can

353
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,800
apologize to your listeners because we've done this when you screw up the audio every

354
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:47,840
week we do. Yep. But but you know, it's worth making some effort because you know, there

355
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,120
are some podcasts that I've watched and listened to where I can't even get more than 60 seconds

356
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,600
in and I just think screw this. This is terrible. I'm not wasting my time with this. Not because

357
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,960
the content is terrible, but because the audio is now I sound like a massive jerk or I sound

358
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:12,520
like an audiophile. I'm not that guy who has a vinyl record player on yeah, it's not that

359
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,420
guy. No, but it's just you know, when when you don't take enough care to make it even

360
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,000
listenable. It's awful for your listeners.

361
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,520
So the thing I think the thing that you said in there that's buried that if I was a new

362
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,860
podcaster that I might not have pulled out is you can get away with so much if you're

363
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:34,480
locally recording everybody's audio, because then if you had to you could do the intermediary

364
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,900
call could be a phone call. And you could you know, if they're if they're off in some

365
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,840
weird place, as long as they're recording local rich mic audio, and then some some poor

366
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,040
schmuck has to edit it all together. I love you him. It has to edit it all together on

367
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,280
the back end. That is it is nice because it doesn't matter if Hangouts sounds like a robot.

368
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,180
It doesn't matter if Skype drops you doesn't matter if mumble got weird, because you're

369
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,720
recording locally. And in the end, it all comes together sounding very nicely. And that

370
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,880
is a very nice way to come across. Now that is that is more like you know, you're going

371
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,000
for your audio listeners, you're going for people that are listening with headphones,

372
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,600
they're listening in their car with nice speakers, or their computer with nice speakers. And

373
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,880
so you know, your target audience is a little more refined. I don't know if that is as important

374
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,040
when you're when you're targeting video, but wimpy you what was it six months ago upgraded

375
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,800
your microphone kind of re looked into your audio setup. Have you kind of walked away

376
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,320
with any thoughts after it's been a little while you've been using the setup for a bit?

377
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:35,160
Yeah, yeah. So around the start of the year, I changed my setup. And I've changed it twice

378
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,520
since actually. So Popey invited me on to the open to podcast to stand in for a couple

379
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,600
of episodes. And I thought I better make an effort and you know, put my best foot forward.

380
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,680
So I went and got all my old junk out of the lot and lashed it together with bits of string.

381
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:57,340
That's your best one! Well those two things don't align!

382
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:02,680
So that's what I was using was basically a load of gear that I had from when I was a

383
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,060
musician years and years ago, that I kind of made work. But the problem with that was

384
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:13,240
is that each time I recorded, I had to keep messing about with the levels and the settings

385
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:21,680
before I went on because it was so old and busted that it was a real faff. So about two

386
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:28,540
months ago, I got myself a Blue Yeti mic, which like he was saying is just a simple

387
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:35,320
USB connection. All the knobs and the levels actually on the mic itself. So I don't mess

388
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,120
about with the mixer on the PC. You just you know, you just turn up every week and you

389
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,680
know, it's going to sound like the week it did before. So that's what I'm using now.

390
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,680
And that has an added advantage in that we're all off to Ogg camp at the end of the month

391
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,040
and we're actually going to record a couple of shows whilst we're away together. And I'm

392
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,280
going to take the Blue Yeti with me and you know, because it's got multiple recording

393
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,480
modes, can actually use it as a traveling mic.

394
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,920
You can adjust I guess like the recording capsule there so it can do direct capture

395
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,720
or it can go into room mode or it can do like a figure eight or whatever.

396
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Yeah, that's fancy.

397
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,720
Yeah, that does make it nice for group interviews and whatnot.

398
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,920
So they're slightly more expensive. But if you, you know, use camel camel camel to watch

399
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:26,840
them on Amazon, they drop down to sort of the sort of 80-85 pound mark every so often.

400
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,120
So they're kind of a bargain when they get down to that price.

401
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,840
Yeah, I think actually, though, the truth of the matter is, is you can kind of get it

402
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,120
just right. But then, I mean, once you get it set, it's pretty much ran for you, right?

403
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

404
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:46,360
Yeah. Yeah, that is, that's the nice thing. There's a little bit of troubleshooting upfront.

405
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,760
And the only other thing I would say is that I only listen to podcasts that I can subscribe

406
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,280
to with a podcatcher. So I might watch the odd thing on YouTube, but I don't regularly

407
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,040
watch the stuff that I subscribe to on YouTube because it doesn't have that same, like if

408
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,120
I'm cooking in the evening, I might have a podcast going, and then I pause it whilst

409
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,880
I do something else outside or, you know, do something with the family, come back and

410
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,280
start it again. And it's that, you know, stop start nature. And that doesn't work so well.

411
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Yes, yes.

412
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
You know, with YouTube.

413
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,800
I'm the same way while I drive. I'll listen. And when I when I get there, I got with them

414
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,320
with my new vehicle, too. It's I finally have I've reached the new age where it actually

415
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
uses Bluetooth audio.

416
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Don't you love that?

417
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,560
Oh, my gosh, it's so great.

418
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,520
Your phone stays in your pocket. You just hit the button really makes it brings my podcast

419
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,000
listening up to an entirely new level because it is just as approachable as the radio. I

420
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,740
turn on the vehicle and the podcast resumes. Exactly. And then and the other nice thing

421
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,000
is it doesn't stop playing until I open the door so I can park the vehicle, turn it off

422
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,260
and I can listen for a few minutes while they complete their thought. And then I open the

423
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,840
door and it pauses. And I just love that. And so for me, it has made and the other thing

424
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:05,760
I do is I listen at bedtime. I sometimes listen to podcasts at bedtime. So I have I have podcasts

425
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,400
that I listen to that make me sleepy. Yep. That I have good information, but they make

426
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,360
me sleep. And I believe Popeye listens to one of them, too. It's it's the it's the talk

427
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,100
show and I'll sometimes listen to it literally to just to fall asleep. It's it's brilliant

428
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,100
for that.

429
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,160
Great. This is very distracting. You don't worry about all the problems in the morning.

430
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,000
He just kind of drones on in his Gruber kind of way. And I don't really quite care what

431
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,480
he's talking about. So it's perfect to fall asleep to. And then I have other shows that

432
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,220
keep me awake and amped up and listening while I'm driving. And so for me, I have the same

433
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,160
threshold that Wimpy does is it's got to have an RSS feed because I got to be able to subscribe

434
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,600
to it on my phone because this is pretty much I'm listening to shows now. I will watch the

435
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,840
one off, you know, on YouTube from time to time. But I am much more apt to if I can put

436
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,960
it on my phone, I will even if I'm not listening weekly, I'll download a few of them and then

437
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,280
bang through them when I know I'm going to be on the road for a while.

438
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,360
As someone who doesn't use RSS feeds very much, but does listen to podcasts, I will

439
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,100
also say that any time that you can take out of that process is helpful. Like, you know,

440
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,760
it's the worst when I'm sitting in my car and I'm trying to download it and the link

441
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,960
isn't obvious. And it's like, I just want this to download so I can listen to it on

442
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,760
my drive. Right. Even if it's not RSS, if you can just make it simple, that goes away.

443
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,520
And Lord, you wanted to jump in with a mic that you think is pretty great. And I'll let

444
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:22,840
you get a plug in for that as we kind of wrap up the mic question. You still have it? No,

445
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,880
he moved on. All right. He left in the chat room for those of you that want to jump back.

446
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,600
All right. So guys, Kubota Podcast, guys, any other questions about the show itself?

447
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,960
I could talk a little bit about organizing and planning for the show. I know you guys

448
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,600
have some kind of a dedicated machine for recording or something like that. How does

449
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,680
that set up work? For example, I don't know if you have OBS on it and you record. I know

450
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,160
you have some weird controller that you just switch screens and all that. Well, if you

451
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,800
want to go down the rabbit hole. Yeah, this is a boy. This is quite the rabbit hole. If

452
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,800
you're going to do it right, you need two machines. That's why I say it's a rabbit

453
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:03,240
hole. So in front of me right now, I've got two systems. One is an OBS system and one

454
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,280
is a Wirecast system. The Wirecast system is sort of our legacy system because it has

455
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:15,920
to run on the Mac OS of tens. And it is sort of a all in one. It does what a $15,000 hardware

456
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:21,920
video mixer does, only it does it for $1,000. So it does the video feed mixing so it can

457
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:30,560
pull in USB video at 30 frames per second with PC desktop video working at 60 frames

458
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:36,720
per second with HDMI video working at 30 frames per second. And then it can also pull in live

459
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,720
screen captures, encode all of that in real time, send it up to Ustream, send it up to

460
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,120
Scale Engine and also write a lossless ProRes file to a RAID 0 drive array at the same time.

461
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,560
So it's a nice piece of gear and it's being very, very, very quickly replaced by OBS.

462
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,040
And so right now on the other machine, on a much, much smaller machine, on a much weaker

463
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,460
machine, we're able to accomplish a lot of the same stuff that we do in Wirecast on a

464
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,640
freaking NUC because when you move over to OBS and when you move over to Linux, you are

465
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,840
gifted in a ton of overhead of performance. And so one of the things that we are moving

466
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,880
towards is a setup where a lot of that stuff going out to the stream endpoints, the recording

467
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,840
to a lossless file, the recording to a regular file will happen under OBS and eventually

468
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,120
OBS will sit in front of the Wirecast rig. Right now OBS is behind the Wirecast rig and

469
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,320
supplies Wirecast with a certain set different amounts of feeds like rerun feeds, station

470
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,180
identification feeds, kind of things like for like a screen capture feed, things like

471
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:40,080
that that are sent by OBS into Wirecast and the Wirecast goes out to the web. Now probably

472
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,380
at some point we'll reverse that and then at some point completely replace Wirecast

473
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,560
altogether. It doesn't do everything. OBS doesn't handle everything like streaming to

474
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,160
three or four different endpoints at the same time. It doesn't really do that. If that's

475
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,320
not something you're worried about, then that's not really an issue. OBS isn't, we're not

476
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,400
quite sure. We haven't totally tested its lossless yet file recording but it seems to

477
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,960
be there for different formats. So there's some stuff you can do with OBS today that

478
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,120
even back in January, we couldn't do yet. And so a lot of people have sort of opted

479
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,080
to use Google Hangouts or they've opted to use something else completely different and

480
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,520
I would invite them to check OBS out again because the one thing that is true is that

481
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,480
since Linux Fest Northwest in April, we have been using OBS in production every single

482
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,000
day in some capacity, to some degree. And in some cases we produce entire shows now

483
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,880
using OBS. There's been some recent episodes of the Linux Action Show where the entire

484
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:39,720
thing was recorded, the shots were done, all of it was done in OBS, no Wirecast, no Mac

485
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,920
needed at all. And so it's getting really, really close. There's just a few areas we

486
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,840
keep running into and we keep working on those. So I would say if you were, if I was starting

487
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,200
out today, I would probably build the entire thing around OBS and just sort of, because

488
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,600
I would imagine its limitations would not be outpaced by my noobness. Like my noobness

489
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,640
would still be behind what OBS's limitations are. The problem is, is right now, is we're

490
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,760
coming to OBS from this perspective of a ton of functionality and a ton of expectations

491
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,120
and it's just not meeting all of them yet. But if I didn't have all those expectations

492
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,480
and all those needs, and if my expectations were much simpler, OBS would be doing the

493
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
job. Does that make sense?

494
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,880
Yeah, you could grow with OBS. And I have to say the thing about it, just watching you

495
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,640
guys use OBS, it's already grown a lot. And I think the more people we can bring on board

496
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,920
and support it, then it will really become a great community tool to make these kind

497
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
of podcasts.

498
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,080
Yeah. Rekai says if you have trouble finding OBS for Linux on their distro, have a look

499
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:40,280
for Open Broadcaster Multi-Platform, as that's actually the name of the rewrite, is multi...

500
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,280
Multi-platform.

501
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,720
Yeah, Open Broadcaster Multi-Platform.

502
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,600
We've tried it, I think, last week or two weeks ago, and we've done some experimenting

503
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,080
with streaming directly to YouTube, so we don't have a streaming server. And it worked

504
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,840
really well, but when I clicked the record button, everything just froze. My whole desk

505
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
almost...

506
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,680
Yeah, that does happen, yeah. Boy, isn't that a monster. And you know what it is, it's probably

507
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,600
some library, something underneath that OBS isn't working right with, and it really is

508
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,000
a pain in the ass. But when you dial it in just right and you finally get it working,

509
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,680
the nice thing you're gonna get by that is you're gonna have a local file. And that local

510
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,940
file is very easy to strip the audio out of, so you can release an MP3 version. It's very

511
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:25,400
easy to go directly to an MP4 file and post that up for download somewhere or a WebM file.

512
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:31,540
I mean, the thing is, is just by mixing locally in OBS versus using Hangouts, you make it

513
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,760
accessible to an entire different category of audience. And that's the category of audience

514
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,160
that's gonna be your passionate long-term subscribers who are gonna be your foundation.

515
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,720
So it is totally worth the technical trials, even if it's gonna mean you try it on a different

516
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,920
distro, you try it on Ubuntu LTS versus Ubuntu 1510 versus Ubuntu Studio versus Arch. You

517
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,320
try it on the different distros to see which, because the truth of the matter is, one of

518
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,600
the mixes, it will work. It just, like what we do here is over there, that is an Archbox

519
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,440
running a very fixed set of packages. And it's running the GNOME 3 desktop because that's

520
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,220
the desktop I prefer. It's not the best desktop for production, but it's the one I prefer.

521
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,600
It's running Arch, and we just simply don't install updates.

522
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
It stays.

523
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,100
And it just runs. And in six months, we'll replace it with a fully up-to-date box that's

524
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,100
been tested.

525
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,200
So we need a perfect Linux broadcast container that can just be distributed.

526
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,240
Exactly. Yeah, Docker could very well help with this problem, too. So truth be told is

527
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,980
we found the best combination was Arch, and then you don't change it. Because when you're

528
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:42,520
working on this kind of stuff, a lot of the different software depends on the latest changes

529
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,360
to FFmpeg, the latest capabilities of this. Like when we want to build a stream to multiple

530
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,600
destinations, we're literally just waiting for final bits of code to be written. So to

531
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,760
be running on a version of FFmpeg that's a year old is just not even an option for us.

532
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,100
It's unusable.

533
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,200
So you got to play with that. That is the definite downside to production under Linux

534
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:10,200
is if this was the Mac unplugged show, I would say, yeah, don't install Capitan. Just install

535
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,000
Mavericks and go get Wirecast, and you're good to go. Oh, yeah, you're going to be out

536
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,320
$2,500 for the computer and $1,000 for Wirecast, but you'll be good to go.

537
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,920
But the thing is, is that locks you into buying that new Mac every couple of years. It locks

538
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,280
you into doing the OS X upgrades, and it locks you into buying the $500 Wirecast upgrades

539
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,460
every year. And it is just a cycle that is unneeded because the open source stuff is

540
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:42,360
super close. It's getting there. So yeah, I would say stick with OBS.

541
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,520
That's why I also asked about the dedicated machine. Should we have... I saw you have

542
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:52,560
a NUC, and I know they're really powerful, so I was thinking maybe we can invest in one

543
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,920
and just use that one for the recording. But I don't know how would we stream, for example,

544
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,000
from my laptop to the recording machine so that that machine records the video and audio

545
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,840
from everybody? Or how would we configure that?

546
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,560
Yeah, definitely do a separate machine because the reason there is, is it crashes and you

547
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,040
lose your episode. And so anything you can do to isolate and make it less likely to crash,

548
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,600
the less things that machine is doing, the less likely you're going to lose your show.

549
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:28,080
And nothing hurts more. I have done the three best Tech Talk Todays of my life. I mean really

550
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:34,360
good episodes with super good mumble conversation. All three of them have been lost. And it hurts

551
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,560
because they were really good episodes, and they've all been lost. And so the less that

552
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,160
machine does, the less likely you're going to lose that episode. If you can have a backup

553
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,000
recording that's good, all that kind of stuff. So the NUC, if you're using it for serious

554
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,300
production is probably not powerful enough yet. You might want an i7 with like 16 gigs

555
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,440
of RAM or something. I don't know. Maybe you might be able to make it work.

556
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,920
Too big for us right now.

557
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,520
You might be able to make it work then. Just play with it and see.

558
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,720
We'll try different hardware, see what happens.

559
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,000
Definitely take some tuning there, I'm sure.

560
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,800
Yeah, you just kind of have to dial it into how much usage you guys have for it and stuff.

561
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,460
Like all the other thing is ours runs 24-7. What was it? I'm a kind of, this is how do

562
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,400
you send the video recordings to the separate machine. Oh, that's a good question. It depends.

563
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:27,480
So sometimes it's over the network using RTSP, and sometimes it is via direct capture on

564
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:34,760
HDMI. Both come in as different camera sources, HDMI and RSTP, RTMP. So yeah. All right guys,

565
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,120
any other questions before we wrap up the segment?

566
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,760
How do you play music during the live show?

567
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,800
Tricks of the trade.

568
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Yeah, how do you play music or like how do you do like soundboard clips?

569
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
And the value of this is negative. Get it out of here.

570
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,260
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

571
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,840
That is honestly, it's not that tricky. You just have a separate machine that goes into

572
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:03,240
a separate input on the mixer, and I just have it dedicated and ready to go. And sometimes

573
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,200
I have soundboard software, sometimes I use VLC. I just have, I have input seven on my

574
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,760
mixer is dedicated to a machine that can make silly sounds when I want it.

575
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
Some audience members.

576
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
Get it out of here.

577
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
What's that?

578
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Some audience members prefer that didn't happen.

579
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
Yeah.

580
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
I don't know.

581
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
Exactly. Very much.

582
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,760
But it's here to stay.

583
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:30,120
On the Ubuntu podcast, we have a separate person with their own laptop and I give them

584
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:35,400
signals and they press the buttons for the sounds to be played in, but it works the same

585
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,840
way. It's like an extra person on the stream. They don't say anything. I just give them

586
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,840
the nod.

587
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:47,440
That is hilarious. So it's almost like it is like another host in a way. It's commentary

588
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
in its own way.

589
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
I love it.

590
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,560
So the microphone I've got disabled on that machine, but the audio out from it plays out

591
00:41:53,560 --> 00:42:00,080
over mumble. So we all hear it and it gets recorded locally. So everyone records locally,

592
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:09,000
including that person. So we have a separate audio file for each speaker plus that device.

593
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,280
But it means that we all get to hear it during the recording, which is actually quite important

594
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,280
because you can all take a breather and you can hear the stings and the bumpers and the

595
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,720
bed that goes underneath. You can all hear it and you know when to speak and when not

596
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,720
to.

597
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,960
Yeah, and you get to talk to the beat and stuff like that. Yeah, that's why we do our

598
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,680
music live too. We'll do all of the music and stuff like that live so that way we can

599
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,400
kind of play to the music and stuff like that. And that's another nice thing about knowing

600
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,720
you're targeting audio a little more too, is that's a lot harder when you're doing video,

601
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
as it turns out.

602
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,160
All right. Any last questions, guys?

603
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:53,040
Okay, last question. How do you organize the sections and keep in time with them? Because

604
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,200
every time we plan, okay, we finish on that time and we always get over it.

605
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:05,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, also I'll do that backwards. How do I... So what was the first

606
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,640
part is how do I plan the segments?

607
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:13,040
How do you plan the segments so that you finish each segment on time? Because we always surpass

608
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,040
that time.

609
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,600
Wes, what do you suppose I do?

610
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,000
Well, I would say it helps a lot to not have a time that you're set for.

611
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,480
That is pretty much it. I just have a pretty innate feeling for how long I have to say

612
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,280
about something and how long the Mumble Room has to say about that thing, how long Wes

613
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,640
or Noah or whoever it is has to say about it. And I've just kind of sussed it up and

614
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,320
I just keep plugging content in until I'm like, well, that'll take me about 20 minutes

615
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,200
to talk about. And every now and then I blow it. Like last week or on Sunday, I blew it

616
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,440
and we had a two-hour Linux action show. I usually try to go for about no more than

617
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,920
an hour 45, which was great, just by the way.

618
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,120
We were targeting for one hour, so that's why I was asking.

619
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:58,800
Yeah, we do the same. We have a set of show notes and at the top we list each of the segment

620
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:05,000
names and the amount of minutes that each segment should be. And I have a web-based

621
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:13,680
clock that if you go to a specific URL that I know, all of you, even on remote locations,

622
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,760
can go to this URL and it shows you the same clock. And when you want to advance to the

623
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,440
next segment, anyone can tap the screen and it will move the clock on to the next segment.

624
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,160
And the clock has the amount of time for this segment and how far you've clocked up in this

625
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,680
segment. So you know when you're going over. And when you get to the end of the segment,

626
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,560
someone hits the button and you move over and everyone's clock moves over.

627
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,560
Link released.

628
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,400
It's a single HTML file. I'll send you an email with the HTML file.

629
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,800
Do you find watching the clock becomes distracting?

630
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,800
Well, we have a – I personally have a tablet on my desk which I have always on with the

631
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,800
clock on it.

632
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,640
I don't mean physically watching the clock. I mean does it take mental CPU cycles to think

633
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,640
about a clock?

634
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,360
Yeah. But there's four of us. So it's not – like with you, you're often the only

635
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,200
presenter or the main presenter, right? With us, there's four of us and –

636
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,200
So you have more cycles.

637
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,400
When one person's speaking, the other guys are looking at the clock and they're paying

638
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,960
a message on the chat and be like, hey dude, shut up now.

639
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,400
So that is like – I definitely do try to follow a clock when I'm doing tech talk.

640
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,480
I try not to make it longer than 30 minutes. But otherwise –

641
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,720
I think it's wasted effort.

642
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:27,120
I'll tell you why I think it's wasted effort is I feel like following a specific

643
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:34,440
time limit is following mainstream media's rules. And I'm not doing a podcast because

644
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,480
I want to emulate mainstream media. And then one of the nice things about I think the podcast

645
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,600
medium is I can say the podcast is exactly as long as the content justifies. And if the

646
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,000
content justifies that it's a 45-minute show, then it's a 45-minute show. And if the content

647
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,640
justifies it's a two-hour show, it's a two-hour show. And I don't really get that

648
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,900
hung up on it because I have my rough goals that I'm aiming for. But at the same time,

649
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,120
I don't want to necessarily take an outdated way of thinking and cram it into a new medium

650
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,120
either.

651
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:08,720
So the flip side of that is you're doing this as a job. I'm not. So I'm doing this

652
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,200
during an evening. We start recording at half past eight in the evening and finish at half

653
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,200
past nine. So we do two half-hour slots. And we set the expectation with our listeners

654
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,840
that each episode is half an hour long. So if we suddenly turn up with a two-hour episode,

655
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,040
they're like, whoa, dude, what on earth happened there?

656
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,720
There's definitely shows too where you can say it's an hour-long show and it's part

657
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:37,160
of the show. There's space for it too. I say don't get super hung up on it, but basically-

658
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:42,360
Yeah, and I kind of agree with you. A couple of episodes recently, we've rumbled on a bit

659
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:47,560
and while one person's talking, the rest of us, I can feel it, are all looking at the

660
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,400
clock going, oh my God, oh my God, we're going over. Come on, dude, shut up. We're running

661
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,840
over. And I think part of me thinks, well, maybe actually we should just chill out a

662
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,200
little bit. And every so often put out, instead of a 30-minute episode, put out a 45-minute

663
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,400
episode. And actually, that's not a big deal. But then the flip side is we're doing this

664
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,200
in our evenings and we've all got families and stuff to do and really we're doing this

665
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,480
in our spare time. And nobody's paying us for this. We're not asking for donations.

666
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,240
Well, and honestly, your existing audience tends to love a longer show, but new people

667
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,840
will tend to be put off by really long shows. So it's a hard line to walk.

668
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,160
It's kind of how much does it help you? And I think what is important is to have good

669
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,040
sideband communication between hosts so that even if it's not sticking to a distinct timeline,

670
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,600
you can at least communicate like, that's enough. I don't have anything else. Keep things

671
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,600
in sync.

672
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,720
And there's a lot of different ways to pull that off. There's inline chat. There's IRC

673
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,280
in the background. There's Google Docs chat. There's Slack. There's all that kind of stuff.

674
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,280
There's a lot of different ways.

675
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,200
Hand signals if you're lucky enough to be in the same room.

676
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,560
Wimpy or Popey, you guys have any last wisdom to pass on before we move to the next segment?

677
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,640
You've kind of covered it with your fancy equipment and OBS, but make sure you've got

678
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:03,600
a backup. So if you're doing local audio recording, make sure that somewhere there's something

679
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:09,080
recording all of the streams, because one day what will happen is somebody won't be

680
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:14,760
recording or they'll have the wrong mic or something. And you'll need that backup.

681
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,760
Yeah.

682
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,000
So every person records their own stream.

683
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,360
Yeah, it's super demotivating to lose a really good episode.

684
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,360
Yeah.

685
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,360
Yes.

686
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,360
And it's also a great way to join a podcast, as I found out earlier in the year.

687
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,360
Yeah, that works too.

688
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:36,040
Yeah. I have a recording of the Open2 Podcasts, a mythical lost episode 30 on a hard drive

689
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,480
that's somewhat fried on my desk. And one day I'll get around to getting it back.

690
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,000
Oh, man. I have lost some good episodes over the years. And for a long time, I'd never

691
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
lost any shows. And then now we have more backups in place. But that wasn't until after

692
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,280
learning the hard way.

693
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,120
Sometime last year, you had a bad streak there. And these are like the saddest day.

694
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,560
The next day you'd come on and talk about how you lost. It was just so sad.

695
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,480
Yeah. Well, because it's a double whammy because you don't have an episode. So people show

696
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,960
up and you got nothing to give them. And he's like, you did all of the work except for the

697
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,840
publishing part. You did all of the work and then lose it. So yeah, definitely make a backup

698
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,840
if you can.

699
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,080
And honestly, if you're going to do it live, that's probably right there as your point

700
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:20,000
to do your backup. It all gets mixed down and sent out. Get a backup going right there.

701
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,040
And there are a ton of great Linux podcasts out there. Wimpy and Popi just put out an

702
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:33,240
episode of the Ubuntu UK podcast that basically talked about all the podcasts they listen

703
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,560
to. And you can give a shout out or you can check out there because they have a shout

704
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,840
out to a ton of great shows, including a couple of our shows. So you can find that over there

705
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,360
on their podcast. So if you now are interested.

706
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,280
That's a great example of one where one of us was talking a lot and the rest of us were

707
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,280
looking at the world.

708
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,280
Who, Wimpy?

709
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,720
Because Wimpy has a podcast list that is as long as mine.

710
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:01,560
It is a burning. It was good fun though. It was worth doing.

711
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:06,680
That was nice. And then, you know, it's funny because really the truth of the matter is,

712
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:12,440
and I think in a very good way, a few years ago there was a handful of Linux podcasts

713
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:17,200
and now there's a heck of a lot more. And I think that's a sign that the nuances in

714
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,780
the Linux desktop are sort of maturing a little bit and there's different podcasts that can

715
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,520
fill each one of those nuances, which is awesome.

716
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,920
That's really cool. So check it out and we'll have links to some of the stuff we talked

717
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,720
about. And of course, you guys can also go look at the Kubuntu podcast if you're a Kubuntu

718
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,600
user, might be of interest to you. They got five episodes up on YouTube. And guys stick

719
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,660
around for the rest of the episode and let us, you know, hang out with us and share your

720
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,280
insights and then I come back from time to time and let us know how it's going because

721
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,800
you're always welcome to join us.

722
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,480
Thanks a lot for the info.

723
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,160
You bet. Good luck. All right. So before we get into the next segment, I'm going to take

724
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,920
a minute and tell you about my cell phone provider. And they're pretty neat. It's Ting.

725
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:04,920
I want you to go to linux.ting.com to support the show and get the Linux unplugged discount.

726
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,480
Here's what I love about Ting. Mobile, that actually makes sense. You can wrap your brain

727
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,440
around this because it's pretty straightforward. You just pay for what you use. Boom. So simple.

728
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,080
That is really simple. It can't be simpler. Flat $6 for the line, pay for what you use.

729
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,080
They just take your minutes, your messages, your megabytes, whatever you just use, that's

730
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,320
what you pay. Plus they have really great dashboards to manage it all. They have super

731
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:30,760
passionate customer service. All their devices are unlocked. I think, are you starting to

732
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,120
get the picture here? This is pretty nice. They got a savings calculator. When you go

733
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:39,140
to linux.ting.com, you can try it out. Now I want to put this out there because if you're

734
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:45,280
clever at all, if you just put a little thought into this, you can work this. You can really

735
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,200
work this to your benefit. I've got, I mean, Noah is really the ultimate example because

736
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,480
he's got an unbelievable amount of lines and he just does not pay very much, but I got

737
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:01,560
three lines. That's not baller, but I got three lines on Ting. And I'm paying 45 bucks

738
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:07,320
this month. 45 bucks. Because I just think about it a little bit. I download my podcast

739
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:12,760
before I leave. I make very few calls. Pretty much the data I use is for audio streaming

740
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:18,440
or maps, like Waze and stuff like that. Otherwise, I'm really savvy about it. And honestly, that's

741
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:23,400
all it takes. It's just that much forethought and you can save so much money on your mobile.

742
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,760
And the nice thing about Ting is they have two networks to pick from, GSM and CDMA. And

743
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,280
again, the thing I like about that, and I think this plays well in our audience, is

744
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,180
if you're just a little bit clever, again, you know the difference in your area between

745
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,640
a CDMA network and a GSM network, or even if you don't know the difference, you don't

746
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:44,400
mind Googling. That's all it takes to figure out, well, I can get better speed or better

747
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:51,080
coverage or maybe I want to move things around. The thing is flexibility, control, power.

748
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,680
That's your position in the Ting relationship. Ting is built around giving consumers total

749
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,800
control over their Ting account. And they have a bunch of great devices and a bunch

750
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,960
of great tools to do this. I want you to go over to the Ting site right now to support

751
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,560
the show, linux.ting.com, and then play around. Take a look at some of these, I was going

752
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,640
to say computers, take a look at some of these phones I have.

753
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,640
They are computers.

754
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,440
They really are. I mean, the Nexus 6P.

755
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,000
Ooh, look at that.

756
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,200
Oh, man. I have to be honest with you. I am definitely tempted.

757
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,200
I am too.

758
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:26,400
So, okay, Wes, would you be more of a 6P guy or are you more of a 5X guy or a Moto X guy?

759
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,840
Traditionally, I think the 5X is where I'd be looking, and I am looking, but the 6P,

760
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:35,280
I don't know, I haven't had a metal body. The thought of that, Nexus line, metal body,

761
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,280
I am very tempted.

762
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,080
I agree. So the 5X is like the phone that I should get.

763
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,080
Yes, exactly.

764
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,080
It seems very reasonable.

765
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,080
And it looks nice.

766
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,040
Unlocked, $379, you can have it at Ting. I mean, it is like, it's the perfect phone because

767
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,400
it's the Google experience. It's unlocked and you only pay for what you use. You're

768
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:54,800
in control of the entire account, no contract, no early termination fee. It's amazing. Flat

769
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,640
$6. The 5X is like, if I'm reasonable, that's where I should go. But then I look at the

770
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,920
6P, I look at the 6P and I go, but that's bigger.

771
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,920
And it's faster.

772
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
It's faster.

773
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,920
And it's got metal.

774
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,920
More pixels.

775
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,920
Yes.

776
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,920
And it's got metal.

777
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,920
Yes.

778
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,920
And it's a new hardware vendor-ish.

779
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,920
I don't have a lot of experience with Hawaii.

780
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,920
Exactly.

781
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,400
And I would be kind of curious what a Hawaii phone is. And I really want Marshmallow right

782
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,840
now. I'm jelly for Marshmallow. I can't help it. I can't help it. Linux.ting.com, go check

783
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,520
out Ting, see why I use them. I've been using them for two years and try out their savings

784
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,520
calculator.

785
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,920
I bring this up because I think my audience is savvy enough to know that they could take

786
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,020
something like Ting and just use a little bit of their skill set to really maximize

787
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,760
how much you could save. It is really a great opportunity for people that are willing to

788
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,520
maybe do a Google search from time to time. You're not afraid to visit a subreddit every

789
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:46,480
now and then. Or just call up their passionate customer service. It is an opportunity that

790
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,760
is waiting for you. Linux.ting.com. Go try out their savings. I've saved over $2,000

791
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,760
in the last two years. Go try them out. Linux.ting.com.

792
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,280
All right. So, I was really kind of pumped about OpenStreetMap, oh, I don't know, about

793
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:06,920
a year ago. And I really haven't looked into it very much. But recently, I've been thinking

794
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,000
a lot more about maps and navigation and marking areas that I visit.

795
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,400
Is that something to do with your recent road trip?

796
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,400
It is.

797
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,400
I don't understand.

798
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,760
It is. You know what I discovered on the road trip is even the best mapping systems often

799
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,360
need updates and improvements. And there is a lot of different things that you can get

800
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:29,520
out of OpenStreetMaps. But for those of you that are not familiar, OpenStreetMaps is a

801
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,800
really, really, really neat project. And as the name implies, it is open source maps.

802
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,660
It's powered by users, thousands of users, data, web sites, mobile apps, all the stuff

803
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:45,520
that comes in, dedicated hardware devices, local knowledge, community driven, all open

804
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:51,100
data. And I really, really love this project. But it's one of those boring infrastructure

805
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:56,240
things that you can't really like just randomly, randomly talk about from time to time because

806
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,560
it's like, yeah, yeah, we all know about it. So what's new? Well, this week, some stuff

807
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,120
is coming out that is brand new. And I'm going to get to that in just a moment. But I wanted

808
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:08,440
to recap on OpenStreetMaps itself. If you're not familiar with it, it's greatly expanded

809
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,480
access to geodata worldwide. When OpenStreetMaps started over 10 years ago, it was created

810
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,760
as a response to limited geographic data. Now, primarily in the UK, it's grown much,

811
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:25,960
much larger than that now. It's open and flexible. It's created for the greater good. This author

812
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,120
who I'll link to in the show notes talks about one of his favorite things about OpenStreetMaps

813
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,880
is this large and dedicated community. One of the best parts of this community is the

814
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,800
Hot OSM whose memberships help coordinate updates to OpenStreetMaps in areas impacted

815
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:43,320
by natural or humanitarian disasters. So that way, the maps reflect the current stuff. And

816
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:49,400
it's enabling an entire new emerging industry to grow because the data is available to everybody.

817
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,840
There's APIs and software development kits out for mobile devices. Developers, say, the

818
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:00,720
ones that have written into Koda Radio, have told me that their API and their SDK is easier

819
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,560
to use and integrate with your apps than Google's own native maps API on the Android platform.

820
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,000
Like, it's a really, really good system.

821
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,640
I was looking into it. I mean, at least the Python binding seemed very simple and straightforward,

822
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,640
which is really nice.

823
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,480
So think about taking something like Google Maps and making it available to everybody,

824
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,040
making it available on all kinds of mobile devices. Well, then you can start to build

825
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,760
some really cool stuff. And I want to tell you about some of these apps because I think

826
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:31,480
this is a really amazing initiative. The first one I want to tell you about is Wheelmap.org.

827
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:36,560
Wheelmap.org is an online map database to search, find, and mark wheelchair-accessible

828
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:42,480
places, something that maybe Google would never really be motivated by profit to do,

829
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:48,520
but something that a passionate community can do using the accurate, up-to-date, always-being-modified

830
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,520
data from OpenStreetMap.

831
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,200
You get so much infrastructure to just build on and tweak and update.

832
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,960
So look at this. This is a Wheelmap.org for wheelchair users. It gives them places like

833
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:04,600
bars, restaurants, cinemas, supermarkets, so they can look up and find places that are

834
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,880
accessible to them. And, of course, there's apps available for mobile devices as well.

835
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,880
That's awesome.

836
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,880
And it's something that, like, you know.

837
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,880
Wow, look at this. There's a lot of stuff on here.

838
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,880
Yes, isn't this cool?

839
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,880
It's crazy.

840
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,880
Are you looking at it right now?

841
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
Yeah.

842
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,080
Yeah, I know. So, like, here, I'll look at Seattle, for example. And I think this is

843
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,680
really kind of, and you can go right here to King County. And you can also have it get

844
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,360
your direct location if you want, if you don't want to do, like, all of the searching stuff.

845
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,840
Look at that. Look at this. And also, you'll notice, too, how fast it is. Doesn't it just

846
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,840
feel super fast?

847
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,200
I've been consistently impressed with the UI. Like, they've done a lot of work on the

848
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,120
front end to make it snappy and competitive with Google, really.

849
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,720
Yes, very much so. And there's some, there's cool ones. There's, like, OpenStreetMaps that

850
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,520
will even show you where power lines are run.

851
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,520
Oh, wow.

852
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,720
Like, again, Google's never going to put that in there, right? Here's another really cool

853
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:55,760
app, Maps.me. Offline OpenStreetMaps for iOS, Android, Mac, Linux, and Windows computers.

854
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:01,320
Offline maps powered by OpenStreetMaps. Maps.me is an open source cross-platform offline maps

855
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:07,960
application built on top of crowdsourced OpenStreetMap data. Isn't this neat? And here's Maps.me

856
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,640
online right here. And, in fact, didn't you send this in, too?

857
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:16,040
Yes, I believe I did. I just love how much you can do. You know, it's like, I was looking

858
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,120
at one earlier where it was custom bike routes.

859
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,120
Yes.

860
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,000
And so, you know, people can take the data that's available here and then determine their

861
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,760
own routing algorithms that might be better or more optimized or better for your city.

862
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,760
And they pull in the data from a lot of different locations, like, Lorde, you're in the, Lorde

863
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,080
Dirac in the chat, in the mumble room right now is mentioning that a lot of the U.S. data

864
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,240
came from the Census Bureau. I didn't know that.

865
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,240
That's great.

866
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,720
Yeah, that is great. I mean, might as well get it from open locations. And I actually

867
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,560
started looking into it because there is when you, now this is Chris talking about the road

868
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:51,120
trip again, but when you are hauling something, there is an entirely different set of, I am

869
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:57,200
driving like in a parallel dimension. So, when I'm pulling the rover, in total, I'm

870
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,120
like 45 feet long. That's near semi-length, right?

871
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,680
Because you've got the truck and then you have a 25 foot long trailer, plus you have

872
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:10,080
the connection. And so, it's like 40 feet long, plus. And so, there are certain areas

873
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,960
that are just very challenging to go into. So, I have been looking to see if there's

874
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:19,560
specific OpenStreetMap based data that would help with this. What are you looking at there?

875
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:23,800
Well, this was linked here in the chat room to Kresney here. Tell them about State of

876
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,800
the Map.

877
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,400
That looks really, that looks really fancy.

878
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,800
Yeah, it's the biggest OpenStreetMap conference ever. It sounds like there are videos up now.

879
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:37,880
Very cool. So, I want to tell you about something that, this is why OpenStreetMap got on my

880
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:45,000
radar today. This is what kind of made me excited about it is, since the whole last

881
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
pass thing, I've been like, this is what I've been trying to square, is can I really

882
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,780
replace every service that relies on a hosted third party system? Is that really realistic

883
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:00,240
in 2015 when everything's in the cloud and everything's online, everything's got to

884
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,240
be mobile?

885
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,240
Well, it has to be mobile.

886
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,240
Everything's got to be mobile.

887
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,240
It has to be in the cloud. That's the rule.

888
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:10,480
I don't know if you saw that, but I think Obama came out and said, hey, everybody, one

889
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,480
of the rules is-

890
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,480
Executive order.

891
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,280
Yeah, he said, first he came out on the stage and he said-

892
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,280
Hello, everybody.

893
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,280
And then he said, look, this is-

894
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,280
That's how we roll.

895
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,240
Everything's got to be mobile. And so I was trying to get my head around this and I realized,

896
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,920
how am I going to get nav routing and maps?

897
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,880
Yeah, you're dependent on the big providers with their big database.

898
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,720
Yeah, and it seems like this is an impossible, impossible thing for an open source project

899
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:37,720
to take on. But you see, this is where OpenStreet, the data of OpenStreetMaps comes in. And there's

900
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,360
a few different projects that are tackling this. And there's a new one out there called

901
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:47,840
Mapzen, M-A-P-Z-E-N. And it is essentially an open platform trying to handle this particular

902
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,480
problem. It's a search engine for places that takes the philosophy of open communities and

903
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,500
creating data and open code to heart. Mapzen Search will launch this week. And in the meantime,

904
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,360
they're going to share some background info here with us. And so we're going to go into

905
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,360
all of this.

906
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:05,480
Here's what jumped out at me. Okay. Their data collection is already underway. UK post

907
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,920
codes beginning with E. They got different countries, have different address number schemes.

908
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,960
They figured all of that out. They went through US highways. They got all that figured out.

909
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,940
East, west, odd routes, all this crazy stuff. And now they believe they have an open routing

910
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:20,280
system that's going to be available to users to go into and simply get planned routes,

911
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:25,440
maps, all this stuff as available as another data layer sitting on top of OpenStreetMaps,

912
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,560
which will then be available to developers. And they got a whole series of cool stuff

913
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:36,600
they're working on. When you go to mapzen.com, including Tanzgram, a flexible hackable mapping

914
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,480
engine designed for real-time rendering, 2D and 3D of maps.

915
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,480
Oh, wow.

916
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,080
Yeah. They got the Maps and Search, the Modern Geocoding and Play Search service. They're

917
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:50,360
going to have turn-by-turn directions available through this and vector tile services. Vector

918
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:56,480
tiles are awesome. I don't know. I think this is really like the next level. So you have

919
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,880
OpenStreetMaps providing the core infrastructure of the data. And then you got these guys providing

920
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:06,120
cool 3D maps, cool real-time routing with traffic, all this stuff coming in to Maps

921
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,320
in.

922
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:11,400
To me, this is going to take OpenStreetMaps and sort of make it available at a whole other

923
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,480
level to apps. You could use this stuff on the go. And then you combine it with stuff

924
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:23,520
like OSM Tracker, which is a really nice way for sort of crowd-based Google Street Maps

925
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:30,280
taking photos, real-time corrections of OpenStreetMap data when there's errors. You can mark areas

926
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:36,000
of construction if the map is completely wrong. All that stuff right here from an app while

927
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
you're driving around.

928
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Oh, that makes it so easy.

929
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Yeah.

930
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,880
So you can really keep this thing up to date.

931
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,040
I thought that was pretty cool. I thought it was pretty cool. Wimpy, you wanted to jump

932
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:48,000
in and talk about an open source alternative to Google Maps.

933
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,520
Yeah. So one of the hottest apps on Ubuntu Touch is called UNAV, which is written by

934
01:03:54,520 --> 01:04:02,800
Marcos Costales. And that's a full turn-by-turn GPS navigator for car, bike, and walking.

935
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:08,600
And that uses OpenStreetMap and Maps then to do its mapping. And I'm going to use this

936
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:16,640
to hopefully navigate us from the south of England to the northwest of England when we

937
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:21,320
go to odd camp at the end of the month. So we're actually going to use it in anger to

938
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,680
drive somewhere unfamiliar.

939
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,760
Cool. That's the ultimate test, isn't it?

940
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,760
You'll have to let us know how it goes.

941
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,760
Yeah.

942
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,760
Well, it's... Go on.

943
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,000
Well, I noticed it does turn-by-turn by directions and it avoids toll roads. Do you notice it

944
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,360
do offline maps too? Because that's one of my favorite things about a lot of these OpenStreetMaps

945
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,360
apps.

946
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:42,720
I don't think it does yet, but I do think that they're planning that. At the moment,

947
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,840
it's an online-only solution, I believe.

948
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,280
But the good news is in the UK, we have pretty good coverage.

949
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,280
Right.

950
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,280
It's not as much of a problem, is it?

951
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,280
That's not a problem.

952
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,280
Yeah.

953
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,520
No, here is a sort of required thing.

954
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:00,440
As we discussed a few weeks ago, I've got 3G in my car, so it should be all right.

955
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,860
I will add a link to that in the show notes for people that are taking a look for maybe

956
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:09,120
a Ubuntu Touch-based app. So it's UNAV, GPS navigation, UNAV app explorer.

957
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,120
Really cool.

958
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,120
Yeah.

959
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:16,720
Yeah, I've been looking for something that is specific for RVers. So if anybody out there

960
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:23,040
in the audience knows of something that is OpenStreetMaps-based that is geared towards

961
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:27,520
truckers or people that have RVs, large vehicles, I'd love to know because I was doing some

962
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,000
exploring around which kind of led me to find this topic.

963
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,520
And then I realized, kind of much like we talked about LibreOffice a few weeks back,

964
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,520
there are some really other cool projects out there that are attached to Linux, but

965
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,480
not directly, that are really neat.

966
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,440
And OpenStreetMaps, if you think about it, if you think about how critical that kind

967
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,040
of information is and how fundamental it is to a platform, I mean, that's why Apple went

968
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,240
off and made their own maps.

969
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,240
Yeah, exactly.

970
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,240
It's obviously important enough to them.

971
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,240
Yeah.

972
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,240
Google's got their own thing, right?

973
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,680
And, you know, one of the nice ways is there is more and more people using this OpenStreetMaps

974
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,520
stuff like DuckDuckGo.

975
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:04,880
If you go to DuckDuckGo's Maps application, that is powered also by OpenStreetMaps.

976
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:10,960
So you can get some Navi-type stuff right now using the OpenStreetMaps from DuckDuckGo,

977
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
which is pretty neat.

978
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,960
I don't know if you've played with it.

979
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,960
Yeah, go ahead.

980
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,120
One of the other things we're using it for, when Martin's going to be driving us up to

981
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:23,720
Liverpool, I made a little app for Ubuntu Phone, which was inspired by your road trip

982
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,720
actually, Chris.

983
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,720
Oh, yeah?

984
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:30,320
Yeah, I saw your – I was following your road trip online and watching the position

985
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,320
of your RV.

986
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,320
Oh, the live tracker, yeah.

987
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,320
Yeah, yeah.

988
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,240
And so I thought I'd write an app.

989
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:40,640
And so I've written an app for Ubuntu Phone, which reports our location to an online map.

990
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,640
Oh, that's fun.

991
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:48,760
So if you go to ubuntupodcast.org slash road trip, then you'll see a map.

992
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,240
It's currently blank because we haven't set off yet.

993
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:57,200
But when we do, you'll see a little dot showing – showing where we are.

994
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,840
It's all done on Ubuntu Phone or using free software.

995
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,360
Now is there – what is the backend server software?

996
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,240
Is it TrackCar or is it something you just – are you up to date?

997
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,240
No, it's all homegrown.

998
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,240
That's cool.

999
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,240
Wow.

1000
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,240
It's all free software.

1001
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:17,200
So on the phone, it's a little HTML5 app which calls out to the phone to find the GPS

1002
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,200
location.

1003
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,800
It's a battle bus.

1004
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:27,960
Yeah, once it gets the location – whenever the location changes, it sends a message over

1005
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:33,960
web sockets to our server and our server then updates the map as and when.

1006
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,800
And I've got a little – I've got a little button in the app just in case I drive somewhere

1007
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,680
that maybe I don't want people to know about.

1008
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,800
I can press a button that reverts it back to some other location.

1009
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,800
Wow.

1010
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,800
Yeah.

1011
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,080
Yeah, if I actually wander into a strip bar, I can make it say I'm in church or something.

1012
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,920
There were a few times where I was on the road trip where I was like – I got lost

1013
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:56,200
a couple of times and I'm like, damn it.

1014
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,600
If anybody's watching me right now, they're just – and I can't remember – I swear

1015
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,200
to God, it was somewhere in Montana where we got off the highway to get gas because

1016
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,800
once we got below a half a tank, we're like, we better fill up, especially in some of these

1017
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:11,720
places in Montana because there's no gas for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

1018
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,720
miles.

1019
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,920
It's ridiculous.

1020
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,160
And we pull off the freeway and, of course, the gas station was closed because it was

1021
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,760
after 9 o'clock.

1022
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:26,080
And what we realized quickly is only the main road right off the highway was paved.

1023
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,280
Everything else was gravel and like –

1024
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,280
Wow.

1025
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,960
And I ended up going around in circles trying to get out of this place and I'm thinking

1026
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,680
if anybody's watching me right now, I am in the middle of nowhere.

1027
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,160
What the hell is Chris doing?

1028
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,160
Yeah.

1029
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,160
I'm driving around on gravel roads.

1030
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,880
I must look like an idiot.

1031
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:44,480
So having that button built in to be able to just be like, never mind, that's a very

1032
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,480
–

1033
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,480
I'm at the last scene.

1034
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,480
Yeah.

1035
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,040
There's no attention to that.

1036
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,040
Yeah.

1037
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,000
I'm really excited about what OpenStreetMaps is doing.

1038
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So – well, hi there.

1039
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Hell, there.

1040
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,480
So now, Poppy, did I miss it?

1041
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,720
So you are using the OpenStreetMap data to power that?

1042
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,720
Yeah.

1043
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,160
The map is rendered on top of OpenStreetMap.

1044
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,160
I mean, from the phone.

1045
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,560
It's just a case of setting the latitude and longitude.

1046
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,560
It's nice.

1047
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,560
Why?

1048
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,560
And direction and speed as well.

1049
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:14,520
So I might have to – depending on how fast Martin goes, I might have to add a button

1050
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,520
that –

1051
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,520
Got nine points on my license.

1052
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,520
Yeah.

1053
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,520
So I strictly adhere to the speed.

1054
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,520
Right.

1055
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,520
Okay.

1056
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,520
So now you do.

1057
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,520
I don't need to worry about that.

1058
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,520
Now you do.

1059
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,520
A delay function that's in here.

1060
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,520
Yeah.

1061
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
Yeah.

1062
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,520
That's the other thing is if anybody was watching me, they would see that sometimes

1063
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,200
– they'd be looking at me going, you know, he's pulling a trailer.

1064
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,400
He shouldn't be going that fast because it tells you the exact speed I'm going to.

1065
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,560
And then it's like, yes, I'm doing 75.

1066
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,000
It's 80 miles per hour here.

1067
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Leave me alone.

1068
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Which, whatever.

1069
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Well, that's cool.

1070
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So there you go.

1071
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
That's a great idea, tracking that.

1072
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I think it's fun.

1073
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I think it's fun tracking it.

1074
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,840
I think I would love for the next road trip, I would love to use Track Car, T-R-A-C Car,

1075
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:54,400
because right now I'm using like a hardware device, which works fine because what's really

1076
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,160
nice about it is I just switch it on and all of a sudden it's working.

1077
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,640
But I would love to be able to use Track Car and just throw it on a digital ocean droplet.

1078
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,640
And I think –

1079
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,440
We can build that into a hardware device for you.

1080
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,440
You think?

1081
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,440
Like a Raspberry Pi?

1082
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,440
Yeah.

1083
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,440
Yeah.

1084
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,440
I'm looking right now.

1085
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,000
I'm betting they must use – they must use –

1086
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I believe they do.

1087
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I'm looking.

1088
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I don't see it.

1089
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
But I bet they use OpenStreetMaps.

1090
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I bet they do.

1091
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Wes, will you check?

1092
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I will check.

1093
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Will you check while you do that?

1094
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Tell you what.

1095
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,080
While you do that, I'll prep us for the next segment, which is – I've been really looking

1096
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,840
forward to it because right here we've got the Steam Link, which is this I'm excited

1097
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,720
about, but I think the Steam Link is going to need some testing.

1098
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,300
For those of you who are not familiar with the Steam Link, I'm sure you probably know.

1099
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:37,080
But it allows you to stream Windows games to this thing, or probably Linux games too,

1100
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,540
to this thing that's hooked up to your TV.

1101
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,320
It's kind of like on live but in your house.

1102
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,440
And it works.

1103
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,400
And then the thing that we're really – the thing that we're really excited about that's

1104
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,320
had a lot of different iterations is the Steam Controller.

1105
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:58,040
And now we have been told that beginning with Linux kernel 4.3, not only is Steam Controller

1106
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:02,560
support built in, but some significant fixes for like the Xbox 360 controller are also

1107
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,560
built in.

1108
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,120
Ooh, got to love that 360 controller.

1109
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,120
That's great.

1110
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,640
Yeah, well, if you don't like – if you don't like the Steam Controller, you might

1111
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,380
like the 360 controller.

1112
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:12,240
It's a decent controller, right?

1113
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:16,200
Built into Linux kernel 4.3, support for this built into Linux kernel 4.3.

1114
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,480
I however have Linux kernel 4.2.

1115
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,680
So we will see how it goes.

1116
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:24,480
We're going to unbox this, give you our first impressions of how the actual final product

1117
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,200
feels in our hands, take a look at it, hook it up to the arch rig here, and see if we

1118
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,380
can get it working.

1119
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:35,320
And if we can, I'll give you the fix that we tried to figure out ahead of time.

1120
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,960
We did come up with what we think it's going to take to make it work ahead of time.

1121
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,760
And if it does work, we'll share that – well, we're going to share it regardless in the

1122
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,760
show notes.

1123
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,760
Did you find it there?

1124
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,760
Oh, I'm looking for it right now.

1125
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,760
All right.

1126
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,760
Well, that's fine.

1127
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,800
I'm imagining TrackCar uses OpenStreetMouse, but I suppose they could use anything.

1128
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,800
Who knows?

1129
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,800
Who knows, Wes?

1130
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,800
I don't know.

1131
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,800
All right.

1132
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,800
But you know what I do know?

1133
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,800
I know that we're brought to you by our friends over at Linux Academy.

1134
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:00,040
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug – linuxacademy.com slash unplug to get our special discount.

1135
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:05,560
They just had a live event, a big one, where they announced a ton of stuff.

1136
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:09,720
Not only do they have a brand new CDN powering all of their content, not only do they have

1137
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:14,800
a beautiful new HTML5 player, and not only do they have tons of great stuff like their

1138
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,560
self-paced courses with instructor help available, their labs that are based on any of the distributions

1139
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,960
from 7Plus to choose from that you've chosen, their scenario-based training, and now their

1140
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,240
practice labs where you can go in there and actually be great on how you performed in

1141
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,240
the lab.

1142
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:33,120
Not just did you make NGINX start and serve up a webpage, but how well did you actually

1143
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,120
do it?

1144
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,120
That's in there now.

1145
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,040
Think about the technology required to make that work.

1146
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:42,080
7Plus distros – you choose the distro, your courseware automatically adjusts, your

1147
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:46,880
lab server automatically adjusts, and now they can help you see how you actually performed

1148
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,880
in there.

1149
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,720
Also, when you're ready to go take the big exam for whatever cert you're going for,

1150
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,720
they've got different modes now that really help you learn.

1151
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,040
If you have a little anxiety around testing, they've got some stuff that really helps

1152
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,040
with that.

1153
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,640
I also like – this is a huge component for me – the nuggets.

1154
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:06,000
Truth be told, sometimes I don't want to sit down and spend five hours to learn something.

1155
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,240
I want to spend about two hours, maybe I want to spend an hour at most, and I just want

1156
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,720
to deep dive on a topic.

1157
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,720
They've got those.

1158
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,680
They also have an availability planner.

1159
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:18,140
Now for somebody like me, I know that a couple of nights a week I've got some extra time.

1160
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:22,200
Other times during the week I'm a lot busier, especially when it comes to doing stuff with

1161
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,200
the kids.

1162
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,840
So what I can do with the availability selector is I go Tuesday nights I've got time, Thursday

1163
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,520
nights I've got time, Sunday night I've got time.

1164
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,440
And then Linux Academy will automatically generate courseware that matches my availability

1165
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,360
with reminders about exams and all of that.

1166
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:40,280
And then the best part is they have a community stacked full of your friends, Jupiter Broadcasting

1167
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:43,280
community members who I've been telling about this for a long time.

1168
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,080
They're over there now and they are passing these courses.

1169
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,160
They can give you a lift if you get down.

1170
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,600
They can give you tips and tricks.

1171
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,480
I hear from the folks at Linux Academy all the time about how well this works out.

1172
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,120
They're rolling out new technologies all the time.

1173
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,520
I'm going to start telling you about them over the next couple of weeks, but right now

1174
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,480
I want you to go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1175
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,320
They just upgraded a ton of stuff on their system, a massive rollout.

1176
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,200
All the technologies around Linux making Linux even better and all of the associated stack

1177
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,600
is all over there.

1178
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,680
This isn't one of your general learning sites where they're going to tell you how to have

1179
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:18,520
effective leadership communication, how to use Adobe After Effects and how to set up

1180
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,520
Apache.

1181
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,520
Because those sites suck at what they do.

1182
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,140
They try to do all of the things.

1183
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:27,160
They try to tell you how to fix your sync and how to use After Effects and how to use

1184
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,160
Linux.

1185
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,160
It doesn't work.

1186
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,240
There are people who truly know the subject matter, who are passionate about it, who are

1187
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:36,200
motivated to bring Linux to as many people as possible, who then decided, how do I achieve

1188
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,200
that goal?

1189
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,200
Well, I team up with developers.

1190
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,560
I team up with educators and then they created the Linux Academy platform.

1191
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,680
That's who you want to learn from because that passion translates to a deep, deep understanding

1192
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:50,120
of the root technology and following that technology's latest developments, which means

1193
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,400
you're getting the best education possible.

1194
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,020
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1195
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:57,920
Go take care of, go take advantage of our discount, go see what I've been talking about

1196
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,600
and now, go participate in the stacked community.

1197
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,200
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1198
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:07,360
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1199
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,840
You guys are rocking and that update is huge.

1200
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,440
And in fact, when you sign up, go into the community section and go read about the updates

1201
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,440
from Anthony.

1202
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,440
A lot of stuff there.

1203
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,940
I'm really, really impressed.

1204
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:20,280
Has somebody who feels like he's constantly running the rat race to produce the best content

1205
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,280
available?

1206
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,440
I am massively impressed because not only are they producing the content, they're also

1207
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,920
developing the platform to deliver it.

1208
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,920
I know.

1209
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,400
They're building the infrastructure at the same time as they update all of their guides,

1210
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,400
all of their tutorials.

1211
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,400
It blows my mind.

1212
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,400
It's very impressive.

1213
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,080
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring Unplugged

1214
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,080
program.

1215
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,080
Okay, Wes.

1216
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,680
Okay, so this is a big moment, Wes.

1217
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,960
I pre-ordered this a while ago.

1218
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:47,000
I'm really excited, but I invite you, sir, to unbox the Steam Controller.

1219
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Wow.

1220
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,080
It is a big moment, I know, I know, I know, but let's go for it.

1221
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,080
Are you ready?

1222
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,080
I am ready.

1223
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,080
Okay, Wes.

1224
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,080
Have at it here.

1225
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,080
You know what?

1226
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,080
I will work on the link.

1227
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,200
Now, I'm not as excited about the link.

1228
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,960
How destructive should I be here?

1229
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,280
Well, you can go for it.

1230
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,280
Just rip it.

1231
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,280
Let's just rip it.

1232
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,280
Let's just rip it.

1233
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,280
Let's just go for it.

1234
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,280
Let's just rip this top one here.

1235
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,280
That's what the audience wants.

1236
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,280
Yeah.

1237
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,280
Yeah.

1238
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,280
Yeah.

1239
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,280
All right.

1240
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,400
So, I'm getting some new smell off this.

1241
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,560
They got a nice dark blue box here.

1242
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,560
Yeah.

1243
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,560
Yeah, this is nice.

1244
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,040
Cute little controller icon on mine.

1245
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,040
Yeah.

1246
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,760
Oh, I don't have any cute icons.

1247
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:26,760
I have a steam icon.

1248
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,240
Here, I'm going to take your keys to get the tape.

1249
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,240
Please do.

1250
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:33,280
It's got a ring of tape on the outside of the box, and I'm going to cut through it now.

1251
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,080
Don't pass those back when you're done, Sid.

1252
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,080
So you see that?

1253
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,080
You got that same ring.

1254
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,080
It's a nice ring, actually.

1255
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,080
Yeah, very sturdy tape.

1256
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,080
All right.

1257
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,080
If that's any sign.

1258
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,520
Oh, there it is.

1259
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,520
Here's the link.

1260
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,520
I'm pulling it out now.

1261
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:51,840
I'd say it's about the size of a Roku 3, maybe even smaller, maybe even smaller.

1262
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,840
It's got...

1263
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,240
Oh, man, it smells so good.

1264
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,040
It smells like new stuff.

1265
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,040
All right.

1266
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,040
Oh.

1267
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,040
Oh, I got it open.

1268
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,040
Oh, here it is.

1269
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,040
Let me show you.

1270
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,040
I'll show it to the camera for those of you watching.

1271
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,040
Here it is.

1272
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,040
It's a nice little box.

1273
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,040
Yeah.

1274
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,040
There it is there.

1275
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,040
There it is right there.

1276
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,040
Okay, Wes.

1277
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,040
Take it out.

1278
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,040
Tell me how it feels.

1279
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,560
The link controller, the Steam Link, it's got two HDMI on the back, power, Ethernet,

1280
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,800
or I'm sorry, two USB on the back, power, Ethernet, and an HDMI out.

1281
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,280
Oh, this thing, it's light.

1282
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,280
It feels solid.

1283
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,280
It's solid, but light.

1284
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,280
It's light.

1285
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,280
All right.

1286
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,520
And it comes with a nice little wireless dongle here.

1287
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,520
All right.

1288
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,520
Okay.

1289
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,520
You ready?

1290
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,520
Yeah.

1291
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,520
Let's get this hooked up.

1292
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,520
All right.

1293
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,520
So we're going to put batteries in it.

1294
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,520
Interesting.

1295
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,520
Interesting.

1296
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,520
It's got a nice battery snap off in the back.

1297
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,520
It's got like a set little switch at the bottom.

1298
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,600
Like a bat wing almost.

1299
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,160
Nicer than your average TV remote.

1300
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,320
So one battery goes in each side of the controller, it looks like.

1301
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,320
Right?

1302
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,320
That'll give a little heft.

1303
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,320
Yeah.

1304
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,320
Here, Wes.

1305
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,320
I'll let you...

1306
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,320
You do that.

1307
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,320
I think that goes in there.

1308
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:53,800
It comes with a USB receiver with the Steam logo on it.

1309
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,800
Here.

1310
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,800
I don't think the camera...

1311
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,760
I don't think that shows up on the camera.

1312
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,760
That's too bad.

1313
01:17:58,760 --> 01:17:59,760
It's got the Steam logo on it.

1314
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,760
I like that.

1315
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,760
All right, Wes.

1316
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,760
I'm going to go...

1317
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,760
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to plug this in.

1318
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,760
You know what I should do?

1319
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,760
Do it.

1320
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,760
Hold on.

1321
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,760
Before I do it, I'm going to bring up dMessage.

1322
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,760
And then we'll...

1323
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,760
Let's watch this live.

1324
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,760
Yeah.

1325
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,760
Then we'll pull...

1326
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,760
Then we'll run dMessage afterwards, too.

1327
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:13,760
Okay?

1328
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,400
So dMessage is up.

1329
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,760
And here, I'll bring it up on the screen.

1330
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,760
So there's dMessage.

1331
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,760
And there's...

1332
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,400
Now, that's before I plug in.

1333
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,400
Now I'm going to plug in.

1334
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,400
All right.

1335
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,400
All right.

1336
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,400
All right.

1337
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,400
All right.

1338
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,400
I just plugged in the Steam controller.

1339
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,440
I'm going to run dMessage again.

1340
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,360
Oh, we got some new stuff.

1341
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,360
Okay.

1342
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,360
USB HID device.

1343
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,360
Valve software Steam controller.

1344
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,360
Oh, you see that?

1345
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,200
It says Valve software Steam controller.

1346
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,520
I don't know if this is in all the way.

1347
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,760
You can kind of feel it in the back there.

1348
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,240
Oh, it doesn't feel like it's in all the way.

1349
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,240
Oh, no.

1350
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,240
Those are levers.

1351
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,240
That's what I thought.

1352
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,240
Okay.

1353
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:46,240
Yeah.

1354
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,240
Those are levers.

1355
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,240
What's going on, though?

1356
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,240
Oh, it just beeped.

1357
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,240
Did you hear that?

1358
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,240
It beeped at us, guys.

1359
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,240
Did you hear that?

1360
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,240
Okay.

1361
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,240
All right.

1362
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,240
That's cool.

1363
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,240
All right.

1364
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,240
So that's cool.

1365
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,240
So something just happened with the Steam controller.

1366
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,600
I'm saying I'm not freaking out, but the Steam logo has lit up in the middle of the

1367
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,600
controller now.

1368
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,560
I might be freaking out a little bit right now.

1369
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,560
It's actually happening.

1370
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,240
Oh, wow, Wes.

1371
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,240
The smell is intoxicating.

1372
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:10,240
Wes, run your thumb along the Gabe nipple pad right there.

1373
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,240
Do you feel that?

1374
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,240
Oh, yeah.

1375
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,240
It's got haptic feedback.

1376
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,240
It's quite haptic.

1377
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,240
Yeah.

1378
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,240
Okay.

1379
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:20,880
So we're going to launch Race the Sun, and I'd say it feels a little heavier than the

1380
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:21,880
Xbox.

1381
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,840
So those of you who have used the Xbox 360 controller, I'd say it feels a little bit

1382
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,600
heavier than the Xbox 360 controller.

1383
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,920
The X, Y, A, and B buttons do not light up.

1384
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,240
The Steam button is blinking.

1385
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:36,640
Oh, I was supposed to go into big picture mode, I think, wasn't I?

1386
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,400
I think I was supposed to go into big picture mode after this.

1387
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,840
Try to get the firmware up there.

1388
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,200
Yeah, yeah, because nothing's happening in the game at the moment.

1389
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,200
All right.

1390
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,200
All right.

1391
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,200
So we'll jump out, and we'll go into Steam big picture mode.

1392
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,520
I mean, this might not work without it, but yeah, we'll see.

1393
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,520
We'll see.

1394
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,840
This might be as far as we get, Wes, right here.

1395
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,840
We may have...

1396
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,240
The kernel's working hard for us.

1397
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,240
All right.

1398
01:19:54,240 --> 01:20:01,160
So we'll go into big picture mode, and yeah, so there's big picture mode.

1399
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,480
All right.

1400
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,860
So welcome to Steam from your couch.

1401
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,080
Nothing's happening, though.

1402
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,080
Nothing's happening.

1403
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,080
Oh, hold on.

1404
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,080
Update.

1405
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,080
Okay.

1406
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,080
Look at that.

1407
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,440
We can update the firmware on the Steam controller right now.

1408
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,440
Do it.

1409
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,440
Live update, everyone.

1410
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,440
All right.

1411
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,440
Update Steam controller firmware.

1412
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,400
The new firmware is being installed on the controller.

1413
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,280
Well, so then we must be communicating with it.

1414
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,280
Yeah, definitely.

1415
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,280
Yeah, so that's a good sign.

1416
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,960
Or it's chosen one of your devices to flash with the Steam firmware, and it's just brick

1417
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:27,960
now.

1418
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,000
It's overriding my S6 over Bluetooth right now.

1419
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
All right.

1420
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,360
Well, cool.

1421
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:37,280
So I guess that means then if it's seeing this, then the Udev rule that we added to

1422
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,400
my system must be working.

1423
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,400
Must be working.

1424
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,000
Your user has permission to update the firmware.

1425
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,480
So there was two things we had to do to make this work on a non-4.3 kernel.

1426
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,360
It'll be different for your distribution, and I have it linked in the show notes.

1427
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,000
But number one is we created a Udev rule.

1428
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Oh, hey, look.

1429
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
It's done.

1430
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Whoa.

1431
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Yeah, and it vibrated the controller.

1432
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,580
And I am now operating this big picture mode with the controller.

1433
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,460
This is happening right now.

1434
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:01,720
Let's go try Race the Sun.

1435
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:02,720
Okay, here we go.

1436
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,720
We're going to play.

1437
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,720
Oh, I'm excited.

1438
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:07,560
We're going to play Race the Sun with the Steam controller.

1439
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,600
So anyways, Udev rule got added, and then my user account, my chrisf user, had to be

1440
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,560
added to the Steam group, which it already was by default.

1441
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,560
So okay.

1442
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:19,760
I don't know what I actually hit to launch the game.

1443
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,060
That would be the big question.

1444
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:25,640
So I'm going to say, I'm just going to use the...

1445
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,640
All right, here we go.

1446
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,640
Here we go.

1447
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,640
All right.

1448
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,640
Are you ready, Wes?

1449
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,640
Let's see if this works.

1450
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,640
So nothing's happening.

1451
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,640
It does not work.

1452
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,640
It does not work.

1453
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:34,640
Nothing's happening.

1454
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,120
This game may not support it.

1455
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,040
It had a controller icon.

1456
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,040
No, it did.

1457
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,040
It did.

1458
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,040
It did.

1459
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,040
All right.

1460
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,040
So here, I'll jump out.

1461
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:46,400
I have no idea what I'm doing, though, because maybe I have to go in somewhere.

1462
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,400
So here's something that's interesting.

1463
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,400
I don't know if you noticed this.

1464
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,400
In fact, I'll jump back to the big picture mode here.

1465
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,560
You see how it has, in game, it has a controller icon.

1466
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,560
Yes, it does.

1467
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:56,560
Yeah.

1468
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,160
So I think it does support the Steam controller, but I just have to mess with it a little bit

1469
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,160
more.

1470
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,560
The creators of this game have made an interface that requires a keyboard and a mouse.

1471
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,560
Oh.

1472
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,560
Oh, okay.

1473
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,560
So I picked the absolute wrong game.

1474
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,560
But it's such a good game.

1475
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,440
A little pop-up showed up a couple seconds after we were on the page that said it doesn't

1476
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,760
work with Steam controller.

1477
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,200
You see how it has a little controller icon there?

1478
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,200
Yeah, I do like that.

1479
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,200
Yeah.

1480
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,200
Which almost is accurate.

1481
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,200
Yeah.

1482
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:20,980
So it does still emulate keyboard and mouse if you go to the manage game menu, configure,

1483
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:21,980
and pick a template.

1484
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:22,980
Yeah.

1485
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:23,980
So expert tips here.

1486
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:24,980
Thank you.

1487
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:25,980
Manage game menu.

1488
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:26,980
So where do I go here?

1489
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:27,980
Yeah.

1490
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:28,980
Open up your game, or go to the game tile.

1491
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:29,980
Okay.

1492
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,480
And then, oh, I have to manage it for each game, is what you're saying?

1493
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,480
Yep.

1494
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,480
Since each game could have different mappings.

1495
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,480
Oh.

1496
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,480
Oh, I see.

1497
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,280
So I go here to manage game, configure controller.

1498
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,280
Ah-ha-ha.

1499
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,280
Yes.

1500
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,280
I see.

1501
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,280
Yeah.

1502
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,280
I see.

1503
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,280
Okay.

1504
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,280
All right.

1505
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,280
All right.

1506
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,280
Hmm.

1507
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,280
I think I will play with that after the show.

1508
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,280
That'd be nice, though, if they just had some controller presets for some of the more

1509
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,280
popular games.

1510
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,320
Well, they definitely do, actually.

1511
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,320
And users can contribute.

1512
01:22:54,320 --> 01:23:01,000
In fact, I already contributed a controller scheme for Shovel Knight.

1513
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
So I can...

1514
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Oh, okay.

1515
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
So here I go.

1516
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,480
I'm going to browse controller configs, and then I can say, this controller configuration

1517
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:11,000
is recommended for this game.

1518
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,280
And so then I think it...

1519
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,280
I think it just loaded it.

1520
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,280
I'm not sure.

1521
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,280
So I'll browse configs.

1522
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,280
Select.

1523
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,280
Okay.

1524
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,280
I'm selecting this config.

1525
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,520
And now I'm going to save this config.

1526
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,520
All with the controller.

1527
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,520
Yeah.

1528
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:25,520
I'm doing this all with the controller.

1529
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,540
Now I'm saying I'm done.

1530
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:29,520
So should I try playing it and see what happens?

1531
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,520
Do it.

1532
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,520
All right.

1533
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,960
So now I don't know exactly...

1534
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,240
I didn't actually study what all the buttons are supposed to be.

1535
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,520
Yeah, Kitson, you can ask a question.

1536
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:39,520
Go ahead.

1537
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,520
Yeah.

1538
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:41,520
North Ranger.

1539
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:47,560
You said that there is some per application controls in Steam regarding the Steam controller.

1540
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:52,720
Could you set that up to work with like an NES simulator or something of that nature

1541
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,620
outside of Steam?

1542
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:57,320
To be honest, I haven't gotten that far yet.

1543
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:01,800
Everyone that I've played with has been through the Steam client because the Steam overlay

1544
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:09,280
or the Steam big picture mode is required to emulate non gamepad activities.

1545
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,640
So when I go into configure controller, let's see.

1546
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,640
For a keyboard mouse only game, you probably have to go to the templates when you're browsing

1547
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,640
configs.

1548
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:18,640
Yeah.

1549
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:23,560
And choose the keyboard WASD template instead of a gamepad.

1550
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,560
Okay.

1551
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,000
Oh, I see.

1552
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Community templates.

1553
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:33,400
And then you say keyboard WASD and mouse.

1554
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,400
So let's see.

1555
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,400
Yeah.

1556
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,400
Yeah.

1557
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,400
All right.

1558
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,400
I can give it a shot.

1559
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,400
I'll give this a shot.

1560
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,400
This does seem a little...

1561
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,400
It's nice that these are available, I guess, right?

1562
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,120
That's kind of a nice thing.

1563
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,120
But I feel like...

1564
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,000
I don't know.

1565
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,480
You're wishing it had just worked.

1566
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,840
Well, I kind of wish by default it would just work.

1567
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:51,840
Yeah.

1568
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,840
But that's okay.

1569
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,840
It doesn't have to, I suppose.

1570
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,640
Because it just takes the Race of the Sun guys one update.

1571
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,640
Yeah.

1572
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,200
And they seem to update pretty often.

1573
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,360
So I'm moving the mouse now.

1574
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,800
I'm moving the mouse around with the Steam controller.

1575
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:04,800
Hey, that's a good start.

1576
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,280
And it feels really good, actually.

1577
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,280
So that's actually...

1578
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,280
That's working for me quite a bit.

1579
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,280
All right.

1580
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,280
So I'm going to launch the game.

1581
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,280
And we'll give it one more try.

1582
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,240
We'll see if I can blow up or if I can actually drive.

1583
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,240
Wow.

1584
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,240
Look at me moving the mouse.

1585
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,200
That's cool.

1586
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,760
But still not moving the guy, though.

1587
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,240
I'm still not moving the guy.

1588
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:23,200
So out of the box, it didn't move the guy.

1589
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,200
And we're dead.

1590
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,200
Yeah.

1591
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,200
You tried, Chris.

1592
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,200
Yeah.

1593
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,200
I did.

1594
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,200
I can move the mouse now.

1595
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,200
So that's an improvement at least.

1596
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,520
But I still have some work to go, I guess.

1597
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,040
Well, I'll keep playing with it.

1598
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,040
You know, it feels...

1599
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,040
Wes, give it another go.

1600
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,840
I mean, it feels pretty good in the hand, though, don't you think?

1601
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,840
It does feel pretty good.

1602
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,840
You know, they've got the...

1603
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,840
I don't know what to call them.

1604
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:43,960
The input pads are at the slight upward angle, so you can kind of rest with how your thumbs

1605
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:44,960
lay.

1606
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:45,960
Yeah.

1607
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,920
Oh, the triggers on the back, too, are very...

1608
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,920
They're nice.

1609
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:49,920
Yeah.

1610
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:50,920
They're kind of like...

1611
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:51,920
They've got a weight to them.

1612
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,400
I don't know what the weight of them and triggers are.

1613
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,400
What do you think of that?

1614
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,200
I'm not sure what I would use that for.

1615
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,720
Maybe shifting between different ammo or something like that.

1616
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,360
It seems like it would work well for a driving game.

1617
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:03,400
It kind of is like the paddle shifters on the expensive race cars.

1618
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,400
Yeah.

1619
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,400
Yeah.

1620
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,400
Yeah, exactly.

1621
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,400
Yeah.

1622
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,400
It feels like a pretty high-quality controller.

1623
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:12,000
Oh, but I will say the mouse emulation is really accurate.

1624
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Yeah.

1625
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
It feels really...

1626
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Like it's really glued to your finger.

1627
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,280
It moves fast when you want it to.

1628
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,280
I could use that in place of the mouse.

1629
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,280
But it's got the fine control.

1630
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,280
Yeah.

1631
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,280
Oh, yeah.

1632
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,280
Yeah.

1633
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,840
I could use that in Portal mode or even just if you could use it to control your mouse

1634
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:24,920
on the native screen.

1635
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,000
I would use that from the couch, no problem.

1636
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Yeah.

1637
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I don't know if I have a game...

1638
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,840
I don't know if I have a game that would have it supported by default or not.

1639
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,440
Portal 2 is an excellent example of built-in controls.

1640
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,440
I wonder what I have.

1641
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,440
I will...

1642
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,440
How do I get out of big picture mode?

1643
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,440
Oh, you can just...

1644
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,720
Oh, in big picture mode, you can view just installed games.

1645
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,720
All right.

1646
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,140
So I've got BioShock installed, Distance.

1647
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:47,800
Well, of course, I've got Race of the Sun.

1648
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,120
I don't see Portal though.

1649
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:53,840
I wonder what about Trine?

1650
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,000
I'll have to play around with this and see because there's...

1651
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,760
And the other thing is I wonder how it works in conjunction with the Link as well.

1652
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,720
That's another area I have a lot of questions about.

1653
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,720
Oh, I know.

1654
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:07,320
That'll be really exciting for people who already have nice gaming rigs and just want

1655
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,120
to, you know, bring it to the living room.

1656
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,120
Yeah.

1657
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,120
So there you go.

1658
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,120
That will be our...

1659
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,120
Just for...

1660
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,120
And it will be done.

1661
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:15,120
I know because some people, they can't stand all the Steam talk.

1662
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,120
I know.

1663
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,120
So there you go.

1664
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,080
There's our Valve update right there.

1665
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,160
We talked about it.

1666
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,160
We unboxed it.

1667
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,800
The Steam controller is real.

1668
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:23,800
It's here.

1669
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,520
Did you talk about the community key maps?

1670
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:27,520
Using a Steam controller.

1671
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,520
Look at this.

1672
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,560
Please run Steam in big picture mode to make full use of your controller.

1673
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,920
Well, at least it tells us.

1674
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,440
I was just looking at some of the community key maps actually.

1675
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:35,440
Those are pretty nice.

1676
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:40,080
That's an awesome system that if there's a game that doesn't support it, you can build

1677
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,680
it and then share it.

1678
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,680
Yeah, that is really cool.

1679
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:50,720
And I bet within one week, all of the games I play will have tons of different profiles.

1680
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:53,520
So is that new with the Steam controller?

1681
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:54,520
Yeah.

1682
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,520
Okay.

1683
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,520
Wow.

1684
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,040
I hope that that infrastructure is extended to support other controller layouts too.

1685
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,040
It feels...

1686
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,040
It could be nice with the 360.

1687
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,040
It feels like...

1688
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,040
It probably will.

1689
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,040
Oh, yeah.

1690
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,040
Right?

1691
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,040
Because there's some games where it's like, well, I know I could make this config, but

1692
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,040
why doesn't Steam do it?

1693
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:09,480
Well, they wrote the compatibility list stuff for the 360 anyway, so it makes sense if they

1694
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:10,480
had the...

1695
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,000
That'd be perfect.

1696
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,300
What I was kind of curious about was could the Steam controller become the Linux user's

1697
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,600
default game pad that...

1698
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,360
So right now on Linux, when people write into the show or when we're talking about a game

1699
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:28,360
controller, we always have to say, well, if you really want the best game controller for

1700
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,360
Linux...

1701
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,600
Buy this Microsoft product.

1702
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,600
Yeah.

1703
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,600
And doesn't that feel a little weird?

1704
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,600
A little bit, yeah.

1705
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,600
I mean, it's a great controller, but...

1706
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,600
Yeah.

1707
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,600
It's a little weird though.

1708
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,600
So I'm hoping...

1709
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,280
Or buy this Logitech that pretends to be a Microsoft.

1710
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,280
Yeah, exactly.

1711
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1712
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:46,520
I'm hoping that this becomes the really solid recommendation that is also just a damn good

1713
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:50,560
controller too, not just the fact that it's wireless, not just the fact that it has built-in

1714
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,240
kernel support, not just the fact that VAL's behind it.

1715
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,720
Yeah, not just the VAL factor.

1716
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,520
But the fact that it's a really good controller, and so...

1717
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,440
Plus the box is really pretty that it comes in.

1718
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,440
I just want to...

1719
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,440
You should keep the box.

1720
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,440
I think my initial...

1721
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,440
Put it up on your...

1722
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,440
I should.

1723
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,440
I actually should.

1724
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,440
You're right.

1725
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,440
I should.

1726
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,440
My initial impressions are pretty good, but I'm going to keep playing with it the rest

1727
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,240
of the week, and I'll talk about more in Friday's Linux action show.

1728
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:11,400
Or Ubuntu 15.10 and Friday's Linux...

1729
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,400
Oh, look at this.

1730
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,760
The packaging has like a layer-by-layer breakout.

1731
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:15,760
Yeah, they did like a...

1732
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,200
Probably pretty hard to see on the stream, but you can kind of see how the controller

1733
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,200
is constructed.

1734
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,440
Yeah, they did like a schematics breakdown on there.

1735
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,440
That's really cool.

1736
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,440
That is...

1737
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,440
That's neat.

1738
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,080
It's neat to have the first generation of this too.

1739
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,080
I like that.

1740
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:32,920
And I was looking at the price, so you were asking on the pre-show how much it was?

1741
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:33,920
It looks like it was $49.99.

1742
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:34,920
Oh, hey, that's not too bad.

1743
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:35,920
No, that's not too bad.

1744
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:36,920
$49.99 is not too bad for that.

1745
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:43,480
So, I'll give it some more testing, and on Friday's Linux action show, I'll have more

1746
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,480
thoughts on the matter.

1747
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,480
Mumble room, any other...

1748
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,480
Don't mind me.

1749
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,480
Look at that.

1750
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,480
Look at that.

1751
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,760
And now I have three mice on this Bonobo.

1752
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:54,520
I've got the trackpad, the actual mouse, and now I've got the Steam controller.

1753
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:57,440
Oh, so it is just picking it up as a mouse on your desktop.

1754
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,440
Yeah, you're just...

1755
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,440
Yeah, you're using my desktop there.

1756
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,440
Yeah.

1757
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:01,440
Yeah.

1758
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,560
This seems like a great pairing as well, if you have like a Steam slash Kodi box or...

1759
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:09,280
That's what I was just thinking, is upstairs in my office, I'll often watch TV shows on

1760
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:14,080
my Linux rig, and I use Unified Remote to be able to control it from my Android device,

1761
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,640
but now I could just use it...

1762
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,200
Yeah, you don't have to unlock it, you don't have to just grab it.

1763
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,200
Yeah.

1764
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,200
I could just use it as a regular controller.

1765
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,200
Yep.

1766
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,200
That is really cool.

1767
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,920
I'm really excited, and we won't spend all of the Linux action show this Friday because

1768
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,480
it's going to be our Boon 2 review, but I'll give you an update on what it's like to actually

1769
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,640
use it with a few games and with a few profiles and stuff like that.

1770
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,960
So, yeah, it's an exploded view.

1771
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:34,960
Exactly, Lord.

1772
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,640
That's exactly what it is on the box.

1773
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:40,040
And I'd be curious if you've gotten one, what your experiences are, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1774
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:44,240
Heck, linuxactionshow.reddit.com is a great place to go to give us feedback on this particular

1775
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,400
topic or anything else.

1776
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:49,400
Somebody in the Mamba Room have something they want to shut in before we wrap up?

1777
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,280
I heard somebody open up their mic.

1778
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,280
You're welcome to.

1779
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,280
No?

1780
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,280
Okay, all right.

1781
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,280
We're friendly, we promise.

1782
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,320
OpenFaustrain, we'll have the link in the show notes, and that, right there, will signal

1783
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:00,040
the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged Show.

1784
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:01,400
Thank you very much for joining us, Mamba Room.

1785
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:02,520
We'd love to have you guys join us.

1786
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:07,720
Go over to jblive.tv for the live show, or even better, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash

1787
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:08,720
calendar.

1788
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,760
Find when we're doing Linux Unplugged and join us in our virtual lug.

1789
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,080
We really do treat it that way.

1790
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,440
This is the community's lug, man.

1791
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,440
We love it.

1792
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:18,160
And if you can't make it to a local one in your area, at least attend a virtual one.

1793
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,080
Or even if you can, why not supplement it with our virtual one?

1794
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:24,160
We don't judge, we're friendly, and it's the only bite when you ask.

1795
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,160
That's true.

1796
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,600
And honestly, honestly, we love the conversation.

1797
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:28,600
jblive.tv, join us.

1798
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:32,880
You can hang out in the chat room, or if you can't catch us live, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1799
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,880
All right, everybody.

1800
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,360
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1801
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:59,400
See you back here next week.

1802
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:15,880
Thank you, everybody.

1803
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:16,880
Great show.

1804
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:17,880
Good stuff.

1805
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:18,880
Lots to cover this week.

1806
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:19,880
It's all over the place.

1807
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:20,880
It was going to be a hard one to title.

1808
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,040
Boy, this Steam link is really solid.

1809
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,040
Feel that thing.

1810
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,040
It feels like a solid piece of...

1811
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,040
Oh, yeah.

1812
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,480
It's like an external hard drive, but kind of even more dense.

1813
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,480
Yeah, it's very dense.

1814
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:32,040
JBtitles.com, let's pick a title.

1815
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,800
That thing looks like you could throw it across the room and it'll still work.

1816
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,600
Yeah, it would put a hole through the wall.

1817
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:37,600
HDMI.

1818
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,600
Ethernet.

1819
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,600
Reminds me of the Super Nintendo.

1820
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,400
Does anybody remember that beast?

1821
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,400
Oh, yeah.

1822
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,400
Oh, yeah.

1823
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,400
Of course.

1824
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,400
Yeah.

1825
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,400
I've started using Firefox on my Android phone because it's better than Chrome.

1826
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,400
Really?

1827
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,400
On the Android?

1828
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:51,400
It's a ton better.

1829
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,400
What's better?

1830
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,600
Even Chrome people love it more.

1831
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,600
Really?

1832
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,600
Really?

1833
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,520
Versus Chrome on the Android there.

1834
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,200
So Chrome on the Android basically does nothing.

1835
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,200
Android does everything you need it to do.

1836
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,200
It has add-ons.

1837
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:08,080
It has, you know, good tabbing structure.

1838
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,080
It's not...

1839
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,080
And how's the sync with the desktop?

1840
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,080
It's not incredibly limited.

1841
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,080
It works fine.

1842
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,080
Perfect.

1843
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,080
Yeah, it works fine.

1844
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,080
Nice.

1845
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:16,560
It has an actual quit extension.

1846
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,560
I want to...

1847
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,000
What's a quit extension?

1848
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,640
You can even install Android, the add-on for LastPass.

1849
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:23,640
Great, right?

1850
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:24,640
Yay!

1851
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,640
Finally.

1852
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,640
I can finally...

1853
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:27,640
Oh, good.

1854
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:28,640
Good.

1855
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,640
Bit late for that.

1856
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:30,640
Yeah.

1857
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,640
Yeah.

1858
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:32,640
Yeah.

1859
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:38,960
I have a theory as to why Chrome is kind of bare bones in Android.

1860
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,600
They don't want you blocking content.

1861
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,440
For instance, Firefox has add-ons for ad control.

1862
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:51,200
Since Google's an ad company, it would make sense that they wouldn't want to build an

1863
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:56,440
add-on system because they don't want people creating ad blockers.

1864
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:01,320
Yeah, but then do you think they'd really be willing to make one of their most important

1865
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:03,560
products less competitive?

1866
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,320
On mobile, I think they're willing to do it.

1867
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:09,560
I don't think they're willing to do it on desktop because otherwise Chrome wouldn't

1868
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,520
be able to compete on the desktop.

1869
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,520
Yeah, but there's just features...

1870
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:18,240
They've got the advantage of being pre-installed on Android, so why would you bother installing

1871
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:20,400
another browser in the same way?

1872
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,760
The only reason why people install other browsers on Windows is because the one that comes with

1873
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,480
it is crap on Android.

1874
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,240
The one that comes with it is pretty decent.

1875
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:28,720
Well, no, it's crap.

1876
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,860
It's basically edge.

1877
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:32,160
It's limited.

1878
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:33,160
It works.

1879
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:37,120
It has support for standards, but pretty much it's limited crap.

1880
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:41,720
So on the platform where they are the incumbent browser, they're the least competitive.

1881
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,560
That isn't that interesting.

1882
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,560
Isn't that just exactly what Microsoft...

1883
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,520
Well, their only real competition is Firefox, right?

1884
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,720
That's exactly what Microsoft did.

1885
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:51,080
As soon as they're an explorer became the incumbent browser, they just got nice and

1886
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,080
lazy, didn't they?

1887
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,080
Yeah.

1888
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:56,200
Is it sad that I've actually been using Safari pretty regularly now?

1889
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,200
Safari?

1890
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,200
Yes, on my phone.

1891
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,200
Wow.

1892
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,200
It totally is.

1893
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,360
I'm also going to use it on the iPhone because everything else is...

1894
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,360
Chrome.

1895
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,360
You can get Chrome.

1896
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:05,360
Yeah, I know, but...

1897
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:09,320
Chrome is actually a little bit nicer on the iPhone than on Android, actually, just comparison.

1898
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:13,240
You can't really make it your default browser, though.

1899
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:16,800
You can use it, and you can copy URLs, and some apps even have support if they detect

1900
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,880
you have Chrome installed because they can do the URL hand...

1901
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,680
All the Google apps will actually map you to Chrome instead of to Safari.

1902
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:23,680
Yeah, exactly.

1903
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:28,480
But otherwise, Safari is the default browser.

1904
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,480
Actually Safari on iOS 9 doesn't seem to be that bad, but...

1905
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,480
No, it's pretty okay.

1906
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,560
Yeah, it is interesting.

1907
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:58,680
State of Chrome.
