1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Microsoft's done it again. They've open sourced another project.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,600
Oh, is it big this time?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,000
I think so.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, let's see if we can figure it out. Don't tell us what it is.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I got one hint for you.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,600
Okay.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:18,200
Part of the reason Microsoft says it's open sourcing X is the changing state of work.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,900
Oh, it's probably something to do with Teams then. That sounds very Teamsy.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,500
There may be a Teams connection.

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,900
Hmm, have they open sourced something in with Skype that wasn't open sourced before?

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,400
That's my guess. You boys have a guess? You got anything?

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,200
I think it's an open cookbook. It sounds like maybe that's the state of work that's changing.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,500
I'm going to go with open sourcing the Windows kernel.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,200
Whoa, that's bold.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,500
That would really change the face of work. That would really change the industry.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,800
That would be history right now.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,300
I wish.

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,600
All right, so what is it?

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
It had a 1500 3D emoji sound.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:05,700
Emojis?

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,000
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,700
My name is Chris.

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,700
My name is Wes.

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,900
My name is Brent.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,300
My name is Alex.

26
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Hello you handsome devils coming up on the show this week.

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,100
Well, we blew it.

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,100
We knew it was going to happen.

29
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,300
We warned you this was going to happen.

30
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,100
This is your chance to say I told you so.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,300
Our little server, our humble garage box has died again.

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,300
Join us this week as we attempt to save our little zombie server.

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,600
Bring it back from the death and this time we may be looking at data loss.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,100
So we'll lay out what we're going to do in the future and our plans going forward.

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,900
Then we'll round out the show with some great JB news, some boosts and picks and more.

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,700
So before we go any further, let's bring in our virtual lug.

37
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,100
Time appropriate greetings.

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,700
Mumble room.

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,600
Hello friends.

40
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,100
Hello.

41
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,600
Hello.

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,100
Hello guys.

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,000
Hello Wes.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,300
Hello Alex and Brent.

45
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,600
Hello.

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,500
Hello on air.

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Hello quiet listening.

48
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,600
We offer both to our mumble room.

49
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,600
If you'd like to just join and get a low latency open stream, you absolutely can.

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,800
And of course, you're always welcome to get in that on listening and share your thoughts with us as we go live.

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,100
The only thing we do is we just kind of like check to make sure you got a mic that works for us.

52
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,100
And as long as it passes the sniff test, which is actually a listen test, we'll put you on air

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
and you can get in that virtual lug.

54
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,400
And of course, you can always jump in.

55
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,200
Just tag me in the chat room and I'll try to work into the conversation.

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,800
Sometime, you know, eventually mumble get those smells via wire, but we're not there yet.

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,900
I have been using the heck out of tail scale this weekend.

58
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,300
So go over to tailscale.com and say good morning from Linux Unplugged.

59
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,900
Would you?

60
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,800
Tail scale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard.

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,600
Get it on any device in seconds.

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,800
And I mean it. Mobile, armed device, x86 box, VM, VPS.

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,300
Do it. Build yourself a mesh network with WireGuard.

64
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,800
We love it.

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,300
It'll change your game.

66
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,100
Go say good morning.

67
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,500
Try it out for 20 devices for free at tailscale.com.

68
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,400
Yeah, I wish you'd stop making me time you setting up tail scale.

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,900
It's getting old. You're fast.

70
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,000
I get it. It's fun.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
It's fun. All right.

72
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,700
So let me take you all back in time a little bit.

73
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,800
Years ago, we identified that sometimes there are just certain jobs that work better locally.

74
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Perhaps it's an old archive of your past productions.

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,200
You want to save the raw files.

76
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,400
Maybe it's movies you've backed up via the DVD or the blu-ray.

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,000
Love you. Make MKV.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,100
Or maybe it's just something that's really not something your team needs access to very often.

79
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,900
So it just doesn't make sense to store it in the cloud.

80
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,600
My friends enter in our legacy server hardware,

81
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,000
which we have been running out of the garage here at the studio since about 2014 ish.

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,100
We bought the box used at the time and it's been serving a lot of great little duties for us.

83
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,200
Then within the last year,

84
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,400
we had a couple of very generous audience members donate us brand new used server hardware new to us.

85
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,300
And we jumped into action.

86
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,100
And moved some of the services over.

87
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,800
It's been a process an ongoing process you might say.

88
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, and we've gone through several summers where this box gets really hot

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,600
and we've tried to come up with various solutions because it is a garage that the afternoon sun hits

90
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,500
and every now and then I pull in there with my hot car too.

91
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,200
And so sometimes the ambient temperature can be 95 degrees.

92
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,000
So we've come up with various strategies over the years to try to accommodate for this high temperature

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
less than ideal production environment.

94
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,200
We get the palm leaves. We take turns in there. It's rough.

95
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,000
So I've set up this year. What I did was like a whole air cooling system.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,100
I created a holistic approach to my temperature management Wes.

97
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,500
I cracked the garage door.

98
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,400
Okay. All right.

99
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,000
And then I set a box fan in the doorway.

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,200
Oh, we've got some we've got you know outside airflow.

101
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,400
These are good ingredients.

102
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,100
Then further down the hallway.

103
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:07,300
I set up a second box fan and then for like the real like cooling like finality piece.

104
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,800
I opened the back door.

105
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,900
So I create a cross breeze through the entire house.

106
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,500
It creates a wind tunnel that sucks the hot air out of the garage

107
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,900
and vents it out the back of the studio and it actually does work to a degree

108
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:34,500
and it's ridiculous because a cat came in and pissed in the garage traditional hazards that are most servers encounter.

109
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,500
No and and this will come into play later.

110
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Also, there was a lot of you know,

111
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
when cotton trees bloom and there's like this cotton that goes in the air in the Pacific.

112
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
It's like it's snowing for a day.

113
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:56,300
Well, a lot of that came into the wind tunnel.

114
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:07,000
The entire garage got covered in cotton flowers rolling around in the cat piss getting in the server stuck in the cat piss has really happened.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,400
So it's coming in.

116
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm picturing this cartoon with you know,

117
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,400
the chicken that falls into tar or something and then people throw feathers at it.

118
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,300
Yeah, then Levi got in there fast forward to last week Thursday.

119
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:29,100
I realize it's getting hot again and even that particularly hot just kind of back to hot hot enough that the garage is getting warm.

120
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,900
And so my protocol is around one two o'clock right about now actually as we record I would shut the server down

121
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,400
because the temperatures are just getting too high and we don't have a better solution than that with what I've done.

122
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
And I would shut it down and then we wouldn't use it for a bit.

123
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,000
So I migrated a couple of of more essential services off each individual server up on the Linode

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,200
and I kind of kind of spread things out.

125
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,800
So like certain batch jobs are happening on one server like the the plaques

126
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,600
and the jellyfin media has happened on one server like I've kind of spread the load out a little bit.

127
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,500
So if one box dies not everything goes and then I would shut them down in like right about now.

128
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,700
And then the next day in the morning I get in about 7 a.m.

129
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,900
And I turn them on and run them till about 1 p.m.

130
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,200
You know, let them get caught up on their work and whatnot do their backups.

131
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:21,200
And so Thursday evening it was a busy day and I didn't make it out there till like 4 o'clock.

132
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,100
And I get out there and it's 92 degrees in the garage and all the servers are going.

133
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,500
So I go to each one I shut them all down and I go to our oldest server.

134
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,700
The one that has like our historic projects on it the ones that go back from the very beginning of time

135
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:41,800
and the one that has all of my media library, which Chris's private selection 70 80 percent.

136
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,600
I've hand ripped right like pride has gone into creating these rips funny enough.

137
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,900
Almost like a weird like movie foreshadow the day before.

138
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,100
I'm not even kidding you had he was like, should we just throw away all this physical media?

139
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,800
Because I've got like crates of it under the server of physical media.

140
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,700
And she's like we don't watch DVDs or blu-rays.

141
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Should I just like sell this or get rid of it?

142
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,300
Like what do you want me? I'm like, I don't know.

143
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Let's hold on to it for a little bit longer. I like having the source copies.

144
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's hold on to it for a little bit longer.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,300
That was the previous day. The next day I go out there.

146
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,100
I go to do a halt, you know, like a pseudo shutdown kind of thing.

147
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,700
And it tells me the binary cannot be executed.

148
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,100
That's a good sign. Just always a great sign that your systems working normally.

149
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,900
So then I have my laptop. So I fired my laptop. I go to SSH in SSH connection refused.

150
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,100
Like well the box is up. I'm standing right here.

151
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,700
So I do the control delete, you know, the six times and it starts to reboot

152
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,900
and I get cannot unmount and it's this ZFS path.

153
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,800
Cannot unmount this ZFS path. Cannot unmount this ZFS.

154
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,900
And it's all screen after screen. ZFS error, ZFS error, ZFS error, ZFS error.

155
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,500
And then cannot execute shutdown.

156
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,900
So I shut it off and it's too hot and I'm like, I'm not going to stand out here

157
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,300
in 90 plus degree weather and troubleshoot this thing

158
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,200
and I'm not going to run it in 90 plus degree weather.

159
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,700
So I shut it down Thursday night.

160
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,800
I got in my car and I left and I went home and I was like in a bad place.

161
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,600
I was like, ah, just mostly because even if I could re-rip all of that stuff

162
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,200
and even if I could reset up the server, like how many days of work am I looking at?

163
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,700
Right? Just that, right? I was sitting with like, oh my God.

164
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,900
This is going to be weeks of work, right?

165
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,100
And I, so I get over it. I get home and I think well,

166
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll go down there tomorrow, Friday and boot it up.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Get like, get it going off a USB disk.

168
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Get the lay of the land at least. Yeah.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,400
So that was sort of my mindset. I was like, maybe it'll be all right.

170
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,800
I'll get in there. See if the DFS array is fine.

171
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,700
Maybe it's just the boot disk that failed because that is its own separate disk

172
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,000
that is super jank outside the case. Not properly cooled.

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Oh, this keeps getting better. It was like not a great setup.

174
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,700
So I figured if there was going to be a point of failure,

175
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,400
that's where it was going to fail. So Friday morning,

176
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I come out really kind of early like 7 a.m.

177
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,000
because I had an 8 a.m. call and then I had a 9 a.m. recording and like,

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,800
I knew like I had, did not have much time to look at this,

179
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,100
but I thought I'll get out there while it's still like 65 degrees in the garage

180
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,500
and get this thing booted. It's the next morning.

181
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,400
I've been standing here for a little bit. It's still pretty early.

182
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,700
I want to do this while it's cold out, but I've been just trying to strategize

183
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,900
and honestly kind of reflect on what I'm going to do if this thing doesn't work.

184
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,300
Like after I press this power button,

185
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,200
I'm either going to have a massive pain in my butt or everything's going to be fine

186
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,800
with some logs I need to review.

187
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn it on

188
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,400
and then I'm just going to listen. I suspect maybe the OS drive has died.

189
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,000
But we'll see. Here we go.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:01,800
All right, everything's coming on. Monitor's powering up.

191
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Drives have lit up. No red lights yet.

192
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,900
I'll be closely watching both the post-boot screen

193
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,300
and also of course once the OS starts to load.

194
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,800
Just kind of in that window right now.

195
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I just have to wait. The screen hasn't turned up.

196
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,200
I just have to wait. Come on screen. Show me your post.

197
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,500
Show me your post. Ah, here we go.

198
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:43,600
Okay, no BIOS errors or IPMI module error or USB controller error.

199
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,700
The disks are all pass through so there's no con-

200
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,400
I wouldn't expect any kind of controller error, but we'll see.

201
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:57,700
Oh, there we go. Oh, that moment.

202
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:04,100
Okay, we're getting to grub now. Oh, no.

203
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,000
Reboot and select a proper boot device or install boot media

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,600
in the selected boot device and press a key.

205
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,600
I think our OS drive is indeed dead.

206
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,800
I'm touching which I think this is the OS drive.

207
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:26,200
It's hard to tell, but I don't think it's spinning.

208
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,400
Better than the array, but man, what a pain in the butt.

209
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,700
So at this point, I'm pretty sure the data is probably good.

210
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,100
And what I'm thinking is I'll go grab Ventoy.

211
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,500
I'll boot Ubuntu 2204 because it's got built-in ZFS support.

212
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,100
Sure. I'll get SSH going on this thing

213
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,300
and then we'll get it restored, right?

214
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
It's like not ideal,

215
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,000
but this seems like something we could actually recover from.

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,700
And of course, I ran out of time and I had to go record

217
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,500
and do a call, which I was totally down for doing

218
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,300
because we're working on some great swag for the West Coast road trip.

219
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,700
So I was like, I had to go to take care of that.

220
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,800
Totes worth it, but the job demands I move on.

221
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,300
I'm not a server admin by my day trading anymore.

222
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Just a nice little hobby you have sometimes.

223
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,000
So in the back of my mind, I'm strategizing

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,700
without really realizing I'm doing it.

225
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm thinking, all right, I'm going to get that Ventoy.

226
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that.

227
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,200
So I sneak out there in the middle of the day

228
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,300
and I pop the Ventoy in the back because for whatever reason,

229
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,400
the Super Micro, it doesn't have any USB ports in the front

230
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,600
and man, is that annoying. Like, come on.

231
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,700
So I'm doing this thing where I'm trying to get it way back in there.

232
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,200
But of course, I have the MVME

233
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,800
and this big housing that has CNA on both ends of the connector for USB.

234
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,500
So it's like, it's this big fat mother and I'm trying to get it in there.

235
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,200
But it's only got two USB.

236
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,100
Anyways, it was super annoying.

237
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,300
You really need to be looking at it and rotate the whole thing.

238
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,200
But I get the Ventoy attached.

239
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,900
I reboot it and I get this strange, strange boot error.

240
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,200
Like it's totally, obviously the Ventoy is completely incompatible.

241
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,400
This is like three releases ago.

242
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,900
Ventoy, it's obviously totally incompatible with the Super Micro BIOS.

243
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Well, OK, so I got to go flash this event to image directly to a USB thumb drive.

244
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,300
Sure. OK, fine. Fine.

245
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,200
Well, I don't got time for that right now.

246
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,500
So I was like, OK, well, there goes my 15 minutes to try to solve this.

247
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,100
So I move on and I keep I keep working to finish off my Friday.

248
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,500
Record a Bitcoin dad pod and I go home because I got the kids.

249
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,400
Kids are over. We got stuff going on. It's weekend time.

250
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,300
Saturday, same thing. It's too hot.

251
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,800
I can't really go down there and work on it.

252
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Saturday, take the kids out for a hike, which was also brutal.

253
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,900
And then get home. It's like the evening.

254
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,100
I think I could go down to the studio and get it going now because I want to make it ready for us to get it up right now and get it repaired.

255
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,000
My thought is I could do the whole USB boot thing.

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,400
I got the ISO image. I've got a USB thumb drive.

257
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,300
Good to go. Screw it.

258
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,300
I'll come in Sunday morning. So I get in early this morning before the show.

259
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,400
While the server room is still nice and cool.

260
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:02,100
And I'm looking at the other servers that are off the other new servers that have been contributed by audience members.

261
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:09,600
And I just thought while they're off, maybe I should just do a health check on these things, too, before these things end up dying on me.

262
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,600
I open it up. And it is covered in cottonwood.

263
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,100
I open up the other server covered in cottonwood.

264
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,800
I pull out the drive trays, all of the air intakes totally covered.

265
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,300
So I kid you not, I spent an hour and 45 minutes this morning cleaning servers with cotton vacuuming.

266
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,600
I'm pulling out every single disk, vacuuming them, putting them back in because everything's down.

267
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,300
So might as well do it now. Right. Hey, I have a top tip for that.

268
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:47,400
If you have a loose blower or some compressed air, that's the best way because you don't need to touch things that way rather than vacuum.

269
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,200
Well, you know, the whole thing was all I had out there was a shop vac. I wasn't expecting this. Right.

270
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,600
But then I thought I should check this. Yeah. So then I think, well, I should probably go look how old fake NAS is doing.

271
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Right. How's old fake NAS doing? And I go and I didn't expect any of this.

272
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:11,000
And I didn't I didn't even get the USB disk inserted before I started discovering something was a little strange.

273
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:20,900
This is a pretty old box. And one of the things I just want to double check before I write this hard drive off completely is that the power is good.

274
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,000
And the data is good because the power is actually I just noticed coming off a little splitter here.

275
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So I'm going to rid of this splitter and then run it directly to the hard drive.

276
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,600
Now, the hard drive itself is a Western Digital. It's one of those velociraptor drives.

277
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,100
So it's like 10000 RPM. Honestly, I would actually expect this thing to die. Right.

278
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,900
The other ones are all 7200. But this thing not only was it not getting the proper cooling because the case was cracked,

279
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,500
but it's also a 10000 RPM disk. But we'll see running.

280
00:16:51,500 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm running different power and I'm running slightly better spot here in terms of hopefully it would get better cooling.

281
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,200
I doubt it. I'm actually just more kind of banking on the power situation. That adapter looked a little sketch.

282
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm sure that had nothing to do with it. OK, here we go. It's actually a decent box.

283
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:24,300
It has two L5640 Xeon CPUs in it at 2.27 gigahertz each.

284
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,200
And I don't know something like 48 gigs of RAM, 64 gigs of RAM, quite a bit of RAM.

285
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,700
So, you know, it's lasted quite a long time for us. It's it's definitely served its purpose, I should say.

286
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,700
I could just use a couple of more months. Come on, come on, keep going.

287
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:48,900
Show me grub. Show me that grub. Boot baby, boot. No, come on, come on.

288
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:57,300
It's booting. System D version 249.5-3-arch. Yes, this box is still running arch.

289
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:04,900
I can't believe it. That is going to be the luckiest play ever because I had a ton of errors when I shut this thing down.

290
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:12,200
So maybe that thing just got hot. I don't know. Maybe that adapter got hot. It's booting right now.

291
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:22,000
Drives are flashing. OK, I got a snapshot failure here, but that's not a big deal. Come on.

292
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I can hear the hard drive clicking. Come on, please boot. I do not need this project right now.

293
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,100
Uh-oh. Oh, no, there we go. OK, so one network interface didn't start, but that's not even the primary network interface.

294
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,400
We're up. We're up. I'm going to go check services, but the disks are flashing away.

295
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:54,500
They look so happy. They look like a date of Christmas tree.

296
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't remember why we did it, but when we hooked up that extra OS boot drive we added last minute,

297
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,800
we hooked it up to a splitter and I think that splitter was just done. It was dead.

298
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:12,500
Now, obviously, clearly, this is like the third time we have pulled the server back from the absolute brink of death.

299
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,800
And this time I really got a lesson learned. I never want this to happen again.

300
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:27,100
So we'll get to that here in a second. But what I was thinking, Wes, is what we ought to do is log into that thing and let's get it up to date.

301
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,400
We better get it up to date. While, you know, while we can while we're working on it,

302
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,600
because I don't think it's been since we've done it on the show.

303
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,700
And, you know, these arch boxes, they tend to break when you go months without updating them.

304
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,100
So why don't we do it now live on the show?

305
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,500
If you wouldn't mind SSHing into there. I checked earlier.

306
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:56,100
I believe we have about a gigabyte worth of packages to download with a net upgrade size of 152 megabytes.

307
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,300
It's essentially every system package. Every app, every package on there.

308
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,800
You love updates.

309
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,400
So let's do it. Let's get it all up to date.

310
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,800
Let's get this thing done and make sure it's in a good spot for the rest of the road trip.

311
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,700
And then I'll tell you what I'm thinking about.

312
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,400
You're going to make me help you rip these Blu-rays if this doesn't work, aren't you?

313
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,000
We'll come back to that. We'll see how you do, Wes. You let us know, OK?

314
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,300
Oh, net upgrade size 150 megabytes.

315
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,700
Yeah, isn't that great? Just what a thing. It is pretty great.

316
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:34,000
I've realized we should colo these. These these probably shouldn't be in my garage anymore.

317
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,200
It's been fun and I've got away with it for years.

318
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:46,100
But when the cottonwood came in and it made me realize that this is just not a this is not a doable thing anymore.

319
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:52,200
And so if anyone out there in the audience in the Pacific Northwest area happens to work at a data center

320
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,700
or a colo location where we could take two or three boxes

321
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,000
and put them in a rack where they could be properly taken care of,

322
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
please reach out Chris at Jupiterbroadcasting.com or Linuxonplug.com contact.

323
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
We'd be willing to work out a deal. I need to get him out of this garage.

324
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,100
It's just time, you know, like I thought we'd get air conditioning,

325
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,900
but we didn't and I figured we'd the shutting them down would be enough.

326
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,600
But it clearly wasn't because there was just some time when just things happened.

327
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,500
And when I went out there and I touched that box that for that Thursday night that evening.

328
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
It was so hot. I could barely keep my hands on it.

329
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,100
That's what you know, it's like how can this system last right?

330
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,100
It just it possibly could make it a little bit longer.

331
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:39,100
But eventually this box is going to die and those boxes that have been given to us by the audience are going to die.

332
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,100
And it's not like they're, you know, especially that box. It's not in the show path.

333
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,500
We don't need it to do our recording. So yeah, we just got to get it.

334
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,000
We got to get it hosted and coloed. It's been a fun experiment.

335
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,900
But if anybody out there has any any ideas or hook us up,

336
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,200
let us know because I think what are you laughing about?

337
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,100
I just like the idea, you know, you sort of taking care of these things,

338
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,100
trundling out to the garage, you know, checking on them,

339
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,100
touching them, logging in the old fashioned way with the little, the ancient LED LCD monitor.

340
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,100
It's my first LCD screen I bought ever, a hundred years ago.

341
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
4-3 ratio, right?

342
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Yeah, of course. I think it's a 14 inch screen, which it's a KDS,

343
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,300
which I don't even think that brand is around anymore.

344
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,800
I think they died long, long time ago.

345
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,900
And just think now you get credentials to go into a data center that could potentially lock you out

346
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,600
if there's a BGP error. How much fun would that be?

347
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,400
I know. This is where I'm not really a big fan of this idea,

348
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,300
is the whole idea with these is it's like large data stuff

349
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,200
that you really only want to transfer over a gigabit LAN anyways,

350
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,300
like source files or media files or things that we want to do.

351
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,900
Like we want to take 15 MP3 files, convert them or FLAC files,

352
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,800
convert them to MP3 and upload them to our radio stream.

353
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,100
Like you don't want to do that necessarily on a cloud box,

354
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,300
but maybe we just got to accept we don't have servers in the summer.

355
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,200
It's just a winter time thing that we do.

356
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,100
Yeah, maybe. You know, one thing that's been really handy is I've broken the tasks up a little bit.

357
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,500
So JOOPS has its own network.

358
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,600
So like my immediate media files and whatnot in my Home Assistant,

359
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,400
I'll run on a local network on a Raspberry Pi.

360
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,000
And then here I have a Home Assistant Blue that runs the Home Assistant automations for the studio.

361
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,800
And then we have one of the Dell systems that we've set up

362
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
that's running a lot of the automated tasks that's good to go.

363
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,900
And another system that's running a lot of data storage and that's been fine.

364
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,000
And those don't even need to be on 24-7, so I can just leave them off for days at a time.

365
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,700
But FakeNAS was like, I needed to turn it on like once a day.

366
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,300
You know, it's not always great to turn a server on and off all the time either.

367
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,200
You know, they tend to just like to stay on at a good even temperature.

368
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,500
I feel bad. It's like they're my garden, you know, and I'm not growing some weird fruit.

369
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,300
Yeah, I got weeds in my garden. I'm not watering them properly, you know.

370
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,200
Chris, you were going to touch on lessons learned.

371
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,900
I feel like we can make quite a list out of that story.

372
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,100
Do you think that's a nice idea?

373
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,600
Yeah, my lesson is colo. That's my lesson. Colo, idiot.

374
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,700
That's the overall lesson, but I feel like try not to get cottonwood in your servers.

375
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,900
That's a good lesson, right? Rule number one.

376
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,000
Maybe the wind tunnel wasn't the best idea.

377
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Get some filters for your wind tunnel.

378
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,800
Yeah, and then pull the trigger on setting up that whole temperature sensor thing

379
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,300
with the smart plugs that you were going to do last year.

380
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,500
Like a year ago.

381
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,400
Yeah, it would also be good like maybe we shouldn't put everything into production

382
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,600
until we have the cooling and the rack solution done because I thought we would get that done.

383
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,200
That's my fault. I'm going to take that one.

384
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Alex, do you have any advice?

385
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,400
Nothing that hasn't already been said. I mean, it's all obvious, isn't it?

386
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,200
Back up your configs, kids.

387
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,800
This is Uncle Chris telling you right now.

388
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,400
I just had a brush with death and my first thought was,

389
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,800
I don't know if I backed up the configs.

390
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,200
Linode.com slash unplugged. Go there to get a hundred dollars

391
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,700
and 60 day credit on a new account.

392
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,600
And it's just a great way to support the show and check something great out.

393
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,500
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting with the best support in the business.

394
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,400
Underscore that real humans all the time. Take out your highlighter,

395
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,400
even though sometimes it makes the ink blur a little bit.

396
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,200
Highlight this. The best support in the business.

397
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,500
Man, does that matter when it really matters?

398
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,600
You're thinking about it.

399
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,700
I've been getting notes from audience members who were maybe on a different cloud provider

400
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,600
who's been changing things recently and they're just not very happy anymore.

401
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,100
And they're looking to migrate.

402
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,300
I've also heard from some of you out there who have looked for like the ultimate budget provider

403
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,600
because you just got a cheap machine you're throwing together.

404
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
And the next thing you know, it's been running for three months.

405
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,400
It's kind of important to you and now you want it somewhere better.

406
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Well, that credit works for you to go to Linode.com slash unplugged and just try it out for a bit.

407
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,700
It could also be a great way to try out something like a multi-cloud strategy this summer.

408
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,300
Our garage slash server room in air quotes to the extreme.

409
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,200
It's getting up to like 90 degrees, 92 degrees, 93 degrees some days,

410
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,700
especially if I parked the hot car in there and the reality is it's been a peace of mind

411
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,500
knowing on the during summer.

412
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,900
I just moved some of this stuff over to Linode and I don't I don't really need it here in the garage.

413
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,700
Sure. I'd like to have access on my land,

414
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,900
but the reality is Linode's infrastructure is so fast that it's typically faster than my own gear.

415
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,500
Anyways, like even locally. It's crazy because they are their own ISP

416
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,300
and they have 11 data centers around the world.

417
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,000
So for this kind of stuff, I'll just pick the one on the on the West Coast,

418
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,300
right? You pick the one closest to you and then they have MVME disks in there.

419
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,100
They have AMD epic processors for the dedicated GPU machines.

420
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,800
In fact, if you want physical hardware to they can work with you on that.

421
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,700
Linode's constantly adding new features like database as a service.

422
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,500
So that we've you just want Linode to run your Postgres or MySQL your Mongo.

423
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,700
They'll do it for you.

424
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,800
They'll bring their expertise that they've collected for the last 19 years

425
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,400
and they'll bring it to something like a hosted database service.

426
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,800
Nobody else has this combination of features

427
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,300
and this is the place you go to support the show too.

428
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,700
It's a win-win. So go check it out. I think you're really going to like it.

429
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,800
If you've been considering it, maybe migrating from one of those other providers.

430
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,500
Maybe you're just done with the hyperscalers crap.

431
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,700
Go try out Linode. You know, what's up.

432
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,000
linode.com slash unplugged one more time.

433
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,800
Just go to linode.com slash unplugged.

434
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,700
With some small website updates on the new website.

435
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,800
We have something like I think it's something like 60 people now in our matrix chat room

436
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,300
that are keeping updated on the new website, which is pretty amazing.

437
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,300
And I was able to recently convince Alex to jump into the project

438
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,500
and I think that was a good thing.

439
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,900
Hello. What have you been up to this week?

440
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,600
What haven't I been up to?

441
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,600
We've been doing a lot of infrastructure work a lot of basic plumbing

442
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,400
and stuff like that that actually just needs the JB crew.

443
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,400
I suppose to do it really because you know, we you know, there are servers at the end of the day.

444
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:15,000
We're using GitHub actions to fully automate the deployment of the building of the Hugo site

445
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,600
and then deploying that to a Linode node.

446
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,700
I never know what to call them. I used to call them droplets back in the day, but you know Linode nodes.

447
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,800
We changed the URL of the website and you did some fancy DNS stuff, didn't you?

448
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,600
Ah yes, this was a long time ago actually.

449
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:41,400
The orange one and I wrote some pretty ninja level, which probably means hacky as F Ansible code,

450
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:47,400
which automatically scans the Docker compose file for the relevant traffic labels

451
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,000
and then automatically updates the Cloudflare DNS records using Ansible under the hood.

452
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,700
So you could, for example, spin up a new container have the correct traffic label against that container

453
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,200
and not need to open Cloudflare and type it all in and all that kind of stuff.

454
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,500
Now you could argue you could do that using Terraform,

455
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,000
but the advantage of doing it this way with Ansible is it's just one command.

456
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,500
It's all in one place and it's all automated.

457
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,100
That's awesome and we do have a new URL that we want everybody to use

458
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,700
and also please we need some people to test the new website.

459
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,000
So Alex, what did you make the new URL?

460
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,600
We thought long and hard deep into the night about how to name this thing.

461
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,000
new.jupitabroadcasting.com

462
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,400
So that's where the new website is being sort of tested for now.

463
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,700
If you just go to jupitabroadcasting.com,

464
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,400
it's currently the old WordPress website that's still functional and still up to date and everything.

465
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,500
But the new website that we're building is at new.jupitabroadcasting.com

466
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:53,900
and if you want to get more involved, please join our matrix room and also check out our GitHub.

467
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,400
Don't forget also coming up in this week's Office Hours,

468
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,200
we're going to do a deep dive into a lot more of the configuration

469
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,400
and the plans for continuous integration and feature branches and all that kind of stuff.

470
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,800
I'm looking forward to that.

471
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
A lot of good stuff.

472
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,600
Yeah, so if you're coming in and you're going new website, what are you guys talking about?

473
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah, we've been covering this in officehours.hair.

474
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,200
This is a new community project that's just absolutely incredible and it's coming along.

475
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,800
Brent says small updates, huge updates.

476
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:27,400
It's a whole brand new website statically generated on demand when we publish a new episode

477
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,200
and it's coming together and we're kind of in the final stretch and we'd love your feedback.

478
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,200
So we do have our GitHub page where you can give us some feedback,

479
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,900
but just go check it out at new.jupitabroadcasting.com

480
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,500
Chris, you got a nice new feature as well this week, didn't you?

481
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,900
This is so cool.

482
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,200
So, oh man, this is a great time to be building this website

483
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,200
because we're kind of embracing new ideas and new ways of doing stuff.

484
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,100
And one of them is PeerTube.

485
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,200
Yeah.

486
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,400
We're back on the PeerTube bandwagon, baby, at jupiter.tube

487
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,100
and we want to start using that for our live stream in bed because,

488
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,100
you know, just today as we were getting ready to start the show,

489
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,600
we started playing a song and we realized,

490
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,000
oh no, this might actually get us kicked off of YouTube just playing this.

491
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,500
And so as we move forward, it's like,

492
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,000
why do we want to keep promoting Google's platform or Amazon's platform with Twitch?

493
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,200
Like, why not promote our own free software platform that's not going to take us down?

494
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,500
And so then the next question was, well, shouldn't we be using that as our embed?

495
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,700
But how are we going to do that?

496
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Are we going to like do a new embed for PeerTube every single time we want to do a live stream?

497
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,600
How's that going to work?

498
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,700
And we've been kicking that around.

499
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:38,700
And this is a great example of our community came in with a solution that is so slick,

500
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,200
so elegant, and they're using a lot of like native technologies

501
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,900
that we're just now implementing like PeerTube.

502
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,800
And they're looking at the PeerTube API and they're saying,

503
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,900
how can we use this to properly embed a live stream on the new website?

504
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,400
And the guys dug through it.

505
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,300
And they found a way where when we go live on PeerTube,

506
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,400
it can automatically update the website.

507
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,500
And I don't know if it's changing the embed at the website

508
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,800
or if the embed is just somehow auto updating, but it is so,

509
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,300
I don't do anything but go live

510
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,300
and the website automatically gets the new embedded live stream from PeerTube.

511
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
Just how it should be.

512
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,600
It's so cool.

513
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,300
It's so cool like we're building and we're building a page that talks about how to do boost.

514
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,700
So that way we have all that explained in one place.

515
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,900
And in the future, I imagine you'll actually be able to boost from there.

516
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,800
We've got a page for the memberships.

517
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,700
We've got a page for all of the hosts, our swag store, the calendar.

518
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,000
And of course, the new player is so slick.

519
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,700
It supports chapters.

520
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,600
It supports a lot of the new podcasting 2.0 spec.

521
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,700
It's an open source player itself, Podverse.

522
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,900
I'll talk about that more in the show.

523
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,000
It's all coming together in one statically generated website

524
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,800
that's going to just load beautifully and fast for everybody, hopefully.

525
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,000
And the neat thing is like, you know, you mentioned the player.

526
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,800
Well, the Podverse player, Mitch over there, was happy to collaborate with us

527
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,500
and we went back and forth for, I don't know, something like two weeks,

528
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,400
sending some requests for certain features and they built it in

529
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
and then they'd send a request from us to do something a little differently.

530
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,800
It's been really cool to interact with other open source projects as well in our efforts.

531
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,300
So, I think everyone over at the website creation team, I think big applause

532
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,300
and thank you for making this so much fun.

533
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,100
Yeah, I think that actually is worth just talking about a little bit more is

534
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,400
we didn't intend for this to happen, but there's been some other projects

535
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,600
that have gotten bug fixes and they've made some improvements and changes

536
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,900
as we've been building this website.

537
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,100
It really has been a collaborative open source project, which is just really awesome.

538
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,300
We didn't necessarily intend for that to happen, but…

539
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,600
Freaking open source.

540
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,900
Yep, and all of this that we're doing, it's all up on our GitHub.

541
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
It's all there.

542
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,500
While we're talking about Podverse, I might as well mention that

543
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,800
the Android and iOS clients are getting boost support.

544
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,700
It's in F-Droid right now.

545
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,800
As we record, I believe this morning, it's landing in the Play Store

546
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,000
and it is currently in review on the Apple iOS Store,

547
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,200
but version 4.60 has boosting in the mobile client as well.

548
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,500
So, Podverse is one of these podcasting 2.0 clients we like a lot

549
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,400
because they have an iOS, Android, and web player.

550
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,900
It's all GPL.

551
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:18,600
It's available in F-Droid if you'd likes it and it's embeddable too as a player.

552
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,500
So, you as a listener could create a Podverse FM account with the online player

553
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,400
and then when you go to our website, you could play it in there

554
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,900
and you could click a little button and bring it into your overall Podverse list of podcasts.

555
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,800
It's going to be very slick.

556
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,600
So, do check out Podverse.

557
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,900
They are iterating quickly and it'll be landing in Play and the App Store this week

558
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:44,200
and it's already in F-Droid, a brand new version with lots of fancy features

559
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
and they're just a great team.

560
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,500
Like Brent said, we worked with them on the website.

561
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,300
It's been awesome.

562
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,800
So, Podverse.fm for that.

563
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,000
I think Brent's found a new calling.

564
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,300
I don't know if he realizes it quite yet,

565
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,500
but a new calling as being a scrum master or some kind of a project manager

566
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,800
because he wakes up and I know the first thing he does is he looks at his phone

567
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,700
and checks just how many pull requests have been opened that night, how many issues.

568
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,100
But the other thing I think that we need to just underscore

569
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,400
is how Brent's really driven this community engagement.

570
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,900
I know that you're my friend and everything,

571
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,500
but I think you've done a great job with it.

572
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:19,900
Well done.

573
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,700
Well, thank you.

574
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,200
Round of applause.

575
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,100
And we're just, and really, not to early celebrate,

576
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,200
but we're really close to the finish line, right?

577
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Like we're so close and I don't think we'd be there if it wasn't for Brent's work.

578
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,800
So, of course, Stefan and really there is an entire team of people.

579
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,500
If you go to GitHub, there's a huge team.

580
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Go to GitHub, look at the Jupiter Broadcasting Com Insights

581
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,200
and look at the last 30 days.

582
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,300
It's going to blow your mind.

583
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,700
It's so awesome, isn't it?

584
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,500
It's incredible.

585
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,600
It's really amazing.

586
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,800
Yeah, I think it outpaced what we were expecting

587
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,500
and I think that's really exciting.

588
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,200
You know, in like 14, 15 years,

589
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,500
I think it's the most successful community project JB's ever done.

590
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,300
So, and a big part of that is thanks to Brent.

591
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,600
Big part of that thanks is to Stefan and really just the incredible community we've built

592
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,500
and the philosophy of value for value

593
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,900
because it's not always just sats and dollars,

594
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,300
it's time and talent as well.

595
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,200
Absolutely.

596
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,900
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

597
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,600
Go there to get started with a free trial for an individual or a business.

598
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,400
It's Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

599
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,200
It's just the easiest way for you or a team of people

600
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,400
to manage secrets and pass phrases, things that really are important.

601
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,400
And Bitwarden is open source, so you know that their security is audible,

602
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,800
it's open, it's transparent,

603
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,300
and it's trusted by millions of individuals and teams in their community.

604
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,200
It's what we use to manage our passwords,

605
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,500
our two-factor codes, and other sensitive recovery keys

606
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,600
for the applications that require that.

607
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,700
And then it's also how I manage to have complex secure passwords on my mobile device

608
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,000
because I also have Bitwarden installed on my mobile devices.

609
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,700
I put it in my browser.

610
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,500
I grab the app from Flathub

611
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,900
because they've got a flat pack of Bitwarden,

612
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,700
which is great for getting a new system set up.

613
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,100
And I put it on my mobile devices.

614
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,900
And I always appreciate the little changes that come down the pipe from Bitwarden,

615
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,300
the little improvements, the tweaks, the iteration on the UI,

616
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,500
things that just make the workflow smoother like account switching.

617
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,900
And recently, I mean like just last week,

618
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,800
they got support for cross-domain identity management right there in Bitwarden.

619
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,200
So like for enterprises,

620
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,200
it makes it so much easier now to provision Bitwarden for your users.

621
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,300
They also recently added a username generator.

622
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,800
So that way you can have a unique username and a unique password

623
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,400
for every website and service that you sign up for,

624
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,700
but not just username and password.

625
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,100
They also have an option to create an email alias

626
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,700
for each service or website that you sign up for.

627
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,900
You know, it just routes it through simple logon or Firefox Relay.

628
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,900
And then the service doesn't know really anything about you.

629
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,300
And if they get a breach,

630
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,900
which a service I use just had a breach last week,

631
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,900
then it doesn't share your identifying information,

632
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,800
something that you might use on another site or service, right?

633
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,600
It's just that site and services information.

634
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,300
So it's limited in its damage.

635
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,000
It's going to do just small things like that,

636
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,600
using a password manager, using a unique password,

637
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
using a unique username,

638
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,100
and even a unique email address for every website and service you use

639
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,400
is going to greatly enhance your online privacy and security.

640
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,900
It might just be the number one thing you can do.

641
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:25,600
And Bitwarden is the tool that makes this actually doable and manageable.

642
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,800
So go try it out for yourself or your business.

643
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,400
Go try it for free at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

644
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,200
It's also a great way to support the show.

645
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Maybe you already know all this,

646
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,500
but maybe somebody you know,

647
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,200
maybe a teammate at work needs to hear this,

648
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,000
maybe a friend-ish.

649
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I mean, if they're a friend, you've already had them switch to Bitwarden.

650
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,400
But I'm not going to make judgments.

651
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,600
Maybe a family member you don't talk to very often.

652
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,700
We'll frame it that way.

653
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,600
Maybe they need to know about Bitwarden.

654
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,500
Send them over to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

655
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,300
One more time, to support the show, it's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

656
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,600
Now, you know we have some meetups to talk about here.

657
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,300
Let's get a little bit of meetup going here.

658
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,000
We have not one, not two, but maybe like four or five coming up.

659
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,800
September 20th, Southern Oregon.

660
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,000
September 23rd, Northern California.

661
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,400
September 29th, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

662
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,300
September 30th, Southern California.

663
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,600
October 7th, Northern Oregon.

664
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,900
All of them, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

665
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,200
If you're in the area, let's meetup.

666
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,100
We're going to also have some swag on board.

667
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,100
But we'll also, even if you can't make it to the meetup, have something for you.

668
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,600
Brand new idea.

669
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,400
We're going to stash little geocaches along the way.

670
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,200
And then we'll give you hints in the show where you can find them.

671
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,900
So even if you can't make it to the meetup, maybe you can still get some swag.

672
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,300
We're leaving something behind for you.

673
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,900
I got to pick up like some Tupperware containers, I'm thinking.

674
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,900
Don't give it all away.

675
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,000
No, I'm going to put some swag, you know, like shirt stickers, some stuff in there.

676
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,600
Can we do like perishable food items?

677
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,800
That's probably a single hair in each.

678
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,400
Probably shouldn't do like a banana.

679
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,300
Probably shouldn't.

680
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,600
Oh, okay. All right.

681
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,400
Although, how impressive.

682
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,700
That'll tell you how long it's been in there.

683
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,300
Right.

684
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,800
Like if somebody...

685
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,500
What if somebody found it and then took a picture with like a like a still edible banana?

686
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,600
That'd be very impressive, right?

687
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,000
Maybe we should put a banana in there.

688
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,500
I think there's an argument for a banana.

689
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,700
Now get finding y'all.

690
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,300
Yeah. So we'll let you know as we hit the road.

691
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,000
We'll hide them along the way and give you hints here in the show.

692
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,700
But come say hi to us. Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

693
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,400
You know what it is.

694
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,200
I think it's time for some feedback.

695
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:49,300
Yeah. Up first is actually a listener who found their way here after you were a guest over on the podcasting 2.0 show.

696
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,000
Oh, cool.

697
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,300
Yeah. Arno writes in and has got some questions about the Raspberry Pi.

698
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,800
Maybe you can help us out here, Chris.

699
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,500
All right.

700
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,300
Do you know of any solution for using the Pi on battery power?

701
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:06,400
Now, specifically with the SmartPi Touch 2, which I guess is like a fancy case that includes a screen.

702
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,300
Unfortunately, Pi juice does not work.

703
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,500
I guess the developer says that the Pi and the screen draws too much power.

704
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,100
Using a power bank with extra cable isn't very portable.

705
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,400
Oh, well, OK, I was going to say that's really how you do it, right?

706
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,300
Because then you can size it to how you needs it.

707
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,400
But of course, I'm thinking not so portable.

708
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,900
How would you do that portably?

709
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:31,000
The only thing I could really think of is like something like the Moto dock.

710
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,700
But I don't know if that's going to be really easy to get your hands on these days.

711
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,600
I think you got to build yourself essentially a Tupperware container.

712
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,200
With a banana.

713
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:51,400
And then you put all that in the Tupperware container and then you just make the Tupperware container portable.

714
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,800
OK, OK, well, swing and a miss maybe.

715
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,300
But maybe somebody listening has a better idea.

716
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,700
Here's a second chance over here.

717
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,300
OK, all right.

718
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,500
Do you have any advice for like a good microphone or audio setup to use with the Pi?

719
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:09,200
I think Arnos tried a USB stick with PCM2902 and a three and a half millimeter jack playback was fine.

720
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,000
But input does not seem to work.

721
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,200
Now, I don't know how you're doing your storage.

722
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,800
So this is going to be the problem.

723
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,700
But you absolutely got to go USB audio interface.

724
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:23,700
I think something like the Audio Technica ATR could possibly do in this scenario.

725
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,400
I don't know if the Blue Icicle is still easily available too,

726
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,600
but that'll take any XLR mic and make it into a USB mic with just one device.

727
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,500
It's kind of a big device, bigger than the Raspberry Pi, but it's a thing.

728
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,800
That's probably how I would do it, Wes.

729
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,900
The other thing, although we had limited success with it, is you could look at that Raspberry Pi Ninja project.

730
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,600
Maybe they'd have more success than we did.

731
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,700
If so, write back in and let us know.

732
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:53,000
Another feedback item today from Paul responding to Linux Unplugged 468, the read only scenario.

733
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,700
Before listening, if you had asked me what distros I'd recommend to a new or long term Linux user,

734
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,700
I would not have even thought about suggesting Endless.

735
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:10,100
But after Lub 4.68, I think I have to say it's an awesome and known nonsense distro.

736
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,900
Years ago, I heard about Endless and the Endless computer,

737
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,000
and I thought it'd be a great idea for my children, you know,

738
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,800
encourage them to start learn coding, that kind of thing.

739
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,300
Anyway, long story short, the laptop was not really used much by my children,

740
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,700
but since my Mac was aging, already no longer receiving updates,

741
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,600
I started using the Endless computer.

742
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:35,100
While my use case is really just web browsing, email, word processing, and the occasional spreadsheet,

743
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:40,800
it performs perfectly, especially as this is a pretty low cost machine.

744
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,200
And the time we've had this laptop, I've never had any issue with updates or day to day use,

745
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,700
and we've never had to open the command line to fix or rectify anything.

746
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,400
Now, this could be attributed to our basic use case, the well thought out operating system,

747
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
or a combination of both.

748
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,600
I propose we do have a bit of an Endless blind spot.

749
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,000
I think that is true. I think we don't think about Endless very much,

750
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,600
because I think they haven't targeted our user base very much.

751
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,500
But then as we start talking about these immutable systems that we want to just work out of the box for workstations,

752
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,100
I start thinking maybe we should have been looking at Endless more.

753
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,700
So that's great feedback. Thank you for that.

754
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,300
I will put that into like my, you know, the back of my mind.

755
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,200
I feel like we've done the immutable thing quite a bit.

756
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,400
Do we need to do another one?

757
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,300
But Endless is kind of its own thing.

758
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,100
When was the last time we really gave it a go?

759
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,400
We've never. I don't think we've ever looked at it.

760
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,700
Infinity got it.

761
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,400
Really?

762
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,100
You know, the Endless computer kind of piques my interest from what we've been talking about lately with these low end computers as well.

763
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,900
So it's almost like a two episode hit here.

764
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,300
I was gonna say we could send Brent off for a field report.

765
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,000
I'm not sure I follow the logic.

766
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,700
It's not like we wouldn't cover Arch if we just covered Ubuntu though, is it?

767
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,400
So not covering it because we already just covered Nix.

768
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,800
Like they're different things.

769
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,700
Yeah, you're right. No, you're right. You're right.

770
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:06,500
I feel like too, where it fits is I think it could be a solid competitor to Pop or Elementary or Mint.

771
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,000
I think if you're one of those users.

772
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,100
One of those users. What are you saying?

773
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,800
One of those Pop users.

774
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,400
Wait, don't we sometimes?

775
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,800
I just like a lot of punctuation in my Linux distribution, okay man?

776
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,700
I think sometimes. Wait a minute. That's us sometimes. Wait.

777
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,700
Yeah, all right. All right.

778
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,000
All right. You guys are probably right.

779
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,300
I imagine. I mean, we should probably look at it.

780
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,400
I don't know. Okay.

781
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,700
You know, I don't mind trying it.

782
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,100
I think I've had Fedora on this laptop for a little bit.

783
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,200
It's been a mixed bag that maybe we'll talk about.

784
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,600
I don't mind jumping on and let's give it a shot.

785
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,300
He says so casually over there. These little nuggets.

786
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,900
I would like a long-term review and then maybe we should do this next week.

787
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,300
Now, the more we talk about it, the more I'm kind of wanting to do it.

788
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,000
All right. Okay.

789
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,200
We'll put it up for discussion in the committee after the show.

790
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,200
And now it is time for the boost.

791
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,700
wooden501 wrote in with 3,000 sats.

792
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:13,400
I have two B-Link Mini S systems and an ASUS PN41 that I'll be using to learn Kubernetes on.

793
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,700
An actual tiny cluster of systems.

794
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:20,900
They're all running NixOS with GNOME wonderfully with a combined TDP.

795
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,900
What's TDP? I'm out of the loop here.

796
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,900
Oh, total, total, Alex, total power, I think.

797
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,000
Power draw? Draw of power. Total draw of power.

798
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,200
That's my best guess. Of only 36 watts,

799
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,200
which was definitely a major consideration when my electric supply cost more than doubled this year.

800
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:45,000
All three ran Windows 11 fine for all the five minutes each it took to get the Windows license registered with the account.

801
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,200
Not that I'm ever likely to use those licenses.

802
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,100
Not related to the question, but TDP is thermal design power.

803
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,400
Yeah, that's what I said.

804
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,300
You're close, definitely close, definitely, definitely close.

805
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,400
wooden501 also sent in an off-air boost.

806
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
Now, Chris, what's an off-air boost?

807
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,600
So one of the things we've decided to do is, I think we're, I think, I can't remember,

808
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,900
honestly, because we're kind of flying by the seat of our pants here.

809
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,200
Don't reveal our secrets, man.

810
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,400
I think it's a 2,000 sat limit to get on air.

811
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,100
It might have been 1,000. I can't remember.

812
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,700
I think you said 1,000 last episode, but I could be misremembering.

813
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,300
You should have just said a row of dots.

814
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,100
Here's the thing, Chris.

815
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,100
You said 1,000 in LUP, and then you said 2,000 in self-boasted.

816
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,300
I think that's where you're confused.

817
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,500
And Coder, right?

818
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,700
Because I'm trying to realize, because I'm just, we want to keep it tight,

819
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:34,000
but we also will read every single boost that's sent in, and every now and then we'll pull one forward.

820
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,200
And so Wooden had 1,000 boost here, and I thought, you know,

821
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,700
we should read this one because he says that E Ink display tablet you got could be a good boost board.

822
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,700
And I agree.

823
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,500
Brent's got a node.

824
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,100
You know, that's a good idea.

825
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,600
You'd basically need to get like Firefox or something working.

826
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,500
That's all you'd really need to display it.

827
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,700
So it seems a little heavy on that, but we'll see.

828
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,100
We'll see. Everything's possible.

829
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,400
I think going forward to keep the segment tight,

830
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:03,600
we're going to set the minimum at 2,000 boosts for an on air read, but 2,000 sats,

831
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,700
but we'll read 100% all of them sent into the show,

832
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,100
and maybe every now and then pull one or two of them ahead.

833
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,500
Rasta Calavera, a.k.a. Rasta Casta Versa.

834
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,900
Give that man a banana.

835
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,800
wrote in with a row of ducks.

836
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,900
Thank you kindly.

837
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,300
Apparently Chris really butchered his name last week, so apologies there.

838
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,300
Yeah, apologies.

839
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,100
I like Rasta Casta Versa.

840
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,200
I think that's a great name.

841
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,900
So Rasta Casta Calavera wrote in suggesting.

842
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,200
Should I try that again?

843
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,200
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

844
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,900
Okay, spell it.

845
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:54,200
I am now Rasta Casta Versa and expect the Rust audio clip when I boost.

846
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,700
They write, Brent, you should start a Calibre web instance

847
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,500
and send cool things to that E Ink display

848
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,000
or use it as a GPS navigator when you drive.

849
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,700
That's not a bad idea.

850
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,100
I'm thinking a Mario-like map that shows you moving around the country.

851
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,000
Meetups are all the bonus levels.

852
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,800
Hey, that's a fun idea.

853
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,800
What's the castle?

854
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,000
Is that my real question?

855
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,900
Hmm, the studio and your place and Alex's place,

856
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,800
like, you know, major landmarks could be castles.

857
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,400
Don't you think?

858
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,000
I think maybe we'll do the live tracker again for this road trip.

859
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,400
If we can get all our ducks in a row,

860
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,300
I think we should do the live tracker again

861
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,800
because the nice thing about that is it did lead to a few micro meetups.

862
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,400
One, two, three, four people.

863
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,700
Very true. Yeah, that was fun.

864
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,200
It's fun following you along.

865
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,800
Yeah, so we might set up the tracker again.

866
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,100
We only got a few creeps. It was fun.

867
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,200
Yeah, it was totally good.

868
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,800
All right, next boost comes in from DFJ-225 with 16,000 SATs.

869
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,500
Because I'm a back home bowler in pajamas that cost $10.

870
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,500
Hey, folks, I've been itching to use Rust for a project

871
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,000
and I've got a few Raspberry Pi's laying around

872
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,800
wondering if you've got any recommendations

873
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,800
for a useful or fun project idea.

874
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,600
Thanks.

875
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,500
And Wes, you just tossed a link here in the notes.

876
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,900
Yeah, I mean, it can be a little tricky.

877
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,300
A, because you can do so much on the Raspberry Pi

878
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,200
and then B, of course, you know, you can do a lot of things with Rust.

879
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,100
So it kind of depends on what areas you're interested in.

880
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:23,000
But it looks like there's a Raspberry Pi operating system

881
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,700
like writing an embedded OS in Rust targeting the Pi.

882
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,700
And I mean, I might have to try that because that sounds fun.

883
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,200
Interesting. Well, that's pretty great.

884
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,400
I was just going to suggest put Linux on there

885
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,900
and get the Rust tools installed

886
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,700
and just play around with some different projects.

887
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,700
And it's fun just to be on an ARM system and all.

888
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,300
Yeah, I mean, there is a little bit of like getting used to that as well.

889
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,100
All right, 412 Linux boosts in with 2048 SATs,

890
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,300
which I think is actually a gigabyte boost.

891
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,600
Is this live audio from the server room?

892
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,200
Oh, the cottonwood's back.

893
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,700
It's almost that old. It is almost that old.

894
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,300
He says, I agree that the boosts do provide an easy way to get feedback into the show.

895
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,600
I've been listening to the podcast.

896
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,600
I've been listening to your podcast since 2005

897
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,900
and many things have gotten easier regarding podcasts.

898
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,800
It used to take effort to get podcasts onto mobile devices.

899
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,500
I mean, remember having to use juice?

900
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,100
Now it just happens automatically on our pocket computers.

901
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,300
Boosts are the next evolution for easy feedback straight up from the app.

902
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:29,600
I listen right there and I can send it from my pocket computer while I listen.

903
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,000
Great content as usual.

904
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,900
Thanks, everyone. Great job.

905
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,600
Well, thank you very much, 412. That's incredible.

906
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,100
I mean, you're a podcast OG.

907
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:42,000
So I respect your opinion on that.

908
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,300
Nev writes in, before really I was firm on the 1000 or 2000 SAT thing.

909
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,600
So he's making it under the wire.

910
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,500
So you mean before like five minutes ago?

911
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,600
Yeah, like five minutes ago.

912
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,500
Gotcha. Yep.

913
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,300
Also, Nev's like such a long timer that I feel like, you know,

914
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,000
Coming in hot with the boosts.

915
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,500
Nev boosts in with a hot 1877.

916
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:06,700
1877 SATs is the year Ernst Warner von Siemens invented the first ever moving coil microphone.

917
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,500
How about that?

918
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,200
That's great to know, Nev.

919
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:16,400
Also, PSA Ohio Linux Fest will be soon, coming up soon at the Hamilton Hotel in Columbus, Ohio.

920
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,000
December 2nd to the 3rd. That's not that soon.

921
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,700
But it is a good amount of notice to get your plans in order.

922
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,200
Get your plans in order. With the price of tickets, it's a good idea.

923
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,000
Of course, Nev's going to be there.

924
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,700
I would love to hear if the community wants to put a meetup together.

925
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,400
I know a couple of decent spots in Columbus.

926
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,100
Nice. All right.

927
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,000
We got to figure this out.

928
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,300
Maybe we should create a Columbus Matrix room.

929
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,900
So let's make a note.

930
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,300
We'll make a Columbus Matrix room and we'll link to it in the show notes.

931
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,500
It'll also be listed in the overall space.

932
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,500
We got to remember to do this.

933
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,000
Christmas in Columbus.

934
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,800
Yeah, Christmas in Columbus.

935
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,600
I don't know if we'll be there, but I really don't feel like that should be a reason these meetups shouldn't happen.

936
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,500
We're starting to see these self-organized and why the hell not?

937
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,400
Because the audience is full of awesome people.

938
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,400
Think about it.

939
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,900
Think about what the chances are.

940
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,400
If somebody else is also a listener to this show, it's likely you're going to get along.

941
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,100
Such great taste.

942
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,800
It's crazy how well it works.

943
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,300
All right. Marcel boosts in with some dirty 30sats.

944
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,100
30-30.

945
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,200
Yeah.

946
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,500
That's the Kool-Aid Man, by the way, if you didn't know.

947
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,900
Yeah.

948
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,300
Because if you are in your 30s, you know who the Kool-Aid Man is.

949
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:25,500
Is this the original Kool-Aid Man or is this the Family Guy pastiche of Kool-Aid Man?

950
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:33,600
But to stay true to the medium, I looked up how many years ago was 30 years ago, which is like the early 90s, of course, obviously.

951
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,700
I think you'll find it was exactly 30 years ago.

952
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,800
Yeah, it turns out.

953
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,800
And I went and found commercials on YouTube from that time.

954
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,000
And then I grabbed the Kool-Aid Man from the summer commercials of that era.

955
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,400
And that's why this show is technically historical fiction.

956
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,200
That's right. And I'm just putting it out there.

957
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:54,000
Like if you wanted to help with the boost sound clips, you want to get some variety into the show.

958
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,200
This is my process. You know, I was like, OK, 30 years ago.

959
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,400
All right, let's go to what it was on TV. And I just went and got something.

960
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,700
And we'll never talk about it again.

961
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,900
And you'll only know if you've listened to this episode what that's a reference to.

962
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,400
And that's just how it works.

963
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,600
There we go. All right, moving on.

964
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,700
This is a crazy episode. Marcel writes for the member bet line.

965
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:19,500
We were talking in the post show about how to create a system for the members of unplugged core to get a hold of us.

966
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,900
If you want to build it into the app, the only thing you can really do these days is boosting the member feed.

967
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:29,800
You'd need to set up a wallet and you'd need to have like maybe some expectations on your end of lower amounts.

968
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,800
But I know some people don't like the boost or they don't want to get into it.

969
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,000
So maybe a secret web form could work. It's a bit high friction.

970
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,800
Maybe a secret matrix channel. Yeah, we're thinking about a bad line for the members.

971
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,300
Matrix channel came in a couple of times as a suggestion.

972
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,400
I wonder how feasible that is. Would it stay secret?

973
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,700
Would it? Huh? I don't know, but we're going to figure something out.

974
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,700
Yeah, there's a lot of good options. Let us know if you have any thoughts.

975
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:02,700
Next up in the boost department from the PMO fam with a row of ducks.

976
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,300
This old duck still got it.

977
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,100
Giving Fountain a try on Android, sending a row of ducks for Brent's gas tank.

978
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,100
Aww. Oh, thank you. Thanks fam.

979
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,400
Oh, thanks. It runs on fuel, but ducks will work too.

980
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,900
Oh, and you know, the PMO fan did not stop there.

981
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,200
Another row of ducks. Oh, double boost.

982
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:27,900
And you know, I guess tossing in the talent of agreement here,

983
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,100
the package manager debate is annoying as hell.

984
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,500
Oy to all the vays.

985
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,000
Can I just say, this week alone,

986
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,200
there was at least two different threads on our Linux about package managers again.

987
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,600
Can we just like, here's a wild proposal.

988
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,900
Could we just get some sort of group consensus to stop talking about it

989
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,800
and just let the market decide?

990
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:58,000
And whichever end users end up using, we just go with and we stop debating it endlessly?

991
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,100
Yeah, but what if it snaps?

992
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,900
Yeah, that's true. What if it is snaps?

993
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,100
That's a good point Wes. I can't argue with that.

994
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:11,600
Space Ninja wrote in as well with 15,703 sats.

995
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,600
Oh!

996
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:17,600
Because I'm a back home baller, if I want something I just holler.

997
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,800
I've been running Mint on an HP ProBook from 2011

998
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,700
that has a dual core i5 and 8 gigs of RAM since about Mint 18.

999
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,300
I love it as a mobile, just hop in and write some code device.

1000
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:33,700
It's been really stable and I just upgrade only every couple of years.

1001
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:38,200
Oh, that sounds dangerous, but apparently works fine.

1002
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,300
I don't know. If it works, how nice would that be?

1003
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,300
Sounds hassle free to me, you know?

1004
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:49,000
They continue, my custom main rig has had just about every distro on it,

1005
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,800
but I recently circled back to Mint because I'm done fiddling because of lack of time.

1006
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:59,700
So it's VM only for testing and Mint 7.365 every day of the year.

1007
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,300
I've only loved watching this little distro since about version 15.

1008
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,800
Hey, that's way better than going back to the Mac or Windows. Am I right?

1009
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,700
Mm-hmm. Yeah, if it works for you.

1010
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,600
And in fact, I really appreciate that. It does give us good perspective.

1011
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,600
That's a really good use case to keep in mind.

1012
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,300
Well, and I feel like maybe Mint hasn't really changed that much since back then.

1013
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,700
I used to use it, I think it was around 17.

1014
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,800
17 is when I first got in, right up to 19.

1015
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:29,200
And the way that it doesn't like totally change the paradigm is also, I think, maybe an advantage.

1016
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,000
Yeah, it's a feature.

1017
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,100
Sure, for certain workloads, yeah.

1018
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:38,700
Emvon also wrote in with 2,000 sats, thanks for the weekly episodes,

1019
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:43,100
plenty of material to get me through 30 hours of driving out to the East Coast.

1020
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,100
30 hours, 30 hours.

1021
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,000
You know, when you say something like that, that's such a tease.

1022
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,900
Envy, you got to boost it and tell us like, where are you driving?

1023
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,900
Give us more. Because the commuter is the original podcaster's friend

1024
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,700
and there's less and less.

1025
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,800
And now we're hearing about new ways people are finding to listen to podcasts.

1026
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,000
I'm always curious, like if you were a commuter

1027
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,700
and you transitioned to like listening to the show during a different routine,

1028
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,300
what was it and how did it go?

1029
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,900
And are you able to stay current?

1030
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,800
I guess I'll find out. Boost it and let us know.

1031
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,400
But also, Envy, what are you doing?

1032
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,100
What are you driving? 30 hours of driving, is that per day?

1033
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,400
Are you driving more than there are hours in the day?

1034
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,000
Are you a time traveler? You got to give us more details, man.

1035
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,600
Is that there and back or just one way?

1036
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,700
Well, it's clearly just got to be, it's one way, right?

1037
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,200
I mean, it's got to be. There's no details, I assume.

1038
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,800
RobinWeb74 also wrote in with 3000 cents.

1039
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,600
Coming in hot with the boost.

1040
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,000
Hello from Slovenia.

1041
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,400
How many listeners do we have from my country?

1042
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,900
I like your shows. Thank you.

1043
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,600
I'll be first to say Slovenia isn't like the top of our list.

1044
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,000
But a lovely place I'd love to visit.

1045
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,300
You know, interesting factoid about Slovenia

1046
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,300
is that they have a reciprocal arrangement with Slovakia

1047
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:56,000
that they actually return each other's posts with the wrong address on it

1048
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,300
because they get confused so often.

1049
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,600
Well, I did look up the numbers before the show.

1050
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:08,800
We have just over 10,000 listeners as of this morning in that area.

1051
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,300
That is impressive.

1052
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,400
Which is just beating out the Republic of Lithuania

1053
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,200
where we have 9.2 thousand listeners.

1054
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:22,000
And just above Slovenia is Croatia with 10.6 thousand listeners.

1055
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
We love all of you and it's not a contest.

1056
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,500
Don't worry, but it might kind of be a contest.

1057
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,900
Yeah, it might be. It might be. But isn't that neat though?

1058
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:28,600
That's amazing.

1059
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:32,300
Yeah, and of course in that same region is Turkey and Saudi Arabia

1060
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,500
kind of in those same numbers a little bit more about 12,000 in Turkey.

1061
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,700
I was blown away when I saw that absolutely blown away

1062
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:43,800
and a little a little humble reminder that this is your world's largest Linux podcast

1063
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,600
and the numbers show it and those are to the hundreds.

1064
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,000
I mean like right down. I'm telling you Republic of Lithuania.

1065
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,900
I can tell you 9,217, right?

1066
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,300
Like it's beautiful.

1067
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,000
This old duck still got it lower third writes in longtime listener.

1068
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,900
First time booster.

1069
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:04,200
It's a real Mario and Luigi situation when it comes to Linux hardware on the cheap,

1070
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,400
but it's good to know that mate Mint and XFC have us covered.

1071
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,600
Great show.

1072
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,900
Or is it more of a Wario and Waluigi type situation?

1073
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,300
I don't know.

1074
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:19,200
I love it when we get a longtime listener first time booster.

1075
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,400
That's growing the Lightning Network

1076
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,500
and the Lightning Network is a peer-to-peer free software Network

1077
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,600
and we are seeing more and more free software projects come on

1078
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,100
and that means imagine the day when your favorite free software project.

1079
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,100
Maybe it's VLC.

1080
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:34,900
Maybe it's Nano.

1081
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:39,100
If you're a gentleman, you know, your favorite free software project comes online

1082
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,400
to the Lightning Network

1083
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,200
and you've got a wallet full of Satoshis because you've been listening to our podcast.

1084
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,400
That's how you start to monetize free software is we're building a network right now.

1085
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,900
It's going to make a difference.

1086
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,900
And so when we get Chiron aka lower third coming on for the first time after listening,

1087
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,100
we're building to that Network

1088
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:00,400
and there are now over 7,000 almost 8,000 podcasts on the Lightning Network.

1089
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,800
So that is pretty gosh-darn exciting.

1090
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:14,900
Mr. Quackers comes in with $2,222.

1091
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,100
That's another road, Dux.

1092
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,100
Quacka Wacka.

1093
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,000
It's a treasure.

1094
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,600
Yippee.

1095
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:26,500
They say the Asus VivoBook L2-03MA, 175 bones on Amazon.

1096
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,400
It's small.

1097
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,500
Not very powerful, but Fedora and KDE works just fine on there.

1098
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,400
It's not necessarily compatible with a FWAP manager, you know, you know for your LVSS.

1099
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,100
The old FWAP D.

1100
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:43,200
But you still can update the BIOS from the USB old-school style.

1101
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,100
I use it if I'm going somewhere and I don't really care if it gets lost or stolen.

1102
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,800
It's just not a big deal.

1103
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,900
I haven't used it in a while.

1104
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,600
But you know what?

1105
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,200
The battery when I did use it lasted 8 to 10 hours.

1106
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,200
I also have an X1 Carbon Fedora Edition.

1107
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,600
I think the recent BIOS update or maybe it was a kernel version increased my battery life to an extra hour.

1108
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,200
Have you experienced that?

1109
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,700
So my X1 Carbon has gotten better with time on Fedora as well, Quackers.

1110
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,800
And Nix as well.

1111
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,500
It is better now.

1112
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,100
It's still not the battery life where I'd like it to be,

1113
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:16,200
but I swear it is better than where it was when I first got it, which when does that happen?

1114
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:23,100
And you know, Wes and I follow the kernel updates pretty closely for the Linux Action News over there.

1115
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:30,900
And we have definitely seen a stream of Intel driver updates and improvements for power management from both AMD and Intel in the last year.

1116
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:37,300
So I think it's absolutely the case that when you get a newer kernel, when people say why do you want a new kernel in your Linux?

1117
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,500
Well, because it's usually faster and it has more hardware support and improvements.

1118
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,800
That's why, obviously.

1119
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,100
But yeah, I think a kernel update does improve your battery life because I've seen it happen.

1120
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,600
Quackers came in with a dubs boost with a row of ducks.

1121
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,400
Things are looking up for old nut duck.

1122
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:57,400
Just to clarify, I did mean the Asus VivoBook L203MA Ultra Thin Edition.

1123
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,400
It does look pretty nice.

1124
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,400
You know, it's got one of those 180 degree like fold flat screen kind of thing.

1125
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,600
It's pretty light. It's got USB-C. Really not bad for like $175.

1126
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,800
What?

1127
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,600
$184 at the time I'm looking at this.

1128
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,800
Alright, even still.

1129
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,800
But you know, you could get it by Friday.

1130
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,800
I mean, that's not bad, right?

1131
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,600
That's not bad.

1132
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,600
A machine by Friday during these days?

1133
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,600
Not so bad.

1134
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,300
SourceD just comes in with nothing but a row of ducks.

1135
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,300
That's very helpful, love ya.

1136
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,800
Thank you for the ducks.

1137
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,300
We also got some thank you boosts that I wanted to cover on the show.

1138
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,800
I'll just do a selection of these under the $2000 mark.

1139
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,300
1701 SATs from True Grits.

1140
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:39,600
Also doubling down on the idea of an unplugged core member's matrix exclusive chat room.

1141
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,700
I don't know how the heck we'd do it.

1142
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,000
Maybe just a private URL.

1143
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,700
But alright, we got a few plus ones for that.

1144
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,200
Mega Strike 3 sent in $2000 SATs.

1145
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,700
Just gas money for Brent.

1146
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,200
Thank you, thank you.

1147
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,200
And we got $1000 SATs from iBookie with a question that I wanted to cover.

1148
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,200
So what happens if I send a boost in and I think you guys missed it?

1149
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,200
What should you do?

1150
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:06,200
So the easiest resolution is when you boost in, if your username matches your matrix username,

1151
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,200
a lot of times I'll just coordinate with you on matrix.

1152
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:13,200
We'll get boosts in under $2000 SATs and I will follow up with them on matrix.

1153
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:18,200
The Golden Dragon boosted in just under $2000 SATs and so we were talking about a new board

1154
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,200
that he has that I think would be good for Home Assistant.

1155
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,700
Because he uses the same username in the boosts that he uses on the matrix, right?

1156
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,200
So I can track him down that way.

1157
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,200
But otherwise, if you're not on matrix, you can always send me an email.

1158
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,700
Chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

1159
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,700
Just give me a screenshot or a copy of it and we'll get it all sorted out.

1160
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:38,200
I try to read 100% of them, but I am but one man.

1161
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:43,700
However, Wes Payne has concocted a few ideas on how we'll be able to actually just import those messages

1162
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:48,700
into our various channels as appropriate down the road in the future, which is going to be really cool.

1163
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:55,700
Because it all turns out, I'm not even kidding, all of these boosts live in a database

1164
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,700
that has a Rust front end with an API.

1165
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,200
Well, you won't even install non-Rust software anymore.

1166
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,200
I keep trying to get you to consider some fun picks, but you just won't.

1167
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,200
That Dave Jones, he did it right. So yeah, we'll have that coming soon.

1168
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:13,200
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, go grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

1169
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,700
You can also check out Podverse.

1170
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:18,700
We mentioned that earlier. That's going to now have boosts on your mobile clients.

1171
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:22,200
And then if you really want to make it nerdy, Boost CLI.

1172
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,200
Although I think you got to have your own node and you got to have a command line client.

1173
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,700
So it's like, don't think of those as bad things.

1174
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,700
Just think of them as additional challenges to get your boost to the next level.

1175
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,200
Chris, I wonder, will you commit to reading all the Boost CLI?

1176
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,700
All right, for next week. Yeah. Yeah, for next week.

1177
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,700
We'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it.

1178
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:45,700
Because I think it's so cool because you got to get like a bunch of free software going to make it happen.

1179
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,700
Got a couple of picks for you this week.

1180
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,200
I have been trying out Fluffy Chat.

1181
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,700
You guys familiar with Fluffy Chat?

1182
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:57,700
It's one of the ones that have come up when we rattled off alternative matrix clients to Element.

1183
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,700
And I thought, let's give it a go.

1184
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,700
They've got a desktop version.

1185
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,200
They've got a mobile version.

1186
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,700
It's even an F-Droid.

1187
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,200
It's in the App Store for Apple.

1188
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,700
It's in the Play Store for Googs.

1189
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,700
You can run it in your browser.

1190
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,200
It's also available as a Flatpak and a Snap.

1191
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,700
All right, so all of the bases are covered.

1192
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:21,200
And it looks like a Telegram UI on top of Matrix or maybe a more traditional chat client.

1193
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:27,700
And so the idea is something other than Element to kind of make the Matrix chat experience a little more palatable.

1194
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,700
It's early, but I like it.

1195
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:38,700
And I think it's really, really good for one or two Matrix instances you're on, maybe for friends and family.

1196
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,700
I can see it really useful for that.

1197
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,700
Does it do threads?

1198
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,700
Yeah, I think so.

1199
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,700
I actually don't know if I've engaged in any threads, but I think so.

1200
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,700
Does it do encrypted DMs?

1201
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,700
Yeah, yeah, it does do that.

1202
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,700
And it supports spaces and that kind of stuff.

1203
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:59,200
It's actually really, it's got most of the chat experience you want and it is open source as well.

1204
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,700
So it's up on GitLab and there is an F-Droid repo for it.

1205
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,700
How fluffy is it?

1206
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,700
It's pretty fluffy.

1207
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:07,700
I miss Element when I use it, I have to be honest.

1208
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,700
It really does get that like base experience with.

1209
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:16,700
I set my wife up with Element so that way she could participate in our West Coast crew Matrix room for the road trip.

1210
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,700
And I gave her Element and it's been fine.

1211
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:22,700
But I realized afterwards maybe that would have been a good opportunity for fluffy chat

1212
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:27,700
because it just operates and looks more like a traditional chat client.

1213
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,700
I don't know how else to put it.

1214
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,700
And so if Element has been the sticky point for you in adopting Matrix,

1215
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,700
I think fluffy chat is worth looking at.

1216
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:41,700
For myself, after using Element for a while, I am no longer really suffering from those pain points that I was.

1217
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:48,700
My brain has made the adaptations necessary and the Element team has made some of the improvements and we just kind of met halfway.

1218
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:53,700
So you said pretty fluffy, but I think it's more of like a zero to cottonwood in your server kind of scale today.

1219
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,700
Yeah, I'd say it's cottonwood.

1220
01:07:55,700 --> 01:08:00,700
I'd say it's cottonwood, but not like jammed up your air vents so your hard drives are overheating cottonwood

1221
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,700
or plugging up your power splitters kind of cottonwood.

1222
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:10,700
It's just like fluffy, nice to see cottonwood going through the air and you're like, oh, it's like it's snowing in August.

1223
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:15,700
Wes, you found us a little command line tool for the learning and the educationals.

1224
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,700
Yeah, that's right. Maybe you're trying to do some kind of spaced repetition.

1225
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,700
You've got something you're studying for.

1226
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:25,700
Now there is the great Anki program that maybe folks have used, open source,

1227
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:31,700
great little powerful intelligent flashcard system, but it can be kind of a lot sometimes if you, you know,

1228
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:36,700
you're the kind of person that might procrastinate by fiddling with things and trying to set up their new tool

1229
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,700
more than just using that tool, which has happened to me before.

1230
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:44,700
So try Learn, L-R-N, it's just a simple little terminal app.

1231
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,700
You can prefill it with a bunch of self-prepared questions or flashcards.

1232
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:51,700
And then you've got two modes in the match mode. You type an answer to a question.

1233
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:56,700
Otherwise, you can do like a cards mode that's more like just a traditional little flashcard where you get to see the question

1234
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,700
and then flip the answer and you kind of decide if you knew it or not.

1235
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,700
And it's on the command line. I'm sure you said that, but it's all on the command line.

1236
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:06,700
So you can just bring it up in your terminal and get to learning.

1237
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,700
That's pretty great. L-R-N. We'll put a link to that in the show notes.

1238
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:16,700
So you can find all that at linuxunplug.com slash 471.

1239
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,700
And I'd love some suggestions for picks as well.

1240
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:23,700
You can send them in via the contact page, linuxunplug.com slash contact,

1241
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,700
or you can boost them in with your new podcast app as you do.

1242
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:30,700
And of course, I want to invite you live. Get in here. Join us.

1243
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:38,700
It's an experience to watch us live. I mean, kind of take some of the shine off, I have to say,

1244
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,700
because, you know, it's like you can really enjoy a hot dog,

1245
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:45,700
but then when you go to the factory and see how they make the hot dog.

1246
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:50,700
Yeah, Brent won't put, he just won't put on a shirt.

1247
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:55,700
Yeah. So, I mean, you could take the factory tour if you like over at Jupiter.Tube.

1248
01:09:55,700 --> 01:10:00,700
We do the show live every Sunday at noon Pacific, which is like 3 p.m. East Coast time,

1249
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:03,700
3 p.m. Alex time over at Jupiter.Tube.

1250
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,700
See you next week. Same bad time, same bad station.

1251
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:12,700
And a big, very hearty thank you to our members who help give us the runway to talk to the sponsors

1252
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,700
we feel are appropriate for our audience.

1253
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:19,700
They give us the flexibility to say no to those weird emails that come in.

1254
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:24,700
And of course, they help orient us from a business perspective towards our audience.

1255
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,700
You can become an Unplugged Core member over at unpluggedcore.com

1256
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:32,700
or support the entire network of shows over at Jupiter.Party.

1257
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:38,700
And last but not least, if you'd like to contribute a bit of value in the time and talent sense,

1258
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:46,700
go check out new.JupiterBroadcasting.com, get a look-see on, hook your peepers on the new website,

1259
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,700
and then head over to our GitHub.

1260
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:53,700
You'll find our Jupiter Broadcasting.com GitHub project and give us your feedbacks

1261
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:57,700
and maybe contribute your time for your fixings and your codes.

1262
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:58,700
That's a thing, right?

1263
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,700
Who knows? You might just see a wild Brent.

1264
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:01,700
You never know.

1265
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,700
And then last but not least, if you want more news, you want more Linux,

1266
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,700
you want to know what's going on in the world of open source,

1267
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:09,700
LinuxActionNews.com.

1268
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:38,700
Thanks so much for joining us. See you right back here next Sunday.

1269
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:50,700
Hey, breaking news here.

1270
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:51,700
Hi, bitch.

1271
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:56,700
But I've just been informed by Kenji over in the chat room that it turns out me accidentally

1272
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:01,700
mentioned Anki, a little flashcard app, they're converting their Python code base to Rust.

1273
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:02,700
Oh, no.

1274
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,700
Sneaky last-minute Rust pick.

1275
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:05,700
Can't escape it today.

1276
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:08,700
That's three different Rust drops in one show.

1277
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,700
And Linux 6.0 isn't even here yet.

1278
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,700
We need to follow in.

1279
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,700
We need to follow up on that server update, Wes.

1280
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,700
You got your SSH session still going over there?

1281
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,700
Oh, I do.

1282
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,700
Come on now.

1283
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,700
You forgot all about it, didn't you?

1284
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,700
No, no.

1285
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:28,700
Well, we've been, because Arch is like running Gen 2, we've been building our AUR helper,

1286
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:29,700
you know?

1287
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:30,700
Oh, good.

1288
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:31,700
I'm glad we're doing the AUR updates, too.

1289
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,700
Wouldn't want to miss the AUR updates.

1290
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:37,700
I mean, hey, DFS, DKMS is in there.

1291
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,700
That's actually true, yeah.

1292
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,700
Oh, right.

1293
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:44,700
That is a problem with the way we do it on Arch, is the DKMS module for ZFS is in there.

1294
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:48,700
Is it the only problem?

1295
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:51,700
So where is it at right now?

1296
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,700
Still building.

1297
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:59,700
But, you know, all the main AUR updates, we did have a whole lot of GPG signatures to

1298
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,700
update, so I just ended up doing that in a separate step to before, because that was

1299
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:03,700
going to be simpler.

1300
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:06,700
That is the biggest problem when you don't update an Arch box in a while, is all the

1301
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:07,700
GPG keys.

1302
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,700
But after that, main upgrade went totally smooth.

1303
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,700
All right.

1304
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,700
So our main upgrade's done.

1305
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:13,700
Yeah, we got a new kernel and stuff.

1306
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,700
We're going to get some updated ZFS.

1307
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:20,700
Going to make sure that that's going to build.

1308
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:37,700
Find out next week, I guess.
