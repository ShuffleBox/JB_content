1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
anybody in the mumble room using something besides just the default

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,400
terminal for their desktop like I love I love console so that's almost always the

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,840
one I go to but anybody using something besides the default like term X

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:20,440
terminator terminator yeah yeah oh really okay I I recommend hyper

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,560
Pokemon this is something that dark crack team here at Linux unplugged has

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,180
discovered and I just want you to give it a consideration it's wondrous

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,720
tailor-made Pokemon themes for hyper terminal okay so just give that a

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,360
consideration while the link in the show notes it's for all you Pokemon

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:45,720
enthusiasts this is Linux unplugged episode 202 for June 20th 2017

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,240
Oh welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show where your host

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,600
is being bombarded by BSD enthusiasts it's a full-on attack I'll tell you more

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,960
about that later out of the show mr. West is in route right now battling

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,120
Seattle traffic but the show goes on he'll be slipstreaming himself into the

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,240
show he'll be live patching himself into the podcast in a little bit in the

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,680
meantime we have some community updates to get through including some really

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,480
important security news for Kmail users up front huge update from the fedora

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,440
project we're gonna dig into some shenanigans going on out there we'll

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,760
tell you about that there's a mystery afoot and some mess what I know it's

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,200
very confusing and then mr. Michael Hall joins us formally from canonical now at

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,840
endless to tell us what he and endless is up to and then towards the very end

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,800
of the show we have a random grab bag I have some updates on something we talked

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,120
about last week and if time permits although we have so much stuff to get to

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,720
this week I have an interview from the floor of self that we haven't had a

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,200
chance to play yet in the show now it's not super time-critical so if time

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,720
doesn't permit never fear we could always sneak it into later time but if

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,840
the show permits we'll get to that so before we jump into all of our community

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,100
updates for episode 202 before I start talking about the barbecue coming up in

28
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,400
a couple of weeks before we get to our follow-up let's bring in our mumble room

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:26,600
time-approved screening mumble room Wow I feel like I feel like if I was in a

30
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,040
room and we were in a physical room and you all did that I would nearly go into

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,080
an anxiety attack but for some reason you're all coming into my headphones I

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,440
maybe it's even more intense but thank you guys for being here I'm looking

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,000
forward to chatting about all this stuff Michael welcome back to the show mr.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Hall it's good to have you like this is your third time I think you might be a

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,600
record holder yeah do you do like the SNL like five-timer jacket or something

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,320
I think I should get one of those I think we should I think we should

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,920
probably you could be the person that starts that tradition you never know and

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,680
it would be a good jacket too like not one of these WWDC jeans jacket but all

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,840
really nice materials I'm afraid you'd have to give Alan and Martin like a full

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,760
wardrobe though yeah there'd have to be a line between like occasional guests

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,280
and frequent contributor because those guys basically would have not just the

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,840
wardrobe but they'd also have to have like a whole line of like swag just for

43
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,200
them of them for their attendance although although to be fair if you keep

44
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,400
it up at this rate you might beat them because they've been very busy on

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,160
Tuesdays recently so they haven't been able to join us of course it is

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,320
obviously I mean what else you got going on so we do have a few really positive

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,520
stories to get into but I wanted to cover one that's I don't know if I don't

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,320
know if negative is the right way to describe it but I did want to cover one

49
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,120
that is pretty important for Kmail users Kmail send later feature when combined

50
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:53,600
with K K mails PGP support didn't work and so if you were scheduling emails

51
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,520
with the understanding that they'd be encrypted when they were sent later

52
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,280
those emails were getting sent in the clear text they were just getting sent

53
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,240
plain text no encryption applied at all even though the UI would suggest

54
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,320
encryption was being applied to that email the back-end scheduler that

55
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,160
actually grabbed that queue and sent the emails off didn't go through the open

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,480
PGP system and so those routines were completely bypassed leading to the email

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,760
being sent in plain text without being signed or encrypted which is even just

58
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,240
getting not not getting signed is a big deal and so the bug would lead to

59
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,680
unintentional information disclosure of private messages and it's CVE 2017 96 04

60
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,560
how about that and the KD project is aware of it versions 4.11 that's when

61
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,920
the send later feature was introduced and 1704.1 are vulnerable Kmail version

62
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:50,880
so it's versions between 4.11 guys to 1704 Kmail version 1704.2 released on

63
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,320
June 8th of this year contains a fix for the problem and so this is one of those

64
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,200
where I'm not sure what distros are patching I haven't I didn't look into

65
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,720
that but I'm not sure if it's getting back ported to older desktop versions by

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,880
the distro maintainers or what there is there is several there are several links

67
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,440
that more information about it but that just is one of those things you know

68
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,840
it's just like you you're using a tool you think you're using encryption and

69
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,640
maybe you have a reason why you especially like when you're doing this

70
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,680
type of communications you had very limited amounts of doing some of our

71
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,760
work for some of our other shows timing is sometimes kind of an important thing

72
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,880
about it because like you're writing somebody something and you want to send

73
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,040
it off after something after a piece of news breaks or after after a story comes

74
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,040
out then you want the email so the timing thing of really sensitive

75
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,200
communication turns out to be pretty pretty important so this is a this is

76
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,720
one of those where if I have I ran a Linux critics blog I would be extremely

77
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,520
harsh about this because it's an example I think of a vulnerability and I don't

78
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,040
need to harp on this too hardly but I do think it's an example of a

79
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,240
vulnerability that if say

80
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,880
Gmail had this problem or even say Apple Mail on the iPhone had this problem it

81
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,760
would be there would be mobs in the streets there would be mobs in the

82
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,760
streets about about this lack of security and this simple obvious amateur

83
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:25,280
mistake by these companies but when it's K mail and we all love the the K mail

84
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,560
folks I mean it's not like we want to blame shame anybody here but when it's K

85
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,160
mail we're all just like oh okay good I'll go and get those patches installed

86
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,680
and then we don't really even talk about I mean this is this is a story from June

87
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,240
and I was like nobody's talking about this so I think it's an I think it's

88
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,760
worth mentioning

89
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,820
a HRS points out they don't you says it's a Gmail doesn't support GPG but you

90
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,600
get my drift right if there was a critical vulnerability in something like

91
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,160
this in a in a commercial product we how we hold it to a different standard

92
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,560
WW do you agree do you I mean you see what I'm saying here at least like if

93
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,540
this was Gmail that had a flaw of this magnitude I feel like there would be a

94
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,000
totally different level not just because the users are larger but because the

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,800
expectations are different or do you think oh yeah yeah I think if this was

96
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,400
happening on Gmail and I like I'm a Gmail user even though I'm going through

97
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,680
Thunderbird I would probably demand a fence you know you would have want to be

98
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,480
left out of this you know former bro Levy and have your stuff out and open

99
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,320
and to their credit you know they when they found out about it they hustled to

100
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,320
get it fixed and they've been really clear on their communication about it's

101
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,880
not like they're trying to like snuff the story out it just doesn't seem to

102
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,120
get maybe I mean I'm sure user base size must be part of it I don't know feels

103
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,240
like more than that though one of the stories getting a lot of traction is

104
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,040
this post by Christian Shaler on the future of fedora just even beyond

105
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,280
workstation 26 and there's a couple of things I pulled out in here that have me

106
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,160
super excited about just long term fedora not not a lot of stuff we get our

107
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,760
hands on immediately but long term they're working on improving integration

108
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,960
of the NVIDIA binary driver which is kind of remarkable talking about the

109
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,240
fedora project here but they think they have a salute they're gonna have a

110
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,520
solution in place where you can use the NVIDIA driver when you want the extra

111
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,440
graphics and graphics power and they think that it's going to be a pretty

112
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,200
smooth installation and they're also working on a fleet commander which will

113
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,560
allow which will be a tool essentially to allow you to manage fedora and red

114
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,600
hat enterprise desktop centrally it's a tool that's really targeted more like

115
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
universities and large installations but I don't know it could be pretty cool and

116
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,880
the the other thing is they're gonna help you integrate it with their free

117
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,520
IPA suite of tools so it's essentially going to give you an LDAP active

118
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,760
directory style like active directory support but the one that I really want

119
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,520
to talk about in this post and I think this is probably why this post is

120
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,640
getting the most attention is pipewire we've talked about it before on the show

121
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,000
when it was called pinnows and now it's been renamed to pipewire and they're

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,520
increasing the scope of what pipewire is going to accomplish so think of it maybe

123
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,480
at first pass as pulse audio for everything video and audio it aims at

124
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,680
unifying Linux audio and video the long-term goal is for pipewire to not

125
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:23,120
only provide handling of video streams but also handle all kinds of audio

126
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,600
wow I got to stop right there that if they pull that off that's the homefield

127
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,480
advantage Mac OS has for media production because they they have that

128
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,960
whole quick time and core audio and core video system worked out where there's

129
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:48,160
just API's available and Final Cut 10 just sits on top of that technology so

130
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,760
they're spending a lot of time to make sure that pipewire can handle audio in a

131
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,440
way that not only addresses pulse audio use cases but also the ones that are

132
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,880
handled by Jack today wow a big part of motivation for this is they want to make

133
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,280
fedora workstation the best place to create content and we want the pro audio

134
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:14,000
crowd to be first-class citizens of our desktop oh my god wow so this is huge

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,320
this is really really huge is if they can if they can get this even close it's

136
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,000
gonna be it's gonna be a phenomenal phenomenal groundwork for multimedia

137
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,480
applications also flat packs so they expect to start shipping pipewire in

138
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,760
fedora workstation 27 which is pretty soon if you think about it but it it's

139
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,880
only gonna be sort of like the first version the really early stuff it's gonna

140
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,480
handle video and they say one of the reasons they need to do that is to

141
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,120
handle video for flat back applications because I got a they got to give it like

142
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,960
up they got a poke a portal for video and so they're gonna also provide an API

143
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,760
for flat packs and get ready for this

144
00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:00,160
an API for screen capture under Wayland this is one of the number one questions

145
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,000
I get about Wayland I had one just just it came into the show 45 minutes before

146
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,440
I went on air what about what about remote access to Wayland what about

147
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,680
screen capture software in Wayland this is gonna be huge for desktop users of

148
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,240
Wayland that wanted to screen capture that that want to maybe have a remote

149
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,260
desktop system this could lead to all of that potentially so pipewire to the

150
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,760
rescue for more for media production and also for the Wayland transition then

151
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:34,280
there was this moment oh man I wish Wes was in here so I could see his face in

152
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,160
this one so they make a post and they make a part in here little section here

153
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,840
about fractional scaling for high DPI systems fractional scaling a lot of talk

154
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,760
about that recently we've been talking about that recently because there was

155
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,080
that hack fest between canonical and gnome developers at canonicals what was

156
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,240
it Taipei offices well it turns out fedora workstation has been leading the

157
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,400
charge in supporting high DPI on Linux they write and they hope to build on

158
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,400
that current work to enable fractional scaling support where they link to the

159
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,520
gnome.org blog post about the fractional scaling hack fest and he goes on to talk

160
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,200
about the importance of fractional scaling now they're gonna be there to

161
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,720
support that when it's ready and some great work also going into just the

162
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,880
general performance of gnome shell all this almost feels like a direct

163
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,920
criticism response of mine recently and I'm happy to see this they are closing

164
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,960
bugs on small little performance issues in mutter and gnome shell it's coming on

165
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,080
top of earlier work that they've done and while it's a real you know subjective

166
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,480
thing they are working on quote-unquote gnomes performance and quote-unquote

167
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,240
gnomes overhead to make gnome shell even more performant in future versions of

168
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,760
fedora which of course is going to benefit everyone using the gnome desktop

169
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,040
then there's a little note in here about flat packs they say essentially what

170
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,560
we're doing is making it very simple for a fedora maintainer to build a flat pack

171
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,200
of an application they maintain through the fedora package building

172
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:04,440
infrastructure and push that flat back into a central flat pack registry hmm so

173
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,200
they're gonna make it easier for people to ship flat packs as well good stuff

174
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,120
overall about about about firmware updates they're getting closer to

175
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,680
shipping codecs just as everybody's streaming things and it doesn't matter

176
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,640
anymore yeah we're glad we fought that and this is a big one I will end on this

177
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,080
I think yeah we'll end on this yeah this will be good battery life they're

178
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,560
looking into hopefully making a dent here they say for a while now we've been

179
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,680
digging into this and we'll hopefully share information soon on which laptops

180
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,640
users should buy that will have good battery life under fedora hmm they also

181
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,760
have a they they have a point Christian Kellner or Kellner is the main point on

182
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,080
battery life and taking up improving battery life benchmark tools that they

183
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,880
use so hopefully we'll see a distribution taking battery life very

184
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,200
seriously one that's very gnome focused again pretty good because it turns out a

185
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,000
lot of districts are shipping something based on no shell these days that's a

186
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,360
lot of that's a lot of stuff coming for fedora after just last week I said it's

187
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,680
fine it's fine it's all right is anybody in the mumble room have any

188
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,440
reactions or responses to any of that stuff that I just rambled on about go

189
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:19,400
ahead no only the Western already does a spawn RTP back end so oh oh okay I I

190
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,720
guess I think you may have heard that yeah do you just put in the term I'd

191
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,040
love to know more about that so it's like a full-on RDP like Microsoft

192
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,800
remote desktop protocol back end for Weston basically using free RDP and

193
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,760
using those libraries as well so there is an implementation of it for wayland

194
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,800
but only in Western for some reason I don't know why the desktop something up

195
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,560
hmm yeah well and Weston is sort of like the reference right so if they just they

196
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,360
don't have to necessarily choose to use that part of the reference of limitation

197
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,520
I suppose no I mean they could use their own interface for the libraries they

198
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,280
could but they just see the talk is there so I think part of it is to like a

199
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,720
lot of them are adapting their existing compositors or existing systems to use

200
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,480
wayland instead of creating something from scratch so maybe some of that might

201
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,400
be belted on later I don't know that's interesting that you know I'm gonna I'm

202
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,600
gonna take a look at that more thanks for attuned it for for linking that

203
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,000
that's pretty cool that's pretty cool anyways we'll have a link to the fedora

204
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,440
26 workstation post I go ahead sorry I think the flat back thing is rather

205
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,720
interesting tell me does that could some kind of replace the PPAs of Ubuntu if

206
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,240
you have a build server that can build some flag packs out of the sources you

207
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,200
imagine the same thing as snap packages with to get service like some kind of

208
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:43,260
open build service yeah that would be rather cool I think that you that would

209
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,120
be really cool you guys know about flat hub right so this is I think separate

210
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,680
than flat hub but no go tell go on about flat that's cuz it's pretty interesting

211
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,640
so flat hub is this kind of centralized flat pack repository it spun out of the

212
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,160
gnome work it's independent of gnome now and trying to get buy-in from app

213
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,560
developers and platform developers and it's really just to ease discovery and

214
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,160
distribution of flat packs by having one place where you know distros can set up

215
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,960
by default users can just go there and find whatever apps are available yeah

216
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,360
they're there they were last week we talked a little bit about they're

217
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,920
looking to raise some funding and I like that they're I like that they're trying

218
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,080
to set something up that's independent which is great and whenever you're

219
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,240
trying to figure out like what software is available it's nice to have a central

220
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,280
place to go to go see what applications so if you go to flat pack org slash apps

221
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,040
dot HTML you can get all the GUI or command-line apps there's quite a bit of

222
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,880
stuff really I mean there's some good stuff in here like core bird is pretty

223
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,400
nice and discord and gnome mpv shoot shoot yeah so there's some good stuff in

224
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:57,760
there and yeah flat pack flat pack org slash apps dot HTML for that yeah I I

225
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,720
think that's fascinating so speaking of competing technologies that's kind of a

226
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,680
similar similar trend everybody's everybody's friend Lenart Pottering has

227
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:15,760
a new tool new a new project and it's ca-sync casa-sync I'm not sure ca-sync

228
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,360
I'm gonna call it and it's it's it's a tool for distributing file system images

229
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,760
it combines the idea of the our sync algorithm with the idea of git style

230
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,200
content addressable file systems and creates a new system for efficiently

231
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,340
storing and delivering file system images and for optimizing for high

232
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,160
frequency update cycles over the internet with a focus on delivering to

233
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,640
IOT devices containers VMs applications portable services or entire OS images

234
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,080
but he hopes to extend it to later in later on down the road to more of a

235
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,080
generic way a fashion to become useful for backups and home directory

236
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,040
synchronization as well and he goes through his blog post here and says he

237
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,320
took a look at the different approaches out there he says he wanted something

238
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,320
that made updates cheap he wanted something that respected boundaries on

239
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,120
disk space and usage on servers something that was friendly to content

240
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,760
distribution networks something that was simple and he does specifically in here

241
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,540
address systems that operate on block layer and replace squash FS images you

242
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,720
know I don't updates and they just right over the squash FS image and then mount

243
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,680
it he seems to not like that approach which I think is kind of the I could be

244
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,360
wrong on the details but I think it's kind of the Ubuntu core approach and he

245
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,320
wants to he goes on to say later on delivering direct squash FS or other

246
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,560
file system images is almost beautifully simple but of course it means every

247
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,040
update requires a full download of the newest image which is both bad for disk

248
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,240
usage and for generated traffic even though you can try to hack it with z-sync

249
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,880
and things like that he says besides the issues I pointed out already I just

250
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,120
wasn't happy with the security and root reproducibility properties of these

251
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,840
systems either so this isn't like a flat pack snap packages alternative but it is

252
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:07,000
like a whole new way to distribute OS updates and images I think he was

253
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,720
working on something in the past that use butter FS to accomplish something

254
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,360
kind of similar to this but this is different than like say are just using

255
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,400
our sink or OS tree or similar tools because those tools he is doing

256
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,680
something where he's removing all of the file boundaries and then he chunks

257
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,720
things up small files get lumped together with their siblings large files

258
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,920
get chopped into pieces and then he can recognize similarities between all of

259
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,280
those files beyond just there you know beyond the file boundaries make sure all

260
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,800
the chunks are distributed and then send them around and the chunking algorithm

261
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,040
is based on buzz hash which is a rolling hash function and shaw 256 is used to

262
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,120
store the hash functions to generate the digits of the chunks I know it's super

263
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,000
complicated it's all up on its blog up on his blog post what do you think

264
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,120
www you loving this no I'm not loving it because it reminds me of how I'm

265
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,560
recovering files and I can't even use any of hash functionality or anything to

266
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:15,440
double-check files and I have one files merged with other files and compressed

267
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,000
containers and all kinds of junk so no this just does not sound appealing to

268
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,600
me at all I I feel like it is complicated to understand and this

269
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,880
diagram isn't doing any benefits but there are other operating systems out

270
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,200
there like plan 9 and there's other systems out there that have this

271
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,720
functionality at an OS level and it's it's really nice because you can

272
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,040
essentially send a system from one system to the other system booted up and

273
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,520
it's live you can clone it you can you can send an update over the internet and

274
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,800
if it fails you know you have recourse you can slowly trickle something to a

275
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,120
device when you have a limited bandwidth connection and then have it assemble the

276
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,640
updates on its side and then do itself you know screw itself over in the

277
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:12,520
upgrade process so I I totally recognize on the surface of it a need that it

278
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,520
seems to be addressing just like I did with system D when when system D was

279
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,000
announced then I was like oh yeah like the network socket stuff and some of

280
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,800
these other things are really pretty useful in the server space this is one

281
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,680
of those where when you have systems that have all kinds of random ass

282
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,320
containers or dozens of containers running on it you do kind of need a way

283
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,200
to manage all of it that sort of standardized at the OS level that goes

284
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:43,240
just beyond beyond just software delivery but actually addresses

285
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,920
delivering and managing the operating system and you do want something that's

286
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,120
sort of almost like the plumbing level and he's pretty good at that kind of

287
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,200
stuff but I do wonder if it's competing with other solutions that have already

288
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,120
been created I got to learn more I'm gonna study more into it but if anybody

289
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,400
else has done a deep dive and can help me figure it out I'd appreciate it whole

290
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
thing is really fascinating he talks about where it could go down the road

291
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,800
talks about how you can operate at the block level or the file system level

292
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:15,840
anyways there's there's he's already I mean he's already got essentially this

293
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,440
is what's crazy about Lenart he's already essentially built the whole damn

294
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,000
basics here he's got functional code you can use right now I really I just find

295
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,680
this to be one of those one of those things where it's he creates something

296
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,640
that's slightly slightly thought-provoking and sometimes causes a

297
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,360
strong reaction and it's so ca-sync and we'll have a link in the show notes if

298
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,120
you want to see more about that ca-sync by Lenart quite the quite the transition

299
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,800
he's made over the years anybody else have any thoughts on it before we move on

300
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,560
I'll throw in a quick related story I guess I have I guess I have a thought

301
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,960
then if nobody else does just a quick update canonical has released a new

302
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,560
stable version of the snap craft utility for creating snap packages and this one

303
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,320
supports resuming downloads of the core snap when a building them like a when

304
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,320
building a classic snap or an air occurs or something like that the package can't

305
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,440
be if you know this just happens sometimes you can't fetch do you can't

306
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,980
fetch and this is going to be very handy for anybody that's trying to do that or

307
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,680
people that are doing continuous integration they will continually be

308
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,040
downloading pulling things down and sometimes the snap just fails to grab

309
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,160
something and this is gonna help that maybe the connection resets cuz like for

310
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,800
me I'm on a my file lot this can be really cool so good for them everything

311
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,880
is continuing to move forward I say it's it's good to see all kinds you've got

312
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,800
flat we got news on flat packs we got news on snap packages Katie and live

313
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,960
today just announced that they're shipping the next test version of Katie

314
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,000
and live via app image for the first time or like they said something about

315
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,040
the first time we're shipping this an app image so they're still doubling

316
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,880
they've been talking about it before but they're doubling down an app image it is

317
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,720
and now let notes got see a sink so welcome to Linux everybody it's a party

318
00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:03,080
hey and you're welcome to join it and just bring your own booze now I don't

319
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,080
know what to make of it I don't I don't care it's just as long as I can install

320
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,080
software if I could pick one I'd probably go with snaps or app images but

321
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,640
I'm happy with flat packs do I'll take PPA 2.0 just get it to me just just yeah

322
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,600
BYO packaging exactly you know let's talk about digital ocean for a second

323
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
let's take a moment and talk about something that's really simple and

324
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,280
straightforward it's an easy way to spin up a Linux rig on their super powerful

325
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,160
infrastructure in just seconds and probably less than a minute you could

326
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,200
have a Linux system up on one of their many data centers all over the world

327
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,920
with a 40 gigabit connection coming into that hypervisor they got SSD storage for

328
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,440
everything an interface that is so easy to use if you're a total noob or a long

329
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,200
time expert you're gonna have a good time and then when you're ready to grow

330
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,320
it's easy to increase your memory attach highly available block storage it's also

331
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,560
all SSD based a simple I API when you start having multiple systems monitoring

332
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,640
alerting to make you look like a boss and you're on top of things load

333
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,400
balancing as a service and ladies and gentlemen a brand new baby coming soon

334
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:13,240
object storage yeah yeah and if you sign up for early access you can receive one

335
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,280
terabyte for free through October 31st oh my gosh they don't they don't like

336
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,600
they don't ever rest like they don't do they just never take a vacation over a

337
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,440
digital ocean they're wrong like they just rolled out the new cloud firewall

338
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,760
which is such a brilliant thing now this object storage a simple easy cost

339
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:38,680
effective way man this is brilliant digital ocean is just killing it go to

340
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,200
digital ocean calm use our promo code do unplugged apply that after you create

341
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,680
your account you get a $10 credit and you can start messing around build a

342
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,840
system put it in production learn more digital ocean calm and use our promo code

343
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,080
do unplugged it's all one word you just apply it to your account digital ocean

344
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,080
calm promo code do unplugged so you heard mr. Michael Hall just a little bit

345
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,200
ago chatting with us and he joins us today but not from canonical anymore but

346
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:14,240
from now now flying the endless flag is the is the flag is it sort of is it is

347
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,440
it like really well rounded on the corners and with beautiful

348
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:25,960
translucencies and what's that flag look like Michael welcome back to the color

349
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,000
scheme I'm I'm picking up the whole thing it's a big change and yet not a

350
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,840
whole big change so I was talking about endless a few weeks ago on the show when

351
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,040
I was talking about how I think the future for gnome is extremely bright

352
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,840
beyond just the fact that more people are working on it and everybody just a

353
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,200
lot of things are lining up for gnome right now and on my list of things that

354
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,040
are lining up for gnome in the positive direction was endless and endless OS

355
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,920
which I believe is based on gnome shell am I right it is yeah it's got a

356
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,240
modified version of gnome shell so what is the what is endless about what is

357
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,960
sort of the elevator pitch on to endless for people that aren't familiar so the

358
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,760
company's mission summed up in a single sentence is the whole world empowered

359
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,440
and it's basically there are about three billion people who want a desktop but

360
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,800
don't have access to one for one reason or another and the company's mission is

361
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:23,280
to make a desktop that works for them price point they have the internet that

362
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,600
they have because a lot of desktops right now if you don't have internet

363
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,520
access or you've got very unreliable or very expensive internet access a lot of

364
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,440
the stuff that you know regular PCs will do but yeah are not available yeah when

365
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,880
they when the internet goes out which happens from time to time my smartphone

366
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,160
and my PC like I I have it happened recently I sat there Michael and I

367
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,960
thought to myself well what the hell did I do with my computer before I had the

368
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,560
internet like I doubt there was a time mean very long time before I was

369
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,840
regularly connected to the internet and now when it's out I it feels like

370
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,440
everything I can't search I can't reference Wikipedia I can't really pull

371
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,440
down my email it's it feels extremely limited so how does how does endless

372
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,000
address that specifically so there's a couple ways we go about it one is

373
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,280
preloading content like you said you go to Wikipedia a lot but how many pages of

374
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,360
Wikipedia do you actually go and see at any given time you can fit thousands and

375
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,040
thousands of these pages onto a few gigabytes of hard drive space so we'll

376
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,000
preload a whole bunch of Wikipedia content onto the hard drive of these

377
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,640
computers that go out so that all that information is there whether they have

378
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,480
internet access or not and then the second thing that we're working on is

379
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:44,560
what we call asynchronous internet and that's ways to deliver content in either

380
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,560
times where internet is cheap or when in the brief periods where they are

381
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:55,160
connected so sort of batching up like updates exactly so like if you've got a

382
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,120
newsreader app or something you've got an app for your local newspaper it

383
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,960
doesn't need to go and download the content every time you open the app it

384
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,640
can go download it overnight and get you you know the next day's stories already

385
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,480
there for you and a lot of the the bandwidth expense in a lot of the areas

386
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,720
of the world that we're targeting is really cheap at night when everybody's

387
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,960
asleep so people can download content when it's cheap use it offline when it's

388
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,160
expensive so why not why not a few apps on top of

389
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,800
Ubuntu why why a whole OS why why a complete solution because it feels like

390
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,720
it's more than just a desktop it feels like it's a whole integrated product and

391
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,880
solution it is it's actually it's built off of OS tree and flat packs oh okay

392
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,280
so the OS image is delivered through OS tree we can do transactional updates of

393
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,640
that and then you add apps to it via flat packs from GNOME software that's

394
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,440
some edge that's some cutting-edge stuff there yep and you know part of what

395
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,560
we're doing is we're working on a way now where you can load apps or OS

396
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:06,280
updates or even like application content updates onto a USB stick from a computer

397
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,720
that has internet access and then take it to a whole bunch of these computers

398
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,800
that don't have it and they can use what's on that USB stick just like they

399
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,560
would connecting to a remote server so they can get their OS updates they can

400
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,360
install applications they can refresh you know their news app whatever hmm and

401
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:30,600
so are they are they focused it's only on like the the markets that have like

402
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,840
occasional internet and and things like that or are they looking at also the

403
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,360
broader Linux desktop market that is the the specific market and it's kind of a

404
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,720
vague definition because it's not just like you know in Africa or parts of South

405
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,560
America but there's work being done right now in prison systems where those

406
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,160
computers are not connected to the internet ever for obvious reasons sure

407
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,080
but they still need a way to put updates on there get new content on there make

408
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,960
them useful without putting them actually on the internet absolutely gosh

409
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,720
that may avoid there must be there must be so many use cases for that and

410
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,720
there's really nobody that's rushing to fill that void because everybody wants

411
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,120
to integrate their OS is with their cloud product exactly but you know a lot

412
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,120
of these technologies that you were just talking about with flat pack and you

413
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,700
know like see async and everything they're all again make it easier to do

414
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:28,200
all of this offline or asynchronously so why um why also hardware because it's

415
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,280
pretty unique stuff it's got a unique look a unique design is this is this

416
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,040
part of the we don't just give out an image but is this part of the whole it's

417
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,200
one product thing so that to give it a little bit of history the the original

418
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,720
attempt that the company made was to use mobile hardware like tablets or phones

419
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,640
oh interesting they were gonna have them plug into a TV for a monitor you know

420
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,760
you might call like a convergence type experience yeah similar to what you know

421
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,200
a bunch of was going for but that that wasn't working out for them and they

422
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,280
tried some variations on that before settling on actually doing a desktop OS

423
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:11,640
based on Linux so once they started getting the the OS going they needed a

424
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,840
way to actually put this OS out there and give it a run make sure it works

425
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,160
show investors that it works so they did this line of hardware they did the

426
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,600
mission mini the mission one a couple others the devices that you've probably

427
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,240
seen the little white yeah which did their job of letting the company test

428
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,800
the OS in these markets with hardware that they knew it would work on since

429
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,320
then though they've been partnering with a sir and ASUS and HP and now those though

430
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,180
we I'm sorry the ones who are making hardware with endless OS running on it

431
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:52,280
and putting that out into those market no kidding so we're in Brazil and Mexico

432
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,360
and Guatemala right now and we are just about to launch in Indonesia wow

433
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,680
congratulations that's really great and so I guess as part of this growth they

434
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,600
brought you on and are you are you on there as is your official role like Lord

435
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,320
and dictator of endless or where do they fit you in there same role that I had at

436
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,080
canonical actually I'm a community manager and going to be working on

437
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,720
growing their community and helping the the users get in touch with the company

438
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,360
make sure we're getting good feedback into the company and vice versa cool so

439
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,560
I guess what excites me about endless is first of all brilliant idea seems like

440
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,560
that's a pretty good market to go after because even outside of developing

441
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:39,180
nations there is a lot of installations just in the West that sounds like they

442
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,080
could benefit from a system that's intentionally designed to be offline with

443
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,840
ways to update it via thumb drives and whatnot that's just I love all of it so

444
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,240
it to me when I heard this and thanks for filling in some of the gaps to me

445
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,840
the reason why I thought this is gonna be great for gnome was now you have a

446
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:00,080
company who's who's gonna have who's gonna have something based on gnome in

447
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,640
front of a lot of users that are truly that quote-unquote new user people that

448
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,560
really expect different things from their computer like it's gonna bring in

449
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,640
a whole new set of of users that are gonna drive finding more bugs they're

450
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,120
gonna drive future upstream development of gnome like I think that even more

451
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,280
deployments are going to increase the eyes on the bugs in the code like all

452
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,160
these things are going to stack up but what are some other ways that endless is

453
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,760
involved with the gnome project outside of just what seemed to me to be obvious

454
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,680
benefits so I mentioned flat hub already one of the endless employees Rob McQueen

455
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,240
is the one who's getting that set up he did the crowdfunding that you mentioned

456
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,120
and endless is already planning on shipping flat hub enabled by default in

457
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,400
future versions so that people who want to put apps available to endless users

458
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,760
submit them to flat hub they're automatically going to be available

459
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:55,040
that's awesome and that that is a just that would be great for hall clinics in

460
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,000
general really is just getting just getting a universal package format more

461
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,080
accepted and why flat packs and you know the history and the decision there was

462
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,840
it just because it's the whole gnome ecosystem I don't know the history of it

463
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,360
I think it's because there were a bunch of known people that started the

464
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,320
original engineering around this that's what was there at the start it was

465
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,920
available it worked so they went with it can you fill in any details around that

466
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,040
because that was the other thing I remember hearing about endless is that

467
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,120
there was some known people behind it right so I don't know all of them but I

468
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,960
know cosimo who I think he's been on your show before I'm not I can't

469
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:39,080
remember he's been on some show cosimo cos it yes yes the gnome director is an

470
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,080
engineer here at endless yeah it was Linux action show ages ago I think yeah

471
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,640
and I know we've got some others too I just don't know who's yeah I'm still

472
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,320
yeah I've been here for less than a month now so I'm still learning

473
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,240
everybody and what their past connections were so what are so what are

474
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,040
some of the secret future projects that you can you can tell us about and then

475
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,200
blame on the fact that you were new to the gig and didn't understand all the

476
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:07,840
rules like give us like give us a hint so if you go to community dot endless m

477
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,400
comm I'm gonna start posting some kind of teaser videos about what's coming in

478
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,160
the next version so endless 3.2 has got some really big changes we fell behind

479
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,960
in our sync with gnome so we were a few versions behind that's being caught back

480
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,020
up a lot of new flat pack improvements have landed a lot of OS and shell

481
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,840
changes have landed that makes it a lot better so I'm gonna start dropping some

482
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,840
short little videos showing off the changes you can check them out there

483
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,060
that's our forum site community dot endless m comm awesome I will link that

484
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,280
in the show notes to to make it easy for anybody that wants to lazy web that link

485
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,520
it looks like that's a that's a pretty cool resource so if I was if I was

486
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,320
looking to switch distros is this something that would be in is this

487
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,040
something you say yeah Chris is a long time desktop Linux user I think you

488
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,720
should give this a consideration or is it more for totally new users who are

489
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,520
coming into Linux and and want something just just something that's more met for

490
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,440
their expectations I would tell you to give it a try but if you're like a

491
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,720
hardcore tinkerer you're probably not gonna like the fact that it's got this

492
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:19,080
read-only OS tree system image oh interesting but you know if you've got

493
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,600
you know like a guest computer or something anywhere you've got Chrome OS

494
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,400
being run it would be a great replacement for that I actually just

495
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,160
gave I gave a laptop with it to my grandmother to let her try it out

496
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:40,440
because her windows well she's only had it for a little while now she played a

497
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,560
lot of online games so that's been some issues with flash but I put Chrome on

498
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,620
there and that seemed to have helped stuff I love it but he makes got some

499
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,840
some tough questions for you Michael see if you've managed to grok this stuff yet

500
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:59,200
go ahead mini yeah Michael do you have some upgrade priorities for your system

501
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,680
I imagine if you have bad internet so let's say you have priority call bug

502
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:13,920
fixes and other bug fixes and then at the end only application updates I don't

503
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,080
know yet I know the whole offline upgrade with a USB stick is still being

504
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:24,560
developed and I would imagine it uses just OS tree images so like the kernel

505
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,120
and the system libraries and stuff would all be in one update but if you have

506
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,240
some if you have normal online connectivity could the system just

507
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:41,180
decide okay I have online connectivity I have new kernels first I do a kernel

508
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:48,560
update if I have a connection I continue with the upgrades oh like like the like

509
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,640
the oh wow oh that is a neat idea so the update system itself says okay well now

510
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,240
that I've got a moment of data these are the most high priority but you know what

511
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,920
would be tricky about that is you also have to figure out dependency resolution

512
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:14,280
somehow right in fact so the OS tree models like it's like getting that it

513
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,520
has checksums for individual files right so you can check to make sure every

514
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,760
files legit so if there's a bad file you can you could abort the update so that's

515
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,080
pretty solid so you have a good chance the updates gonna work and it uses hard

516
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,440
links I think so I'm rough on my understanding but the OS tree is like

517
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,480
sort of it does the entire thing in one go and then it goes through and does a

518
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,520
full check of all the files to make sure that everything is solid and that there

519
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,480
aren't any corrupt files and then it flips the bit and says this is now the

520
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,100
live file system that kind of right and I think it keeps that old one around too

521
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,960
so if you go to reboot and something's wrong you just flip back to that old set

522
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,840
right which is sort of going back to what Lenart was saying like here's a

523
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,120
different way to do it Lenart's has CA sync now which is totally different thing

524
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,720
which I'm sure we'll learn more about in the future but this is another way to

525
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,280
deliver this feature set so sounds like maybe CA sync is going to deliver these

526
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,440
differences to OS tree images maybe I don't know I'll have to look more into

527
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,720
that interesting hmm so you do you do you I guess I want to make sure I

528
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,120
understand the the your answer to the hardware stuff sounds like sort of the

529
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,880
implication and your answer was is that endless might pull back a bit from

530
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,400
producing hardware now that they kind of have some momentum going and feature

531
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,160
more so it sounds like you're gonna focus more on working with upstream OEMs

532
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,280
did I did I just grok that yeah yeah I mean we don't we don't want to be the

533
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,240
hardware provider for endless OS that was a way to bootstrap things to get it

534
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,240
out into the market but we really want to work with hardware partners to get it

535
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,440
out there oh okay all right well you know what that seems to make a lot of

536
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,880
sense like I'm really excited about just something just something really focused

537
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,400
on that market focused on on it's so refreshing to hear here's somebody that's

538
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,080
building something that's not all about integrating their cloud solution and

539
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,040
it's more about building a system for people where they could be offline for

540
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,920
long periods of time because that happens to me quite a bit and it's gonna

541
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,640
happen to me in in in about a month I'll be offline for a large period of time

542
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,560
and so it'd be a great time to give something like endless a spin so I'm

543
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,080
considering throwing it on a on an XPS how's the high dpi support um I don't

544
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,880
actually have a high dpi monitor to test it on so I'm not sure I might give it a

545
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,000
go it's a gnome shell so yeah yeah you know and you got all that fractional

546
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,440
scaling well played sir well played well Michael is there anything else you want

547
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,440
to mention or tell us about endless before yeah if you want to get it the

548
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:42,200
the latest stable version is available at endless OS comm slash download we're

549
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,680
pushing bit torrent so if you could help us out by seeding it that would be

550
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,760
awesome we'd love you for it very good and then keep an eye out in about a

551
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,320
month the next major version should be coming out oh very well we will keep our

552
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,420
ear to the ground and I keep everybody updated and feel free to join us in the

553
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,920
future and tell us what's going on with the project I'm I'm excited I'm really

554
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,400
excited by it look forward to it yeah give it a try I want to see what you

555
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,120
think okay I might just time it perfectly with my offline trip and we

556
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,480
will report back now I before we go I wanted to just mention also really

557
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,440
quickly another bit of community news just sort of a quick aside our friends

558
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,400
over at elementary OS have announced their move over to github oh there he is

559
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,520
ladies and gentlemen mr. West Payne hello I'm late no problem been holding

560
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,240
the fort down though it's been an awkward show but now that you're back

561
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,880
everything's right so I just think I just mentioned that really quickly

562
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,320
because I think that's gonna be great for elementary OS yeah hopefully that

563
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,520
makes it easy to people to contribute exactly you get more people in there

564
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,720
it's exactly that's exactly what I was thinking you read my mind mr. West you

565
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,720
know what let's take a moment and thank ting go to linux.ting.com to sign up and

566
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,520
get $25 off a device if you want to grab one directly or if you bring one and

567
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,760
they have a CD main and they got a GSM network so you might just want to bring

568
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,400
one check out their BYOD page if you bring it you get $25 in service credit

569
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,200
son I'll tell you what girl it's $23 per phone per month on average for a ting

570
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,880
customer so you see why that $25 credits nice it's really simple in fact it's

571
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,520
it's the way mobile would work a lot of times outside the states my audience

572
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,000
tells me you mean this isn't how you guys do it it's it's obvious it's so

573
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,840
simple and obvious I guess it took two cows to figure it out and they launched

574
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,040
ting and now they have a simple smart way to do mobile you just pay for what

575
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:36,000
you use $6 for each line so if you want one line at $6 a month if you want two

576
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,320
lines at $6 a month if you got a phone that you occasionally use that's a

577
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,240
really really nice thing because you can have your main line like I do and then

578
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,680
you can have a standby line that's only six dollars if you don't use anything on

579
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,320
it and when you do need it you just pay for what you use your minutes your

580
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,520
messages your megabytes it's all clearly laid out on ting's website there's no

581
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,680
hidden charges or surprises you get a great dashboard to manage it incredible

582
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,920
customer service all the stuff you'd expect with a standard plan nationwide

583
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,400
coverage no contracts you can see your usage at a glance so you're on top of it

584
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,120
all the time bring a device or grab one from ting like check this one out Wes I

585
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,080
gotta scoot up here for this guy scoot up gotta get in get I gonna get yeah I

586
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:20,920
gotta zoom in here zoom in enhance this is the ANS h450r say that again the ANS

587
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:30,320
h450r Wes I'm sure you've heard of it right you might notice it's a it's it's

588
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,880
a bit rugged look I was gonna say it quite handsome it's rugged yeah it

589
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,800
looks like the fridge that Harrison Ford jumped in to survive yes you get it so

590
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,280
this is I bring this up because this son-of-a-gun is in the sub 70 market

591
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:49,200
when you use our code oh yeah go to linux.ting.com $65 Android phone now you

592
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,000
know it's not gonna be the S8 here it's not got the it doesn't have like the eye

593
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,600
tracking it does look like I could drop it and have a decent chance of not

594
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,960
scratch that is ruining yes that is exactly you get an Android 5.1 device

595
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,120
with a quad-core 1.3 gigahertz processor that does stand that could stand a nuke

596
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:12,000
test it's got Corning Gorilla Glass display that takes a punch it's got wet

597
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,040
touch technology yes you can laugh at a maniac during rainstorms while you're

598
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,680
using your phone like a boost yeah it's also apparently dust resistant

599
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,880
waterproof dust proof and get ready for this West is why I picked it for you

600
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,280
shockproof oh perfect yeah you're not getting it for its 2 megapixel front

601
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,360
facing camera though that is not but you know that's gonna catch you when you're

602
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,640
jumping out maybe I really prefer the lo-fi selfies yeah exactly yeah it's

603
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,600
like a learning that much it's retro yeah it's like a 70s so you can get it

604
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,520
with like you know 8 gigs or whatever internal but here's the thing West micro

605
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,720
SD and the son of a gun and if that okay if this wasn't enough for this truck

606
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,600
size Cadillac get this the son of a gun has a 2 sim slot well guess what guess

607
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,880
what that's pretty handy I don't know why does it have CD man GSM antennas in

608
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:08,720
it let me see no I just think it has CDMA all right no I mean I think it just

609
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,360
has GSM so I don't know why you would want two Sims it's a good question

610
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,360
maybe one goes bad on you it's like eyes it's like your eyeballs or your ears who

611
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,920
is better than somehow I'm sure Noah could tell us why we want want to he

612
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,880
probably has to yeah you're right he probably could Linux dot ting calm

613
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,480
that's where you go to get started you could go get yourself Cadillac phone

614
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,080
maybe just go get yourself that phone I mean I'm not judging to be honest with

615
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:37,640
you I'm not judging you I'm jealous I'm super jealous so we have ourselves a

616
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,000
barbecue coming up I should probably mention really quick because it's

617
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,800
getting not next week but the week after the 4th of July America's birthday go to

618
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,880
meetup calm slash Jupiter broadcasting if you're anywhere in the Pacific

619
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,560
Northwest if you're within I'd say six hours you should come because seeing

620
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:59,440
West's in a skirts worth it alone I would say I mean they usually on show

621
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,560
days wear skirts that's true yeah cuz you know we have to cut it off at the

622
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,320
table now I won't even now I'm not pretending like I'm not wearing a skirt

623
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,520
cuz I'm just not wearing any pants so if you want to see that yeah it's warm in

624
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,440
the studio it really does there's a lot of equipment and you want some flow you

625
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,280
do yeah you need otherwise you're getting distracted and if you're

626
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,360
thinking about other things you can't do a good show so meetup calm slash

627
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:23,880
Jupiter broadcasting that we'd really like to have you join us hang out maybe

628
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,360
help my chair does this squeak on you during text nap like this or is it just

629
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,320
do I just move around more than you do I mean it does squeak I think the latter

630
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,880
yeah yeah I do I'm conscious that it's it's funny cuz I'm not on camera I'm

631
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,240
just sitting here I could just sit here like a lump but instead I'm like moving

632
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,280
around constantly meetup calm slash Jupiter broadcasting I don't know what's

633
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,380
happening other than we're gonna be cooking a lot we're gonna be hanging out

634
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,520
I wonder if we'll have the VR set up or if we can enlist somebody set up the VR

635
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,160
we could have the VR go and that could be pretty fun and then we're gonna do

636
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,920
Linux unplug live we're gonna invite everybody to stay and hang out with us

637
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,360
and we'll have it going on the TV in the living room and we also have a couple of

638
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,240
chairs here in studio so if we get a couple of brave souls who might want to

639
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,720
go from a virtual lug member to an actual physical take it to the next

640
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,000
level right so meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting if you can make it just so

641
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,040
we kind of know how many people are coming as we can plan food wise and then

642
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,240
we probably are gonna stream it somehow I mean if nothing else we'll have the

643
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,800
studio cameras on who love the mics open so people come in and talk to the chat

644
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,920
room and I don't know they will have like a barbecue cam or something it could

645
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,520
be a lot of fun so it's we're gonna celebrate episode 200 of the unplugged

646
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,000
program there we go I got that out of my system I feel like we can do the show

647
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,880
now breathing room it was do you see that do you see that box behind you do

648
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,440
you see that there's a box back there is a box what's in that box these started

649
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:48,000
showing up around the around the around the web and they are they're hand

650
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,520
painted I believe tux mass sort of like a guy Fox mass but it's a guy this is

651
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,880
adorable isn't that pretty cool it's a system 76 been sending out these these

652
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,160
guys here I'll turn on do I have the do we have studio cam yeah there we do it's

653
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,760
not a very clear picture but here you can kind of see if you're watching the

654
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,760
video version you can kind of see the guy tux mask here and it comes in a

655
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,440
nice envelope with a wax stamp straps right to your face and so they have they

656
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,880
have quite a big they're making something something's going on there's

657
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,760
like a hashtag involved and there's a I also notice on the website there's a

658
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,560
countdown going on so I suspect if you go to the system 76 calm website and

659
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,120
look around for their revolution or look so it's either revolution of 76 or

660
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,200
hashtag revolution revolutionist 76 if you're on Twitter I think there's

661
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,480
probably some sales coming down the road but they're making look at this I don't

662
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,080
know what it is it could be something bigger though because I mean at first I

663
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,480
thought okay it's gonna be a big sale but then they start talking about the

664
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,520
people have forgotten what real freedom means to have the possibility of

665
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,520
attaining anything you can imagine rather than allowing limits to define

666
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,520
your greatest potential don't like to allow limits to define my potential

667
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:58,840
that's true on June 27th which is soon hashtag revolution is 76 commences for

668
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,960
which I have a grand surprise in store for our community this shall be the day

669
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,960
the day that we reveal to the world a global society of creators today we will

670
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,880
remind the people how to access freedom from surveillance from limitations from

671
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:19,280
restrictions so I so I don't know I don't know what this means access to

672
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,720
freedom sounds good though yeah so I don't know it could be at first I was

673
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,320
like well this sounds like open hardware almost like maybe they're gonna launch

674
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,000
does that was that what you were thinking something like that but it also

675
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,560
could just be a sale it could just be a sale I think it does go to show that

676
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,480
those system 76 keyboards the caps lock key definitely works it's very effective

677
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:46,120
yeah that smooth travel yeah that is a takeaway you can make and there's also

678
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,520
it's happening here in the tweet to look see see there's a lot of there's a lot

679
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,360
of caps in that tweet there too well what it feels that good why not you

680
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:56,400
pretty pumped up yeah hey so if you want to play with the it's pretty nice see oh

681
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,920
and then they have a website inside the mask open source revolution org let's go

682
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,920
there let's see what that open source revolution you know I'm having a hard

683
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,480
time typing today is a weird you're not wearing your mask it's because I all

684
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,680
they've had today is a is of is a smoothie oh it just goes to the website

685
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:19,360
I was already alright so you can go to if you want to check it out and so you

686
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,480
know you people people always say like oh let me put my sys admin hat on now

687
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,960
you can put your sys admin mask on yeah and you're ready to do some do some

688
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,200
penguin eating right all right do you think it would look good it might

689
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,800
the smells alright so I could wear that it's kind of loud though when we set

690
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,000
around on the table you know I mean it's not a good show prop yeah it'd be good

691
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,880
if this was more if we had a camera if we had a camera straight on to us but

692
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,280
anyways yeah so you can we'll have a link in the actually I hopefully I'll

693
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,640
have the image embedded if you want to see it in the show notes so duder linux

694
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:56,240
says that there's going they're gonna be launching new cases and stuff wow oh my

695
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,000
god West holy crap that was freaky man hello I'm gonna take a picture I just I

696
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,640
just I just turned over and Wes was wearing the mask I looked over at Wes

697
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:12,520
and he's wearing the mask and I I just about had a heart attack that is uh I'm

698
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,720
gonna tweet that so people can see what I'm talking about cuz that is some

699
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,520
creepy stuff yeah so duder says that he says that they're gonna be launching new

700
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,160
cases and stuff that could be it I'd like to see something I mean there's a

701
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,360
yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of there's a lot of caps and there's a lot

702
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,960
of promotion for freedom and open source so we'll see what's we'll see what it

703
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,800
comes out to be anyway so I'll post that later cuz I'm getting distracted by it I

704
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,880
wanted to cover something that I think is just really important anybody who

705
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:43,080
likes minecraft or and like in my case is a parent of a minecraft user two of

706
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:49,080
them as a matter of fact minecraft is going to this new back end this new

707
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:55,480
fancy bedrock back end that's gonna be a common core for minecraft on Windows 10

708
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,800
minecraft on Xbox and Android and console versions like that and tablets

709
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:07,880
and there is currently no back end for the Linux what yeah and there currently

710
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,080
is a they drop in Java yes exactly they're moving away now they're gonna

711
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,200
can't they're gonna maintain the Java version so it's not like Java the Java

712
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,480
versions going away forever but the issue is that if you want to if you want

713
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,680
to multi-play or if you want to download any of the new texture packs or any of

714
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:28,400
the new levels or skins you have to be in this new back end I see so if you

715
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,120
want it's the Java users will probably just be able to keep playing amongst

716
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,160
each other forever and I just never get any of the new cool stuff yeah my yeah

717
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,520
exactly my son Dylan says he's fine with that but I have it see what I'm worried

718
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,600
about is this eventually leads to dad I want Windows 10 and then that's this is

719
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,680
this we cannot have so they have this feedback dot minecraft dot net site where

720
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:54,240
there is currently a petition yes I know it's a petition there's currently a

721
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:01,320
petition going on for Linux support and it also is for Mac support but there

722
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,440
are more like radical approaches kidnapping developers children it's just

723
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,600
these petitions so so often fail to work because the developers themselves bring

724
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:17,120
in a certain bias to the market so this guy his name is mojang to toto MMO and

725
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,960
he's got a Windows icon you know he's got mojang in front of his name and he's

726
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:27,360
responding on the reddit post about this feedback thread and he says he talks in

727
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,680
here he says well one of the reasons we're not shipping for Linux is there's

728
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,840
there's no store there's no Xbox Live but they probably just have to build that

729
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,320
in there's no update mechanism for closed-source stuff so you would need to

730
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:44,320
make our own store and then we'd have to sell the launcher there and it's just a

731
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:48,800
massive amount of work for us and probably more than just porting issues

732
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:55,400
so he's saying the reason why one of the most highly played games in history

733
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,240
isn't getting ported to Linux is because they can't figure out a way to ship it

734
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:05,440
for Linux is what he's saying yeah ouch I would like I would like somebody to

735
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:13,000
tell him about flat packs and snap packages and app images yeah and then of

736
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,800
course they so somebody says what about using the distro third-party repositories

737
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,480
Google does this for Chrome and Debian you could set up your own repo and then

738
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,820
send updates that way and he says but how do you plug that into a store so

739
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,880
then people can buy it and if they don't buy it they don't get it you can't use

740
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,800
repo for paid updates out of the box also each distro can choose different

741
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,320
package managers so instead of one you have to support two and a lot more than

742
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,600
that really or go steam which is gonna be unlikely for Microsoft yeah that's

743
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,240
that part which is he totally acknowledges in this post he says I

744
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,180
ported a game to Linux before and the fragmentation of the and the

745
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:49,660
non-existence of the ecosystem makes Linux easily the most expensive platform

746
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:53,600
to support for developers which crossed them which crossed with minimal sales

747
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,740
makes it a really tough idea actually getting the game to run is almost the

748
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,720
easiest part and we're already there because they got working on Android to

749
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,040
the game I've ported sold something like 56 copies in the first month on Linux

750
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,120
this guy's a mojang a place everything theory or a former mojang employee he

751
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,600
might be an MS employee now I'm not sure but the anyways we'll have the thread

752
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,480
all that linked in the show notes if you would like to see it ported maybe it's

753
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,840
worth throwing in there because if it gets enough attention they'll learn

754
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,360
about ways to distribute software on Linux it's a solvable problem it's

755
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:29,200
actually problem we've already solved so I would love to see that because man

756
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:35,220
wouldn't it suck if Linux missed out on one of the most important games simply

757
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:41,920
because it was too freaking hard to figure out how to ship software on it

758
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,160
especially for you for so long when people were running like Minecraft

759
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,240
servers on Linux and I mean you know it feels like there's been we've kind of

760
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,520
been at least somewhat connected to it or it's been a part of our community or

761
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,800
at least on the edges of it for so long yeah architect points out I'm gonna I'm

762
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,160
gonna do this respond to this because they probably get this in the comments

763
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,280
to architect points out well you know Chris you could run you could run the

764
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,200
new bedrock or whatever it's called version in in wine you know maybe

765
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,440
crossover will build a build a nice easy installer and put in a bottle but the

766
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,560
the thing is is like my kids and all of my kids friends aren't gonna install

767
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,840
Linux to then install wine to then install Minecraft the might see the

768
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,760
thing is is right now there's the and this is kind of what this is what muddies

769
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,520
the water is there is a quote-unquote Minecraft launcher which is kind of

770
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:32,360
recent might still actually be in beta and is native and available for Linux

771
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:37,320
this is a native Minecraft launcher for Linux and that's been available for a

772
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,820
while now and then there's this new bedrock core version of Minecraft which

773
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:46,400
is only at present in terms of desktop computers available for Windows 10 there

774
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,960
is a port like a small educational version that they have forked off that

775
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,120
is available for Mac OS that is also based on the bedrock core there is

776
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:01,220
nothing for Linux and that's really depressing so links in the show notes

777
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:05,360
I'm gonna I'm gonna try to get in there I'm gonna try to pass around this

778
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,960
information to folks and maybe get the folks over there in touch with people

779
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,480
that know more about how to package up software deliver it and maybe get them

780
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,720
communicating with the folks that are developing the new Minecraft version so

781
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,080
that way they can get educated on what's available maybe we can help them so we

782
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,680
are working on it already behind the scenes it is tough though when you kind

783
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,640
of you you know you're relying on you know other games bigger games or things

784
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:33,040
where you weren't so assuming that there would be the store infrastructure you

785
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,800
know like a lot of games they'll just do it in game or that kind of thing it's

786
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,720
tough when we don't you know we have kind of those but we don't have great

787
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:44,560
set of primitives for hey here's your private DRM paywalled app it's just not

788
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,560
yeah yeah yeah yeah and it's one of those things where like the old version

789
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,960
is not gonna die necessarily so maybe it'll be just fine for a while but you

790
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,480
don't also want to be on the road yeah yeah there's yeah there's always there's

791
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,520
always the possibility that mine test could take off yeah well GB mine test

792
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:08,400
server that's what you're saying no I don't think late at the barbecue I don't

793
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,480
think so man you know I got you know I you know what I gotta do I gotta quit

794
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,120
playing video games takes up a lot of time but just never I never I never have

795
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,000
time for for anything because I'm just playing all these little race the Sun

796
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,480
here and there okay you're right just to wake up with okay you're right okay I

797
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,280
was teasing I I don't actually play video but I you're right I do play some

798
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,800
race the Sun from time to time you know what I you know what I would do if I had

799
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:37,380
some spare spare time I would lay seeds in my mind and I would then pour stinky

800
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:42,120
stinky fertilizer over those seeds I would then water it and maybe every now

801
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:47,120
and then splash in a dash of coffee grinds have you heard this coffee grinds

802
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:52,000
in your garden have you heard oh yeah sure you have uh-huh yeah I haven't done

803
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,320
it but I've done it don't do too much did you grow me some more coffee no I

804
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:00,140
grew tomatoes but this is supposed to be an analogy about your mind Linux

805
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:05,440
Academy comm slash unplugged see I was I was I got off on the I'm being excited

806
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,400
about coffee but the thing is is you could lay the seeds for your mind and

807
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,720
then Linux Academy that's the fertilizer you go in there you get some self-paced

808
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,320
in-depth video courses on every single Linux cloud DevOps topic the big stuff

809
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:23,320
too like Azure and AWS and your open stacks and oh my goodness oh my goodness

810
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,360
if you didn't if you don't have all of the basics of networking don't feel like

811
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,160
you're don't don't don't feel bad don't sit there and hide it from everybody

812
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,040
don't keep it your big secret just go to Linux Academy they got great courses all

813
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:38,040
that stuff hands-on scenario based labs to give you experience on real servers

814
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,960
human beings instructors that are happy to advise you and answer questions when

815
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,480
you get stuck course scheduler which is nice to work with your biz a schedule

816
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,640
learning paths with your series of courses and content plan by Linux

817
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,760
Academy's instructors iOS and Android for when you're on the go like West hey

818
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:57,040
oh and study guides like lesson audio and notebooks that you can take with you

819
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,840
and study offline and flashcards that are maintained forked and made even

820
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,680
better by a community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members what's not

821
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,880
to love go there and try it out for seven days for free Linux Academy comm

822
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,440
slash unplugged this is a tool and a platform built by Linux enthusiasts

823
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,440
wanting to spread Linux to more people and make it more accessible and this was

824
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,720
their mission they combined up with developers and educators and now more

825
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,040
and more people's Linux Academy is just growing like crazy and they're build out

826
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,880
a team that keeps that content fresh builds in new stuff all the time they

827
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,340
have virtual labs that they really have nailed because you can pick the course

828
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:35,200
where distro click that and then it'll match up with the lab server and spin

829
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,080
that up for you that stuff is magic and I was involved in some of the

830
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,360
conversations on how they were putting it together super impressed with their

831
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,620
team really smart people running Linux Academy go to Linux Academy comm slash

832
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,880
unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged

833
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:55,440
program so I want to do a little follow we got a comment in last so we got a

834
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,740
couple of things so the first one I want to address is like just what it's like a

835
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:01,280
like a question I'd like to get people's comments that listen to the show

836
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,960
after the fact and the last week's show was like an hour and 27 minutes almost an

837
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:12,840
hour and 30 and the comment that came into the show was too short shows not

838
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,700
long enough that seems like it was probably and see in my world about an

839
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:24,600
hour is about probably just right for most commuters maybe hour and 45 for the

840
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:28,780
longer commuters 30 minutes is even a good time that's what we try to do with

841
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:33,320
Linux action news is about 30 minutes and it's you know so I was like I what

842
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,960
are your thoughts was I feel like an hour and a half was probably too long

843
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,580
last week I think like we went too long and so I'm kind of curious who you

844
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,760
think and I want to toss it out there for people listening on like the

845
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,320
YouTube's or and they're in their cars when they commute and can maybe tweet me

846
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,640
some feedback and let me know what they think or leave in the comments but your

847
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,560
thoughts what do you think I mean I I do agree that an hour it's a very

848
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:55,740
tractable time kind of understand it you know how to budget for it maybe an

849
01:02:55,740 --> 01:03:00,160
hour and a half is less so it does bring up a good question about like how do we

850
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,640
want to manage that what do we shoot for and when do we break you know what's our

851
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,360
flex there in terms of like what we're having a really good discussion it makes

852
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:11,960
sense to go that longer or that deep dive made sense but hmm so maybe the

853
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,600
content should decide yeah I think that's why we went long is like that's

854
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,800
just what the content called for yeah but I mean we should think about how

855
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,480
it's distributed how people can listen to it I know that like you know I don't

856
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,520
want to get in position where it's always just a little too long and then

857
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,160
people aren't finishing it or feel like they don't get to enjoy it the right way

858
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,240
yeah or I don't want people not listening because it's too long right

859
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,880
like I got other shows I gotta listen to too I can't spend an hour and a half on

860
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,400
one show it could be a thing I would like to think that we would be high on

861
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,000
their list but you never know so give us your feedback either in the YouTube

862
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,480
comments or at Chris Elias let me know speaking of at Chris Elias Paul tweeted

863
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,800
me on some moonlight follow-up from last week this is really cool so remember we

864
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:52,240
talked about moonlight is an open source project that allows you to take

865
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,960
advantage of NVIDIA's proprietary lockdown only to Windows on chip GPU

866
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:02,640
accelerated network streaming moonlight opens that up for Linux users tablet

867
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,040
users Raspberry Pi users like it just opens that whole thing up and it's

868
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,280
really slick and you and I speculated we thought well could you use this to

869
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,560
stream a Windows desktop to a Linux PC yeah and this would be sort of like

870
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,040
screw wine screw VMs I'll just put a Windows box in the corner and just

871
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,800
stream the whole damn desktop using moonlight yeah well Paul tweeted me and

872
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,520
he said at Chris Elias you can use moonlight on the entire desktop by

873
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,640
pointing it at explore dot exe and it doesn't work on grid cloud so like it

874
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,560
won't work on AWS because it requires a hardware GTX we also said well shoot put

875
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,640
this up on a cloud exactly yeah but it needs a physical GTX card for that which

876
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:42,520
we know we knew that actually and then Alder wrote into the unplug subreddit at

877
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:47,160
unplug dot reddit comm he said sometime last year I had a grand plan of putting

878
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:53,360
a Windows PC in a corner and using it as a gaming appliance yeah yeah he said so

879
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,400
the idea was run Linux on a laptop with a clean-looking office space with

880
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,240
moonlight helping to bridge the gap of missing games for Linux but suffice to

881
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,200
say I ran into a few problems I tried every version available of moonlight on

882
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,440
the iPad 3 on the Nexus 5x on an Android TV box Linux laptop Windows laptop

883
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:14,520
chromium extension and the Java client they all performed amazingly up to 720p

884
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:20,480
at 60 frames per second but there is some input lag but it's mostly workable

885
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:25,760
especially with a single-player game where the where twitch or a frame twitch

886
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,720
FPS or competition isn't the goal as in you know it's not super twitchy but

887
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:35,040
rather the experience of enjoying the game in that use case it's fantastic

888
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:42,000
however once I try to push it up to 1080p the leg became very bad the H to

889
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,120
see the h254 which I don't know if that's typo or maybe it is h254 stream

890
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:51,280
freaks out at times you have to wait for it to come back it does reconnect but it

891
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,720
does freak out from time to time he was running on an Intel for a four core

892
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,600
Intel rig with an NVIDIA 970 and then later he put a 1080 in there and he had

893
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:02,200
it connected to a gigabit LAN as far as you could see there wasn't a bottleneck

894
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,840
in the setup but he just thought maybe it wasn't up to snuff he also mentioned

895
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:11,200
messed around with Wi-Fi and things like that so he says you make sure we have

896
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,720
some network stuff but he says he's happy to report the video drivers didn't

897
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,160
really seem to make a big difference same performance with different video

898
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,920
drivers he says I don't I'm not sure anyways he says I just wanted you guys

899
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,720
to know that if you dig into it it's pretty close just needs a little more

900
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,840
work and give a little forgiveness on the performance from time to time but if

901
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,200
you're doing a 720p stream you're gonna be pretty happy up to 60 frames per

902
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,040
second that's reasonable yeah especially if you're just trying to pull you know

903
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,920
pull down a Windows desktop application like I mean after we talked about is

904
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,200
like well this could be a great way to do Photoshop or maybe even premiere

905
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,440
that 720p would be pretty limiting or for me you know you might even like I

906
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,680
remember using this plane with the steam streaming stuff yeah I just wanted to be

907
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,600
hanging out with my roommates in the living room but I didn't want to like

908
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,760
drag my tower and hook it up to the TV but they just like said I could play on

909
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,160
this little laptop and yeah kind of a similar thing kind of a similar thing

910
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,800
so thank you guys for I got a couple other people that wrote about moonlight

911
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,480
and they were similar in tone so I thought that would probably be a good

912
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,200
summation but I was we actually got a few bites on that moonlight topic I was

913
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:17,840
surprised maybe I should go try it so yeah if you do let me know let me know

914
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,600
let me know how it goes let me know how it goes if you'd like to join us here in

915
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:26,160
the show we'd love to have you with the we have a decent see how many people

916
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,720
right now we have if you expand the window here hold on let me see I'm gonna

917
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:35,200
tell you we have eight people have joined us this week which is pretty good

918
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,480
we love each and every one of you they're not super talkative this week but

919
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,200
we love having them here and that's nice but we have had sort of like in the past

920
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:46,000
we've had up to like 40 50 people in that room it's been a park and I think

921
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,800
the summertime is here and people are out out and about enjoying yes so there

922
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,440
is an opening for a new opportunity for new voices and new opinions come talk

923
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,920
about Linux yeah the opportunity is there it's not as crowded as it has been

924
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:04,600
and the you could take advantage of the summertime exodus just I think we have a

925
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,240
just go to the go to the chat room really because we you can find out about

926
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,480
the guide that we have you can find out about the mumble room so really the best

927
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,320
resource is to go to jblive.tv and just go to the embedded chat room there you

928
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,840
can do bang mumble to get the mumble server information and then we'd love to

929
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,880
have you join us next week and if you don't make it to mumble the IRC is fun

930
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,440
too yeah yeah you can definitely hang out in the IRC we're watching that

931
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,760
during the show as well we we do try to this is you know we have less less stuff

932
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,640
live than we did because Linux action is to be live right so this is you know

933
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,320
we're kind of moving more towards this is the big live show that we do for our

934
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,600
Linux community so we'd like to see more people get involved I know it's during

935
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,840
the day and that makes it rough for a lot of people right but it's just kind

936
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:46,880
of the way it's worked out for us I you know it's another option we just do it

937
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,600
even earlier in the day and that's gonna be good for anybody involved it's not a

938
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,280
good idea but we'd love to have you if you can make it so go to jblive.tv

939
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,040
you'll find the chat room or go to irc.geekshed.net and it's a hashtag

940
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,120
Jupiter Broadcast and you don't have to be here the whole show you know you can

941
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:06,640
chime come in chime in on a couple issues hang out and disappear yeah like

942
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,840
like mr. Hall today you know he came in and we would wish we kind of had to get

943
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,360
out of here by six o'clock East Coast time and so we just kind of you know

944
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:16,280
make sure we chatted to him before then and then he's chatted a bit with us then

945
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:20,280
he was out and I think that works too if you can't make it for the whole show

946
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:23,280
we're just happy to have you for a bit sometimes same with poppy and wimpy

947
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:27,560
they'll pop in when they're when they're not podcasting themselves yeah also I

948
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:31,400
guess Mozilla has a new podcast coming I saw that that's an interesting little

949
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,400
headline before we get out of here yeah there's there's been a lot going on in

950
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,840
the Linux community this week and so one of the things that I've been doing is

951
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,440
I've been transitioning Linux unplugged a bit to more about the community stuff

952
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,600
so you know talking with Michael Hall about endless and talking about the

953
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,680
elementary project moving over to github and I'm trying to get more community

954
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,440
stuff that isn't necessarily headline grabbing it's still good discussion here

955
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,880
in this show because every Monday we have Linux action news now it's about a

956
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:03,360
half hour long it ranges depending on the news and a hell if if our most

957
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:08,200
recent episode maybe it wasn't our best yet episode oh man because you know what

958
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,920
it was and I don't mean it too I wouldn't I really wouldn't tell my own

959
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,160
horn unless or whatever that's a phrase was it it's definitely not tooting my

960
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,400
horn actually kind of like it's I'm tooting my own horn here it's pretty

961
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,800
good I like that well the skirt makes it real easy so I'm not wearing a skirt I'm

962
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,960
not wearing anything you know I was looking at the news in Linux action news

963
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:31,360
6 Linux action news episode 6 we covered Debian 9 getting released tales 3

964
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:36,080
Firefox 54 free nose 11 open media vault 3 plus we did follow-up from the

965
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:41,360
previous week's episode and Joe gave a boon to touch on his phone a spin and we

966
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:46,400
managed to get all of that in 30 minutes and I I swear I'll stand by it it's all

967
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,480
of the most important things about all of those releases you need to know and

968
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,160
then we just get through it and it doesn't feel super rushed it just it's I

969
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:56,840
think because Joe and I have been doing Linux news coverage ourselves for so

970
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,280
long that we really come into it and we really it's just I really like the way

971
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,660
that episode worked so if you haven't checked it out yet or if you checked it

972
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:08,640
out and haven't come back check out Linux action news episode 6 I thought it

973
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,240
turned out great and speaking of that Debian 9 story there's something I just

974
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,920
wanted to mention before we get out of here Debian 9 did come out this week

975
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:21,840
congratulations to the project it is always a big big deal when Debian 9

976
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:27,520
comes out and this release is dedicated to the projects founder Ian Murdock who

977
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,920
did pass away on December 28th 2015 so Debian 9 is dedicated to Ian and I

978
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,920
thought that was pretty cool I thought it was worth mentioning it's really kind

979
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,960
of classy of the project to do that too all right that'll bring us to an end of

980
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:46,640
this week's unplugged program steaming right towards rushing at a mad pace

981
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,400
towards our VLUG barbecue meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting go there

982
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:55,160
check it out if you want more Wes Payne check out the tech snap program yeah I'm

983
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,480
gonna be listening this week cuz there's a story that didn't make it into this

984
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,080
show that I think you guys are gonna cover in typical fantastic tech snap

985
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,440
fashion don't forget our mumble room we'd love to have you participate with

986
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:09,080
us live follow the network at Jupiter signal thanks for being here and we'll

987
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:21,720
see you right back here next Tuesday. Say goodbye Wes. Goodbye.

988
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:57,680
And the value of this is negative. So go figure I don't have my co-pilot this

989
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:01,960
week and right before the show starts like I was already on the air it was

990
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:08,240
actually I think 1.55 something like that the OBS machine lost all of our so I

991
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:12,120
couldn't grab like my screen and stuff like it lost all the capture yeah yeah

992
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,840
so I had to had to fix that super quick and then got that all solid and then I

993
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:23,480
started the show and realized into the show that in fact it's it's happened

994
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:31,520
again it happened again my my browser highlighting extension that I use that I

995
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,880
was just using before the show started that I went through and highlighted like

996
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,920
this this fedora 26 blog post because it was thick and long and it was meaty and

997
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,360
I was like I like I don't need to put I don't need to read all of this in the

998
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:46,240
show because this would be an hour-long show of me just reading this post so let

999
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:50,320
me highlight these sections I highlight upstairs I come downstairs and using

1000
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:54,240
Chrome upstairs and I come downstairs and my extensions gone and so I

1001
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:58,400
installed it I stopped the show I stopped recording explicitly to install

1002
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,720
because I guess like there's no way I can do this next story without this and

1003
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,320
without you here to fill dead air time like I can't sit here and search through

1004
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,920
a thing right so I'm like I got to stop the recording which I never do unless we

1005
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:13,480
have a crash I stop recording then I go and I install the extension and now it's

1006
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:17,480
gone again and I did that mid show and so there's no way I'd install the

1007
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:22,520
extension during the show and I was using it to read up to our last story I

1008
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:27,280
was using the highlight function and now it is actually gone from Chrome again I

1009
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,220
really can't I can't fathom like shareware extension where you get like

1010
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:34,760
six highlights and then it uninstalls itself it's actually you know Diago or

1011
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:39,120
di GGO it's it's actually a paid service that I've been using for yeah

1012
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:46,240
it's disabled this extension may have been corrupted it says oh what the hell

1013
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:52,320
is repair extension okay so I just okay can I just if I can if I can click a

1014
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,120
button and say repair extension and then another screen comes up and says would

1015
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,320
you like to repair extension and I click repair extension why doesn't it just

1016
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:03,480
automatically repair extension yeah and then is it is corrupt yes repair and why

1017
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,440
is it corrupt on this I wonder if I'm having a mismatch in versions I wonder

1018
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:10,120
if I have a newer version of Chrome here or something that I do upstairs I wonder

1019
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:13,400
if that's what's going on wonder if this is a side because I didn't update on

1020
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:17,680
this computer yesterday so I'm on Chrome 59 here need a script that'll just

1021
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:21,880
update all of your workstations yeah all right JB titles calm we got to get out

1022
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:26,000
of here for mr. West JB title leave you high and dry it's all right it's all

1023
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,560
right it just is so I had like that hardware thing so I was it was just a

1024
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,520
weird start it was a weird start for the show it was that's all right hi it's too

1025
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,640
bad I was actually really excited about I mean I'm always excited about love but

1026
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:39,720
I was especially excited about this one yeah we it I think at all it all shook

1027
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:44,080
out in the end Wes it all shook out all right Jimmy titles calm everybody go

1028
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:49,560
boat so it sounds like the way land is going it should really just be called

1029
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,320
like I don't know it's basically like Pac-Man

1030
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:57,880
syu but just for all of your yeah yeah yeah when we got done afterwards we're

1031
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,120
because you don't when you're recording you don't know how long the length of

1032
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,480
the episode is because you know you're recording for a while before you start

1033
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:07,500
you record for a little bit after you end plus you know you might stop midway

1034
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,560
during the show or something like that and so we didn't know because we had a

1035
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,520
quite a bit more than a half hour in the recording so when it published and it

1036
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:18,400
came in around a half hour I was like damn like that's amazing that not only

1037
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:23,520
did we not like watch a clock but with all of that stuff we still managed to

1038
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:29,200
nail it I mean I was a editing machine yeah things yeah yeah don't forget the

1039
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,760
door knocker oh oh yeah oh that's actually what threw me off wow thanks

1040
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:38,120
MN that's what threw me off super bad is so I was actually I actually had a good

1041
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,320
groove going I got I bounced back from the technical failures I hadn't ran into

1042
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:45,280
the gnome extension issue yet right so I hadn't hit that flaw so I didn't know

1043
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:51,720
what was down the road but at 202 201 so this I'm starting up I'm spinning

1044
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,640
everything up where I've already hit record we're getting ready to go the

1045
01:16:55,640 --> 01:17:00,360
doorbell rings oh no and five minutes before the doorbell ring I got a

1046
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,760
telegram from Angela said by the way there's somebody coming to work on the

1047
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,120
roof guys having his friends over yeah right at least though she says by the

1048
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,880
way somebody's coming to work on the roof don't worry I've pre-briefed him

1049
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:12,720
not to ring the doorbell not to knock on the door I told him you are in there

1050
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:18,960
recording it says I know shit yeah cuz it it always happens yeah there's no way

1051
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,520
right cuz like it's instinct especially for people doing roof work like they you

1052
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,000
know they they want you to know what that noise is they want you to know why

1053
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,880
there's somebody in your yard so they feel obligated to talk to you right for

1054
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:32,000
the like regardless of what they've been instructed like they feel for their own

1055
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,920
personal reasons they have to so it always happens and so so but what threw

1056
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:41,080
me off was like all of it like we this guy we went out of our way to tell him

1057
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:45,600
not to do it and so that was kind of frustrating and then also like he took a

1058
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,760
long time like he was just talking to me about something like I'm like I'm doing

1059
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,200
I'm like I'm on the air right now I didn't say that to him I'm like like

1060
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,120
but that frustration builds up in the back of your mind you're like okay I got

1061
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:59,080
a clock ticking I'm I've got a sound clip you should just had him come right

1062
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,120
in you kind of had that I know right I should have I'm like could you come in

1063
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:05,120
here and talk to me yeah I had like a sound clip of for like a certain amount

1064
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,800
of time that was playing so I didn't have dead air I'm like okay well I've

1065
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,200
got this amount of time to talk to this guy before they before we have dead air

1066
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:16,720
so then I sat down and I was totally flustered by it all because we just

1067
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,440
really went out of our way to make sure that didn't happen and then I started

1068
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,240
thinking like well god can we just never ever schedule stuff on show days but we

1069
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,840
always have a show to sell a lot of show today yeah yeah and people don't want to

1070
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:31,160
come out on Saturday yeah yeah so it's the after that and that really did throw

1071
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:38,360
me off this it was a it was a weird episode you know it's just weird weird
