WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:05.720
So before we start the show can we talk about this really great project that the pirate Bay co-founder has built

00:05.880 --> 00:10.360
He says based on the pirate Bay's own number or based on the music industry's own numbers

00:10.360 --> 00:13.520
He could be costing them ten million dollars a day

00:14.480 --> 00:16.400
The pirate co-founder Peter Sunday

00:16.400 --> 00:22.080
I think that's how you say his name has created a device that he believes is costing that music industry ten million dollars a day

00:22.640 --> 00:24.640
And it's a pretty sophisticated device

00:24.640 --> 00:30.640
You see what it does is it makes a hundred copies of a song and then sends those songs to dev know

00:31.960 --> 00:37.480
Because the whole point of this device is just underscore how ludicrous the RAAA's model is

00:37.760 --> 00:44.200
To try to generate revenue off of copies of a digital item and also go after people and sue them for copies of a digital

00:44.200 --> 00:46.800
item eight million copies of the song have been made and

00:47.480 --> 00:49.280
the machine just

00:49.280 --> 00:56.800
Constantly deletes them. It's I think built around a Raspberry Pi and it just downloads the tracks and immediately deletes them because it's the downloading

00:57.200 --> 01:01.920
That the music industry says cost them the dollars and if you base it on their figures for how much each track cost

01:02.480 --> 01:08.520
That's a lot of money. Yeah, it's it's better than just deleting though because it actually copies them to dev know yeah

01:08.880 --> 01:12.000
Yeah, yeah, that is good of the name to copy machine

01:13.600 --> 01:16.840
Good for them delightfully foreign, but perfect what a nice

01:16.840 --> 01:23.800
Yeah, so the it's built on using a Raspberry Pi and then has an LCD LCD display and you know some quote-unquote Python code, right?

01:24.920 --> 01:26.920
This is Linux unplugged episode

01:27.440 --> 01:29.440
125 for December 29th

01:30.400 --> 01:32.400
2015

01:41.600 --> 01:43.600
Welcome to Linux unplugged

01:43.600 --> 01:49.360
Officially my last broadcast of 2015. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hey there Wes

01:49.720 --> 01:52.320
Technically your last broadcast as well. What fun

01:52.320 --> 01:57.220
Yeah, it is actually kind of it is when you do as many shows as we do it is

01:57.560 --> 02:01.520
It's like whoa wait a minute. This is the last one. I'm doing for the year. That's that's uh, that's a mind job

02:02.080 --> 02:04.700
So coming up on today's episode of the unplugged program

02:04.700 --> 02:06.160
We're gonna follow up on solo s

02:06.160 --> 02:07.220
one dot O's

02:07.220 --> 02:14.800
Release and then the computer chaos club had a conference and they went some presenters went deep into red star OS

02:14.800 --> 02:21.120
You know North Korea's custom Linux operating system the best operating. Yeah, in fact Wes you were compelled to install in your own V

02:21.120 --> 02:25.840
I sure was so we got some clips from the conference and an hour-long presentation

02:25.840 --> 02:31.500
I've boiled it down to just a couple of minutes of some interesting things and interesting ways the red star OS

02:31.500 --> 02:39.020
Surveils its users locks them down to just certain parts of the internet and watermarks all of the media files that pass

02:39.180 --> 02:41.180
through the system and has

02:41.320 --> 02:49.020
Processes that are unkillable by root is a fascinating look into a way free software has been used to cripple free speech

02:49.420 --> 02:52.680
It's a little disturbing, but it's also technically fascinating

02:53.100 --> 02:58.000
We'll talk about that in today's episode on the unplugged program and then later on in the show

02:58.000 --> 03:01.480
We're gonna follow up on that Raspberry Pi kit the canoe or the can or whatever

03:01.480 --> 03:02.480
We still don't know what it's called

03:02.480 --> 03:07.840
But it is an out-of-the-box turn your Raspberry Pi 2 into a full-fledged computer with a slick keyboard

03:08.160 --> 03:11.840
Nice case speakers a hookup the whole thing. It's really cool plus

03:11.880 --> 03:16.200
We have some interesting follow-up for scale towards the end of the show if we have time left

03:16.320 --> 03:19.240
But West before all of that there's a little story

03:19.240 --> 03:26.340
We've followed here on the unplugged program for the year and that is the Linux foundations core infrastructure infrastructure project

03:26.340 --> 03:32.360
You've probably heard about that, right? I sure have and there's different people that have stepped up as of as of

03:32.900 --> 03:38.940
As of like things like heart bleed have come out and things like that to support important open source projects, so

03:40.220 --> 03:45.180
Our first bit of follow-up this week is a little thick so we better bring in our mama room

03:45.180 --> 03:48.380
We need them to get a full take on this time appropriate greetings virtual lug

03:48.380 --> 03:52.900
Oh hello

03:53.420 --> 03:55.020
apologies if

03:55.020 --> 03:57.020
50% of the hosts this week are dying I

03:57.380 --> 03:59.700
Apparently have like a sinus infection or something that's killing me

04:00.060 --> 04:05.260
So I'm gonna I'm gonna hand this first story over to you guys and see what you think, but did you hear this?

04:06.420 --> 04:09.740
Facebook is apparently pulling out on their commitment of donating

04:10.940 --> 04:12.380
$50,000

04:12.380 --> 04:14.380
to canoe PGP and

04:14.380 --> 04:19.780
And they say they initially announced they would provide $50,000 per year

04:20.180 --> 04:23.700
They have since rescinded since rescinded West

04:25.500 --> 04:27.500
Your initial reaction

04:27.760 --> 04:34.200
Well, that's unfortunate. Yeah, you know I did see on Twitter that there are some people maybe associated with Facebook who are saying that it's a

04:34.500 --> 04:40.860
Miscommunication, so I don't know if it's clear yet, but clearly you know the canoe PG folks are you know think they're not getting the money

04:40.860 --> 04:42.980
And it's kind of the best

04:42.980 --> 04:48.100
Privacy you know it's the best privacy guard open source that we have so good which is my go-to one

04:48.100 --> 04:55.380
I'm I'm wondering virtual lug if anybody has any of the scuttlebutt on on this because it seems like a pretty d-bag move from Facebook

04:55.380 --> 04:57.100
But whenever something like this happens you generally figure

04:57.100 --> 04:58.300
There's more to the story

04:58.300 --> 05:04.940
But if canoe PG is willing to go publicly in their news updates to shame there must have been some kind of communication

05:05.060 --> 05:11.620
Yeah, so I'm thinking there must have been a back-and-forth before they made this post. There's something interesting happening there

05:11.620 --> 05:13.860
but I who I just don't know and

05:14.780 --> 05:17.440
One of the things this made me one of the things that's made me kind of

05:17.700 --> 05:24.720
Zoom out and think about a little bit is what happens when critical infrastructure projects like this sort of get guaranteed funding from somebody and then

05:24.720 --> 05:26.720
That somebody pulls out

05:26.780 --> 05:29.820
Is that the open sources community to step up because how what is it?

05:29.820 --> 05:33.860
What is what does an open source project do when they've sort of committed to having that fun?

05:33.860 --> 05:38.280
So maybe I think plans yeah, what do we do then do we just cripple an important project?

05:38.280 --> 05:41.660
Do we step up with some sort of funding? What are your thoughts? You?

05:42.300 --> 05:44.300
Know it would be nice to kind of step up

05:45.060 --> 05:48.180
Canoe PG is one of those tough ones that it's it's used a lot, but it's

05:48.940 --> 05:51.900
Kind of a niche product still unfortunately. Yeah. Yeah

05:51.900 --> 05:57.180
I mean it's gonna take a certain technical user to even know what it is so crowdfunding could be hard crowdfunding could be hard

05:57.180 --> 05:58.660
And that's why it was so nice to see I mean

05:58.660 --> 06:01.260
You know they're still getting the sixty thousand a year from the Linux Foundation

06:01.260 --> 06:04.740
Which is great, but the Facebook's contribution would have nearly doubled that yeah

06:04.740 --> 06:10.220
The other thing I don't quite understand is I guess stripe was also going to contribute, but they were gonna contribute along with Facebook

06:10.220 --> 06:12.220
Or something like that, so I'm not sure how this is affected now either

06:13.180 --> 06:17.440
But obviously these companies make a ton of money off of some of this technology

06:18.180 --> 06:24.180
Winby do you have any reactions to this news and overall like funding of open source projects when in ways the community could step up

06:25.020 --> 06:28.940
Well, I've heard it's been a hard winter for Facebook, and you know money's tight

06:28.940 --> 06:33.920
And this is a lot of money, and they simply can't stretch stretch to it right yeah

06:34.140 --> 06:36.780
No, whilst whilst you were just discussing that with Wes

06:36.780 --> 06:43.620
I was thinking you know we've obviously got the Linux Foundation who are doing their sponsorship of critical infrastructure projects, but the

06:45.060 --> 06:46.340
GPG

06:46.340 --> 06:48.580
Funding wasn't through that was it these were

06:49.300 --> 06:55.300
Organizations that just chose to sponsor the project directly. I think rather than through through the Linux Foundation

06:55.300 --> 07:00.900
Right the Linux Foundation part of step, but yeah, but perhaps what we need is some

07:02.060 --> 07:03.900
community

07:03.900 --> 07:10.020
organization body foundation that people can contribute to directly and then they

07:11.500 --> 07:19.700
Support other critical projects that are not encompassed by what the Linux Foundation is doing because obviously a lot of what the Linux Foundation is

07:19.700 --> 07:21.700
focused on is to

07:21.700 --> 07:27.020
Represent the interests of its members not necessarily you know the

07:28.140 --> 07:33.740
Open source community large that might diverge from the community's interest yeah, yeah exactly yeah

07:33.740 --> 07:38.260
So maybe we need a more community focused grassroots type you know

07:38.940 --> 07:46.660
Some kind of proxy organization that you can yeah that you can put your money into and they then you know fund these projects

07:47.380 --> 07:48.900
That's a really interesting idea

07:48.900 --> 07:54.700
So how is that how do you do something like that without some sort of bias or corruption sneaking in eventually?

07:54.700 --> 07:59.420
And you have to have a lot of people to handle that money, which is always a touchy. Yeah

07:59.420 --> 08:01.420
Well, you'd need some tried and tested

08:02.260 --> 08:03.420
names

08:03.420 --> 08:10.280
Behind this you know the immediate name. I think of is you know Karen Sandler. She's got good standing in the open-source community

08:10.620 --> 08:15.780
She's got the legal chops to deal with this. She's also horribly busy, so yeah

08:15.780 --> 08:19.380
I think the conservancy itself is struggling to raise funds right now

08:19.380 --> 08:25.220
Yeah, exactly exactly so but you know you'd need you'd need people like that with a proven history

08:25.220 --> 08:29.620
Yeah with a track record, so here's here's where I'm taking this discussion is

08:30.140 --> 08:34.820
This is our last episode of 2015 looking at 2016 and part of me

08:35.740 --> 08:42.180
Part of me has I'm a little worried about about this particular problem. I feel like

08:42.180 --> 08:47.380
The problem we've always worried about as Linux grows is starting to happen to us today

08:47.380 --> 08:53.100
And that is when there's enough new users coming in that don't give a crap about the open-source

08:53.420 --> 08:55.460
Ideology about software freedom

08:55.460 --> 09:01.380
They don't give a crap about spreading software around the world and making a general technology platform available to all of humanity what they care

09:01.380 --> 09:04.740
About is replacing their Mac or their Windows desktop more than anything else

09:04.740 --> 09:10.160
And so you get people who are coming in who do not value the open-source software, and I look at it

09:10.160 --> 09:13.060
You know there is a vocal aggressive and

09:17.700 --> 09:22.260
Trolling isn't the right way to put it because it's worse than that because it's it's actually

09:23.020 --> 09:23.980
harmful

09:23.980 --> 09:28.500
there is a subset of the last audience who's still attacking us on a daily basis because

09:28.900 --> 09:35.360
We tried to switch the Linux action show over to being produced fully under Linux and in doing so we had to reduce the full

09:35.360 --> 09:37.220
video production scale and

09:37.220 --> 09:40.700
We are we still are being attacked daily because of that

09:40.740 --> 09:46.340
They don't care if it uses open source and Linux they just want to be able to see my hair in high definition

09:46.340 --> 09:49.300
Well, we all want that I mean I understand, but it is

09:49.860 --> 09:53.740
You know it is it's interesting to see more and more people come into this community

09:54.260 --> 09:59.820
Some of them are coming in because of Steam some of them coming in because Windows 10 is stealing all of their privacy and backing

09:59.820 --> 10:04.220
Up their encryption keys some of them are coming in because Mac Macs are coming with a single USB port now

10:04.220 --> 10:09.640
There's a lot of reasons why people are coming to Linux and a lot of them are not coming because of open source

10:09.820 --> 10:15.860
Idealism or or free software and so I don't know if we can rely on these people so the software conservancy project

10:15.980 --> 10:23.160
Isn't being funded open SSL wasn't properly being funded until the Linux foundation steps up our own shows are being constantly pressured to be

10:23.580 --> 10:26.860
Produced under a software that is not Linux compatible

10:26.860 --> 10:33.180
That is not free software because the there is a larger group of people now who just don't give a shit about those things and so

10:33.180 --> 10:38.980
I look at GNU PG which is an absolutely critical project, and I think maybe the problem is most the users couldn't give a crap

10:39.980 --> 10:42.620
Maybe we need some 1990s Linux

10:44.060 --> 10:48.860
Approaches you know something akin to the box sets that you used to buy for

10:49.940 --> 10:53.660
4050 quid which had all the CDs DVDs and manuals in it

10:54.380 --> 10:57.620
Yeah, you know what's some really good documentation. I could see that working

10:57.620 --> 11:02.900
Yeah, but also, you know a percentage of that going back into community

11:03.500 --> 11:05.500
projects projects that are critical to

11:06.620 --> 11:14.400
Those operating systems and the community at large and you know Red Hat a great ambassadors for the open source community

11:14.400 --> 11:18.740
They employ a large number of developers on different open source projects

11:18.900 --> 11:24.580
so for all of the money that you know Red Hat are making they are channeling a lot of

11:24.580 --> 11:28.220
resources back into open source projects

11:29.220 --> 11:33.900
But of course, it's never going to be enough. There's always going to be something like GNU PG. Yeah, it's true

11:33.900 --> 11:39.700
Yeah needs that needs some funding and I I don't mean to say that these new users they come over aren't potential users to

11:39.700 --> 11:42.500
Sort of over time train them and sort of teach them

11:43.500 --> 11:48.840
Through blog posts and mediums like podcasts with the values of open source of why it's important that that is free

11:49.240 --> 11:51.780
So that's a possibility that they are potential

11:51.780 --> 11:58.940
Converts of the ideology we can teach them our philosophy, but as they come in they're they're sort of the pragmatists at this point

11:58.940 --> 12:02.760
They just want to get their job. Whatever their pragmatists are kits and you think maybe it's a consumerism thing

12:03.940 --> 12:05.540
Yeah, I think so

12:05.540 --> 12:13.300
It's the same reason that people go to Abercrombie and Fitch to get a t-shirt or whatever rather than you know

12:13.380 --> 12:15.380
Go to Goodwill

12:15.380 --> 12:21.160
Now how do you relate that to desktop Linux I

12:22.060 --> 12:28.500
Think that people see the idea of like a Macintosh or Windows box is somehow crafted

12:28.900 --> 12:33.940
Especially for them, even though it's not it's that kind of thing. Hmm. Hmm

12:33.940 --> 12:37.340
I wonder in all of this if we also are suffering a little bit from our

12:37.620 --> 12:42.460
More, you know our stark division between kernel and user space where they're like we have the Linux Foundation

12:42.460 --> 12:46.220
I feel like a lot of you know, we talk a lot about the kernel. We talk a lot about the kernel community

12:46.220 --> 12:50.820
But less so about the wider GNU ecosystem and a lot of you know core utils

12:50.820 --> 12:56.400
We have celebrity projects right and whereas there's a lot of stuff that isn't sexy that you know

12:56.780 --> 13:00.420
Makes let's let's use our wonderful kernel that maybe doesn't get that much attention

13:01.020 --> 13:04.620
It's a good point. And so this sort of brings us to the next story

13:04.740 --> 13:09.100
That's sort of trying to tackle this specially crafted desktop. Give it something nice

13:09.100 --> 13:15.460
New version of solace 1.0 is out the big one. Oh is here

13:15.460 --> 13:18.140
We've been covering it all year long on the show

13:18.140 --> 13:23.300
We just recently did our review of the early version and I'm pretty excited about it. I key just joined us

13:23.340 --> 13:25.340
Thanks for coming in the last minute. I think he's here now, right?

13:26.180 --> 13:28.980
Good. I keep welcome to unplugged in that nice timing sir

13:29.700 --> 13:36.300
Thank you very much. Yes, so come on. Don't just sit there and be quiet brag about the new release

13:36.300 --> 13:41.260
Tell us what's awesome and tell me how the reception's been. I was to be honest with you

13:41.720 --> 13:46.820
We didn't expect it to go the way it's gone. And I don't mean that in a bad way. I really don't so

13:47.540 --> 13:51.900
Apart from the fact that my host is being completely derpy and I can't find out the stats myself

13:52.060 --> 13:57.940
We've had something like 12,000 downloads already. I would imagine I've seen coverage all over the place about the release. I

13:58.980 --> 14:00.700
Mean, I was really surprised to be honest

14:00.700 --> 14:04.980
I mean and on the one hand they shouldn't be surprised because you know, that's kind of why you're doing it

14:04.980 --> 14:07.940
You kind of want to spam it everywhere and get everyone to use it

14:09.180 --> 14:11.180
It actually works though

14:11.420 --> 14:13.420
Yeah

14:13.500 --> 14:17.940
Well, there's a tiny bug and some people can but you know, it's the end of the year we pretend that didn't happen, right?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.940
Yeah

14:22.220 --> 14:28.020
So I see a lot of different people posting on g-plus using it a lot of people talking about

14:28.660 --> 14:30.340
What they like about it

14:30.340 --> 14:36.300
So anything major change since we reviewed it on the show any other any any adaptations or improvements. Oh

14:37.300 --> 14:40.060
Yeah, basically everything. Yeah

14:41.980 --> 14:47.900
So we completely rewrote budget because to be fair the old one it's now technically two years old and

14:48.340 --> 14:54.540
But the old version, I mean it was full of full of bugs and we had work around there since like early GTK version

14:54.540 --> 14:56.300
So we took all that out

14:56.300 --> 15:00.500
Budgie now has multiple panel support at the moment. You can have a top and a bottom panel

15:00.500 --> 15:03.740
But we'll add left and right later on and we got a new notification

15:04.500 --> 15:10.960
Center, which is called Raven and so your notifications get archived there at the moment. They're not interactive, but they will become that

15:11.660 --> 15:16.540
You can configure everything there from there. So the old derpy settings dialog is completely gone

15:16.620 --> 15:20.580
It's kind of your one-stop shop now to configure budgie. So it's kind of cool

15:20.580 --> 15:27.060
So how has the coverage been release wise I have the blog posts and then stories that have been written up about it been pretty

15:27.060 --> 15:31.660
Accurate on the coverage. I'm sure a lot of people must be talking about built from scratch. How a hit-and-miss. What's that like?

15:33.340 --> 15:35.340
So we won't mention read it

15:36.500 --> 15:39.900
I'm now the Antichrist on reddit. I feel great about it

15:42.420 --> 15:44.420
It's an uplifting feeling sorry to God

15:45.500 --> 15:47.260
better than being a

15:47.260 --> 15:53.100
Yeah, I mean most of them have been really really good to be honest with you. Um, there are inaccuracies in some places

15:53.100 --> 15:56.340
But to be fair, I was lazy about updating the site

15:56.340 --> 16:01.580
You know, we were supposed to release on the 25th and we managed it the early hours of the 27th

16:02.240 --> 16:05.860
Which is a lot better than our last release dates been three months late

16:06.420 --> 16:10.500
So we did all right there two days, you know, you can you can take that. Yeah, and

16:10.980 --> 16:12.460
some places

16:12.460 --> 16:18.740
It just clearly not doing the research which is gonna happen. So, you know, you take the coverage first over the accuracy

16:18.740 --> 16:20.740
That's kind of all you can do

16:20.780 --> 16:24.220
But I mean on the whole people have been positive about it. Some people

16:25.300 --> 16:30.460
Focuses on the wrong parts like oh you're using a different package manager. It's like it doesn't matter

16:30.980 --> 16:35.300
You still have software in the desktop can install them. You can run them it. Yeah. Yeah

16:35.300 --> 16:39.740
Yeah, I mean if you've really I felt like saying there is IPM in a repo if you want to install it

16:39.740 --> 16:44.300
I didn't go that far. I'm not gonna subject anybody to that. Come on

16:47.420 --> 16:53.740
Well, congratulations and it's been fun to watch the projects arc and I you know

16:53.740 --> 16:56.980
You kind of had hinted there might be a present from Santa

16:56.980 --> 17:01.980
It was a little late, but nonetheless it's still really it's still landed in the rough time timeline

17:01.980 --> 17:06.460
So I think I kind of had a bit too much beer. I think and was maybe a little bit late

17:06.460 --> 17:12.020
But we made it hangover or not. We got there, you know, very good. Well, congratulations and

17:12.620 --> 17:13.900
so

17:13.900 --> 17:18.500
What wins the next version? Come on now? Come on now, you know once shit. Well, I always shit. Yeah

17:19.660 --> 17:27.180
Will be we will be putting out minor releases. Yeah, and the first minor release is going to be in January. Okay, that's pretty soon

17:27.460 --> 17:29.460
Yeah, yeah. Yeah

17:29.540 --> 17:35.220
Very cool guys. Well, congratulations. I think we're all looking forward to seeing this. Yeah, you know a new member of the ecosystem

17:35.220 --> 17:40.600
Yeah, yeah. Well done. I key. Yeah, keep us posted. Thank you very much. It's always fun to see a new one

17:40.600 --> 17:41.940
Oh born exactly

17:41.940 --> 17:42.180
Yeah

17:42.180 --> 17:47.300
And you guys have been you guys been doing a great job spreading the word on gplus and all that and the blog

17:47.500 --> 17:50.420
Post looks really good. So yeah, great stuff

17:51.020 --> 17:55.740
All right. Well, then let's take a minute to tell you something else. That's extremely great. That's my friends over digital ocean

17:55.740 --> 17:57.740
Did you know about my friends over digital ocean? Oh

17:57.860 --> 18:00.340
you go check out do yo cuz I got the droplets and

18:00.340 --> 18:06.500
You can use our promo code do unplugged to get a $10 credit do unplugged one word lowercase over digital ocean a simple cloud hosting

18:06.500 --> 18:11.260
Provider dedicated giving you the best Linux rig all on SSDs using KVM. Whoo

18:12.140 --> 18:15.500
That's what makes up a droplet because they take super great hardware tier 1 bandwidth

18:15.820 --> 18:19.540
Data centers all over the world and they let you do it all in less than 55 seconds

18:19.700 --> 18:24.300
The pricing plans you get a whole server spun up less than 55 seconds pricing plans start up five dollars a month

18:24.300 --> 18:27.940
Get your 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD cuz

18:27.940 --> 18:36.180
One CPU and a terabyte transfer. I'm not even playing Wes a terabyte and you know, we say that we say terabyte of transfer

18:36.180 --> 18:41.580
We say to your one bandwidth, but it it's really there. Yeah, it is a it makes a big difference over the holidays

18:41.580 --> 18:45.180
I wanted to you know, watch some stuff. We weren't with some friends of mine. We weren't in the same location

18:45.180 --> 18:49.680
I wanted to watch a synchronized stream. I spun up a do droplet stalled engine X

18:50.300 --> 18:55.220
Installed the RTMP module nice to send an RTMP stream up there and bam

18:55.220 --> 18:58.300
Yeah, we actually do that pretty often when we're on location. It's great

18:58.300 --> 19:01.180
It's amazing and you know, or I use it all the time. Is it just a proxy?

19:01.180 --> 19:05.220
You know, I don't have a good link to somewhere. Yeah spin up a droplet download it there. Oh, yeah, absolutely

19:05.220 --> 19:07.680
I use that all the time for the rover all the time

19:07.980 --> 19:10.620
There's some and when you use the promo code deal unplugged you get the $10 credit

19:10.620 --> 19:12.620
You can run that $5 rig two months for free

19:13.060 --> 19:20.100
Speaking of engine X they have a recent tutorial. I was posted on the 17th how to secure engine X with let's encrypt

19:20.700 --> 19:22.900
Yeah, so your favorite. Yeah, exactly

19:22.900 --> 19:26.820
So if you want to use let's encrypt on a boon to 1404, they've got a really great guide up a digital

19:26.820 --> 19:28.860
I have tons of good guides tons of stuff

19:28.860 --> 19:34.940
So they have one-click deployment of apps like entire stacks of applications in some cases and then for the stuff where they don't just have

19:34.940 --> 19:39.980
A one button they have really good tutorials because they pay people to write these and then they have full-time editors to edit them

19:40.620 --> 19:47.620
It's really good stuff and it really takes it's like it takes the best of the arch wiki and brings it to your service provider

19:48.100 --> 19:51.700
But it's even better than it shows how much they care about the community, you know

19:51.700 --> 19:54.380
Like they're not just here to make money. They do obviously and they should yeah

19:54.380 --> 19:58.060
But they really give a lot back and they don't lock these down to be do specific either, right?

19:58.060 --> 20:01.820
She's pretty cool. There's quickly becoming some of the top hits on Google a lot of these questions

20:01.820 --> 20:06.260
Yeah, I think that's probably their strategy and then why you the way you do that is by making really good content

20:06.260 --> 20:10.420
Exactly digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplug to go spin up a rig

20:10.420 --> 20:16.060
There's lots of cool stuff you can do with it and a big thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program for all

20:16.060 --> 20:18.060
of 2015

20:18.060 --> 20:24.260
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do thanks guys and thanks you guys out there listening for using that promo code do unplug

20:24.260 --> 20:25.700
Cuz well, that's what keeps them coming back

20:25.700 --> 20:30.760
Keep spinning up those droplets and that's how we're able to show up and buy beer for this show. Let's be honest

20:31.200 --> 20:34.940
Digital ocean comm use the promo code d a one plugged. Thanks digital ocean

20:35.460 --> 20:38.140
Okay. So have you heard of North Korea's?

20:38.940 --> 20:42.260
Operating system called red star OS before today had you heard of it before today?

20:42.260 --> 20:46.360
I had but I never used it before today. We talked about a little bit a long time ago

20:46.360 --> 20:47.800
Yeah, you actually used it.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.320
What was that process like?

20:49.320 --> 20:50.760
Actually, it was surprisingly easy.

20:50.760 --> 20:51.840
Did you have to torrent it?

20:51.840 --> 20:53.800
And then, or did they have direct downloads, or like?

20:53.800 --> 20:55.360
Actually, I found there was a direct download

20:55.360 --> 20:56.200
in one of the links,

20:56.200 --> 20:57.480
and actually downloaded very quickly,

20:57.480 --> 20:59.400
faster than some Linux distributions, actually.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.240
Nice.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.240
It's just an ISO file, loaded it up in a virtual machine,

21:02.240 --> 21:04.360
and it's kind of the, you know,

21:04.360 --> 21:07.240
the similar Ubuntu installer that they've copied over.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.060
Yeah, okay.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.160
But I was able to, even though it was entirely in Korean,

21:10.160 --> 21:11.320
I was able to click through it,

21:11.320 --> 21:12.940
get it installed, and boot it up.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.260
It does have an English mode

21:14.260 --> 21:15.780
if you can find it in the installer.

21:15.780 --> 21:18.880
So it's based on, I believe, Fedora.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.720
But they've taken so much stuff

21:20.720 --> 21:22.280
from so many different operating systems,

21:22.280 --> 21:24.240
it's really kind of remarkable.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.720
It's a science experiment.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.160
There's clearly a lot of engineering work

21:27.160 --> 21:28.160
that went into it. Yes.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.680
They've built their own quote unquote virus scanner,

21:30.680 --> 21:31.720
which runs all the time,

21:31.720 --> 21:33.480
but it's not actually even a virus scanner,

21:33.480 --> 21:35.340
it's a pattern matching scanner.

21:35.340 --> 21:36.960
So if you put documents on your system

21:36.960 --> 21:38.560
that have certain phrases in them,

21:38.560 --> 21:40.740
it immediately deletes them, instantly.

21:40.740 --> 21:41.580
I gotta try that.

21:41.580 --> 21:43.400
There's a lot of really interesting things

21:43.400 --> 21:45.720
in this operating system.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.600
And so two German researchers, Florian and Nicholas,

21:48.600 --> 21:49.520
I think is how you say his name,

21:49.520 --> 21:51.240
pulled apart the North Korean operating system,

21:51.240 --> 21:54.200
which closely resembles Mac OS X in far as its look.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.080
Very much like an older version of Mac OS X

21:56.080 --> 21:58.860
when the brushed metal thing was really popular.

21:58.860 --> 22:01.560
This was at the Chaos Communications Club in Hamburg.

22:02.940 --> 22:05.000
They say, we found that the features implemented

22:05.000 --> 22:06.840
in Red Star OS were the wet dream

22:06.840 --> 22:09.280
of a surveillance state dictator.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.440
How about that?

22:10.440 --> 22:15.440
So, because it is a traditional Linux OS,

22:15.680 --> 22:18.400
I figured we probably, just as Linux users,

22:18.400 --> 22:20.320
would be kind of curious what's under the hood.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.400
So I grabbed a few clips,

22:21.400 --> 22:26.400
and this first clip tells us what is just the core use,

22:26.600 --> 22:28.480
what's at the core just from a standard

22:28.480 --> 22:30.720
Linux desktop perspective of Red Star.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.540
If you look into the operating system,

22:32.540 --> 22:35.840
it's basically a fully featured general desktop system,

22:35.840 --> 22:36.840
you might imagine.

22:36.840 --> 22:40.140
It's based on KDE and Fedora, as I already said,

22:40.140 --> 22:42.960
and it tries to mimic the look and feel of Mac OS X.

22:42.960 --> 22:46.440
You have an email client, a calendar, a word processor,

22:46.440 --> 22:49.780
you've got QuickTime and all of that stuff.

22:49.780 --> 22:51.620
You even have a disk encryption utility

22:51.620 --> 22:55.060
that Will Scott has shown last year.

22:55.060 --> 22:57.220
They implemented additional kernel modules,

22:57.220 --> 23:00.020
and they touched a lot of kernel modules, so.

23:03.120 --> 23:03.960
Oh, hi.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.660
The kernel modules is kind of an interesting thing

23:05.660 --> 23:06.500
in particular.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.440
I might circle back to that in a moment.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.160
They went through and dug through a lot of this stuff,

23:11.160 --> 23:14.560
and what you have is you have a whole system

23:14.560 --> 23:16.720
that has a whole series of protected files

23:16.720 --> 23:17.880
that can't be touched,

23:17.880 --> 23:20.360
and some of these protected files are backend daemons,

23:20.360 --> 23:23.120
some of them are other strange things like.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.400
I sure did a PS real quick,

23:24.400 --> 23:26.920
and there's a lot of stuff running on your default install.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.560
Yeah, and some of that stuff you can't stop

23:28.560 --> 23:29.880
because of this protection system,

23:29.880 --> 23:32.520
and there's some stuff that kind of makes sense

23:32.520 --> 23:34.800
like some of these system files you can't change,

23:34.800 --> 23:36.420
and there's other things that are protected,

23:36.420 --> 23:38.360
like a WAV file that are really strange.

23:38.360 --> 23:41.040
Quite interesting is that

23:41.040 --> 23:42.880
when we were looking through all of this stuff,

23:42.880 --> 23:47.160
there was a bunch of files that have a certain protection,

23:47.160 --> 23:49.500
and they seem to be pretty important for the system,

23:49.500 --> 23:51.980
and then there is a WAV file,

23:51.980 --> 23:56.560
an audio WAV file that actually is protected.

23:56.560 --> 24:01.560
It's userLibWarning.wav.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.340
I don't know if we can hear this.

24:03.340 --> 24:06.120
I hope that your ears are not going to explode right now.

24:06.120 --> 24:06.960
I'll just try it.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.440
Ah!

24:08.440 --> 24:09.500
Do you recognize it?

24:09.500 --> 24:10.840
I'll try it again.

24:10.840 --> 24:11.920
Ah!

24:11.920 --> 24:13.140
You hear that?

24:13.140 --> 24:14.240
Can you tell what it is?

24:14.240 --> 24:15.080
Sounds like a pig.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.400
Yeah.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.360
Ah!

24:17.360 --> 24:19.060
Does anybody know what this is?

24:20.940 --> 24:21.780
Pardon me?

24:22.960 --> 24:25.020
A pig, exactly, and where is it coming from?

24:25.020 --> 24:26.560
Does anybody know?

24:26.560 --> 24:28.400
Do you have any guess where this pig noise is coming from?

24:28.400 --> 24:29.440
I have no idea.

24:29.440 --> 24:30.480
I don't think you'd ever guess it.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.320
Anybody in the Mamba Room

24:31.320 --> 24:33.000
have a guess where the pig noise came from?

24:33.000 --> 24:34.520
It's actually kind of funny.

24:34.520 --> 24:36.280
I've watched the videos, so I'm cheating.

24:36.280 --> 24:37.620
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

24:37.620 --> 24:38.460
Well, don't say it.

24:38.460 --> 24:39.280
I'll play it, and then we'll say it.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.560
That's stolen from Kaspersky Antivirus,

24:41.560 --> 24:43.900
because in the older version of Kaspersky Antivirus,

24:43.900 --> 24:47.740
if you find a virus, it actually will play this sound,

24:47.740 --> 24:50.300
and it's exactly the WAV file from Kaspersky.

24:50.300 --> 24:53.120
We verified this by doing checksums, okay?

24:53.120 --> 24:57.320
So we have a copyright violation right here.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.160
Ha ha!

24:59.040 --> 25:01.120
I don't think anybody's going to stop that.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.840
So yeah, it was a pig from Kaspersky Antivirus.

25:03.840 --> 25:06.080
They have reached into every nook and cranny

25:06.080 --> 25:06.920
of the ecosystem.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.080
This desktop even has a QuickTime player.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.080
They call it QuickTime player,

25:10.080 --> 25:12.440
and didn't you say it's like located in slash applications?

25:12.440 --> 25:14.060
Yeah, it looks like an OS X package,

25:14.060 --> 25:15.460
but it's a Linux binary in there.

25:15.460 --> 25:18.160
Yeah, yeah, so back to the virtual log.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.040
Somebody was going to say something

25:19.040 --> 25:20.560
about the pig noise, I think.

25:21.520 --> 25:26.120
Yeah, it sounded a lot like a pig noise from Warcraft 2.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.280
Oh yeah, that too, yeah.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.640
I thought it was going to be like some slam

25:28.640 --> 25:30.760
against American pigs, is what I thought it was,

25:30.760 --> 25:32.040
and maybe it is. Unclean.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.720
The warning comes up when you're doing something

25:33.720 --> 25:34.920
from the West.

25:34.920 --> 25:39.920
So then there's two processes on a Red Star OS installation

25:41.180 --> 25:44.880
that are all about the quote unquote integrity

25:44.880 --> 25:46.120
of the system.

25:46.120 --> 25:49.640
They watch your system, and if you alter certain files,

25:49.640 --> 25:52.240
there's a primary daemon, and then there's a backup daemon,

25:52.240 --> 25:56.720
and they take dramatic action if you alter a specific file.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.280
They're supposed to prevent tampering,

25:58.280 --> 26:00.320
and they called it Security D.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.880
Security D is kind of interesting

26:02.880 --> 26:05.120
because Security D is also a process

26:05.120 --> 26:07.660
that is known to run on the Mac OS X,

26:07.660 --> 26:09.860
and I think that I'm not a Mac user,

26:09.860 --> 26:12.320
and I think that Mac OS X with Security D

26:12.320 --> 26:14.600
is kind of keeping track of certificates

26:14.600 --> 26:15.560
and stuff like that.

26:15.560 --> 26:20.440
So what they did is they re-implemented Security D for Linux,

26:20.440 --> 26:22.400
and they included various plugins,

26:22.400 --> 26:25.320
and one interesting issue with Security D

26:25.320 --> 26:27.360
is that it comes with a library

26:27.360 --> 26:30.400
that provides a function called Validate OS,

26:30.400 --> 26:33.600
and what this function does is it has a hard-coded list

26:33.600 --> 26:37.600
of files, you can see like our WAV file right here,

26:37.600 --> 26:41.120
you can see configuration files and autostart files

26:41.120 --> 26:44.600
for SCNPRC is the antivirus scanner,

26:44.600 --> 26:47.880
so it checks if these files are untouched,

26:47.880 --> 26:50.280
and if these files have been tampered with,

26:50.280 --> 26:53.160
it initiates a reboot instantly.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.460
So if you touch one of these files,

26:55.460 --> 26:57.720
your machine will reboot instantly.

26:57.720 --> 27:02.140
The same library is also used from KDM,

27:02.140 --> 27:05.520
so during the startup process when KDM is starting,

27:05.520 --> 27:07.920
it is also doing an integrity check,

27:07.920 --> 27:09.880
and if it finds that one of these files

27:09.880 --> 27:11.200
has been tampered with,

27:11.200 --> 27:13.920
it actually immediately issues a reboot,

27:13.920 --> 27:15.880
and the problem is that if you start tampering

27:15.880 --> 27:18.400
with the system, you will end up in reboot loops

27:18.400 --> 27:20.280
all of the time if you're doing your research,

27:20.280 --> 27:24.720
because once KDM is saying reboot the system,

27:24.720 --> 27:26.880
it's going to check it again if it's rebooted

27:26.880 --> 27:28.500
and sees like it's still tampered with

27:28.500 --> 27:30.560
and it's rebooting again and again and again,

27:30.560 --> 27:32.260
and then your system is basically dead.

27:32.260 --> 27:33.100
Super annoying.

27:33.100 --> 27:33.920
Wow.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.280
Yeah, and so they kind of went through in the video,

27:36.280 --> 27:37.600
they talk about what you would have to do

27:37.600 --> 27:39.760
to de-weaponize this thing,

27:39.760 --> 27:42.040
and it's like this whole process of peeling an onion,

27:42.040 --> 27:44.440
and then one of the last things is you go clean up KDM

27:44.440 --> 27:47.400
so it stops checking to see if files have been modified too.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.920
And you could see like if you're distributing

27:48.920 --> 27:51.160
an operating system, integrity would be pretty important,

27:51.160 --> 27:52.840
I suppose, of that operating system.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.520
I'm also just imagining a free software advocate

27:55.520 --> 27:58.080
going to a dictator in a country and telling them about

27:58.080 --> 27:59.820
all the great things you can do with free software

27:59.820 --> 28:02.620
and how you can customize it for exactly your use case,

28:02.620 --> 28:04.200
be that spying on your citizens or not.

28:04.200 --> 28:09.200
Yeah, so our next one really kind of fits in perfectly

28:09.280 --> 28:11.200
with that whole spying on your citizens theme.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.800
They, and this is something we covered I think a year ago,

28:13.800 --> 28:15.440
but now we have details on how it works,

28:15.440 --> 28:16.960
and they go into further detail in the video,

28:16.960 --> 28:18.960
which I have embedded in the show notes.

28:20.360 --> 28:25.240
Media files that you put on Red Star OS get watermarked

28:25.240 --> 28:28.920
with a ID that is generated based on hardware

28:28.920 --> 28:31.080
in your computer, so it is unique to each PC,

28:31.080 --> 28:33.640
and then every PC that media file goes to

28:33.640 --> 28:36.180
gets that PC's identifier appended to it.

28:36.180 --> 28:39.440
So you could actually track it down back to the original PC

28:39.440 --> 28:40.440
where the media file was created

28:40.440 --> 28:41.640
and each person it was shared with.

28:41.640 --> 28:44.160
But the most interesting thing this service is doing

28:44.160 --> 28:46.480
is it watermarks files.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.080
And now we are going to look deeper

28:48.080 --> 28:50.260
into what this watermarking means.

28:50.260 --> 28:53.160
So actually, as soon as this system will be started,

28:53.160 --> 28:55.640
it reads your hard disk serial and then scrambles it

28:55.640 --> 28:59.000
a little bit, and as soon as you are plugging in,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.080
for example, a USB stick in your system,

29:01.080 --> 29:04.080
then it will trigger a watermarking process

29:04.080 --> 29:07.520
where it takes the serial, takes and hardcodes a death key

29:07.520 --> 29:09.780
from the binary itself, and then encrypts it

29:09.780 --> 29:11.380
and puts it into your file.

29:11.380 --> 29:15.240
When you're converting this hex key

29:15.240 --> 29:17.640
into a decimal representation,

29:17.640 --> 29:20.480
then you see that it's actually two dates.

29:20.480 --> 29:23.320
We actually cannot confirm what those dates mean,

29:23.320 --> 29:27.300
but one of those matches Madonna's birthday.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.140
Madonna's birthday?

29:28.140 --> 29:30.800
There are rumors that some people in North Korea

29:30.800 --> 29:35.800
might really like Madonna, but this is just speculations.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.440
But if you have a better conspiracy theory,

29:38.440 --> 29:40.440
then just let us know.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.540
Because we found some pretty interesting stuff,

29:42.540 --> 29:44.600
but we actually cannot confirm this.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.000
So technically, the watermarks,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.440
they have an ASCII EOF appended,

29:49.440 --> 29:51.420
which is most likely used by the code itself

29:51.420 --> 29:53.480
to parse the files and see if there's already

29:53.480 --> 29:55.400
a watermark in there.

29:55.400 --> 29:58.240
And for JPEG and RV files, for example,

29:58.240 --> 30:01.280
it just appends this watermark to the end of the file.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.880
And when you have a docx, for example,

30:02.880 --> 30:05.120
then it appends it near the header

30:05.120 --> 30:06.600
where a bunch of null bytes,

30:06.600 --> 30:08.680
and then it just puts it in there.

30:08.680 --> 30:12.200
So it's aware of the type of media file it's altering.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.040
See what I mean?

30:13.040 --> 30:13.880
This is a lot of work to make this system.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.200
It really is.

30:15.200 --> 30:16.280
It really is.

30:16.280 --> 30:19.760
So the watermarking itself is like,

30:19.760 --> 30:22.320
as soon as you open a document file with the office,

30:22.320 --> 30:24.440
then it will be watermarked.

30:24.440 --> 30:28.400
And actually, they have code which watermarks files

30:28.400 --> 30:29.920
even if you don't open those files.

30:29.920 --> 30:34.000
But as soon as we saw this, it's pretty buggy.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.160
It doesn't work every time.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.060
But they have code for this implemented.

30:38.060 --> 30:42.600
And mostly it works, but sometimes it just fails.

30:42.600 --> 30:46.880
The supported types that we can confirm are docx files,

30:46.880 --> 30:51.560
image files like JPEG and PNG and RV video files.

30:51.560 --> 30:54.880
But the code indicates that there are several more file types

30:54.880 --> 30:56.840
available for watermarking,

30:56.840 --> 30:58.720
but we most likely didn't look into this.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.760
But the most interesting thing here

31:01.760 --> 31:05.000
is that only media files are affected.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.880
So they don't watermark any binaries or something like that.

31:07.880 --> 31:11.960
They're just, they're reducing their surface to files

31:11.960 --> 31:14.800
which could be used to carry information,

31:14.800 --> 31:19.800
which is actually, which could be used to put information

31:20.760 --> 31:22.480
for your free speech purposes.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.840
And actually what we think is that

31:24.840 --> 31:26.480
this is not a security feature,

31:26.480 --> 31:28.720
so they're actually trying to watermark

31:28.720 --> 31:30.120
free speech in general.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.640
So that every time you might have a document file,

31:32.640 --> 31:34.060
an image or a video file,

31:35.020 --> 31:37.720
then they want to know who had this file

31:37.720 --> 31:39.920
and they watermark it so they can track

31:39.920 --> 31:41.480
the origin of the file.

31:41.480 --> 31:44.360
And they show a visualization of a program

31:44.360 --> 31:45.440
they were able to put it into

31:45.440 --> 31:49.640
and generate essentially a social connections graph

31:49.640 --> 31:52.800
of all of the computers that this had visited.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.360
And they say it's entirely possible

31:54.360 --> 31:55.280
that these files would have visited.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.640
They say it's entirely possible that Red Star OS

31:58.640 --> 32:02.560
could send that ID back to some central server

32:02.560 --> 32:06.480
so they would know which machine ID is tied to which IP.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.920
They wouldn't even have to come hunt down the machine,

32:07.920 --> 32:08.760
they'd just know what house it's at.

32:08.760 --> 32:12.840
And they use an internal IP scheme, 10.1.something.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.760
Right, yeah, at least they're using a private subnet,

32:14.760 --> 32:15.600
that's nice.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.420
The whole country.

32:16.420 --> 32:17.260
That's crazy.

32:17.260 --> 32:18.320
The whole country's behind an app.

32:18.320 --> 32:22.560
And the web browser is a Firefox fork

32:22.560 --> 32:24.560
and it's like a Firefox 3.0 fork,

32:24.560 --> 32:25.400
the one they looked at.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.220
They have a newer version out now

32:26.220 --> 32:28.880
but the researchers didn't get a chance to look at it.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.680
The only SSL root servers it has support for

32:31.680 --> 32:33.520
are North Korean ones.

32:33.520 --> 32:38.360
And it's just set to use all North Korean URLs

32:38.360 --> 32:42.600
and I couldn't even quite get a DHCP provided address

32:42.600 --> 32:44.640
on my network so maybe I'll have to change that

32:44.640 --> 32:47.640
and see if it's in 10 slash eight, maybe it'll work.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.680
Isn't that interesting that it seems like the DHCP client

32:49.680 --> 32:51.480
didn't even fire up when you tried it.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.880
And then they don't let you have root, so.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.160
You know, here's the reality,

32:55.160 --> 33:00.160
is you are giving the distro maker root access

33:00.520 --> 33:02.540
when you set up a Linux box.

33:02.540 --> 33:04.480
And anything they do, so like this thing,

33:04.480 --> 33:06.680
it automatically detects when thumb drives are connected,

33:06.680 --> 33:10.200
immediately mounts them, immediately scans all of the files.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.080
I mean it is very aggressive.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.720
Couple of things though that I thought were interesting

33:15.720 --> 33:17.380
that you might jump out at you

33:17.380 --> 33:19.540
as something you might not expect.

33:19.540 --> 33:23.480
IP tables is installed, turned on, and configured by default

33:23.480 --> 33:25.800
to be protected, to protect the machine.

33:25.800 --> 33:26.640
Wow.

33:27.760 --> 33:28.720
There was a couple other things

33:28.720 --> 33:29.840
that I thought was kind of interesting.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.960
Snort, the intrusion detection system,

33:31.960 --> 33:33.880
installed by default, configured

33:33.880 --> 33:35.320
with some really reasonable defaults,

33:35.320 --> 33:37.920
not actually turned on, but just ready to be flipped on,

33:37.920 --> 33:40.720
and you have an IDS on your rig.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.720
They also included a well-known open source

33:43.720 --> 33:45.240
desktop encryption app.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.820
I'm blanking on the name, it's a GTK app,

33:46.820 --> 33:48.520
I believe it starts with a B.

33:48.520 --> 33:52.120
And I'm messing up with Becerra right now.

33:52.120 --> 33:57.120
And it is legitimately a encryption tool

33:57.560 --> 34:00.600
that allows users to encrypt their files on RedStar OS,

34:00.600 --> 34:02.320
and they can't even find a back,

34:02.320 --> 34:05.080
like they don't see any indication there's a back door.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.960
It's a really useful actual application.

34:06.960 --> 34:08.560
Yeah, their summarization was,

34:08.560 --> 34:10.480
even the North Korean government realizes

34:10.480 --> 34:13.040
that forcing back doors into software is futile

34:13.040 --> 34:14.240
and just gonna make you vulnerable,

34:14.240 --> 34:16.560
so they don't even, even North Korea doesn't bother

34:16.560 --> 34:17.880
trying to inject back doors,

34:17.880 --> 34:21.040
which I thought was a little slam at North Korea.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.760
It sounds like maybe, I'm sure they're using it

34:22.760 --> 34:25.320
for their regular citizens, but these kind of things

34:25.320 --> 34:27.120
make it sound like they're probably also gearing it

34:27.120 --> 34:28.240
for their military use, state use.

34:28.240 --> 34:31.080
Definitely, in fact, they said there's very, very few

34:31.080 --> 34:33.160
web-facing North Korean web servers

34:33.160 --> 34:35.040
that are publicly web-facing,

34:35.040 --> 34:37.760
but one that they did find publicly facing

34:37.760 --> 34:40.120
was running RedStar OS.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.200
Wow. Yeah.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.480
So, I guess the most recent version

34:43.480 --> 34:44.880
hasn't been publicly posted,

34:44.880 --> 34:47.280
so there is one version newer that's in North Korea

34:47.280 --> 34:48.580
that's based on newer stuff,

34:48.580 --> 34:52.120
like it's not based on the 2.6 kernel or something like that.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.720
So, Chris, any chance that Noah and Chris

34:54.720 --> 34:56.540
review RedStar OS?

34:56.540 --> 34:57.800
That would be funny.

34:57.800 --> 35:00.720
That would be, oh boy, what an idea, actually.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.080
That would be a good April Fools episode.

35:02.080 --> 35:02.920
It sure would.

35:02.920 --> 35:04.840
Save that one in the bank, that's not bad.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.280
I like that.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.880
So, Aiki, I didn't happen to be implying

35:09.880 --> 35:11.920
that maybe you're not the trustworthy sort,

35:11.920 --> 35:12.760
but it's true, right?

35:12.760 --> 35:16.380
You distro makers, you really have root access to my box.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.320
Yep.

35:18.320 --> 35:19.160
Yeah.

35:19.160 --> 35:23.000
And I don't know, there's a lot of people out there

35:23.000 --> 35:24.160
that may not really think about that

35:24.160 --> 35:26.380
when they're trying these one-off distributions.

35:26.380 --> 35:28.000
Why should I trust a guy like you, Aiki?

35:28.000 --> 35:28.820
What's going on?

35:28.820 --> 35:29.700
Is it just because Josh hangs out with you?

35:29.700 --> 35:30.620
I like Josh.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.200
No, I mean, mostly I've got a really awesome hat

35:34.200 --> 35:35.760
and I do look pretty good in jeans,

35:35.760 --> 35:39.040
so I mean, those stand for my character more than anything.

35:39.040 --> 35:39.960
I agree.

35:39.960 --> 35:42.240
Your logic has convinced me.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.640
The truth is, no matter what operating system you're using,

35:44.640 --> 35:48.240
if you're downloading from a repository

35:48.240 --> 35:49.380
and you're not the maintainer,

35:49.380 --> 35:51.120
then you're inherently trusting someone

35:51.120 --> 35:53.040
with root access, typically, so.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.040
Yeah, and you know, some of the tools they use

35:55.040 --> 35:56.800
to see if their operating system was spying on them,

35:56.800 --> 36:00.200
for example, was they would just really,

36:00.200 --> 36:01.740
like one of the first things that tipped them off,

36:01.740 --> 36:03.200
it's really simple and straightforward,

36:03.200 --> 36:05.240
they put a thumb drive with a text document

36:05.240 --> 36:08.660
in a Red Star OS machine and never opened it,

36:08.660 --> 36:11.020
and when they ejected it and put it back in another machine,

36:11.020 --> 36:12.680
the file size was slightly larger.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.520
And they're like, well, we never even opened the file.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.360
And so then they realized after analyzing it that it was,

36:17.360 --> 36:20.080
so there's just some basic tools they're using

36:20.080 --> 36:21.820
to determine if the system's spying on them.

36:21.820 --> 36:25.080
So the nice thing is, is while they were capable

36:25.080 --> 36:26.800
of using free software to do this,

36:26.800 --> 36:31.800
to surveil their public and to sort of monitor speech,

36:31.800 --> 36:36.520
also free tools were used to discover it and reveal it.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.840
So that's sort of the positive side of it, too.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.680
It really is.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.480
Any other thought, oh yeah, Aiki, go ahead.

36:41.480 --> 36:44.480
Yeah, so on the serious side of it,

36:44.480 --> 36:45.520
there's a few things that we can do.

36:45.520 --> 36:49.160
Now, in terms of delivery from us to the users,

36:49.160 --> 36:50.840
I mean, I know the problem is that we could be evil

36:50.840 --> 36:52.800
ourselves, but from us to the users,

36:52.800 --> 36:55.080
every single package has a hash in the index,

36:55.080 --> 36:57.080
and we only use SSL on the repo, so I mean,

36:57.080 --> 37:00.620
that's one part, they know it'll only be us who compromises.

37:00.620 --> 37:03.160
But on the other side of it, we are open source,

37:03.160 --> 37:05.920
and all of our infrastructure is completely transparent.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.340
We've got build instructions out there,

37:07.340 --> 37:09.960
so anyone can take a package from the Solace repo,

37:09.960 --> 37:12.040
they can build it exactly the same way that we do it,

37:12.040 --> 37:14.540
and they can see every individual comment

37:14.540 --> 37:17.040
that went into making an update that they got.

37:17.040 --> 37:20.080
So that would be one thing that would kind of mitigate

37:20.080 --> 37:20.920
the concerns for people.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.820
They can actually see what we're doing in real time.

37:22.820 --> 37:25.680
Yeah, yeah, Red Star's being developed behind closed doors.

37:25.680 --> 37:28.300
That's a pretty big difference, isn't it?

37:28.300 --> 37:29.140
Yeah, good points.

37:29.140 --> 37:30.160
All right, anyone else in the moment room

37:30.160 --> 37:31.460
have any closing thoughts?

37:32.560 --> 37:34.320
Yes, I do on this.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.160
Yeah, yeah.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.240
So not only do the distro makers have root access,

37:39.240 --> 37:43.080
really anybody that makes a RPM or a deb package,

37:43.080 --> 37:46.000
because those things have setup scripts inside them too.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.160
Yeah, they do. Yes, they do.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.860
Yeah, that's one of the reasons why you have folks

37:50.860 --> 37:52.360
that are trying to work on installing applications

37:52.360 --> 37:53.440
inside sandboxes.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.680
That's part of the reason sandboxing brings some security,

37:57.680 --> 37:59.280
not just when the application's running

37:59.280 --> 38:00.840
in case the application has a vulnerability,

38:00.840 --> 38:02.340
but installation time as well.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.040
It's probably something that'll come up in 2016.

38:05.040 --> 38:05.880
I think it will.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.520
Speaking of things that might happen in 2016,

38:07.520 --> 38:08.920
I bet that's one we'll actually see

38:08.920 --> 38:11.320
somebody working a lot more on.

38:11.320 --> 38:14.360
All right, well, I want to follow up on the canoe,

38:14.360 --> 38:16.520
and I also want to talk about scale,

38:16.520 --> 38:18.320
because scale's getting crazy.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.220
I can't believe it.

38:19.220 --> 38:22.600
So before we do that, I'm going to mention Linux Academy.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.840
Talk about something else you could do in 2016.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.160
Bring your skill level up a little bit,

38:26.160 --> 38:27.400
and Linux Academy's the place to go.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

38:29.780 --> 38:31.460
They've been sponsors of the unplugged program now

38:31.460 --> 38:32.680
for a while, and all of a sudden,

38:32.680 --> 38:35.880
they're also now on those jerks over at Linux Action Show.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.000
I don't know who those guys are,

38:37.000 --> 38:40.560
but Linux Academy is a platform created by Linux

38:40.560 --> 38:41.940
and open source enthusiasts.

38:41.940 --> 38:44.920
In fact, I think it's a pretty brilliant idea,

38:44.920 --> 38:47.420
because I've definitely noticed over the years

38:47.420 --> 38:50.240
that you can suss out somebody who's not really

38:50.240 --> 38:52.960
a genuine open source enthusiast or Linux user,

38:52.960 --> 38:55.200
somebody who's more of like getting into it

38:55.200 --> 38:56.020
to make money off of it.

38:56.020 --> 38:58.720
You definitely notice this when you go to the cons.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.880
You really see like there's companies out there

39:00.880 --> 39:03.440
that make money off the open source ecosystem.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.000
And then there's companies out there

39:05.000 --> 39:06.680
that are part of the open source ecosystem.

39:06.680 --> 39:08.240
They work in there, they follow it,

39:08.240 --> 39:10.040
it's their day-to-day stuff, they live and breathe it,

39:10.040 --> 39:11.400
they advocate it.

39:11.400 --> 39:14.280
Those are the kind of people that make really great content

39:14.280 --> 39:15.520
for other people like that.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.240
And that's where Linux Academy stands.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.520
They are crazy passionate about Linux and open source,

39:19.520 --> 39:20.680
and they wanted to do something

39:20.680 --> 39:22.040
to spread the word about Linux,

39:22.040 --> 39:23.880
and to do something in the content space,

39:23.880 --> 39:25.080
and they just happened to figure out

39:25.080 --> 39:26.240
a pretty good revenue model.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.080
Not like I have.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.360
I think they did a better job than I did.

39:28.360 --> 39:29.280
They might be smarter than you.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.160
They might be, they might be.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.320
You can get smart too by going to

39:32.320 --> 39:34.000
linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.800
Scenario-based labs, almost 2,000 comprehensive

39:36.800 --> 39:39.140
study guides with videos, instructor help on demand,

39:39.140 --> 39:40.840
seven plus distros you choose from.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.320
It automatically adjusts the courseware

39:42.320 --> 39:43.600
and the virtual servers.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.800
Did I mention that instructor help?

39:44.800 --> 39:46.260
Because that's actually a huge deal.

39:46.260 --> 39:50.100
So it's not just like, okay, go punch some buttons,

39:50.100 --> 39:51.400
and then good luck with everything.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.440
It's like, here's some genuinely good content

39:53.440 --> 39:54.840
by people who really care.

39:54.840 --> 39:57.520
Oh, and if you get stuck, instructor help is available.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.120
That's what makes the difference for me,

39:59.120 --> 40:00.280
because I feel like there's a lot of us,

40:00.280 --> 40:01.740
and we kind of feel like, well, we're smart,

40:01.740 --> 40:03.160
we know computers, I should be able to read

40:03.160 --> 40:04.320
the man pages and figure it out,

40:04.320 --> 40:06.640
but sometimes you want to learn stuff,

40:06.640 --> 40:07.480
and you want to learn it quick,

40:07.480 --> 40:08.380
and you want to learn it well,

40:08.380 --> 40:10.120
and they have real experts to help you.

40:10.120 --> 40:12.080
And that is really a competitive advantage

40:12.080 --> 40:13.960
that a lot of online learning services

40:13.960 --> 40:17.160
cannot compete with, and I think what's genuinely great

40:17.160 --> 40:21.200
about that is the specific type of subject material

40:21.200 --> 40:23.060
is even more challenging for most of these places

40:23.060 --> 40:24.840
to deal with, and this is their bread and butter.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.080
And it's the entire technology stack around Linux

40:27.080 --> 40:29.320
and open source, including AWS,

40:29.320 --> 40:30.680
all of the Red Hat certifications

40:30.680 --> 40:31.920
if you want to get out and work in that space,

40:31.920 --> 40:34.240
OpenStack, Ubuntu, your basic Linux stuff,

40:34.240 --> 40:36.480
your advanced Linux stuff, all of it,

40:36.480 --> 40:38.520
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.440
They've been improving it all throughout 2015,

40:40.440 --> 40:42.200
and they continue to improve.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.520
Check them out and support the show

40:43.520 --> 40:45.920
by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

40:46.920 --> 40:50.320
Thanks, Linux Academy, for the year of support.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.940
Man, you guys rock it, you rock it.

40:52.940 --> 40:55.400
All right, so I want to just take a moment

40:55.400 --> 40:57.720
before we get into all the other stuff.

40:57.720 --> 41:00.120
We'll do the Canoe follow-up here in a second, too,

41:00.120 --> 41:02.120
but another little bit of follow-up

41:02.120 --> 41:04.280
from a discussion we had a couple of weeks ago.

41:04.280 --> 41:07.320
You see this rumor that Mozilla is working on a tablet,

41:07.320 --> 41:12.140
a stick, and a keyboard, oh, and also a router.

41:12.140 --> 41:12.980
Oh, boy.

41:12.980 --> 41:14.680
Yeah, Firefox OS is far from dead.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.380
It's not dead yet at all.

41:16.380 --> 41:18.680
They have a tablet that's gonna be just a web browser,

41:18.680 --> 41:21.520
it's total focus on simplicity, called the Firefox Pad.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.880
It's like just a web browser tablet.

41:23.880 --> 41:26.400
Then they're gonna have like a Chromecast thing,

41:26.400 --> 41:29.720
and they're gonna have a Firefox OS router.

41:31.280 --> 41:35.800
And, and a keyboard, which I believe

41:35.800 --> 41:37.880
may have a Raspberry Pi in it.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.920
So it's like a keyboard with a built-in Raspberry Pi

41:39.920 --> 41:40.760
running Firefox OS.

41:40.760 --> 41:41.720
So you could just plug that keyboard

41:41.720 --> 41:43.680
into a screen or whatever and there you go?

41:43.680 --> 41:46.320
Yeah, this is coming from FirefoxCentral.com.

41:46.320 --> 41:49.000
They say this is an exclusive.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.640
So an Apple TV Chromecast competitor, a router,

41:52.640 --> 41:54.480
a keyboard with a built-in Raspberry Pi,

41:54.480 --> 41:58.280
a tablet that does nothing but run a web browser,

41:58.280 --> 42:01.600
no app store, no telephony, automatic updates.

42:03.080 --> 42:03.920
What do you think?

42:03.920 --> 42:08.200
Is this a scary wandering Mozilla,

42:08.200 --> 42:10.880
or is this maybe the thing to double down on?

42:10.880 --> 42:13.080
Well, I think it's already a scary wandering Mozilla,

42:13.080 --> 42:14.920
but I have mixed views.

42:14.920 --> 42:17.120
I feel like some of these are better than others.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.280
I don't know about the tablet.

42:18.280 --> 42:21.320
I think the tablet space is already kind of difficult

42:21.320 --> 42:24.920
and hard to compete in, and people have a lot of tablets.

42:24.920 --> 42:26.640
What if they get like around 99 bucks?

42:26.640 --> 42:27.480
It's just, here's your web browser tablet.

42:27.480 --> 42:30.480
That might be a great tool for kids who don't do a lot,

42:30.480 --> 42:32.440
but they just wanna check Facebook or whatever.

42:32.440 --> 42:33.520
It's just a flesh wound.

42:33.520 --> 42:36.000
The Chromecast competitor and the router,

42:36.000 --> 42:37.040
I'm definitely interested in.

42:37.040 --> 42:39.880
The router is kind of interesting, isn't it, actually?

42:39.880 --> 42:40.720
And you know what?

42:40.720 --> 42:43.360
The Chromecast thing is what I would totally be down for.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.920
Because I love the Chromecast model, but it's so hard

42:45.920 --> 42:47.720
to shoe hone your own media in there,

42:47.720 --> 42:49.880
and it's such a closed ecosystem.

42:49.880 --> 42:52.880
Firefox would present a much more open playground.

42:52.880 --> 42:53.760
I would buy one.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.080
If they shipped a Firefox stick.

42:55.080 --> 42:55.920
Yep, I would buy two.

42:55.920 --> 42:59.720
Yeah, they could charge me probably 60, 80 bucks, maybe.

42:59.720 --> 43:01.040
99 bucks, maybe.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.560
I'd say 50, but you're a big spender, Chris.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.280
No, I'm thinking, I wouldn't.

43:05.280 --> 43:06.480
But I would support Mozilla, I guess.

43:06.480 --> 43:07.320
Yeah, exactly.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.360
I bought a backpack from them and a shirt before

43:09.360 --> 43:10.520
because I wanted to support them.

43:10.520 --> 43:12.800
So I could kind of see maybe spending

43:12.800 --> 43:14.000
a little extra to support the project

43:14.000 --> 43:15.440
if they would let me.

43:15.440 --> 43:18.000
But yeah, 50 bucks would be great.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
25 bucks would be nailin' it.

43:20.000 --> 43:20.840
Yes, it would.

43:20.840 --> 43:23.200
Yeah, all right, NorthRanger.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.140
What are your thoughts on this?

43:25.140 --> 43:27.520
Well, you know, I really appreciate Mozilla

43:27.520 --> 43:30.600
for their efforts to keep the web open.

43:30.600 --> 43:33.240
But it's kind of a funny point in their history

43:33.240 --> 43:37.480
where they didn't succeed in getting embedded

43:37.480 --> 43:40.080
with other software projects that needed a browser.

43:40.080 --> 43:44.680
They kind of defaulted or seeded that market to WebKit.

43:44.680 --> 43:49.680
So are they trying to kind of do one up on WebKit

43:50.120 --> 43:51.800
and say, well, we're not just gonna give you

43:51.800 --> 43:54.680
the browser engine to build your products around.

43:54.680 --> 43:55.880
We're gonna give you whole OS

43:55.880 --> 43:57.920
to build your project around?

43:57.920 --> 44:00.200
I think it's more of a direct-to-consumer thing.

44:00.200 --> 44:03.240
I think it's more of, well, we tried working with LG

44:03.240 --> 44:05.320
and all these other folks.

44:05.320 --> 44:08.520
Now we're gonna just make a few devices and ship them.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.040
I think it feels, I don't know.

44:10.040 --> 44:15.040
So they say it also does include Panasonic TV.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.400
So that's not totally true actually.

44:17.400 --> 44:19.300
But yeah, I wonder if that's true.

44:19.300 --> 44:20.140
I don't think it is that.

44:20.140 --> 44:22.360
I don't think this is, I think this is a new approach.

44:22.360 --> 44:23.760
I think that brings up the larger question too

44:23.760 --> 44:27.220
of how they tie it into the rest of the Firefox experience

44:27.220 --> 44:29.660
or ecosystem or, you know,

44:29.660 --> 44:31.380
if they do have a success with this,

44:31.380 --> 44:32.920
how do they ensure that that helps

44:32.920 --> 44:34.400
the rest of their brand?

44:34.400 --> 44:36.520
I'll tell you, if they had a really good handoff

44:36.520 --> 44:39.400
between the Firefox web browser on the desktop

44:39.400 --> 44:42.880
or your mobile and the Firefox web browser tablet.

44:42.880 --> 44:45.480
So if this thing's 99 bucks, let's say.

44:45.480 --> 44:46.960
And let's say it's got like a 10-inch

44:46.960 --> 44:49.080
or larger widescreen display.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.520
And it's got maybe an all-day battery.

44:51.520 --> 44:52.980
And this thing is a touch of a button

44:52.980 --> 44:54.360
and your web browser's ready to go

44:54.360 --> 44:56.360
and everything you were just looking at on your desktop

44:56.360 --> 44:58.400
is now available on your tablet or vice versa.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.800
You could go from tablet to desktop.

44:59.800 --> 45:02.800
If they nailed that using Firefox or Mozilla Sync, whatever,

45:04.080 --> 45:05.920
and this thing's running Firefox OS,

45:06.740 --> 45:08.400
I think there's some people in this audience right now

45:08.400 --> 45:10.400
that go, well, you know what, I don't need the iPad.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.820
I don't need the Android tablets

45:11.820 --> 45:12.920
that constantly disappoint me

45:12.920 --> 45:15.080
because number one thing I do on that Android tablet,

45:15.080 --> 45:16.400
I run Chrome.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.240
And so I'm not speaking for me.

45:18.240 --> 45:19.880
I'm just saying this sounds like somebody,

45:19.880 --> 45:21.280
this sounds like a likely scenario.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.420
And if the number one thing you're using your browser for,

45:23.420 --> 45:26.420
your tablet for right now is Chrome or Safari,

45:26.420 --> 45:28.520
well, maybe this works really well for you,

45:28.520 --> 45:30.680
especially if you're already a Firefox user.

45:30.680 --> 45:32.800
They gotta do something because I keep seeing stories

45:32.800 --> 45:34.240
about how Firefox's browser share

45:34.240 --> 45:36.360
has been shrinking for years now.

45:36.360 --> 45:39.080
And I don't wanna live in a world without Mozilla.

45:39.080 --> 45:40.120
I don't think I'm ready for that.

45:40.120 --> 45:41.920
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.380
Anybody else, WWE, do you have any thoughts?

45:43.380 --> 45:45.380
Anybody else have thoughts before we wrap up?

45:45.380 --> 45:49.040
I'm thinking that maybe they learned something crucial

45:49.040 --> 45:51.840
from the Firefox OS phone

45:51.840 --> 45:54.500
and maybe they figured out, okay,

45:54.500 --> 45:59.500
maybe we should go desktop and get more users

45:59.500 --> 46:01.140
but make it so it could be mobile

46:01.140 --> 46:03.560
so people could take it with them somewhere else

46:03.560 --> 46:07.000
and use someone else's keyboard and mouse or whatever.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.880
Maybe they're trying something different

46:08.880 --> 46:11.560
that will work out for them in the long run, I hope.

46:11.560 --> 46:13.080
Well, this is what I find interesting.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.680
Maybe out of all of this is the Firefox Pie.

46:15.680 --> 46:17.640
And if you would have talked to me a couple of weeks ago,

46:17.640 --> 46:19.720
I would have found this to be maybe the least interesting.

46:19.720 --> 46:21.880
But now since we've talked to Wimpy and he says,

46:21.880 --> 46:25.960
the version of Ubuntu Mate for Raspberry Pi is super popular.

46:25.960 --> 46:28.720
We got this canoe in that it makes the Raspberry Pi

46:28.720 --> 46:30.800
like a ready to go computer kit

46:30.800 --> 46:32.540
that really just means you don't plug a few things together

46:32.540 --> 46:34.560
like building Legos and you have a full computer.

46:34.560 --> 46:37.800
I look at this Firefox Pie and the bullet points are,

46:37.800 --> 46:41.400
the target market is education and emerging markets.

46:41.400 --> 46:42.560
Education is brilliant.

46:42.560 --> 46:44.880
For creation, not just consumption of the web.

46:44.880 --> 46:46.660
Keyboard, computer form factor

46:46.660 --> 46:48.400
with built-in keyboard and trackpad.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.840
Can plug into spare TV or monitor.

46:50.840 --> 46:54.000
E.g. millions of obsolete analog TVs in India.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.840
Mozilla web maker built-in.

46:55.840 --> 46:58.580
Harnesses the maker movement, which is a funny bullet point.

46:58.580 --> 46:59.420
Yes, it is.

46:59.420 --> 47:00.800
And partnership with Raspberry Foundation

47:00.800 --> 47:03.280
and or the canoe?

47:03.280 --> 47:04.120
Question mark.

47:04.120 --> 47:05.440
Question mark.

47:05.440 --> 47:08.040
So let's shift over and talk about that first.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.280
Oh, I don't have my webcam working.

47:09.280 --> 47:10.100
That's too bad.

47:10.100 --> 47:11.840
I don't have, oh, hello, hello.

47:11.840 --> 47:14.680
So anyways, right here in studio, we have the canoe,

47:14.680 --> 47:16.580
which we talked about on the episode

47:16.580 --> 47:19.360
right before the holidays of Linux Unplugged.

47:19.360 --> 47:21.600
It is a very cool piece of kit

47:21.600 --> 47:24.360
that makes the Raspberry Pi a ready to go computer

47:24.360 --> 47:26.440
and listener FilesCopied said this

47:26.440 --> 47:28.240
because he thought this might pique my interest.

47:28.240 --> 47:30.600
FilesCopied, how did you hear about the canoe

47:30.600 --> 47:33.080
and what made you decide to send it in?

47:33.080 --> 47:34.760
Oh, the main way I found it,

47:34.760 --> 47:37.680
I had a friend that was trying to get someone interested

47:37.680 --> 47:39.480
in learning about computers

47:39.480 --> 47:41.400
and all the toys that she was looking at,

47:41.400 --> 47:42.920
I was like, they're just toys.

47:42.920 --> 47:44.800
I wanted to find like a real Linux kit.

47:44.800 --> 47:46.300
I knew something had to exist.

47:47.480 --> 47:49.600
And so you started your search and you came across this

47:49.600 --> 47:52.400
and it's an actual ready shipping to go product.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.680
And so you sent it into the studio,

47:53.680 --> 47:54.520
you sent us a heads up,

47:54.520 --> 47:57.480
but I got the box like the day we went on air

47:57.480 --> 47:59.000
and the email I didn't read till like the day

47:59.000 --> 47:59.840
after we went on air.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.240
I didn't know who sent it in, so it was great.

48:01.240 --> 48:02.960
We tracked him down, we got FilesCopied here.

48:02.960 --> 48:04.040
I played with it a little bit

48:04.040 --> 48:08.000
and my impressions were this is really slick.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.240
It's still more work though than the Firefox Pi,

48:10.240 --> 48:15.240
but what it made me realize is this is ready for my kids.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.880
The Raspberry Pi, once you get this,

48:16.880 --> 48:18.040
like they could assemble this,

48:18.040 --> 48:20.000
my six-year-old I think could put this together

48:20.000 --> 48:22.840
and he would have a Linux Raspberry Pi

48:22.840 --> 48:27.840
and the idea of the Firefox Pi is like maybe the solution

48:27.840 --> 48:30.800
for Chromebooks in education, possibly.

48:30.800 --> 48:33.520
You know, you get something that's ready to go,

48:33.520 --> 48:35.800
20, 30 bucks with a keyboard and everything,

48:35.800 --> 48:38.360
that could be pretty portable.

48:38.360 --> 48:39.520
Yeah, we'll see.

48:39.520 --> 48:42.140
I mean, there's still a lot of other factors

48:42.140 --> 48:44.280
like marketing and deals and all that kind of stuff

48:44.280 --> 48:45.120
to make something like that,

48:45.120 --> 48:50.120
but I don't know if I like the idea

48:51.040 --> 48:53.280
of the Mozilla Foundation being people behind it,

48:53.280 --> 48:55.680
but I still want to see where it goes.

48:55.680 --> 48:58.000
Right, and I wonder how much Mozilla can manage

48:58.000 --> 48:59.640
a transformation, because I just think

48:59.640 --> 49:01.480
about the days before Chrome existed

49:01.480 --> 49:02.840
and I remember being a little surprised

49:02.840 --> 49:03.880
how Google's making web browsers.

49:03.880 --> 49:05.140
I mean, it made sense given their agenda,

49:05.140 --> 49:07.560
but they've managed to kind of transform themselves

49:07.560 --> 49:10.400
from what they were into owning Android and Chrome

49:10.400 --> 49:13.560
and so much and I wonder if there's any chance Mozilla can,

49:13.560 --> 49:16.680
maybe there's a future where Mozilla makes a great router

49:16.680 --> 49:19.440
and I trust them with my internet infrastructure.

49:19.440 --> 49:20.440
That would be really great.

49:20.440 --> 49:23.480
And you want a cheap computer that doesn't have

49:23.480 --> 49:25.760
like an advertising monster behind it.

49:25.760 --> 49:28.000
And it's a first class web client.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
And it comes with web creation software.

49:30.000 --> 49:30.840
Right.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.600
Mumble, have any closing thoughts?

49:33.720 --> 49:34.560
Go on, once. I do.

49:34.560 --> 49:35.960
Yeah, go ahead.

49:35.960 --> 49:39.560
I think they're spreading themselves too thin.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.180
That's my concern, too.

49:41.180 --> 49:42.880
You think that's a valid concern?

49:44.280 --> 49:49.280
Yeah, it's just like the most recent upgrade

49:49.280 --> 49:53.760
to the Mozilla browser, for whatever reason,

49:53.760 --> 49:56.720
just decided to not work with Google.

49:58.920 --> 50:01.640
Is that their fault though or is that Google's fault?

50:01.640 --> 50:02.560
I don't know.

50:02.560 --> 50:03.400
Yeah.

50:03.400 --> 50:05.360
I know that like I'll be on Google Plus

50:05.360 --> 50:08.640
or YouTube or whatever and either the page won't load

50:08.640 --> 50:11.140
or the page will just stop loading.

50:11.140 --> 50:14.580
And then I'll close the browser, open it back up.

50:14.580 --> 50:16.300
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

50:16.300 --> 50:18.280
Don't know what's going on there.

50:18.280 --> 50:23.280
Yeah, I hope, so here's my, I'm very conflicted.

50:24.080 --> 50:25.220
And I hope people aren't getting tired of this

50:25.220 --> 50:27.360
because I'm actually, my stance on this is starting to change

50:27.360 --> 50:29.140
as we do these episodes.

50:29.140 --> 50:30.740
I initially would have taken the hard line.

50:30.740 --> 50:32.000
They need to focus on the browser

50:32.000 --> 50:33.400
and focus on Thunderbird even.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.240
Right.

50:34.240 --> 50:37.200
But now, when you look at the undeniable trend,

50:37.200 --> 50:39.440
I think it's, Wes, I don't know if you remember the number.

50:39.440 --> 50:40.760
I think definitely 2011,

50:40.760 --> 50:43.300
but I think maybe even possibly since 2009,

50:43.300 --> 50:46.320
Firefox browser market share has been on a decline.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.320
Yeah.

50:47.320 --> 50:50.680
And that's the reality of the market.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.360
And the thing is, is what's pushing that too

50:52.360 --> 50:53.400
is also mobile to a degree

50:53.400 --> 50:55.400
which they have very little foothold in.

50:55.400 --> 50:58.020
And so they are just literally now dealing

50:58.020 --> 50:59.380
with a new market reality.

50:59.380 --> 51:02.320
And they have to make some adjustments at some point

51:02.320 --> 51:04.000
to stay a viable company.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.400
Not that they're about to die and go away,

51:06.400 --> 51:08.120
but you need to get ahead of the puck.

51:08.120 --> 51:09.480
You gotta have the momentum to keep going.

51:09.480 --> 51:11.120
Exactly, and you gotta start early

51:11.120 --> 51:13.240
in some of these new emerging marketplaces

51:13.240 --> 51:16.360
and in a lot of things, done right,

51:16.360 --> 51:17.240
there is demand for that

51:17.240 --> 51:18.280
because right now these things

51:18.280 --> 51:20.520
like these Internet of Things devices are just a mess

51:20.520 --> 51:21.880
and they're a hot mess at that.

51:21.880 --> 51:23.520
So if you could have a trusted name

51:23.520 --> 51:27.240
that has a trusted brand come in and offer some devices,

51:27.240 --> 51:28.080
they could have a foothold.

51:28.080 --> 51:30.500
And I wonder if they can play up the foundation aspect.

51:30.500 --> 51:31.840
I'm sure there are competitors to Google

51:31.840 --> 51:34.520
that are worried about having too much investment

51:34.520 --> 51:35.840
in this other company.

51:35.840 --> 51:37.680
Mozilla might be a more neutral party

51:37.680 --> 51:39.280
where you can be like, well, we use their stuff

51:39.280 --> 51:41.920
because they don't have an agenda against this.

51:41.920 --> 51:44.120
Or even if they just shipped a couple of these things

51:44.120 --> 51:45.240
and they were good.

51:45.240 --> 51:47.560
Let's just say they shipped the Stick and the Raspberry Pi

51:47.560 --> 51:50.000
because that Firefox Pi just,

51:50.960 --> 51:51.800
Raspberry Pi is just complicated.

51:51.800 --> 51:52.640
It's like you could make that today.

51:52.640 --> 51:55.500
Yeah, and the Raspberry Pi is being built for you.

51:57.180 --> 51:58.280
If they could ship those

51:58.280 --> 52:00.520
and they were really well received,

52:00.520 --> 52:03.000
then maybe your Panasonic's and your LG's

52:03.000 --> 52:06.200
would be willing to sort of have a more serious conversation

52:06.200 --> 52:07.280
about shipping a good product.

52:07.280 --> 52:08.120
A proven record.

52:08.120 --> 52:09.760
Yeah, but we'll see.

52:10.600 --> 52:11.880
We'll see where it goes with that.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.760
All right, so I got a little more to cover.

52:14.760 --> 52:16.280
We've got some big stuff coming up in just,

52:16.280 --> 52:17.920
well, January, which is just around the corner.

52:17.920 --> 52:18.760
Like literally around the corner.

52:18.760 --> 52:19.600
Sure is.

52:19.600 --> 52:20.420
Holy smokes, Wes.

52:20.420 --> 52:21.260
Holy smokes.

52:21.260 --> 52:22.100
What are you doing in January?

52:22.100 --> 52:24.360
Got anything big coming up in January, Wes?

52:24.360 --> 52:25.200
No, I don't.

52:25.200 --> 52:27.360
But I think that means that I have some exciting projects

52:27.360 --> 52:28.200
I need to finish.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.360
Well, well, we got some exciting stuff

52:29.360 --> 52:30.260
coming up in January.

52:30.260 --> 52:34.240
So you will be probably involved in some way or another

52:34.240 --> 52:35.140
with some of these shenanigans.

52:35.140 --> 52:35.980
I hope so.

52:35.980 --> 52:36.840
Yeah, yeah.

52:36.840 --> 52:37.920
And I'll tell you about that.

52:37.920 --> 52:40.240
But first, I'm gonna tell you about our friends over at Ting.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.280
You know, I was talking to Kyra over the holidays,

52:42.280 --> 52:43.500
as I do.

52:43.500 --> 52:44.400
Well, you guys are besties.

52:44.400 --> 52:45.240
Yeah.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.760
Well, she's an Overcast fan.

52:46.760 --> 52:48.040
And I was, so I called her and I said,

52:48.040 --> 52:49.800
Kyra, I noticed you had some podcasts

52:49.800 --> 52:50.760
and your Overcast subscription,

52:50.760 --> 52:51.920
but I didn't see Linux Action Show,

52:51.920 --> 52:53.240
didn't see Linux Unplugged, so I had to talk to her

52:53.240 --> 52:54.080
about that.

52:54.080 --> 52:54.920
You know, I squared her away.

52:54.920 --> 52:56.920
Just a little, you know, slap on the wrist.

52:56.920 --> 52:58.320
Don't worry, don't worry, it's not a big deal.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.120
But you know what, Kyra works over at Ting,

53:00.120 --> 53:00.960
and I love Ting.

53:00.960 --> 53:01.920
Let me tell you about Ting.

53:01.920 --> 53:03.680
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

53:03.680 --> 53:06.040
It's a flat rate, it's really simple.

53:06.040 --> 53:08.640
Six dollars for the phone every month.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.720
That's all you pay.

53:09.720 --> 53:11.320
And then it's just your usage on top of that.

53:11.320 --> 53:14.480
So if you don't use a line, then you don't pay anything.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.760
And if you use a little more data one month,

53:15.760 --> 53:17.080
or a couple of months,

53:17.080 --> 53:19.600
then the other 10 or 11 months of the year,

53:19.600 --> 53:21.780
you'll use less and you pay way less.

53:21.780 --> 53:24.000
So it sort of adapts to your actual usage.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.040
So for me, that usually means in April I have a spike,

53:27.040 --> 53:28.980
and around the holidays I sometimes have a spike.

53:28.980 --> 53:31.180
But for the majority of the year,

53:31.180 --> 53:34.160
my cell bill for three lines is around 40 bucks.

53:34.160 --> 53:35.280
That's amazing.

53:35.280 --> 53:36.120
Hard to beat.

53:36.120 --> 53:36.960
That is really hard to beat.

53:36.960 --> 53:38.600
And the thing I love about Ting is they have

53:38.600 --> 53:40.360
two networks to choose from.

53:40.360 --> 53:41.920
So you can just be a little savvy.

53:41.920 --> 53:44.120
They got the GSM and CDMA networks.

53:44.960 --> 53:46.320
So if you have a phone that's compatible

53:46.320 --> 53:47.720
with one of those networks,

53:47.720 --> 53:49.080
you can get a $25 service credit

53:49.080 --> 53:51.380
by going to linux.ting.com.

53:51.380 --> 53:52.480
You also support the show.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.080
And if you don't have a Ting device yet,

53:54.080 --> 53:57.080
you can get $25 off a device by going to linux.ting.com.

53:57.080 --> 53:59.780
Unlocked devices, great devices.

53:59.780 --> 54:03.160
I love that they now have the brand new Nexus 6P

54:03.160 --> 54:05.280
and the Nexus 6, the first Nexus 6,

54:05.280 --> 54:06.300
because check this out.

54:06.300 --> 54:07.720
Now it's $350.

54:07.720 --> 54:10.520
Boy, that is like half off.

54:10.520 --> 54:13.300
Yeah, on Ting, unlocked, direct updates from Google,

54:13.300 --> 54:16.040
Android M, pay for what you use, right?

54:16.040 --> 54:18.840
And then they also, if you want a great value Android phone,

54:18.840 --> 54:23.840
the LG Volt 2, lollipop 5.1, tri-band LTE,

54:24.080 --> 54:28.560
five inch display, $183, no contract,

54:28.560 --> 54:30.220
unlocked, pay for what you use.

54:31.080 --> 54:31.920
That's crazy.

54:31.920 --> 54:32.740
Ting!

54:32.740 --> 54:35.240
Linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com, go check them out.

54:35.240 --> 54:37.140
Also, they have an early termination relief program.

54:37.140 --> 54:39.480
If you got stuck in one of those duopoly contracts,

54:39.480 --> 54:41.280
you can find out more about that on their website.

54:41.280 --> 54:43.400
Just get started by going to linux.ting.com.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.520
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring

54:45.520 --> 54:46.620
the Unplugged program.

54:46.620 --> 54:49.500
Thank you Ting, thank you Ting, thank you very much.

54:49.500 --> 54:53.040
Okay, Wes, so it was like last week or two

54:53.040 --> 54:55.360
I got talked into trying to go to scale this year.

54:55.360 --> 54:56.200
You just couldn't resist.

54:56.200 --> 54:59.880
Frickin' scale 14, January 21st through the 24th

54:59.880 --> 55:01.440
in Pasadena Convention Center.

55:02.560 --> 55:06.960
And Mr. P4, P3R, in the Linux Action Show subreddit

55:06.960 --> 55:10.120
started a semi-official scale 14 thread.

55:10.120 --> 55:12.680
And if you're going, I invite you to check out this thread

55:12.680 --> 55:13.600
and give us the details.

55:13.600 --> 55:14.440
So is it official now?

55:14.440 --> 55:15.360
Does that make it official?

55:15.360 --> 55:16.840
Well, we're workin' on it.

55:16.840 --> 55:19.080
So, you know, budget-wise it's extremely tight

55:19.080 --> 55:21.720
because in April Linux Fest Northwest is a big deal for us

55:21.720 --> 55:23.640
and that's where we spend pretty much all the money

55:23.640 --> 55:24.480
we make in a year.

55:24.480 --> 55:25.720
That's a first class production.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.900
Yeah, so this being in January is super tight,

55:28.900 --> 55:33.180
but we're, and oh, oh, oh, oh, and to make matters worse,

55:33.180 --> 55:35.080
right during Noah's wife's birthday.

55:35.080 --> 55:35.920
Ooh.

55:35.920 --> 55:37.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:37.140 --> 55:38.860
But we really, it seems like it's becoming

55:38.860 --> 55:39.840
a pretty big event.

55:39.840 --> 55:41.940
And so we're gonna try to make it down there,

55:41.940 --> 55:42.780
one way or another.

55:42.780 --> 55:43.640
I don't know yet.

55:43.640 --> 55:44.760
Still trying to work out the details

55:44.760 --> 55:46.320
on how I'm gonna do that.

55:46.320 --> 55:48.520
But I'm trying to get a sense of how big the audience

55:48.520 --> 55:50.440
is gonna be, presence-wise, down there.

55:50.440 --> 55:52.020
And so that thread's there.

55:52.020 --> 55:54.860
And we might move that into a meetup thread at some time

55:54.860 --> 55:55.760
if we get a lot of interest.

55:55.760 --> 55:58.720
So I'll have it linked in the show notes.

55:58.720 --> 56:00.900
I should probably put it in the chatroom, too.

56:00.900 --> 56:02.160
Wes, do you mind dropping that in the chatroom

56:02.160 --> 56:03.000
when you get a chance?

56:03.000 --> 56:03.820
I would be happy to.

56:03.820 --> 56:04.660
Thank you, sir.

56:04.660 --> 56:06.580
Is anybody in the Mamba Room going to scale?

56:08.800 --> 56:10.220
Nobody?

56:10.220 --> 56:12.520
I know Poby's gonna go, but he's not here today.

56:14.160 --> 56:15.560
I'm wondering, I'm curious to see,

56:15.560 --> 56:19.080
because we don't, for a bit we were considering not going,

56:19.080 --> 56:20.040
just because of the cost,

56:20.040 --> 56:21.400
because we go to so many other shows.

56:21.400 --> 56:23.000
But I think it's a big enough event,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.180
and with UbiKon happening a little bit beforehand.

56:25.180 --> 56:28.560
So we have the official scale thread started.

56:28.560 --> 56:29.660
It's over there.

56:29.660 --> 56:30.500
You can go check that out.

56:30.500 --> 56:31.680
Go show your support.

56:31.680 --> 56:32.520
See if you'll be there.

56:32.520 --> 56:33.360
Sure.

56:33.360 --> 56:34.640
Make it a good event.

56:34.640 --> 56:35.480
Sure.

56:35.480 --> 56:37.400
So a couple other things that I want to talk about,

56:37.400 --> 56:40.440
just sort of, now it's just towards the end of the show.

56:40.440 --> 56:41.920
I got the fire going.

56:41.920 --> 56:42.760
It's just you.

56:42.760 --> 56:44.220
So warm and cozy.

56:44.220 --> 56:45.540
You, the Mamba Room,

56:45.540 --> 56:47.800
couple hundred of our closest friends listening now.

56:47.800 --> 56:49.080
I'm sure most people downloading

56:49.080 --> 56:50.520
probably are gonna tune out here in a couple of minutes.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.380
So I'm just gonna have a little chit chat with you guys.

56:52.380 --> 56:54.280
A little fireside chat.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.540
So we're gonna make some changes

56:55.540 --> 56:57.720
on the Linux Action Show coming up pretty soon.

56:57.720 --> 56:58.540
Whoa.

56:58.540 --> 56:59.380
Yeah.

56:59.380 --> 57:00.220
And we're gonna tell you about it

57:00.220 --> 57:02.080
on Sunday's Linux Action Show.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.440
We're doing the Linux Action Show on Sunday this week,

57:04.440 --> 57:06.000
because of New Year's.

57:06.960 --> 57:08.780
So that will be on January 3rd.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.680
And I invite you to tune in.

57:11.680 --> 57:12.640
I'm excited already.

57:12.640 --> 57:13.960
We can talk about that kind of stuff.

57:13.960 --> 57:16.100
Get your feedback live in the chat room.

57:16.100 --> 57:19.880
And we're gonna make that pretty integral

57:19.880 --> 57:21.040
with the show experience.

57:21.040 --> 57:22.520
So I'd love to have you there live, if you can,

57:22.520 --> 57:23.360
on January 3rd.

57:23.360 --> 57:24.680
We're gonna do it at 10 a.m. Pacific time.

57:24.680 --> 57:26.720
You can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

57:26.720 --> 57:28.760
slash calendar.

57:30.120 --> 57:31.580
But I'll just give you a hint.

57:31.580 --> 57:32.420
Just give you a hint.

57:32.420 --> 57:33.680
You're gonna be seeing a lot more of us.

57:33.680 --> 57:34.520
That's all I'm gonna say.

57:34.520 --> 57:35.360
I'm just gonna say that.

57:35.360 --> 57:36.180
Oh.

57:36.180 --> 57:37.020
I don't want you to take that for what it is.

57:37.020 --> 57:37.860
Mystery.

57:37.860 --> 57:38.680
Yeah, yeah.

57:38.680 --> 57:39.520
So there you go.

57:39.520 --> 57:40.360
Wes, I hope you have a good New Year's.

57:40.360 --> 57:41.200
Oh, I sure will.

57:41.200 --> 57:42.020
Yeah?

57:42.020 --> 57:42.860
You got any big plans?

57:42.860 --> 57:45.160
I'm thinking about seeing some friends in Portland.

57:45.160 --> 57:46.000
Really?

57:46.000 --> 57:46.820
Yeah.

57:46.820 --> 57:47.660
That's a good, that'll be a good drive.

57:47.660 --> 57:48.500
A little New Year's road trip.

57:48.500 --> 57:49.320
Yeah.

57:49.320 --> 57:50.160
Yeah.

57:50.160 --> 57:51.000
It's gonna be like a fun time.

57:51.000 --> 57:51.820
So I'm thinking, going back to scale real quick,

57:51.820 --> 57:53.360
I'm thinking while I'm at scale,

57:53.360 --> 57:54.540
depending on, so here's the thing.

57:54.540 --> 57:57.220
It goes from the 21st to the 24th, right?

57:57.220 --> 57:58.060
In January.

57:58.060 --> 57:58.880
Okay.

57:58.880 --> 58:03.800
And UbiCon's like on the 20th or something like that.

58:03.800 --> 58:05.360
I would love to take the rover down.

58:05.360 --> 58:06.800
I just don't know how it works out timing-wise

58:06.800 --> 58:08.960
because I got so much going on in the month of January.

58:08.960 --> 58:11.000
I got family stuff, I got my daughter's birthday,

58:11.000 --> 58:13.400
I got my birthday, I also got some business stuff

58:13.400 --> 58:14.240
going on.

58:14.240 --> 58:15.060
Oh, it's your birthday.

58:15.060 --> 58:15.900
That's good to know.

58:15.900 --> 58:17.120
And it scales right in the middle of all of it.

58:17.120 --> 58:18.400
So it's just really crazy.

58:18.400 --> 58:19.520
But if I go down there,

58:19.520 --> 58:21.800
I would probably be doing Linux Unplugged from the road.

58:21.800 --> 58:23.360
So it'd be one of those where you could be in studio.

58:23.360 --> 58:24.200
Hey, hey, hey.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.040
I like, those are fun.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.120
Those are fun.

58:26.120 --> 58:27.400
Yeah.

58:27.400 --> 58:29.960
And then Kernel Linux will be making out there midweek

58:29.960 --> 58:33.640
and we'll probably record a Linux action show from there too.

58:33.640 --> 58:35.240
Maybe, maybe not, depending on the timing.

58:35.240 --> 58:37.800
Now looking at the calendar, we actually might not.

58:37.800 --> 58:40.480
So yeah, we're not gonna do a booth.

58:40.480 --> 58:42.300
Okay, so you'll be free floating.

58:42.300 --> 58:44.600
Yeah, oh man, that's my favorite.

58:44.600 --> 58:47.400
I don't know, we might not ever do a booth again

58:47.400 --> 58:49.080
except for at Linux Fest Northwest.

58:49.080 --> 58:49.960
Yeah.

58:49.960 --> 58:50.800
It is-

58:50.800 --> 58:51.640
Well, you're a staple there.

58:51.640 --> 58:52.640
I mean, you have to.

58:52.640 --> 58:55.320
Well, and it's fun to do the two-day broadcast.

58:55.320 --> 58:57.520
I suppose that would be sort of the line

58:57.520 --> 58:59.560
is if we're gonna do a multi-day broadcast,

58:59.560 --> 59:00.680
then you kind of have to have a booth.

59:00.680 --> 59:02.380
But if you're going there to get clips and do interviews,

59:02.380 --> 59:04.120
it's all much better to be walking around.

59:04.120 --> 59:05.320
Right, you get the real experience

59:05.320 --> 59:06.920
of what someone else at the conference would be.

59:06.920 --> 59:08.160
Yeah, yeah.

59:08.160 --> 59:10.200
All right, so anyways, join that.

59:10.200 --> 59:11.440
We'll have that thread over there.

59:11.440 --> 59:13.440
And I hope you guys, if you're gonna make it,

59:13.440 --> 59:15.000
can leave a comment in there.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.600
And I also hope you have a great holiday.

59:17.600 --> 59:19.760
Happy New Year's to everybody in the bubble room.

59:19.760 --> 59:22.320
As we wrap up here, does anybody have

59:22.320 --> 59:25.460
one big prediction for Linux in 2016?

59:26.360 --> 59:28.120
Anybody have one they wanna, if you do,

59:28.120 --> 59:31.020
ping me in the IRC with the mum prefix.

59:31.020 --> 59:33.660
Do you have any big predictions for 2016, Wes?

59:34.480 --> 59:36.680
You have anything you've been kicking around?

59:36.680 --> 59:37.840
Big predictions.

59:37.840 --> 59:40.160
Yeah, I know, it's hard when you actually go to get it,

59:40.160 --> 59:42.720
when you actually go to just do it on the spot.

59:42.720 --> 59:43.560
It's one of those, like,

59:43.560 --> 59:45.440
and they come to me while I'm driving around,

59:45.440 --> 59:47.240
and I'm like, oh, that's totally gonna happen.

59:47.240 --> 59:48.680
And I write it down.

59:48.680 --> 59:52.460
I think Ubuntu 16.04 is gonna be a powerful release.

59:52.460 --> 59:54.680
I think that's gonna be one of the releases

59:54.680 --> 59:56.760
that shapes the Linux ecosystem for the next,

59:56.760 --> 59:58.000
you know, three or four years.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.460
It looks like Wimpy and the gang did theirs

59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.120
in Ubuntu podcast season eight, episode 42.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.860
We did.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:04.700
So I'll have to have a listen.

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.880
I will, I will, I'll have to have a listen.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.240
And then Ham Radio, you have a big prediction for 2016.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.640
He says that you're the Linux desktop.

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.580
I thought he was in the moment room.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:21.220
But yeah, oh, well, look at Ikey dropping some,

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.560
look at that, wow, look at that.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.680
He's trying to get, he has a,

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.640
Ikey, you have a challenge with Mark Shuttleworth?

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.480
Now we've completely gone off rails.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.440
Let's hear it, let's hear it.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.500
This'll be a good ending note.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.320
You saw it on G+, right?

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.160
No, I don't think I did see it.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.200
You can drop us a link, though.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, did you do a throw down publicly with,

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.140
because I'm sure he'll respond, because, you know.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.480
Well, I mean, it was more in humor,

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.360
but the way it started out is somebody was saying

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.920
about 32-bit UEFI and all that crap.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.760
And I was like, okay, I'll try and get it working.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.480
So I went down to the shop and got a tablet

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.880
and it had Windows 10 on it.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.560
No, it didn't, it had Windows 8.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.000
Jesus, it's bad.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.640
Like, I don't know how you're supposed to do it.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.160
Like, you'd need a seal to coordinate your actions

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.760
for you to use the screen.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.840
So I had to think about it and I thought within five minutes,

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.720
well, GNOME can already do half the things

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.240
you need to do on a tablet.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.160
So after I'd bitched about it publicly,

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.960
I put a comment there underneath,

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.920
and I said, well, during 2016,

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.920
we'll get to the end of 2016

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.880
and see who's got a better tablet-based operating system,

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.540
Solus or Ubuntu, and I didn't get a reply.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.000
So, I mean, it was friendly,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.840
but yeah, the challenge is still there.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:31.240
All right, so maybe we'll see a tablet out of there.

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.480
If you guys have any other predictions,

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.240
if you think about it, we could cover them in the post-show,

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.800
but otherwise, that's one of the things

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.560
we will be doing on Sunday's Linux Action Show.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.800
Wow, look at me bring it all back.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.200
On Sunday's Linux Action Show,

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.600
we're gonna do our 2016 predictions,

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.600
an annual tradition, an annual tradition,

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.040
which means at some point,

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.760
we have to own up to past predictions,

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.600
which I guess would probably be with Matt,

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.820
I can't remember, which I haven't contacted him about,

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.800
so I'm not sure.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.320
So we might just have to start fresh,

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.400
because I can't really hold Matt accountable

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.720
if he's not there to attest.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:02.680
But I wonder how I did.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.520
I'll have to go back,

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.800
because that's always the hard thing,

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.800
is go back and see how I did.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.000
And you know what always really stings,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.280
is when I go back and look at the predictions

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.880
that didn't come true, but totally should have, right?

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.280
Those are the ones that. Then you just get sad.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.680
Yeah, like why did that happen?

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.840
Why did that happen?

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.880
All right, well that brings us to the end

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.840
of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840
Thank you very much for tuning in.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.640
Hope you will have a fantastic New Year's.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.040
Hope you had a great holiday.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.840
Make sure to join us for all the Linux excitement in 2016.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.760
No kidding.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.960
Kick it off.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.520
Keep it at broadcast.com slash calendar

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.800
to get it converted to your local time zone

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.080
over at jblive.tv.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.460
Don't forget we've got that mumble room,

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.960
which you are welcome to hang out in our virtual mug.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.280
Linux Action Show on our reddit.com

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.080
is where you go to submit topics or feedback

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.520
for episode 125.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.200
You can also go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.680
and choose Unplugged from the dropdown.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.360
And yes, I know I sound like I'm sick.

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.200
So don't have to write that in.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.160
I'm probably gonna get like a dozen of those.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:50.980
I don't want that.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.820
I know that.

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:52.660
All right.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:54.040
Thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.160
of Linux Unplugged.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.720
Hope you had a great 2015.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.560
See you in 2016.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:14.560
Okay.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:50.360
All right.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.360
There we go.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.720
That is the last show of mine in 2015.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:54.720
My last show.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.720
Boom!

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.720
Done right there.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.960
I want to give Wimpy some credit for his excellent suggestion of a hot toddy right about now.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.200
I know, right?

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.200
What is it?

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.200
So it's Bailey's?

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.200
What else?

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.200
No, no.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.500
They vary, they vary sort of region to region and family to family.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:15.440
But the way we make ours is, we use Ribena, I don't know if you have that in the US, but

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.080
it's a blackcurrant squash.

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:22.120
So you put some blackcurrant squash in a mug, you add to that some freshly squeezed lemon,

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:30.320
a large spoon of honey, a generous measure of brandy, and then boiling water.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.640
And then you stir all that up together and you drink it as hot as it can be.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.040
Wow, I've never heard of that recipe.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.440
It's a cold remedy.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:43.640
You know, when you're feeling a bit bunged up, you know, it's got all the things in it,

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:48.300
you know, the honey to soothe your throat, the lemon for the vitamin C, the brandy to

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.360
sort of, you know, help with the chest.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.360
For the spirit.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.160
So, have one of those before you go to bed to help you get to sleep at night.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.920
Sounds like a great excuse.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:57.920
It does.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:01.600
Or in my case, two or three, because...

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.880
And if you drink enough, you'll forget you're even sick at all.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.120
Right, yeah.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.060
Except for I actually have so much like sinus pressure right now that it's making me a little

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:11.240
dizzy as it is.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.160
So like I had one beer that I sipped this whole episode because like I already feel

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.400
a little intoxicated.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.840
Like I had a day quill earlier today, but I think it's worn off by now.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.440
So I think that's why all of a sudden the sinus pressure's like boom hitting me so hard

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.120
because it's like wearing off during the show, which is like so stupid.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.080
But I only had one thing at day quill, so there you go.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:28.600
Day quill also makes me sleepy.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.360
All right, so let me go dig out this link.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.360
So where did you...

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.360
Oh, I slacked it to you.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.360
Oh, you slacked it.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360
You slacked it.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.360
I couldn't paste it elsewhere.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.360
You want it right in the iris?

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.360
Yeah, if you would.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.360
I want to go...

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.200
So let's get to the bottom of this.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.880
Let's see if this tells me where...

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:43.880
Oh, shipping status.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.720
Okay, so we'll go over to the Purism blog.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.720
We'll check the shipping status.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.920
Let's see, updated December 21st.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.760
I believe I have the Rev 2 coming to me of the Librem 15.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.840
Says it's shipping now.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.720
Says it's shipping now.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.440
I thought it was going to say never, project canceled.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.440
We should set up a fake website.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.760
Rev 1 shipped June 2015, sold out.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.960
So I must not have gotten that one.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.200
It must be Librem 15 Rev.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.460
Then there's...

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:13.460
So what's going on here?

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.640
What's the difference between there is a Rev 2...

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.600
There's two Rev 2s, and one ships in January, and one is shipping now.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.360
Do you have the hinge clutch cover?

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.360
I don't know anything about that.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.360
All I know is I was one of the very first people to back it, and a lot of things have

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.400
changed since then.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.800
I didn't even know they had multiple Revs, let alone different hinges.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:34.220
Or whatever the HKS location is.

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:37.480
There's a 4K version, which is shipping February.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.960
As much as 4K is awesome, I sincerely hope that's not the one I get, because I specifically

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:47.360
bought this laptop, because I need 1080p out, I need to build a mere 1080 from the machine

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.520
here to the capture machine.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.800
And honestly, high DPI just needs another year for Linux, maybe, I don't know.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.800
So yeah, I hope I...

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.800
I might.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.800
We'll see.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.800
Wimpy, what do you know?

01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.800
You're the one that pointed us to this.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.360
I know what you know now, because you've read the same blog that I have.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.840
Not so helpful.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:11.100
And I also saw a tweet earlier saying that if you'd chosen an international keyboard,

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:16.480
so anything other than a US or UK keyboard layout, your devices would be delayed further

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.480
still.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:24.920
And if you didn't want to have those delays, then to come and change your keyboard selection.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.920
I see.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.440
Okay, I see a lot of the difference in the Rev2 is all about the hardware kill switch

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.440
location.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.440
I do like kill switches.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.440
Yeah.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.440
So either you'll get it soon...

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.440
They don't work.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.440
They don't work?

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.960
Do they not work?

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:43.800
You want to see the blog from December the 10th, where they explain they don't work.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.800
Oh boy.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.800
Damn it.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.800
Damn it.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:52.560
In the meantime, I should have just bought an Oryx Pro.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:55.280
How many games do people buy in the Steam sales?

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.280
I bought a couple.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.280
But I only...

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280
No.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.280
Yeah, I only bought...

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.280
I literally bought two.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.280
How many did you get?

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.280
About 30.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.280
Really?

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.240
Yeah, I think I only got two or three.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.880
I had a lot of games already.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.960
Yeah, I had about 30 games and I've got about 70 now.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.720
Now have you tried any of them?

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:14.720
Yes.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:15.720
Yes.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.560
I'm big into Trine at the moment.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.560
Oh my God.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.560
Yeah, Trine is great.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.560
Trine is...

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.560
I've never played Trine before, so I'm on the first Trine at the moment.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.720
Oh, I'm so excited for you.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.760
Yeah, Trine's gorgeous.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.200
Also playing Coffee and Dodgers as well.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.200
I'm enjoying that a lot.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.200
Yeah.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.200
Did you get all the Trines?

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.200
I know Trine and...

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.200
I did.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.040
I had a deal to get all of them for like $6 or something.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040
Wow.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040
No way.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040
Wow.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040
That's a great deal.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040
Yeah, that's super cheap.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040
I need three.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.040
I only have one and two.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.040
Yeah, three is a little different.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.040
It's got more of a 3D camera.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.040
Oh.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.040
I didn't buy it.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040
I was totally in awe of that.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.040
When I started...

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.040
Because I'm not a huge gamer.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.960
The last time I was seriously into games was sort of like PlayStation 2 era.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:58.520
So when it started up, it's just like, oh, this is so pretty.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.520
I just want to play it because it's pretty.

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.520
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.520
It's gorgeous.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:08.000
It's so packed with things and the subtlety of motion was just like, oh, this is too nice.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Yeah.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.560
And the mechanic of switching between different player characters is a fun one.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.360
That's a fun mechanic.

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.800
I see here that distance is on sale if anyone wants to...

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.800
Oh, yeah.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.800
I've got that too.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.800
Yeah.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.800
I've got that too.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.800
Yes.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.800
Yes, very nice.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.800
He had a jump on the top of his head, Chris.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.800
Yeah, I figured.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:27.800
I just...

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.800
I just sucked.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.560
I need to get the controller out is what I need to do.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:36.880
I ended up getting GTA 5 and The Long Dark from Hinterland, which I'm more excited about

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.200
playing because it's pretty good.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.200
Wimpy, how's the performance been for you?

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.200
For what?

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.200
Trying.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200
Yeah, are you playing on the NUC?

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200
I am.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.200
I'm playing it on that new NUC.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.040
So far, I've played everything on the new NUC and not had any issues.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.840
And I'm playing it at Quad HD as well because I've got a new Quad HD.

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:55.840
No kidding.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.840
Really?

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.840
Yeah.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840
Well, that is really cool.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.840
I was going to say, I wonder how it would do at higher resolution, but it sounds like

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:01.840
it's pretty good.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.840
Okay.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:03.840
Yeah.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.840
Well, good enough for me.

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.480
I mean, I've not actually looked to see how many frames per second it's producing because

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:12.800
I didn't want to sort of find that it wasn't very high and I was then annoyed by that.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.040
So I haven't looked, but I haven't noticed anything that makes me think this isn't fast

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.160
enough or responsive enough.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:23.040
But I've been using an Xbox 360 controller and I was like, hmm.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.440
And so I've ordered a Steam controller as well now.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.440
Look at you.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.440
You're going all in.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440
That's funny.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.440
That's awesome.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.440
Yeah.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.800
My daughter's getting a bit older, so I've decided I need to up my gaming skills.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.800
It is a fun thing to do with the kids.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.800
They really need...

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.800
Yeah.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:11:00.920
I've got a couple of kids' games for her as well to have a play on.
