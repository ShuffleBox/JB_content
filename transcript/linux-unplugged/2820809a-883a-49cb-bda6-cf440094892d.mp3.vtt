00:00.000 --> 00:16.320
NASA has announced they are mapping out plans for bigger, stronger, more capable Linux copters

00:16.320 --> 00:18.800
for future trips into space.

00:18.800 --> 00:25.000
One concept is the Mars Science Helicopter, advocated as a way to greatly expand the exploration

00:25.000 --> 00:31.520
zone on the Red Planet, including possibly deep dives into some caves.

00:31.520 --> 00:37.040
This is so great, and I think it clearly means Linux on Mars was a success, and I think that

00:37.040 --> 00:42.320
also means that obviously Linux is going to take over the solar system.

00:42.320 --> 00:51.460
Hello friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:51.460 --> 00:52.460
My name is Chris.

00:52.460 --> 00:53.460
My name is Wes.

00:53.460 --> 00:57.200
Hello Wes, are you applying for those Mars sysadmin jobs right now?

00:57.200 --> 00:58.200
Yeah, we'll see.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.360
Working on the old resume anyway.

01:00.360 --> 01:05.120
I mean, that's either the ultimate work from home job or the ultimate work on location

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
job.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
I'm not sure.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.320
This episode is brought to you by the all new iCloud Guru, the leader in learning for

01:09.320 --> 01:11.320
the cloud, Linux, and other modern tech skills.

01:11.320 --> 01:15.400
They have hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs, so go get certified.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.400
Get hired.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.440
Get learning at iCloudGuru.com.

01:18.440 --> 01:24.160
All right, well, so coming up on 4.14, we've got a lot.

01:24.160 --> 01:28.240
First of all, we've been building a new server, something that we're putting together for

01:28.240 --> 01:29.740
the road trip.

01:29.740 --> 01:31.520
It's a tracker.

01:31.520 --> 01:34.720
We've wanted to do this for a while, and we've done it with some commercial software in the

01:34.720 --> 01:35.840
past.

01:35.840 --> 01:41.360
This time we wanted to build it with all free software, a safe and secure open source self-tracking

01:41.360 --> 01:44.680
tool that you could use for yourself and your family and your friends, or we're going to

01:44.680 --> 01:48.440
use so you can find us on our JB reunion road trip.

01:48.440 --> 01:52.360
It has lots of features, including social groups and stuff like that, but we're using

01:52.360 --> 01:56.760
own tracks to do something a little specific to build something and we'll tell you about

01:56.760 --> 02:01.200
what we're creating and how we deployed it all and why we think that own tracks is a

02:01.200 --> 02:06.280
safe and secure way to track your location and control your data if you would like.

02:06.280 --> 02:10.120
On top of that, an old friend joins us on the show today to chat about how we handle

02:10.120 --> 02:13.880
things in the Linux news when they get a little awkward.

02:13.880 --> 02:14.880
Welcome back to the show, Michael.

02:14.880 --> 02:15.880
Thanks for having me.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.240
It's been a while.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.240
It has.

02:18.240 --> 02:23.760
It's been like years, so we're glad to have you here because in the last couple of weeks

02:23.760 --> 02:27.640
there's been some weird things in the news, and we thought maybe we'd go a little meta

02:27.640 --> 02:31.560
this week and talk about why we cover it and how we cover it.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.560
Oh yeah.

02:32.560 --> 02:33.560
I'm so excited about that.

02:33.560 --> 02:37.000
It's a little dicey this week.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.640
Past couple of weeks, really, if you think about it, because there's been a couple of

02:39.640 --> 02:45.720
these in a row, so it seems to actually have cranked up quite recently in the past year

02:45.720 --> 02:51.880
where we know we had, there's times we have downtime of drama for a year, none at all,

02:51.880 --> 02:55.520
and then all of a sudden now it doesn't seem like it's stopping.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.520
Ebs and flows.

02:56.520 --> 03:00.880
It just comes, it comes in these big waves of it, so we're going to dig into that today,

03:00.880 --> 03:04.400
but before we do that, I want to bring in our virtual lug to help us go through all

03:04.400 --> 03:05.400
of this.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.600
Let's give a very greetings virtual lug.

03:10.600 --> 03:11.600
Hello everybody.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.760
Good to have you in there today, Neil.

03:14.760 --> 03:19.360
In honor of our conversation in the post show, which is the post show for the members, I

03:19.360 --> 03:23.920
am installing Fedora rawhide KDE spin live during the show today.

03:23.920 --> 03:28.880
I don't know how to respond to this, Chris, except for what, you know, I had deep in on

03:28.880 --> 03:32.680
here and I have some follow up thoughts on deep in that I want to share in the feedback

03:32.680 --> 03:35.520
and I recently had Windows 11 on this laptop.

03:35.520 --> 03:40.440
I just feel like this laptop needs a real good purge, needs a clean slate, and so I'm

03:40.440 --> 03:44.560
going KDE spin Fedora rawhide on this ThinkPad X1.

03:44.560 --> 03:45.760
I'm going to see how it does.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.360
And you've got Neil signed up as your personal assistant.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.360
Should anything go wrong?

03:49.360 --> 03:53.440
Well, last week he told me it's going to be perfect and flawless, so I'm assuming that's

03:53.440 --> 03:54.440
not what I said.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
I'm pretty sure.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.440
Yeah, I'm pretty sure those are what you said.

03:56.440 --> 04:01.780
So by the end of the episode, I should find out who we, the install, I just kicked off

04:01.780 --> 04:02.780
the installation.

04:02.780 --> 04:04.720
It's at 18 percent right now.

04:04.720 --> 04:09.820
Also just because I apparently like the chaos, I'm running on battery too, because everybody

04:09.820 --> 04:10.820
knows.

04:10.820 --> 04:13.560
Yeah, everybody knows when you install your OS, you want to run on battery.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.920
That's what they tell you right at the start of the installation, right?

04:15.920 --> 04:16.920
What could go wrong?

04:16.920 --> 04:20.280
Chris, you just invited everything to go wrong.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.280
Yeah, I know.

04:21.280 --> 04:22.280
I know.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.480
I got good news.

04:23.480 --> 04:27.340
We've been chatting with friends in the Denver area and we're locking in what could potentially

04:27.340 --> 04:33.360
be a very awesome meetup location in Denver, which I will update our meetup page when we

04:33.360 --> 04:35.600
have all of the details locked in.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.400
So if you haven't signed up yet, we have two meetups that are scheduled.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.000
And then the idea is with this tracker that we're building, you can watch where LadyJupes

04:43.000 --> 04:44.040
is going.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.400
And if we're in your area, you can reach out to me on Telegram and maybe we can just meet

04:48.400 --> 04:51.560
up impromptu, just do a little mini meetup, but we'll get into that.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.760
It's all coming together this week.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.180
I'm really excited.

04:55.180 --> 05:02.000
It's all finally coming together and the technology to make it possible is all running on Linux

05:02.000 --> 05:03.040
and we'll tell you about that.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.840
But let's talk about this situation with the news.

05:05.840 --> 05:11.960
It really came up when the hoopla around Audacity broke out into the public starting back around

05:11.960 --> 05:19.120
in May when the Muse group awkwardly announced that they had acquired Audacity as you can

05:19.120 --> 05:24.800
in the open source world by essentially acquiring the IP rights and the copyright and paying

05:24.800 --> 05:26.680
off the developers.

05:26.680 --> 05:33.400
That had snowballed into a series of miscommunications and mishandling with Audacity's most passionate

05:33.400 --> 05:40.240
community over issues like the privacy policy, their CLA, their contributor agreement and

05:40.240 --> 05:44.160
other things around metric tracking that always strike a chord with people.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.880
They all came up relatively quickly when you consider that this all just kind of went down

05:47.880 --> 05:51.760
two months ago and these things have been revealed since then.

05:51.760 --> 05:56.480
And it can be awkward for us to cover some of these stories because there's a lot of

05:56.480 --> 06:01.680
drama that gets spun up in all of this, especially when you have Forks that launch and then 4chan

06:01.680 --> 06:03.800
gets involved and starts trolling people.

06:03.800 --> 06:09.840
But then not long before that, there was the Freenode situation which was immensely complex

06:09.840 --> 06:15.080
and an important story with nuggets of information at the core of it that you need to know but

06:15.080 --> 06:19.960
just draped in drama, completely wrapped in drama.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.840
And so we thought this week maybe we'd have a little meta-conversation with you the listener

06:23.840 --> 06:29.040
about how we view these types of stories, how and why we cover them and maybe a little

06:29.040 --> 06:33.160
bit of the logic behind what we hope to get conveyed to our audience when we actually

06:33.160 --> 06:36.760
kind of go into these stories that seem, at least on the surface, like they're loaded

06:36.760 --> 06:38.100
with a lot of personal feuding.

06:38.100 --> 06:41.880
And so that's why it was great to have Michael join us because those of you who used to listen

06:41.880 --> 06:45.560
to the show, you know Michael's been on the show before, but Michael also runs his own

06:45.560 --> 06:49.920
new weekly news podcast this week in Linux and of course is a co-host on the Destination

06:49.920 --> 06:54.540
Linux podcast and has been following these stories and he's had to consider how he wants

06:54.540 --> 06:58.880
to present this information to his audience and he's had to go through is this a story

06:58.880 --> 07:02.640
worth covering and make that call and make that decision and I'm sure there's been times

07:02.640 --> 07:05.340
Michael where you're like I'd just rather not talk about any of this because it's just

07:05.340 --> 07:06.400
so dramatic.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.400
There have been.

07:07.400 --> 07:12.040
There's sometimes over the years that these things have come out, there have been a couple

07:12.040 --> 07:17.520
times where I see how important is this to cover and if it is not important, if it's

07:17.520 --> 07:23.940
just drama that is for the sake of drama, well then I do my best to not talk about it.

07:23.940 --> 07:28.280
But if there's cases like the Freenode thing or the Audacity thing, you kind of have to

07:28.280 --> 07:32.920
consider the fact that there's no way you can't talk about it.

07:32.920 --> 07:39.660
So how do you handle that sort of topic becomes the issue on those weeks and the Audacity

07:39.660 --> 07:47.080
one is a really interesting one in this space because there's some validity to both sides

07:47.080 --> 07:53.400
and both arguments and you kind of need to balance how you present both sides without

07:53.400 --> 07:58.480
trying to – and also I give my opinion as well, so I don't – I want to make sure

07:58.480 --> 08:04.260
that my coverage is as balanced as possible while also providing my opinion and trying

08:04.260 --> 08:13.920
to express the overall encapsulation of the topic without doing it overboard.

08:13.920 --> 08:18.760
And this particular Audacity topic, I've covered it a couple of times on my show and

08:18.760 --> 08:23.560
this past episode when I said I wanted to do it in a very concise way and try to cover

08:23.560 --> 08:28.260
all the bases as quickly as possible and that turned out to be 20 minutes.

08:28.260 --> 08:31.200
So that didn't really happen.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.120
You know what else I was thinking about while you were saying that that's gotten trickier

08:34.120 --> 08:35.940
in the last few years.

08:35.940 --> 08:43.480
More social angles and social issues are working their way into free software news stories

08:43.480 --> 08:47.180
like I think of Linus or RMS.

08:47.180 --> 08:51.020
These are stories that have like a technical angle to them but they also have a social

08:51.020 --> 08:56.020
angle to them and that is not exactly why we got into tech in the first place to cover

08:56.020 --> 08:57.020
social stuff.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.020
Right.

08:58.020 --> 08:59.020
That's a good point.

08:59.020 --> 09:04.660
I think that we wanted to talk about the technology and the innovations that are happening and

09:04.660 --> 09:09.500
that happens a lot and it's really fun to talk about these things and also try to find

09:09.500 --> 09:14.160
new and exciting things that you might not have heard as an audience and present that

09:14.160 --> 09:15.160
to them.

09:15.160 --> 09:19.600
So trying to follow all of these things but there are times where the social aspect comes

09:19.600 --> 09:25.660
in and you kind of have to deal with it and sometimes I've dealt with it well, sometimes

09:25.660 --> 09:26.660
maybe not so much.

09:26.660 --> 09:27.820
I guess it depends.

09:27.820 --> 09:32.860
It does add an aspect that you have to dig through like something that Wes and I will

09:32.860 --> 09:39.460
find that we're doing a lot for Linux action news is just trying to read through threads

09:39.460 --> 09:43.340
of people going back and forth that are having a conversation.

09:43.340 --> 09:44.800
Somebody is yelling at somebody.

09:44.800 --> 09:50.500
The University of Minnesota kernel patch hole, you know, kerfuffle is a great example of

09:50.500 --> 09:55.540
going back and forth, mailing list and trying to build out a timeline of what's going on.

09:55.540 --> 09:59.740
Well, and you know, some of these facts you're getting or maybe facts with quotes around

09:59.740 --> 10:03.140
them, you know, they're coming from individual players who have their own agendas in whatever

10:03.140 --> 10:04.260
story you're trying to cover.

10:04.260 --> 10:08.780
And so you've got to kind of build your own model of how these actors view events so you

10:08.780 --> 10:13.560
can really try to understand at least what they're saying and what position they're coming

10:13.560 --> 10:14.560
from.

10:14.560 --> 10:19.620
Yeah, it seems to me there's also an inclination for certain outlets to go hard on the drama

10:19.620 --> 10:22.500
and really focus on that and turn it up to 11.

10:22.500 --> 10:27.460
And people have figured out how to game that in the in social media and with blogs and

10:27.460 --> 10:30.780
GitHub and all these ways that you can get your message out there.

10:30.780 --> 10:33.100
And I think of like the Freenode situation.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.100
Clearly it's a really complex issue.

10:35.100 --> 10:39.780
But something that we noticed and doesn't I think factors in is the folks that launched

10:39.780 --> 10:43.660
Libera chat were unusually organized.

10:43.660 --> 10:48.940
They clearly had a lot of premeditated maneuvers before they broke off from Freenode.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.060
Were they right in doing so?

10:50.060 --> 10:52.380
It seems in retrospect, yes, likely.

10:52.380 --> 10:57.700
But I felt like the audience needed to know that it seemed like the Libera chat folks

10:57.700 --> 11:00.500
had essentially pre-organized and were ready to go.

11:00.500 --> 11:06.260
And one of the most clear demonstrations of that was that they all had public statements

11:06.260 --> 11:10.140
and they all linked to each other's public statements and they created this cross reference

11:10.140 --> 11:15.860
of public statements that just blasted the narrative out there and really got their take

11:15.860 --> 11:22.500
on the situation miles out ahead of what the remaining Freenode staff could communicate.

11:22.500 --> 11:27.540
And that is an interesting element to a story that while it doesn't really change the facts

11:27.540 --> 11:30.660
on the ground, perhaps is still worth knowing.

11:30.660 --> 11:35.020
It's like trying to dig those nuggets out and try to identify that stuff.

11:35.020 --> 11:40.100
I think in the open source world matters just a little bit more because I think it's it

11:40.100 --> 11:45.280
creates these lasting stories that we tell ourselves.

11:45.280 --> 11:49.160
We tell ours like the story of what happened to Freenode and the story of what happened

11:49.160 --> 11:54.860
to Audacity will be spread around in comment sections and on podcasts now forever, for

11:54.860 --> 11:55.860
hereforth.

11:55.860 --> 11:56.860
Right.

11:56.860 --> 12:01.060
And so while that stuff is developing, I kind of feel like maybe we have a shot and I'm

12:01.060 --> 12:02.060
curious to know your thoughts on this, Michael.

12:02.060 --> 12:07.100
It's like I feel like maybe we have a shot on trying to participate in that initial conversation

12:07.100 --> 12:09.580
and try to get some of the initial history right.

12:09.580 --> 12:10.580
Oh, yeah, definitely.

12:10.580 --> 12:14.540
I think that's very interesting, especially when you're talking about the Freenode one

12:14.540 --> 12:17.940
and you're talking about the the kernel ban situation with the University of Minnesota.

12:17.940 --> 12:22.900
Those were topics that were very volatile, very quickly.

12:22.900 --> 12:27.460
And we're trying to balance the topics, whereas the Audacity has been happening over the course

12:27.460 --> 12:29.200
of a few a couple of months.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.300
So it's kind of built up and you can kind of you have more time to dig in, whereas the

12:33.300 --> 12:36.220
Freenode one was so quick.

12:36.220 --> 12:40.900
And there was, as you mentioned, it's really interesting that they had everything prepared

12:40.900 --> 12:46.940
to go in that sense, as well as all the server stuff was in two days of the potential announcement

12:46.940 --> 12:47.940
coming out.

12:47.940 --> 12:49.580
All of a sudden, everything's ready to go.

12:49.580 --> 12:56.380
So that does kind of create a, well, do we talk about it now or do we wait until we have

12:56.380 --> 13:02.940
time from the other people involved to see if do we have all the information or do we

13:02.940 --> 13:04.860
want to jump ahead of it?

13:04.860 --> 13:11.820
And with the case of Freenode, I think there was like a four or five day delay for them

13:11.820 --> 13:13.700
to give a reaction.

13:13.700 --> 13:19.100
And that kind of created a situation of like, I don't want to talk about it until I have

13:19.100 --> 13:25.780
both sides, because then otherwise it seems like I'm just pushing one agenda or one opinion.

13:25.780 --> 13:31.820
And that is a position that I don't ever want to be in, because I want to be the reporter.

13:31.820 --> 13:38.580
My job that I've chosen to do is provide the information, provide the news, and then if

13:38.580 --> 13:47.840
it's a dramatic news or a social kind of inflammatory news, then I want to cover it on as many sides

13:47.840 --> 13:52.540
as possible to make sure that at least it's a fair coverage.

13:52.540 --> 13:57.260
And then also, I'm going to put my opinion in there as well, because it's not just reporting,

13:57.260 --> 14:02.360
it's also like content in an entertainment fashion too.

14:02.360 --> 14:06.820
So when you do these kinds of topics, you kind of have to balance it.

14:06.820 --> 14:11.700
So I'm not sure exactly which one, one of these topics I waited until more information

14:11.700 --> 14:13.420
came out.

14:13.420 --> 14:20.420
And some topics in the past, I have chosen to jump ahead of it, and then that backfired

14:20.420 --> 14:21.420
before.

14:21.420 --> 14:25.920
So you kind of have to test the waters, so to speak.

14:25.920 --> 14:31.140
And it's made me a lot more cautious in terms of how I want to handle it every time I've

14:31.140 --> 14:33.260
done it.

14:33.260 --> 14:40.540
And it seems to be getting more and more frequent, which is an interesting kind of turn of events

14:40.540 --> 14:45.980
in the past year and a half, two years of what used to be very rare.

14:45.980 --> 14:48.200
Now it seems to be quite often.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.060
So I guess on the bright side, I get more practice for the shows.

14:51.060 --> 14:58.580
Yeah, what do you suppose has caused that, the heat's been turned up on these stories?

14:58.580 --> 15:04.500
People have more time to see what's happening versus the previous issues where the whole

15:04.500 --> 15:10.160
working from home thing and the quarantine of last year and those things, people having

15:10.160 --> 15:12.040
more time to pay attention.

15:12.040 --> 15:16.820
And I think that people are digging in more as well and finding these different things.

15:16.820 --> 15:23.980
Some of these topics would not have been found likely in a previous time period because they

15:23.980 --> 15:30.340
were a pull request or a mailing list posts or something like that, that not a lot of

15:30.340 --> 15:32.020
people are paying attention to.

15:32.020 --> 15:37.140
But because more people have more time to pay attention, they can dig in a little more.

15:37.140 --> 15:41.020
Something Wes and I talk about sometimes, and I'd like to know your thoughts on it too,

15:41.020 --> 15:43.640
is there's two audience in a sense out there.

15:43.640 --> 15:48.180
There is the audience that knows open source, they're free software users, they're Linux

15:48.180 --> 15:51.580
users, they understand this stuff, and they have a different set of priorities around

15:51.580 --> 15:54.520
privacy and metric collection.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.920
Let's take this Muse group stuff for example.

15:56.920 --> 16:01.860
You could argue that if say like an Apple news podcast was covering what the Muse group

16:01.860 --> 16:05.620
was doing with Audacity, they think it was great because now Audacity could be listed

16:05.620 --> 16:07.100
in the Mac app store.

16:07.100 --> 16:11.500
They think all these things that Audacity is happening to Audacity are great.

16:11.500 --> 16:15.620
I'm curious how that impacts how you think about this stuff because you've got Linux

16:15.620 --> 16:19.920
users and then you've got new people that are just discovering this ecosystem that might

16:19.920 --> 16:21.580
have a different perspective on these stories.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.580
Yeah, that's an interesting point.

16:23.580 --> 16:28.500
I think when it comes to these other communities looking into it, they're going to be looking

16:28.500 --> 16:33.540
at it from a much different light, as you said, and with the reactions that we have

16:33.540 --> 16:39.140
in this community and the open source community and those sorts of things, I think that there

16:39.140 --> 16:42.860
is a balance that we need to consider more often.

16:42.860 --> 16:50.780
I think that when it comes to these kind of reactions that are so bombastic of like how

16:50.780 --> 16:56.460
dare you even consider the possibility of telemetry, I've gone on record before that

16:56.460 --> 17:01.740
I think that telemetry is not bad automatically just to exist.

17:01.740 --> 17:02.960
You can do it properly.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.300
You can do it in an ethical way.

17:05.300 --> 17:09.180
You can even do opt-out in an ethical way.

17:09.180 --> 17:12.820
It depends on what kind of data you collect, how you collect it, and how you present it,

17:12.820 --> 17:16.620
and whether or not you ask permissions.

17:16.620 --> 17:21.120
There's some people in the community who see any form of telemetry whatsoever, even if

17:21.120 --> 17:27.700
it is the most minimal amount you can possibly get, and that is too much.

17:27.700 --> 17:33.940
I think that we see sometimes these topics in the case of Audacity or MuseGroup where

17:33.940 --> 17:43.220
they react so harshly so quickly that it kind of puts a negative bubble around it for the

17:43.220 --> 17:45.380
people in the different communities.

17:45.380 --> 17:49.980
They see it as like, oh, these people don't want to even consider, they don't want to

17:49.980 --> 17:50.980
be open-minded.

17:50.980 --> 17:51.980
Right.

17:51.980 --> 17:57.420
A lot of times, that's how the business unit on the other end of that reaction, I've had

17:57.420 --> 18:01.540
several guests that I've kept in touch with after they've announced a Linux product, and

18:01.540 --> 18:06.340
then they didn't package it right, or they didn't build it against the right library

18:06.340 --> 18:11.500
or whatever, and they get a lot of negative reaction, and they don't take it well.

18:11.500 --> 18:15.220
They don't try to listen for the signal in the noise and figure out what they need to

18:15.220 --> 18:16.220
address.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.740
Instead, they just sort of take it as an attack and a front.

18:18.740 --> 18:20.340
Kind of like the Witcher 2.

18:20.340 --> 18:25.340
They had a massive backlash because they had the audacity to use wine.

18:25.340 --> 18:26.420
How could they dare ship it?

18:26.420 --> 18:30.460
And of course, it was a fully tuned, fully tuned, and they had tested it.

18:30.460 --> 18:34.100
It wasn't just like its general random-ass build of wine.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.100
Yeah.

18:35.100 --> 18:40.660
And such an ironic turn of events is that the Witcher 2 does this, and they get so much

18:40.660 --> 18:41.660
backlash.

18:41.660 --> 18:42.660
Valve says, you know what?

18:42.660 --> 18:44.460
We're going to make a better wine.

18:44.460 --> 18:45.460
Yay!

18:45.460 --> 18:52.020
Now all these games run on the platform in the same way that the Witcher 2 did, and the

18:52.020 --> 18:55.140
perception is so different.

18:55.140 --> 18:58.980
I was thankful for the Witcher 2 work being done in the first place and also with the

18:58.980 --> 19:00.980
work for Proton, just to be clear.

19:00.980 --> 19:03.280
This is not a comparison to saying these are both bad.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.280
They're both great.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.280
Yeah.

19:05.280 --> 19:09.220
Whatever support you want to make Linux have support for Linux, continue to do so.

19:09.220 --> 19:12.980
The other thing that is kind of funny to see, and I see this a lot in the written press

19:12.980 --> 19:21.460
the most, is when projects announce that Flatpak is the future of software distribution, it's

19:21.460 --> 19:25.260
hailed as a remarkable achievement that should have happened already.

19:25.260 --> 19:29.540
And then when Canonical announces that Snaps are the future of software distribution, it's

19:29.540 --> 19:31.060
considered like, how could they?

19:31.060 --> 19:32.060
It's an overreach.

19:32.060 --> 19:36.420
It's Canonical trying to control the Linux landscape and application deployments on Linux,

19:36.420 --> 19:39.460
which maybe some of that's true, but it's just funny the different kind of reactions

19:39.460 --> 19:44.360
you see depending on the stories and how it sort of sets the tone for conversation in

19:44.360 --> 19:45.360
the community.

19:45.360 --> 19:50.460
I think that's very interesting as a point as well, because there's the case of the way

19:50.460 --> 19:55.780
that they are perceived is very different, but my favorite part about that particular

19:55.780 --> 20:00.720
thing, the Flatpak versus Snap, is when I've seen people say, how could Canonical do this

20:00.720 --> 20:02.660
when we already have Flatpaks?

20:02.660 --> 20:08.700
And then I have to point out, the first release of Snaps was a few weeks prior to Flatpaks.

20:08.700 --> 20:12.300
So that's not a thing that matters.

20:12.300 --> 20:17.020
And it doesn't really work out the way that a lot of people want to present it of saying

20:17.020 --> 20:18.380
they're doing a not-admitted here.

20:18.380 --> 20:21.060
And it's like, well, they were kind of first.

20:21.060 --> 20:24.940
Flatpaks have a different policy, and if you want to say, I like the policy system that

20:24.940 --> 20:27.820
Flatpaks handles better, fair enough.

20:27.820 --> 20:33.620
But that's not typically what is described in that particular situation.

20:33.620 --> 20:38.900
So I think it's really interesting that a lot of companies are choosing to go with Snaps,

20:38.900 --> 20:44.460
and I'm more than happy to say welcome to the community and welcome to the ecosystem.

20:44.460 --> 20:50.460
And other companies are picking Flatpak, and I'm actually kind of ecstatic when they choose

20:50.460 --> 20:51.460
Flatpaks.

20:51.460 --> 20:55.980
I think that there's a lot of value to the Flatpaks, and my preference is Flatpak.

20:55.980 --> 20:59.660
But personally, as long as it's on Linux, we're good.

20:59.660 --> 21:02.380
Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

21:02.380 --> 21:03.380
Entirely agreed.

21:03.380 --> 21:07.420
I'm curious, Michael, looking to the future, I know when Chris and I are sort of putting

21:07.420 --> 21:14.220
together a Linux action news, there are repeatedly a similar set of written outlets that are

21:14.220 --> 21:20.260
doing a lot of the grunt work, covering things first, scraping through mail server logs,

21:20.260 --> 21:24.340
checking on discussions in GitHub and figuring out what's going on out there.

21:24.340 --> 21:28.220
And there are people like Michael Larable, in particular, Pharaonix, who are spending

21:28.220 --> 21:33.060
a lot of time to do this that enables a lot of great work on top of it that you and I

21:33.060 --> 21:35.380
and Chris are all doing.

21:35.380 --> 21:38.020
Seems like, I don't know how tenable that is.

21:38.020 --> 21:42.940
We're all depending on advertising revenue, and much like in regular journalism, I'm not

21:42.940 --> 21:44.420
sure they get enough credit.

21:44.420 --> 21:45.600
Oh, absolutely.

21:45.600 --> 21:49.940
That's why I started, every time I talk about a source that is a critical piece, I always

21:49.940 --> 21:54.340
promote the source, or I at least have a visual element saying this is where it's from, or

21:54.340 --> 22:00.380
in some cases, like the last episode of Twill, I talked about some stuff that OMG Ubuntu

22:00.380 --> 22:05.040
found from their forums and digging into that thing, and I'm going to absolutely say that's

22:05.040 --> 22:06.120
where it comes from.

22:06.120 --> 22:11.060
And I do think that a lot of times, even on other blogs where they don't really give credit

22:11.060 --> 22:16.620
or sometimes they'll give credit with the word source and a link, and I think that's

22:16.620 --> 22:21.220
the least you can do, but I think it is something that they should get a lot more credit than

22:21.220 --> 22:26.820
they do, and especially like a high five to Pharaonix because there's a lot of great content

22:26.820 --> 22:27.820
on that website.

22:27.820 --> 22:29.260
Yeah, I think he gets a hard time.

22:29.260 --> 22:34.300
Everybody's all Pharaonix and they roll their eyes, but man, that guy is publishing seven

22:34.300 --> 22:35.300
days a week.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.340
He's doing a lot of this stuff hands on himself.

22:37.340 --> 22:39.340
I think he might be a machine.

22:39.340 --> 22:44.820
I look at my list of RSS feeds because we're already going to subscribe to stuff, and you

22:44.820 --> 22:49.380
go like, okay, there's one from this website for this week, five from this website from

22:49.380 --> 22:54.740
this week, and you look at Pharaonix, okay, five from this day and every other day.

22:54.740 --> 22:58.100
Yeah, and that can be Saturday and Sunday sometimes.

22:58.100 --> 22:59.100
It just doesn't matter.

22:59.100 --> 23:01.180
So there are those resources.

23:01.180 --> 23:08.300
I've been thinking more about it too, like what could we do putting all of our resources

23:08.300 --> 23:14.180
together too to help generate new original reporting, and in a way we do it by interviewing

23:14.180 --> 23:15.980
projects and stuff like that.

23:15.980 --> 23:20.300
We both do our part, but I feel like there's probably even more, and I don't have an answer,

23:20.300 --> 23:22.060
but it's something that has been on my mind.

23:22.060 --> 23:27.160
It feels like with the whole lockdown COVID stuff, it was like a year and change to kind

23:27.160 --> 23:34.500
of rethink about events and what events to go to and what events I miss covering, and

23:34.500 --> 23:39.420
I kind of have, you know, maybe I'm kind of working out a new model of what events I might

23:39.420 --> 23:40.420
go to.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.420
Have you given thought to that?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.420
Yes, I have.

23:43.420 --> 23:51.000
In fact, when I previously did events, I would go to events and think, you know, can I justify

23:51.000 --> 23:53.960
the cost of going to these events and all these other things?

23:53.960 --> 23:58.380
And then, you know, when you have the case of the COVID thing happening, which is unprecedented

23:58.380 --> 24:03.220
experience that everybody has no expectations to what's going to happen.

24:03.220 --> 24:09.180
I had no forethought to think I'm going to miss conferences.

24:09.180 --> 24:17.380
So now when it starts back up, I mean, absolutely next year, I can guarantee you that my plan

24:17.380 --> 24:22.720
at least, maybe I can't promise it, but my plan is to be at every single one of the conferences

24:22.720 --> 24:24.140
I could physically go to.

24:24.140 --> 24:26.020
Hopefully we'll see you there.

24:26.020 --> 24:27.540
I mean, completely agreed, right?

24:27.540 --> 24:29.940
Yeah, just get back in the game again for sure.

24:29.940 --> 24:30.940
Oh yeah.

24:30.940 --> 24:36.020
Well, what do you say we continue this fun on Destination Linux?

24:36.020 --> 24:38.060
That sounds like a great idea.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.140
So how about this weekend?

24:40.140 --> 24:41.180
I'm in, I'll be there.

24:41.180 --> 24:46.880
So I'll be there on Sunday and you guys stream it live at dealinlive.com and of course we'll

24:46.880 --> 24:52.000
have links to this week in Linux and Destination Linux and Michael's profile in the show notes.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.540
Check that out and Michael's hang out and stick around with us if he can and we'll just

24:56.540 --> 24:59.060
keep chatting on stuff and feel free to jump in as we go through some of this.

24:59.060 --> 25:00.060
Yeah, for sure.

25:00.060 --> 25:03.940
All right, thanks for making it.

25:03.940 --> 25:06.060
linode.com slash unplugged.

25:06.060 --> 25:11.500
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on your new account and of course, do I even

25:11.500 --> 25:12.500
need to say it?

25:12.500 --> 25:15.700
But of course you support the show, that's linode.com slash unplugged.

25:15.700 --> 25:16.700
Linode is our hosting provider.

25:16.700 --> 25:22.500
In fact, the project we built today, of course we built it on Linode and I actually really

25:22.500 --> 25:26.660
enjoy that process because it's a chance for Wes and I to talk about like, well, what's

25:26.660 --> 25:30.340
this thing going to do and do we want to deploy it on an existing Linux?

25:30.340 --> 25:33.580
We have some of these application servers that we've built that we'll just deploy containers

25:33.580 --> 25:36.420
on or do we want to have a dedicated system?

25:36.420 --> 25:40.620
And what I really appreciate about Linode is the pricing works such that whatever your

25:40.620 --> 25:45.520
style is, it's going to work for you and it ranges 30 to 50% cheaper than what the other

25:45.520 --> 25:50.620
cloud providers are offering and they have 11 data centers worldwide you can choose from

25:50.620 --> 25:56.780
and every single service, even if it's just like one $5 a month rig.

25:56.780 --> 26:02.600
But if you got like we have a lot now, they back it by the best customer service out there.

26:02.600 --> 26:07.520
They're just like winning awards all the time, it's impressive and they're available by phone

26:07.520 --> 26:08.520
or ticket.

26:08.520 --> 26:14.060
Every step of the way, Linode has focused on building a really good experience around

26:14.060 --> 26:17.740
running applications on Linux in the cloud.

26:17.740 --> 26:20.900
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

26:20.900 --> 26:25.780
In fact, I've even seen people run Windows on Linode because they give you that level

26:25.780 --> 26:32.340
of access to the metal if you want it, but they wrap it in a simple, clean, easy to use

26:32.340 --> 26:33.340
dashboard.

26:33.340 --> 26:37.580
So if you're not a pro or you've never set up a server in the cloud before, you're not

26:37.580 --> 26:38.580
going to get lost.

26:38.580 --> 26:42.180
You know, a few months ago I set up a sync thing server in the cloud.

26:42.180 --> 26:46.660
I was just talking to Joe about this this morning and I opted to go with a $5 a month

26:46.660 --> 26:50.580
up Linode just because I figured like, why not just throw a machine out that I can connect

26:50.580 --> 26:51.620
to a lot of disk?

26:51.620 --> 26:53.060
And so I did just that.

26:53.060 --> 26:58.100
I set up that machine and I just added it to my sync thing network.

26:58.100 --> 27:01.380
So I share all of my shares with that.

27:01.380 --> 27:05.180
And then from that, I share it with the additional systems and they all sync with each other

27:05.180 --> 27:10.540
and it kind of creates a peer to peer sync system that is much faster than just one server

27:10.540 --> 27:11.980
to one server.

27:11.980 --> 27:16.500
And I love that because what it means is during the day, I can have something here at the

27:16.500 --> 27:19.500
studio that syncs up to my Linode system.

27:19.500 --> 27:24.380
And then when I bring my system online in lady jupes, the files are coming both from

27:24.380 --> 27:29.700
the studio server now and from the Linode server and it loads up super, super fast.

27:29.700 --> 27:36.340
And because my cellular system in the RV is multi network, I can actually saturate multiple

27:36.340 --> 27:42.660
cellular provider connections simultaneously and Linode can send as much as I can take.

27:42.660 --> 27:47.540
And so I can move files and data around using sync thing transparently, which is one Linode

27:47.540 --> 27:48.540
up in the cloud.

27:48.540 --> 27:51.000
And there's all kinds of things you can experiment with.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.140
You can learn, you can test and you can deploy in production.

27:54.140 --> 27:59.220
So go get that $100 in 60 day credit at Linode.com slash unplug.

27:59.220 --> 28:01.340
Try this stuff out for yourself.

28:01.340 --> 28:08.660
Learn something, build something and support the show Linode.com slash unplugged.

28:08.660 --> 28:12.180
Now we do have a few things to clean up around here.

28:12.180 --> 28:14.700
Come on, Chris, you leave the studio like this.

28:14.700 --> 28:15.700
I know.

28:15.700 --> 28:16.700
I know.

28:16.700 --> 28:17.700
I don't know what that plate of wings is doing over there.

28:17.700 --> 28:18.940
I think it's still safe to eat.

28:18.940 --> 28:19.940
Oh, good.

28:19.940 --> 28:20.940
Cause I've had a few.

28:20.940 --> 28:21.940
Good.

28:21.940 --> 28:22.940
They were delicious.

28:22.940 --> 28:26.420
In the meantime, I want to remind you about our meetup page cause it's back.

28:26.420 --> 28:28.460
We're beginning to actually try to schedule things again.

28:28.460 --> 28:29.460
We'll see.

28:29.460 --> 28:33.800
But uh, go to, go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for that.

28:33.800 --> 28:37.500
Also if you want to contact the show, you got some, some feedback or something you'd

28:37.500 --> 28:39.340
like us to cover.

28:39.340 --> 28:40.340
We'd love that.

28:40.340 --> 28:42.500
Linodeplug.com slash contact.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.780
And also I invite you to join our virtual lug.

28:44.780 --> 28:48.240
It happens every Sunday at noon Pacific.

28:48.240 --> 28:53.160
You can find your exact time at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar.

28:53.160 --> 28:56.980
It just happens in our mumble room, in the lobby, people hanging out, talking about Linux

28:56.980 --> 29:02.820
or maybe you're outside grilling and you just want to jump on with some like-minded geeks.

29:02.820 --> 29:06.700
We invite you to join them and details for that mumble server.

29:06.700 --> 29:10.460
They're over at Linux unplug.com slash mumble.

29:10.460 --> 29:13.420
That's all going down every single dang Sunday.

29:13.420 --> 29:20.660
So join them and hang out and get geeky in our virtual lugs Sunday meeting.

29:20.660 --> 29:24.980
Now we decided to set up a tracker and we didn't want something that was running on

29:24.980 --> 29:27.900
a commercial service or routed through Google maps.

29:27.900 --> 29:32.900
We wanted something that used free software that we could self host and own tracks has

29:32.900 --> 29:34.800
been on our list to try for a while.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.020
We've taken a couple of passes at it.

29:37.020 --> 29:41.900
It allows you to track your own location and you can keep that completely private if you

29:41.900 --> 29:45.020
want and never share it with anyone and just use it for yourself.

29:45.020 --> 29:47.960
An example of why you might want to do that is automations.

29:47.960 --> 29:52.420
You can have things like lighting and whatnot respond to your location on own tracks.

29:52.420 --> 29:55.020
And what it does is it runs on your smartphone.

29:55.020 --> 29:59.480
In most cases there's an app that's in the play store in the Apple app store and every

29:59.480 --> 30:04.380
time your phone moves, what they call a significant distance, it connects to the server via whatever

30:04.380 --> 30:08.540
connectivity you have available and checks in with your location.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.240
And there's a couple of ways you can do that.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.040
One of them is MQTT.

30:12.040 --> 30:17.520
You can send it over MQTT or another one is HTTP, which you can probably guess what we

30:17.520 --> 30:24.500
went with and describe the setup that we decided to go with Wes with own tracks and the method

30:24.500 --> 30:25.500
and how we're hosting it.

30:25.500 --> 30:31.480
Yeah, well, of course we're using Docker because what we always do at this point and we're

30:31.480 --> 30:36.360
using a component of own tracks called the recorder application, and it's really lightweight

30:36.360 --> 30:40.480
and easy to get started with, which I like because I mean, the idea of having this data

30:40.480 --> 30:41.680
seems really nice.

30:41.680 --> 30:45.760
I'm one of the people that enjoyed knowing where I'd been in the past, just sort of reminiscing

30:45.760 --> 30:49.060
or keeping tracks or checking when when was I there.

30:49.060 --> 30:53.160
But I don't love the idea of Google having all of that.

30:53.160 --> 30:56.720
But if I have to stand up yet another database, well, I don't know.

30:56.720 --> 30:57.720
That's one more hurdle.

30:57.720 --> 31:01.140
So it was nice to see that this own tracks recorder, you don't really need much.

31:01.140 --> 31:05.800
There's a Docker compose file that you can get started with and then tweak to your needs

31:05.800 --> 31:11.540
stands up and it does have options for both MQTT and HTTP.

31:11.540 --> 31:17.960
And one nice thing about it is it can be an HTTP to MQTT bridge application and we'll

31:17.960 --> 31:19.240
get to that.

31:19.240 --> 31:22.880
But we basically got this started, expose the port to the internet, we're using traffic

31:22.880 --> 31:29.880
to proxy it and slap on some SSL, what you get out of the box is a nice little application

31:29.880 --> 31:33.840
that you can post updates over HTTP to just send some JSON, I think it's actually the

31:33.840 --> 31:38.200
same JSON payload that you would be sending over MQTT, but you just sort of configure

31:38.200 --> 31:42.520
which endpoint you send in your Android or iOS application.

31:42.520 --> 31:47.720
And then it's going to record it all locally, and to boot, serve up some geo JSON, or even

31:47.720 --> 31:50.920
render some open street map for you to track where you've been.

31:50.920 --> 31:56.520
So that geo JSON lets you pull that into other applications, like Home Assistant, or let

31:56.520 --> 32:00.840
you generate your own map if you maybe wanted to have something embedded on a website with

32:00.840 --> 32:05.760
a live tracker and you wanted to have a map that really was unique and fit the theme of

32:05.760 --> 32:08.460
your website, you could use this to generate the data for it.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.920
Or like Wes said, it'll build one for you using open street maps.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.800
And honestly, they look pretty good.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.580
Yeah, I think that's like more than enough for our purposes.

32:16.580 --> 32:18.880
But then of course, you know, if you want to go above and beyond, you've got the raw

32:18.880 --> 32:20.560
data, which is great.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.560
Yeah.

32:21.560 --> 32:26.040
And you can save it and just use it for I don't know, building charts and graphs of

32:26.040 --> 32:30.940
your travels, or you could use it to do what we want to accomplish, which is make a public

32:30.940 --> 32:33.400
tracker available that you can check in on.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.400
And here's what I'm thinking.

32:35.400 --> 32:38.380
And we're close to it, but we're not all the way there.

32:38.380 --> 32:42.920
And I'd love advice if anybody in the mumble room has any tips or ideas or anybody listening

32:42.920 --> 32:48.360
that would like to write in and give me some advice, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

32:48.360 --> 32:51.120
But I want to play with Hugo.

32:51.120 --> 32:54.680
I could use something else, but I've been thinking I should play with Hugo.

32:54.680 --> 33:01.160
I was picturing a small Hugo site that has this live tracker built into it.

33:01.160 --> 33:07.600
And on that page would also be information about the road trip and the meetup locations

33:07.600 --> 33:12.080
and maybe like a picture feed from pictures we've taken from the road trip.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.080
Something kind of simple.

33:13.080 --> 33:17.600
Oh, like a one stop shop sort of site that's all about this upcoming trip.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.080
I got the perfect domain for it.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.080
Are you ready?

33:20.080 --> 33:21.080
What did you get?

33:21.080 --> 33:22.080
Colony tracker.live.

33:22.080 --> 33:27.280
So I'm thinking like future trips and stuff, you know, track, track, colony tracker.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.560
I'm, Wes, I've been thinking more about it.

33:29.560 --> 33:35.520
You know, I've been thinking like, I feel like we should talk more about decent community

33:35.520 --> 33:41.940
interaction and how to be a good citizen in the Linux community and how to foster an environment

33:41.940 --> 33:44.680
of collaboration and turn down the heat.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.840
Help create the community we want to be a part of.

33:46.840 --> 33:47.840
I like it.

33:47.840 --> 33:48.840
Right.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.360
And I've been thinking the people that want to do that with us can be colony members.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.480
And so I've been, I've been just brewing on this idea.

33:53.480 --> 33:57.380
And so I like this idea of the colony tracker because I think a big part of this is going

33:57.380 --> 34:02.740
to be a big part of, I should say, to be specific of turning down the dial on the, on just the

34:02.740 --> 34:08.360
heat of conversation and just the tone I think will be when we get back in meet space and

34:08.360 --> 34:12.380
we have IRL bandwidth to interact with each other.

34:12.380 --> 34:16.020
I feel like there's going to be a pretty major shift because one of the main experiences

34:16.020 --> 34:22.600
I have had, and I know this is probably true for both Michael and Wes, is interacting with

34:22.600 --> 34:26.680
people in person, they become a friend for life.

34:26.680 --> 34:29.360
Interacting with people over the internet, I can be friends with them.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.360
It's nice.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.360
You know, I can like them a lot.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.880
I won't even think about that.

34:32.880 --> 34:37.720
I won't consider it like a relationship that lacks depth, but people I meet in person,

34:37.720 --> 34:39.920
I could end up being friends with for the rest of my life.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.720
We create really strong bonds.

34:41.720 --> 34:45.060
That's a really interesting point because I've had conversations and stuff.

34:45.060 --> 34:51.160
I've met people on IRC, met people on, you know, mumble or zoom or all kinds of places,

34:51.160 --> 34:53.640
but in person there is a lot more to it.

34:53.640 --> 34:57.880
And it's interesting because the reason I earlier said that I wanted to go to every

34:57.880 --> 35:05.120
conference is because the interaction of going to a lug and then like moving that lug to

35:05.120 --> 35:10.560
a virtual one because you have to, the vibe is so different that even though just the

35:10.560 --> 35:15.920
simplest, it's the same people, but for some reason that it's such a different experience

35:15.920 --> 35:21.080
so drastically that I agree that when you're doing it in person, you can, you can build

35:21.080 --> 35:22.080
a bond.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.080
It's much deeper.

35:23.080 --> 35:26.360
An in-person event, an in-person meeting, you know, even if it's just something simple,

35:26.360 --> 35:30.760
going out and having lunch, that's like a good, rich beer, like a really tasty beer

35:30.760 --> 35:35.400
like the CNX Tuesday and online events are like an O'Douls, like an alcohol free beer.

35:35.400 --> 35:39.840
It's like you get the, you get the essence of beer, you get the idea of beer, but it's

35:39.840 --> 35:40.840
not a beer.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.880
It doesn't taste like a beer quite, quite right.

35:42.880 --> 35:43.880
And you don't get buzzed.

35:43.880 --> 35:47.120
It's better than nothing, but it's not really meeting your need.

35:47.120 --> 35:52.760
And so the idea with this live tracker is not everybody can make it to Salt Lake City

35:52.760 --> 35:58.080
or Denver, but there is a lot of people in between those two locations.

35:58.080 --> 36:02.320
I'm leaving from the Seattle area and working my way out and my experience has always been

36:02.320 --> 36:05.600
people always want to know where you're at, what route you take in, and of course it's

36:05.600 --> 36:09.240
always changing when you're, anybody who does a lot of road trips, you know, things change.

36:09.240 --> 36:12.760
And so the live tracker, it sort of solves that problem.

36:12.760 --> 36:17.480
It gives people real time idea of where I'm at and then we can just do these micro meetups

36:17.480 --> 36:20.040
and just have in real life connections.

36:20.040 --> 36:24.200
Correct me if I'm wrong, but when the, when I used to be a part of JB, I remember there

36:24.200 --> 36:28.320
was a part where you had something like this before.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.240
Is this like a similar thing you're going to do?

36:30.240 --> 36:34.960
And if so, is there like an experience between like the software you use then versus now

36:34.960 --> 36:39.840
and like how it's interacted since the, you know, since the previous time?

36:39.840 --> 36:40.840
Yeah, right.

36:40.840 --> 36:41.840
Great question.

36:41.840 --> 36:47.120
Cause the previous iteration was based on this commercial truck tracking system called,

36:47.120 --> 36:48.480
this was the Rover tracker.

36:48.480 --> 36:49.480
Yeah, yeah.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.580
It was called like Lancy and Aaron.

36:51.580 --> 36:56.440
It's really designed for shipping companies who want to track their trucks.

36:56.440 --> 37:01.880
And so the nice thing about that is there's a hardware device that has its own cellular

37:01.880 --> 37:02.880
connection.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.280
And of course it's a crappy cellular connection, but they have its own and you can just stick

37:06.280 --> 37:10.760
it on your dash and it just runs and it just updates their maps.

37:10.760 --> 37:16.180
The problem is, as you would expect, it's some old clunky commercial product that has

37:16.180 --> 37:22.440
an expensive subscription and the map is antiquated and you can't really do much with it and you

37:22.440 --> 37:23.600
can't self host it.

37:23.600 --> 37:27.600
And so those were like, those, those are just like all the things that just kind of, I never

37:27.600 --> 37:32.800
liked about it, but it solved the core problem of, of location tracking in an embeddable

37:32.800 --> 37:33.800
map.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.400
But we wanted something this time around.

37:35.400 --> 37:38.240
Like if we're going to build it again, we wanted to self host it.

37:38.240 --> 37:40.840
We wanted to have no monthly subscription.

37:40.840 --> 37:45.880
And then what's really nice about own tracks is it, it gives a lot of different types of

37:45.880 --> 37:49.840
data output that we can use to automate and use for different things.

37:49.840 --> 37:57.360
So it provides like a very rich set of API options for you to pull information out of.

37:57.360 --> 38:01.600
And it's all controllable by what information gets shared and how it gets shared.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.640
And it's something that we can run privately.

38:03.640 --> 38:06.380
Like I don't mind if West sees all of my location data, right?

38:06.380 --> 38:10.840
But I wouldn't necessarily want that in maybe some commercial cloud service anymore.

38:10.840 --> 38:13.520
Like my, my, my preference has changed there.

38:13.520 --> 38:18.440
And then I like the idea too, of using that data to drive automations here at the studio.

38:18.440 --> 38:21.880
You turn on lights when I arrive, just even cycle the fans.

38:21.880 --> 38:26.760
Cause of course I've geeked out all the cooling I bought for the summer is all on smart plugs

38:26.760 --> 38:30.020
that are controlled by home assistant and all of that stuff could be automated when

38:30.020 --> 38:31.640
home assistant knows my location.

38:31.640 --> 38:32.640
Yeah.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.640
And that's where it's neat.

38:33.640 --> 38:38.640
The recorder app can act as like you, you can send HTTP updates from your phone and

38:38.640 --> 38:43.760
then it can publish those updates to an MQTT topic that then home assistant can be configured

38:43.760 --> 38:47.560
or open have a lot of these systems can be configured to read from and then pull in those

38:47.560 --> 38:48.560
updates.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.720
So we haven't actually tried that yet, but seems promising.

38:51.720 --> 38:52.720
It's very interesting.

38:52.720 --> 38:56.520
It sounds like you could take this and because it's with home assistant, you could do all

38:56.520 --> 38:58.640
sorts of stuff with this data.

38:58.640 --> 39:03.640
Like when you just get room somewhat close to your house, you could be like setting it

39:03.640 --> 39:08.720
up so that your thermostat turns on and make sure it's the pristine, perfect temperature

39:08.720 --> 39:11.400
or whatever, like those kinds of things.

39:11.400 --> 39:15.920
And it does seem like a very, I'm looking forward to seeing how it works out for you.

39:15.920 --> 39:21.200
I mean, I probably wouldn't do it myself because of effort, but it does sound very interesting.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.800
Well, you know, a lot of this I made West do.

39:23.800 --> 39:27.320
I always have to disclaim that, that, you know, a lot of the heavy lifting was done

39:27.320 --> 39:30.360
by West and you know, he's got a lot of other stuff going on too.

39:30.360 --> 39:32.360
It's not the only thing he's doing and he still does.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.360
He still gets it done.

39:33.360 --> 39:37.280
I just like seeing you turn your home into an experiment and then I get to see when it

39:37.280 --> 39:40.800
goes well and we all get to hear about when it goes very poorly.

39:40.800 --> 39:41.940
Fair, fair.

39:41.940 --> 39:46.880
So if anyone out in the community would like to help me build this colony tracker dot live

39:46.880 --> 39:51.600
page, I'd love to do it in Hugo and I'd love to work with somebody on that and mentor me.

39:51.600 --> 39:55.800
But if you want to build it with anything you want, as long as I don't care, I don't

39:55.800 --> 39:56.800
have to be involved.

39:56.800 --> 39:57.800
I don't have to go your way.

39:57.800 --> 40:02.120
But I'd love either some mentorship on building a site for this or if somebody has a passion

40:02.120 --> 40:06.560
that they could just crank something out and wants to help us create a page with some information,

40:06.560 --> 40:09.880
we could put some branding on there, you know, get a little information out there for everybody.

40:09.880 --> 40:14.320
Please contact me, Chris at Jupiter broadcasting dot com or use our contact page because I

40:14.320 --> 40:16.280
think that could be something really fun.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.040
And you know, it doesn't have to be Hugo.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.280
West knows behind the scenes for about six months.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.520
I keep trying to work Hugo into just about every episode.

40:22.520 --> 40:26.000
We've snuck into a few places here and there, but I don't think you've quite got it out

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
of your system yet.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
No.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.120
And it's not a bad thing to plug in because Hugo is a very nice CMS.

40:32.120 --> 40:34.960
I think it's quite a good static site gen.

40:34.960 --> 40:38.660
The fact that you can do so much of it at the command line, like, you know, that really

40:38.660 --> 40:42.840
got me is like, I love that that you generate it at the command line and all of that.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.280
And there's a lot of great themes out there.

40:44.280 --> 40:47.840
It just seems like it's a pretty solid, like you said, CMS and then it regenerates super

40:47.840 --> 40:48.840
fast pages.

40:48.840 --> 40:53.680
Yeah, it's a static site generating CMS and it's there's other things that do very similar

40:53.680 --> 40:54.680
stuff.

40:54.680 --> 40:59.640
So I'd say it's probably in out of all of the hundreds that exist, I would put it maybe

40:59.640 --> 41:01.400
in the top three.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.360
I'm also very picky about these things.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.720
So I don't want to be like, oh, it's the best.

41:06.720 --> 41:10.240
So it's I'm just saying it's definitely up there for sure.

41:10.240 --> 41:15.000
But I think that there is a question that everybody is going to have to ask you about

41:15.000 --> 41:18.600
this data that you're doing with the colony tracker.

41:18.600 --> 41:21.120
And that is how much of it is going to Muse group?

41:21.120 --> 41:23.320
Yeah, I have to sign a CLA too.

41:23.320 --> 41:29.160
I don't understand why West was just really, really adamant that I signed the CLA.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.240
You didn't read it too closely.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.240
I'm glad of that.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.720
Now I just signed it.

41:32.720 --> 41:33.720
Yeah, that's true.

41:33.720 --> 41:34.720
That's true.

41:34.720 --> 41:39.160
I feel like the trick will be to turn it off when I don't want to be tracked off to remember

41:39.160 --> 41:40.160
to do that.

41:40.160 --> 41:43.600
But I was thinking the nice thing about having it on the Android phone is if we get this

41:43.600 --> 41:47.480
working, I could put the you know, my pixel in my pocket and go to the meetup.

41:47.480 --> 41:51.640
And then if people want to know where the meetup is, they just check the colony tracker

41:51.640 --> 41:52.640
and go there.

41:52.640 --> 41:55.440
So you have your like personal device and then your I want to be tracked device.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.440
I like it.

41:56.440 --> 41:57.440
Yeah.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.880
And I'll probably often just leave it in the RV and you can track us as we go and telegram

42:00.880 --> 42:03.160
me and we can set up something.

42:03.160 --> 42:08.320
But I figured if I wanted to go out to lunch and was totally cool with people showing up,

42:08.320 --> 42:12.360
I just take it with me and maybe just tweet or I don't know, I haven't figured that part

42:12.360 --> 42:13.360
out yet.

42:13.360 --> 42:16.440
Honestly, this is where YouTube would be a lot easier.

42:16.440 --> 42:19.480
Like if I was doing YouTube videos or something, I could just pop on my channel and say, Hey,

42:19.480 --> 42:20.480
I'm doing this.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.480
I've thought about that.

42:21.480 --> 42:22.480
That's a lot of work.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.480
That's a lot of work.

42:23.480 --> 42:24.480
Wes, get on it.

42:24.480 --> 42:25.480
Yeah.

42:25.480 --> 42:26.480
Wes.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.480
Seems like a good idea.

42:27.480 --> 42:28.480
All right.

42:28.480 --> 42:33.760
Well, you're going to have to give me a remote camera access.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.560
Linux dot entropy dot works.

42:35.560 --> 42:38.480
Use promo code love 13 and save 15 percent.

42:38.480 --> 42:42.600
You know, entropy is an industry leading mobile and web development studio based out of the

42:42.600 --> 42:43.600
UK.

42:43.600 --> 42:48.080
And they contacted me because they're listeners of the show and they have been building out

42:48.080 --> 42:53.480
clients around the world, including Mars Wrigley, Walmart, MediaCom, the Financial Times.

42:53.480 --> 42:55.700
And they want to reach out to the community members.

42:55.700 --> 42:58.120
It's not just about the big companies.

42:58.120 --> 43:01.080
They want to reach out to everyone and build a brand.

43:01.080 --> 43:04.960
They want to be known for building Flutter applications and developing applications for

43:04.960 --> 43:11.000
Linux, for the Mac, for Windows and even for the Web.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.680
You know, they run their whole shop on Linux.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.920
There are a bunch of Linux hardware geeks in particular.

43:15.920 --> 43:19.040
They love love playing around with that kind of stuff.

43:19.040 --> 43:23.640
And some of their team, some of their team, I've been told they hang out.

43:23.640 --> 43:26.800
They've got their distros of choice and that's where they they stay there.

43:26.800 --> 43:32.360
But there is absolutely like a distro hopper contingent on the team that's constantly jumping

43:32.360 --> 43:34.800
around and trying out the different distros.

43:34.800 --> 43:37.680
So they have a long standing connection back to the Linux community.

43:37.680 --> 43:42.120
A lot of their tooling is built around Ruby and of course, Flutter for mobile and the

43:42.120 --> 43:43.120
desktop.

43:43.120 --> 43:47.920
I mean, they they really are emphasizing when their clients come to them that, yes, we build

43:47.920 --> 43:48.920
for the Linux desktop.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.640
Would you like to build an app for the Linux desktop?

43:50.640 --> 43:54.700
And I love hearing that, you know, somebody has to push that forward.

43:54.700 --> 43:59.240
And they've pioneered some of the most complex Flutter apps that have ever really been built,

43:59.240 --> 44:04.960
including Flutter apps that have image recognition and machine learning built into them.

44:04.960 --> 44:09.480
And Entropy can rapidly build an app for iOS, Android and Windows and Mac OS.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.760
And yes, of course, the Linux desktop in essentially no time.

44:12.760 --> 44:16.860
They're already one of the global leaders in Flutter development with dozens of deployments

44:16.860 --> 44:19.040
in just the last year alone.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.980
I think we all see where this is going.

44:20.980 --> 44:24.960
It gives us an opportunity to find something that's better than Electron.

44:24.960 --> 44:28.880
It still delivers on that multi-platform delivery promise.

44:28.880 --> 44:33.180
And thankfully, it puts Linux right there at the front of the line with Canonical and

44:33.180 --> 44:34.960
Google backing that.

44:34.960 --> 44:37.480
There's a good shot that's going to be around for a while and that's going to go places.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.680
And I think Entropy sees that and they're ready to start building apps for people.

44:40.680 --> 44:45.280
Wes and I had an app idea for a Flutter app that takes advantage of PipeWire that just

44:45.280 --> 44:47.240
like can list the process IDs.

44:47.240 --> 44:50.660
You select the process ID and it can grab the audio using PipeWire.

44:50.660 --> 44:52.760
You could build that out in Flutter.

44:52.760 --> 44:53.760
It'd be a great app.

44:53.760 --> 44:58.280
In fact, Entropy would love to discuss any ideas you might have and just chat with you

44:58.280 --> 44:59.880
about the Linux desktop in general.

44:59.880 --> 45:04.800
Regardless if it moves forward into a project, they just love to get in touch and chat.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.300
That'd be an opportunity to geek out.

45:07.300 --> 45:11.860
So get started by going to linux.entropy.works, fill out the contact form, and use the promo

45:11.860 --> 45:13.480
code LUP13.

45:13.480 --> 45:17.720
You'll also save a little money when you do that if you do end up starting a project.

45:17.720 --> 45:19.520
There's never any pressure.

45:19.520 --> 45:25.600
They're always just happy to chat and discuss Linux and chat about Goofy Chris on the Unplugged

45:25.600 --> 45:26.600
program.

45:26.600 --> 45:27.600
They'll do that too.

45:27.600 --> 45:35.680
So go check them out and use promo code LUP13, linux.entropy.works.

45:35.680 --> 45:37.800
Well we've got some feedback.

45:37.800 --> 45:44.680
Michael Staggs over on Twitter tagged you wondering about the security of Deepin.

45:44.680 --> 45:49.540
He writes that, I know in the current political climate, China and security are both hot button

45:49.540 --> 45:55.600
issues, but I don't feel we can give Deepin a pass on security.

45:55.600 --> 46:00.520
It's so bad that the OpenSUSE audit team won't even audit their stuff anymore.

46:00.520 --> 46:01.960
Yeah, that's a shame.

46:01.960 --> 46:07.080
You know, so Michael, he tweeted me a couple of links to some bugs that are pretty concerning

46:07.080 --> 46:08.080
in Deepin.

46:08.080 --> 46:14.580
However, they're from 2019, and they're bugs on OpenSUSE's bug tracker, not on Deepin's.

46:14.580 --> 46:17.920
So it's entirely possible that that code isn't even being used or has been replaced, it's

46:17.920 --> 46:19.340
hard to say.

46:19.340 --> 46:23.440
But it is an interesting, you know, consideration.

46:23.440 --> 46:29.040
It's kind of off on its own island, and it could have its own particular security ramifications

46:29.040 --> 46:31.680
when you are creating your own new apps.

46:31.680 --> 46:37.280
I really, really, really wanted it to be like the distro I could recommend to new users

46:37.280 --> 46:42.800
because it's fresh and it's clean and it asks some great questions when you're setting it

46:42.800 --> 46:46.600
up that are simple and I think great questions to ask.

46:46.600 --> 46:51.440
And I thought, boy, wouldn't this be great, especially if they add Android app compatibility.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.880
But it is just too different.

46:53.880 --> 46:57.800
It's like running some crazy ass esoteric distro on your server and then, you know,

46:57.800 --> 47:00.280
walking away and expecting somebody else to pick it up.

47:00.280 --> 47:04.620
Like, I just can't in good faith say go for new users, deploy this unless you yourself

47:04.620 --> 47:06.400
are a Deepin user and you're helping them with it.

47:06.400 --> 47:07.400
Right.

47:07.400 --> 47:10.360
I mean, the farther away you step out of the mainstream, the more of that support burden

47:10.360 --> 47:12.120
you got to take on yourself.

47:12.120 --> 47:15.120
And especially if you're a new user, that's not really something you're capable of.

47:15.120 --> 47:18.280
I think what they're billing over there is really neat, but it's probably not the first

47:18.280 --> 47:19.760
distribution to recommend to new users.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.760
I spent about a week and a half with it.

47:21.760 --> 47:24.720
And so I decided now to wipe it off here.

47:24.720 --> 47:27.080
And I have put Fedora 34 on here.

47:27.080 --> 47:28.080
Let's see.

47:28.080 --> 47:32.760
I'm going to first boot right here, let's log in, see if Fedora rawhide.

47:32.760 --> 47:37.600
So I guess this is technically, I guess this is technically what Fedora 35, going to be

47:37.600 --> 47:40.360
Fedora 35 eventually.

47:40.360 --> 47:43.200
And I'm happy to report it looks like everything went good.

47:43.200 --> 47:45.400
The ThinkPad is now running rawhide with plasma.

47:45.400 --> 47:48.480
I want to see what version it is, though, because that's obviously all that matters

47:48.480 --> 47:49.480
here.

47:49.480 --> 47:51.040
That's the whole point of why you're doing this, right?

47:51.040 --> 47:53.560
It wasn't just for the freshest nano you could get.

47:53.560 --> 47:54.840
That's always a consideration.

47:54.840 --> 47:59.240
But I'll build it from source if I have to, whatever it takes to get the freshest nano.

47:59.240 --> 48:00.240
Whatever it takes.

48:00.240 --> 48:01.240
All right.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.520
So survey says I am on plasma 5.2.2.3.

48:03.520 --> 48:04.760
I'm happy with that.

48:04.760 --> 48:05.800
That's great.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.680
And I'm on Wayland.

48:07.680 --> 48:08.960
And it looks really good.

48:08.960 --> 48:09.960
It looks smooth.

48:09.960 --> 48:13.200
I think this is not a bad default to start with, at least.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.200
All right.

48:14.200 --> 48:17.440
Well, you just check back in after a couple of DNF updates.

48:17.440 --> 48:18.440
Yeah.

48:18.440 --> 48:19.960
Let's see how it goes.

48:19.960 --> 48:22.800
What could go wrong running rawhide on my laptop, right?

48:22.800 --> 48:27.040
One of the things I loved about when I switched to Fedora is that you can get the latest and

48:27.040 --> 48:30.400
greatest plasma without having to wait for the next release.

48:30.400 --> 48:32.920
It's not necessarily that that's coming to 35.

48:32.920 --> 48:37.480
That also might just come to 34 stable as soon as they're ready to take it out of rawhide.

48:37.480 --> 48:38.480
Generally, yes.

48:38.480 --> 48:43.360
However, the timing of things has worked out that the latest plasma isn't right.

48:43.360 --> 48:47.160
I mean, that was the whole thing that Neil convinced me of last week is that's where

48:47.160 --> 48:50.320
it all went sideways is the way the release windows are working out.

48:50.320 --> 48:52.340
It's going to be a long period of time.

48:52.340 --> 48:54.640
And so if you want fresh plasma, I knew it.

48:54.640 --> 48:55.640
Neil was to blame.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.760
Oh, it's totally Neil's fault with five twenty three.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.760
I know there's going to be a little bit of a little bit delay, but that, you know, I'm

49:00.760 --> 49:05.320
on five twenty two dot two and I'm like, I'm OK with that.

49:05.320 --> 49:06.320
Yeah.

49:06.320 --> 49:07.320
Yeah.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.320
Yeah.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.320
To be fair here, right?

49:09.320 --> 49:14.480
Like it's not like you're going to experience a huge gap because five twenty three itself

49:14.480 --> 49:20.160
doesn't even get branched from the development trees in plasma upstream until after Fedora

49:20.160 --> 49:22.880
Linux thirty five is branched downstream.

49:22.880 --> 49:28.940
So like the final release of plasma five twenty three doesn't happen until like I think it's

49:28.940 --> 49:33.920
a week or two weeks before Fedora Linux thirty five's GA, which is just too close to pull

49:33.920 --> 49:35.960
it in right away.

49:35.960 --> 49:40.780
And that just means that it'll get pulled in post GA and update like within two weeks

49:40.780 --> 49:42.300
or so afterwards.

49:42.300 --> 49:47.960
But if you are really feeling compelled to want the absolute latest and greatest, then

49:47.960 --> 49:52.040
Fedora Rawhide does, in fact, have it and we'll get it right away.

49:52.040 --> 49:54.800
But you take everything that goes with that, right?

49:54.800 --> 49:57.400
And that's that's really the core of it.

49:57.400 --> 50:01.000
Or you can use the the copper repos I mentioned earlier.

50:01.000 --> 50:07.560
One of our SIG members actually rebuilds everything from Rawhide for plasma for stable releases

50:07.560 --> 50:10.120
and you can activate those and do that.

50:10.120 --> 50:12.720
Man, you could have mentioned that before I installed Rawhide.

50:12.720 --> 50:13.720
I'm just saying.

50:13.720 --> 50:17.680
Well, Chris, I tried to tell you I tried.

50:17.680 --> 50:20.680
But you were you were on a kick was like, oh, yes.

50:20.680 --> 50:21.680
So is Rawhide any good?

50:21.680 --> 50:24.840
And you know me, I can't help it.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.280
I there's something wrong with me, dude.

50:26.280 --> 50:28.000
It's what drove me to Jen two years ago.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
It's still there.

50:29.000 --> 50:34.340
Well, you know, I have machines that run Rawhide because as a Fedora developer, like it makes

50:34.340 --> 50:37.600
some sense for me to at least have one or two that do it.

50:37.600 --> 50:39.520
And it's it's totally fine.

50:39.520 --> 50:44.920
Like I generally don't have issues with it these days, which sometimes can be kind of

50:44.920 --> 50:45.920
a disappointment.

50:45.920 --> 50:46.920
Yeah.

50:46.920 --> 50:47.920
Right.

50:47.920 --> 50:48.920
Yeah.

50:48.920 --> 50:49.920
But it works pretty well.

50:49.920 --> 50:54.280
Like the the major advantage of running Rawhide, at least from my perspective as someone who

50:54.280 --> 50:59.020
likes to help make the ecosystem better, is that you get the absolute latest Linux kernel

50:59.020 --> 51:03.960
in Mesa as they are coming and you can like before they're released.

51:03.960 --> 51:06.460
And so you can see how well it's working for your hardware.

51:06.460 --> 51:10.440
You can give feedback to the developers and they can actually do something useful about

51:10.440 --> 51:15.100
it to hopefully make it better sooner, because like by the time a release is out, like those

51:15.100 --> 51:16.560
merge windows have passed.

51:16.560 --> 51:19.360
And so it's it takes longer for fixes to come out.

51:19.360 --> 51:24.720
But if you're testing it as the get snapshots are landing in in Fedora or the RCS are landing

51:24.720 --> 51:30.880
in Fedora, Rawhide, then you have an opportunity to make sure that those things are fixed very

51:30.880 --> 51:31.880
quickly.

51:31.880 --> 51:34.480
It sounds like something I want to play with as well at this point.

51:34.480 --> 51:40.040
Now, I'm not typically the one who wants to like the bleeding edge kind of thing, but

51:40.040 --> 51:41.040
I do now.

51:41.040 --> 51:42.040
I do.

51:42.040 --> 51:43.320
Just don't do it on your production machine.

51:43.320 --> 51:44.320
You know, that's what I figured.

51:44.320 --> 51:46.520
Yeah, I'm not I'm not crazy enough to suggest that.

51:46.520 --> 51:47.520
Yeah.

51:47.520 --> 51:49.320
Meanwhile, my production systems are all on Ubuntu 18.04.

51:49.320 --> 51:50.320
It's pretty boring.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.320
I know.

51:51.320 --> 51:52.320
I know.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.320
All right.

51:53.320 --> 51:54.320
But with that, the cone of silence.

51:54.320 --> 51:57.320
Hey, Wes, come here for a second.

51:57.320 --> 51:58.320
Get in here.

51:58.320 --> 51:59.320
Is that you?

51:59.320 --> 52:00.320
The smell?

52:00.320 --> 52:01.640
I mean, yeah, I'm sorry about that.

52:01.640 --> 52:03.640
I'm surprised that hat fits in here.

52:03.640 --> 52:04.640
Jesus.

52:04.640 --> 52:08.040
Anyways, I wanted to let you know and I don't tell anybody else, but I know you've been

52:08.040 --> 52:10.760
wanting to up your credentials game.

52:10.760 --> 52:11.760
I know you.

52:11.760 --> 52:12.760
You talk about this all the time.

52:12.760 --> 52:14.320
You always want the latest certs.

52:14.320 --> 52:18.480
But our friends over to Cloud Guru have a course on Linux file sharing that helps you

52:18.480 --> 52:22.020
prepare for the LPIC two engineer exam.

52:22.020 --> 52:26.080
And in that course, they cover the basics, but also advanced configuration options for

52:26.080 --> 52:27.640
Samba and NFS.

52:27.640 --> 52:29.960
So I wanted to give you the link to this.

52:29.960 --> 52:30.960
I'll just put it in the show notes.

52:30.960 --> 52:33.240
I don't like I don't want to say it in the show because I don't want everybody to go

52:33.240 --> 52:35.400
get the certification and then, you know, take your job.

52:35.400 --> 52:38.360
Well, and it's a little embarrassing how bad I am at Samba can face.

52:38.360 --> 52:39.360
Right.

52:39.360 --> 52:42.240
I mean, yeah, because you can't just do test parm and get all the details.

52:42.240 --> 52:44.080
Anyways, I just thought you should maybe have the link.

52:44.080 --> 52:45.080
So I'll put it in the show notes.

52:45.080 --> 52:46.080
That's what I'll do.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.540
I'll put like in a cloud guru link in the show notes and then that'll take you to this

52:48.540 --> 52:49.540
Linux file sharing.

52:49.540 --> 52:50.540
Thank you.

52:50.540 --> 52:51.540
You're welcome.

52:51.540 --> 52:52.800
Just let's not mention it on the show.

52:52.800 --> 52:55.800
The cone of science.

52:55.800 --> 53:00.200
All right, well, that does bring us to the end of this week's episode.

53:00.200 --> 53:01.200
We'd love to hear from you.

53:01.200 --> 53:05.520
You can tweet us at Linux unplugged or go to Linux unplugged dot com slash contact.

53:05.520 --> 53:08.080
The whole network is at Jupiter signal over there.

53:08.080 --> 53:11.000
We do announcements, live streams, that kind of stuff.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.680
It's really kind of like our blow horn, but you can also send feedback at the Jupiter signal

53:14.680 --> 53:16.280
and we receive it there.

53:16.280 --> 53:20.800
Of course, there's lots of fantastic podcasts, including our sister show, Linux Action News,

53:20.800 --> 53:24.500
and the self hosted podcast over at Jupiter broadcasting dot com.

53:24.500 --> 53:26.440
Check out Linux Action News if you haven't.

53:26.440 --> 53:30.320
We've been discussing the audacity story from the very beginning over there.

53:30.320 --> 53:32.780
And last but not least, we'd love to have you join us live.

53:32.780 --> 53:34.720
We do this here podcast on a Tuesday.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.520
Join us at 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m.

53:36.520 --> 53:37.520
Eastern.

53:37.520 --> 53:38.520
See you next week.

53:38.520 --> 53:39.520
Same bad time.

53:39.520 --> 53:41.240
Same bad station.

53:41.240 --> 53:43.440
Yes, make it a Linux Tuesday.

53:43.440 --> 53:44.600
Why not join the mumble room?

53:44.600 --> 53:47.360
Then you get a low latency audio stream.

53:47.360 --> 53:51.920
And the fun thing about that is if you're on Linux and you connect using mumble, the

53:51.920 --> 53:55.760
entire stack end to end is free software because we're doing it right here on Linux

53:55.760 --> 53:57.000
two using mumble.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.220
You connect, you get low latency, real time audio, and you're doing it all with free software.

54:01.220 --> 54:03.840
And it's also one of the best sounding ways to catch the show.

54:03.840 --> 54:07.400
That is at Linux unplugged dot com slash mumble and you just join us and hang out and then

54:07.400 --> 54:08.400
you're ready for the look plug too.

54:08.400 --> 54:09.680
It's kind of great.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.920
It's like a power move for the show.

54:11.920 --> 54:15.880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the unplugged program.

54:15.880 --> 54:17.220
We're not going to see you here tomorrow.

54:17.220 --> 54:45.440
We won't see you the next day, but we will see you next Tuesday.

54:47.220 --> 55:03.920
I was enjoying a nice sea of this Tuesday, see you next Tuesday, one beer and I'm just

55:03.920 --> 55:05.120
totally scrambled now.

55:05.120 --> 55:06.720
It's like that thing really hits.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.320
We'll see you every Tuesday.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.800
Yeah, that's true.

55:09.800 --> 55:10.800
That's what I should say.

55:10.800 --> 55:13.440
You know, I still have that burn from the steam valve.

55:13.440 --> 55:19.000
Man, you know, I kind of expected this this rawhide thing to be kind of a train wreck.

55:19.000 --> 55:23.600
But man, you know, the default plasma setup after all, because I've just tried so many

55:23.600 --> 55:29.280
different desktop environments recently from Windows 11 to deepen to cosmic.

55:29.280 --> 55:33.720
And now to just throw plasma on rawhide on here.

55:33.720 --> 55:36.400
It's so simple and straightforward now.

55:36.400 --> 55:41.200
It's like plasma has become the just simple, obvious, straightforward UI.

55:41.200 --> 55:42.200
It's weird.

55:42.200 --> 55:45.120
Welcome to my side.

55:45.120 --> 55:49.120
This reminds me of a conversation we had like seven years ago or something.

55:49.120 --> 55:50.120
Yeah.

55:50.120 --> 55:51.120
Yeah.

55:51.120 --> 55:54.200
Well, you know, 40, 40 was compelling for a while, especially on a laptop.

55:54.200 --> 55:55.360
I really like where they're going.

55:55.360 --> 55:56.800
But then I read this.

55:56.800 --> 56:01.520
I read this great piece that Joey wrote for OMG Ubuntu about where the genome sees its

56:01.520 --> 56:02.520
future going.

56:02.520 --> 56:05.960
And I just looked at that and I thought, yeah, OK, that settles it for me.

56:05.960 --> 56:07.920
Plasma is the desktop environment for me.

56:07.920 --> 56:12.760
I am definitely and clearly and now it has been explained to me in multiple ways.

56:12.760 --> 56:38.880
I am not the target user for that desktop environment, and that's OK.
