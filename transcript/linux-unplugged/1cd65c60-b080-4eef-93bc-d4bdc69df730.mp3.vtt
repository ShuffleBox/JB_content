WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
So, Wes, you caught this one. Maybe we could talk about this on the pre-show here.

00:03.600 --> 00:05.360
Cheapoo? Is that how you say it?

00:06.240 --> 00:07.440
Yeah, I have no idea how to say it.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.640
Take a shot of that one.

00:08.640 --> 00:09.280
Shepow?

00:09.280 --> 00:10.080
Shepoo?

00:10.080 --> 00:11.840
Shepow. Oh, let's go with Shepow.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.040
That's the most fun way, I think.

00:13.040 --> 00:21.200
So, Shepow 23 Beta 2 is out, and Shepow is another remake of the Fedora project.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.600
And I normally don't cover all these derivatives, but I've...

00:23.600 --> 00:25.760
How did they... Oh, the 23 comes from Fedora.

00:25.760 --> 00:26.320
Yeah, exactly.

00:26.320 --> 00:30.560
How did they get to version 23 without me having ever heard of it or known how to pronounce it?

00:30.560 --> 00:31.040
Magic.

00:31.040 --> 00:31.840
Throw version on steroids.

00:31.840 --> 00:35.040
Magic. No, yeah, it's... Yeah, because they're just basing on Fedora 23.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.560
Here's why I think this is noteworthy.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.840
Because remember how, like, before, a couple of releases ago,

00:39.840 --> 00:42.160
like, nobody was basing stuff off Fedora anymore?

00:42.160 --> 00:42.480
Yeah.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.160
And now we've got a few of them.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.400
And so these guys, they have themselves one of them good-looking desktops.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.960
They've gone ahead and made things actually look usable.

00:50.960 --> 00:56.560
And like most respins of Fedora, you get your third-party content, like your codecs

00:56.560 --> 00:59.760
and your Adobe flashes and your DVD and Blu-rays.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.760
You also got the curation.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.440
And they say it's gaming-ready.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.400
What do you think, Wes?

01:04.400 --> 01:05.600
What did you think when you first found this one?

01:05.600 --> 01:06.320
Gaming-ready?

01:06.320 --> 01:09.120
You know, I was just surprised I hadn't heard of it before.

01:09.120 --> 01:09.680
But you're right.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.960
I do like to see more things based on Fedora because, I don't know,

01:12.960 --> 01:15.360
I think to some users still, they're just just installing Fedora.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.600
There's kind of a lot you have to do still to make it...

01:17.600 --> 01:20.080
If you're used to something, you know, like Mint or something where you have

01:20.080 --> 01:22.560
everything installed, it's ready to go, you can kind of get whatever you want.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.600
Fedora takes a little more work.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.920
So if this is like a really nice, polished...

01:25.920 --> 01:27.200
You know who this would be good for?

01:27.200 --> 01:29.520
You know who this would be really good for in like three, four, five years,

01:29.520 --> 01:30.640
maybe just a couple of years even?

01:30.640 --> 01:31.520
It's like Noah's kid.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.080
Yeah, right.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.520
Because Noah loves that Fedora.

01:33.520 --> 01:38.480
And so BXNT in the chat room says that it's Shupow?

01:38.480 --> 01:38.960
Shupow?

01:38.960 --> 01:39.440
How do you...

01:39.440 --> 01:40.240
Chapeau.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.680
Chapeau, which is hat in French.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.720
Yeah, it's French for hat.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.280
Yeah, there you go.

01:43.280 --> 01:49.760
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 120 for November 24th, 2015.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.960
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that encourages you to...

02:04.960 --> 02:06.000
Come on now.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Encourages you to brine that turkey.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.160
Wes, my name is Chris.

02:10.160 --> 02:10.960
My name is Wes.

02:10.960 --> 02:11.680
I know that.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.240
You know that?

02:12.240 --> 02:12.480
Yes.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.920
I'm sitting right here. You've seen me before.

02:13.920 --> 02:16.240
Listen, Wes, we have a huge show. It's a holiday week.

02:16.240 --> 02:21.360
And we thought what we would do is get ourselves a little eggnog,

02:22.320 --> 02:25.440
pour ourselves a drink, and have one of the biggest shows of the year.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.200
That's what we thought we would do for this episode.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.160
Stuff ourselves, you know?

02:28.160 --> 02:29.680
Everyone else will be doing it later this week.

02:29.680 --> 02:29.920
Yeah.

02:29.920 --> 02:30.800
Getting started early.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.440
We did have a little bit of bird tirade on the pre-show.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.280
So for those of you that are joining us live,

02:35.280 --> 02:39.680
I hope you enjoyed the warm up session where apparently I went on a complete rant against

02:39.680 --> 02:42.720
having birds, but that is not going to make it into the show.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.880
This is a Linux show, believe it or not.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.560
Yeah, we're going to talk about Linux and open source things.

02:46.560 --> 02:50.560
And to that end, one of the gentlemen from the Vivaldi project

02:50.560 --> 02:52.720
is joining us, a new browser out for the Linux desktop.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.520
After that, we're going to talk about Solus.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.520
We're going to have the developer of the Solus project on here

02:57.520 --> 03:00.240
and talk about his desktops inspired by a bird's name,

03:00.240 --> 03:01.920
hence the rant earlier in the show.

03:01.920 --> 03:06.080
And then, later in the show today, listen, I love Linux.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.120
I love open source.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.480
We've all been here a long time.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.760
GIMP just hit 20 years old.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.720
LibreOffice just got a thousand developers.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.960
Big milestone, hit a thousand developers.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.440
But let's be honest, these projects are still not good enough.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.560
GIMP still isn't there yet.

03:22.560 --> 03:23.680
Doesn't have CMYK support.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.040
Doesn't have non-destructive editing.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.320
It's still not competitive with Photoshop after 20 years.

03:28.320 --> 03:33.440
Is it time to just admit that sometimes open source projects are never going to get there?

03:33.440 --> 03:36.080
LibreOffice, a thousand developers, getting better all the time,

03:36.080 --> 03:38.960
but still maybe not competitive with Microsoft Office.

03:38.960 --> 03:39.920
How many developers?

03:39.920 --> 03:42.480
How many years does it take until open source software

03:42.480 --> 03:45.680
can actually compete with the commercial alternative?

03:45.680 --> 03:48.560
Or have I got it all wrong?

03:48.560 --> 03:51.920
We'll talk about that coming up at the end of today's episode of Linux Unplugged.

03:51.920 --> 03:52.800
So no bird talk.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.160
None of that, Wes.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.600
Except for I do highly encourage you to brine your turkey.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.160
Well, of course.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.440
Yeah, that makes it delicious.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.520
Go look up Alton Brown's recipe.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.240
It's really good.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.080
Hey, we've got a great mumble room.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.960
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Dug.

04:06.960 --> 04:07.460
Hello.

04:07.460 --> 04:07.960
Hello.

04:07.960 --> 04:08.460
Hello.

04:08.460 --> 04:08.960
Hello.

04:08.960 --> 04:09.460
Hello.

04:09.460 --> 04:09.960
Hello.

04:09.960 --> 04:10.460
Hello.

04:10.460 --> 04:10.960
Hello.

04:10.960 --> 04:11.600
OK.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.080
I got to know.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.840
Poppy, how do you always manage to be the first?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.200
Like, what do you do exactly?

04:16.000 --> 04:16.960
I'm in your head.

04:16.960 --> 04:17.280
OK.

04:17.280 --> 04:18.560
I mean, that's what I thought.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.760
That's exactly what I thought.

04:19.760 --> 04:19.920
All right.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.840
Well, we have a couple of stories I wanted to follow up on

04:21.840 --> 04:25.680
that are kind of big news that have broken since the Linux action show was on the air.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.600
And let's start with the first one here.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.960
AMD's got something for your face, an open source driver.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.000
It's been released and supports the latest AMD GPUs.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.800
The announcement has been made on the Xorg announcing mailing list

04:36.800 --> 04:38.800
from, obviously, the Xorg Foundation.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.840
And according to, I'm going to call Mr. Dan.

04:41.840 --> 04:46.640
According to Mr. Dan, the brand new XF86 video AMD GPU driver,

04:46.640 --> 04:51.200
version 1.00 driver, has been forked from the open source project.

04:51.200 --> 04:56.400
And it has been, if you have Linux kernel 4.2, which has the new AMD GPU kernel driver,

04:57.040 --> 05:00.800
then, Wes, a good batch, and I think they're in the SoftPD article they mentioned,

05:00.800 --> 05:05.520
a good batch of the current Radeon cards are now supported by this totally open source driver.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.360
Do you see the list there?

05:09.280 --> 05:09.760
Here you go.

05:09.760 --> 05:10.560
It's this paragraph right there.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.200
What's that say there?

05:11.760 --> 05:12.240
Oh, yeah.

05:12.240 --> 05:12.480
OK.

05:13.520 --> 05:20.240
XF86 video AMD GPU 1.0 currently supports AMD GPUs from the Fiji, Carrizo, Tonga, Stoney,

05:20.240 --> 05:20.800
and Iceland.

05:20.800 --> 05:21.280
There it is.

05:21.280 --> 05:21.680
There it is.

05:21.680 --> 05:21.840
Yeah.

05:21.840 --> 05:28.640
So if you've got an AMD GPU in that range of cards and you've got Linux kernel 4.2,

05:28.640 --> 05:30.640
this is some pretty exciting stuff.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.280
This is some stuff that really NVIDIA hasn't even gotten to yet.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.280
And it's stuff that we've been covering in the news on the Linux action show for like

05:37.280 --> 05:38.320
a year now.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.360
And I think we're all kind of wondering, like, OK, they've talked about doing it,

05:41.360 --> 05:43.440
but when are we going to see the code shipping?

05:43.440 --> 05:45.040
So here's another piece of that.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.360
And Aiki, you're mentioning that 4.3 of the Linux kernel also has some more AMD GPU stuff.

05:49.360 --> 05:49.920
What's that about?

05:51.360 --> 05:53.920
So I was recently updating the kernel inside of Solus.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.800
There's a lot more changes made for basically more devices in the 4.3 kernel.

05:58.800 --> 06:03.040
And it's going to be replacing the old ancient defunct driver, which I'm just trying to find

06:03.040 --> 06:04.480
out exactly how old it is.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.040
One second.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.160
The ancient one, huh?

06:08.720 --> 06:09.520
What do you think, Wes?

06:09.520 --> 06:12.720
Well, yeah, my understanding is that at least part of what this article talking about is

06:12.720 --> 06:16.960
the X specific component of the driver, you know, where there's also a kernel part and

06:16.960 --> 06:18.240
then the Mesa part as well.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.200
And so we need all of those components to come together so that we can have a functioning

06:23.200 --> 06:25.360
AMD open source graphics.

06:25.360 --> 06:33.040
So this really could take the process of getting a semi-recent AMD GPU from one of the more

06:33.040 --> 06:37.520
challenging processes to get full 3D support to potentially works right out of the box.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.800
I wonder if we'll see more support, you know, I mean, I think a lot of people, the people

06:40.800 --> 06:45.600
interested in gaming on Linux kind of tend to skew to NVIDIA these days, you know, maybe

06:45.600 --> 06:46.560
pretty strongly.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.760
I wonder if this can shake that up.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.280
Yeah, yeah.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.880
And also, could there be some other work cases?

06:52.880 --> 06:56.240
You know, because I can very clearly see NVIDIA's reason.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.080
NVIDIA has got their proprietary driver.

06:58.080 --> 07:03.760
They have a lot of certain types of work cases that offload the different types of processing

07:03.760 --> 07:07.120
to the GPU that the Linux desktop is great for different institutions.

07:07.120 --> 07:12.240
I don't, AMD has those same capabilities, but I don't know if things like the, I mean,

07:12.240 --> 07:14.160
it seems everything's like focused on CUDA these days.

07:14.160 --> 07:20.160
And I think AMD GPUs are more open CL, which is great, but I don't really, I don't know

07:20.160 --> 07:24.400
what the big work case scenario is in the enterprise for AMD GPUs.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.440
Maybe it's editing.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.720
I'm not sure.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.800
Aiki, did you find the info you were looking for?

07:31.520 --> 07:35.840
So I had an update in 2014, another release today, so that was once a year.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.720
So you can see, really, there wasn't a lot of effort going on in there.

07:38.720 --> 07:39.680
Yeah, no kidding.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.440
To be fair, it's better than the Nova driver.

07:41.440 --> 07:45.280
I mean, that's ancient, and everyone's having to use Git build, so fair play to AMD for

07:45.280 --> 07:46.720
actually maintaining something.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.680
Yeah, yeah.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.760
And while we're talking about the display stack, kind of a fork from that topic.

07:52.480 --> 07:56.080
Fedora is seeking for some testers on Wayland.

07:56.080 --> 08:00.000
You know, they're getting serious about shipping Wayland in Fedora 24 workstation.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.440
It's become the default option already in Rawhide, the rolling development version of

08:03.440 --> 08:08.160
Fedora, but the plans are not yet carved in stone for Fedora 24 to actually ship with

08:08.160 --> 08:10.800
Wayland, despite what's been reported by a lot of places online.

08:10.800 --> 08:17.360
And really, it kind of comes down to us.

08:17.360 --> 08:21.360
Before GNOME on Wayland becomes the default in Fedora, we need to ensure the transition

08:21.360 --> 08:26.320
is smooth, says the Fedora Magazine site, and the users won't recognize a difference.

08:26.320 --> 08:31.520
Now, that's a high bar to set, and I'm sure it's probably the same exact bar Canonical

08:31.520 --> 08:32.240
must have set.

08:32.240 --> 08:39.600
So we need reports on deficiencies that occur on Wayland, but not X11, and I have it linked

08:39.600 --> 08:41.600
in the show notes, too.

08:41.600 --> 08:45.520
They have a queue, well, a guide, really.

08:45.520 --> 08:49.520
The Fedora QA team has written up a comprehensive guide on how to debug Wayland-related problems.

08:49.520 --> 08:56.480
So if you want to see this happen, this is a real way you, as an end user, could actually

08:56.480 --> 08:59.200
participate in the adoption of Wayland.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.040
You could go follow these links in the show notes.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.800
You could read their QA guide.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.640
And I'm willing to bet this comprehensive guide is probably just good reading in general.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.040
Yeah, probably.

09:07.040 --> 09:07.360
You know what?

09:07.360 --> 09:08.400
Especially if you're interested in Fedora.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.600
I got it linked right here.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.640
Let me go see if I can find it.

09:10.640 --> 09:15.040
I'm kind of curious to see what they actually say, because this could be one of those things

09:15.040 --> 09:16.880
that could really apply to a lot of things.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.080
And it's really kind of nice that they did this.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.840
So this is over on the Fedora Project Wiki.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.920
How to debug Wayland problems.

09:22.960 --> 09:23.360
Here you go.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.920
They say Wayland is intended as a simpler replacement for X11.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.600
It changes the design of the Linux desktop architecture.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.840
That's good background information for you.

09:29.840 --> 09:30.960
Yeah, exactly.

09:30.960 --> 09:35.200
And so they have tips in here for reporting issues and looking for similar reports, how

09:35.200 --> 09:39.520
to file a bug, information to include in your bug report, debugging the gnome shell.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.720
See, OK, well, all those first few things are going to be good for anything, right?

09:42.720 --> 09:46.720
Debugging mutter, known issues, frequent complaints, and fundamental changes.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.400
It's also really good so you're not creating dupes and things like that.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.600
It's like a really good reference just for people transitioning or looking to transition

09:51.600 --> 09:52.080
to Wayland.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.200
Yeah, I think this is nice.

09:53.200 --> 09:58.480
And this is what's really cool about when Microsoft dumps their new Windows 10 in your

09:58.480 --> 10:01.440
face and tells you it's the best thing ever, and Apple tells you the next thing is magical.

10:01.440 --> 10:02.880
I thought it was the best thing ever.

10:03.440 --> 10:04.640
That's why we're using it here, right?

10:04.640 --> 10:06.400
Well, maybe eventually they can get it there.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.080
But in the meantime, this is something we as end users could actually go participate

10:10.080 --> 10:10.560
in today.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.480
I like that quite a bit.

10:12.480 --> 10:17.280
And regardless of what distro you run, I would assume some of the work done here is going

10:17.280 --> 10:19.120
to also help other distributions.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.480
So it's a nice place to go.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.120
And we'll have links for that information in the show notes if you guys want to get

10:23.120 --> 10:23.920
involved on that.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.040
I just like that kind of stuff.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.320
Yeah, it's nice to see.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.960
And Fedora's doing a great job of trying to push things like that.

10:28.960 --> 10:29.360
Yeah.

10:29.360 --> 10:33.120
Wes, you found a kickass guy that looks really nice.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.520
He even has some stuff in here for the Mac users.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.760
But this is the art of the command line.

10:37.760 --> 10:43.040
You know, like the meta overview, the basics, everyday use, processing files and data, system

10:43.040 --> 10:47.760
debugging, one liners, obscure but useful commands, and then crap just for the Mac users,

10:47.760 --> 10:49.120
resources, and all kinds of stuff.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.800
The art of the command line.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.320
And I started reading some of this.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.960
And this is a really nice guy.

10:54.960 --> 10:55.920
You know, it's pretty in-depth.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.920
It looks like it's been well worked over, you know, kind of only the things that need

10:59.920 --> 11:00.960
to be there are there.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.360
But there's a lot of stuff for, I think, any level of user.

11:03.360 --> 11:08.800
I also like seeing, you know, like one of the things they have the HTTP IE program,

11:08.800 --> 11:11.280
which is like a curl alternative that's a little easier for interactive.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.480
Maybe you're doing like a RESTful JSON API kind of stuff.

11:14.480 --> 11:18.400
They have a lot of these modern tools worked in with the classic Unix examples, which is

11:18.400 --> 11:18.960
really nice.

11:18.960 --> 11:19.920
Yeah, that is cool.

11:19.920 --> 11:23.440
And it's, you know, it's a nice resource that I was looking at the edits.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.480
It's getting updated fairly frequently, which is nice.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.440
So you can check it out.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.160
We'll have a link to that.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.200
The art of the command line.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.200
You could probably also Google and find it.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.680
It is posted up on GitHub and it is all formatted in.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.040
Markdown.

11:35.040 --> 11:35.920
That's right, sir.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.480
That's right.

11:36.480 --> 11:36.960
Very good.

11:36.960 --> 11:37.920
Very good.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.160
So Wes, you're a trooper this week.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.200
You have in here.

11:41.200 --> 11:41.680
What is this?

11:41.680 --> 11:45.520
Is this is this actually a Sputnik or, you know, it looks like it's one of the Sputnik

11:45.520 --> 11:45.840
series.

11:45.840 --> 11:46.640
You know, it might be.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.160
I'm I'm actually not sure.

11:48.160 --> 11:48.880
I didn't ask.

11:48.880 --> 11:49.760
It looks just like it.

11:49.760 --> 11:50.160
But it does.

11:50.160 --> 11:50.800
It was actually.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.560
Yes, I think it must be because on Dell's website, they have it listed with the.

11:54.560 --> 11:59.440
So he's got one of these one of these Dell laptops here, like the Sputnik line.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.280
And for this week, you've installed what on there?

12:04.240 --> 12:06.880
Velt OS, Velt OS.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.760
And Velt.io is their website.

12:09.760 --> 12:10.240
Yes, sir.

12:10.240 --> 12:14.320
And we're going to talk to Ike about that in a little bit to see what he thinks about

12:14.320 --> 12:15.120
this.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.800
But Wes has been trying out a bunch of different things.

12:16.800 --> 12:17.440
And you know what?

12:17.440 --> 12:19.600
I love it because a lot of times you come in and you've been trying out a different

12:19.600 --> 12:20.400
distribution.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.960
And I'm curious to know your thoughts on Antigros.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.160
So check this out.

12:24.160 --> 12:28.160
Their latest ISO is laying the groundwork for a ZFS.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.120
Oh, I said it.

12:29.120 --> 12:33.920
ZFS kernel module in preparation for ZFS support in their future installer.

12:33.920 --> 12:34.960
Hey, that's great.

12:34.960 --> 12:35.280
Yeah.

12:35.280 --> 12:38.160
So ZFS installation right there in the Antigros installer.

12:38.160 --> 12:42.400
So you get a rolling arch based distribution with minimal modifications from upstream arch

12:42.400 --> 12:44.480
with ZFS support in a GUI installer.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.360
Your thoughts?

12:45.360 --> 12:45.840
I love it.

12:45.840 --> 12:50.560
Honestly, I don't usually install Antigros, but it is my go to live city.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.760
I think it's a great environment.

12:51.760 --> 12:52.400
It's polished.

12:52.400 --> 12:52.800
It's pretty.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.080
It's got that nice new mix theme.

12:54.880 --> 12:55.680
And also it's arch.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.240
So I know you have all the AURS support.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.600
You have all the latest packages.

12:59.600 --> 13:03.840
And if I want to install arch Linux, it already has all the installation tools.

13:03.840 --> 13:08.800
So if I can do that and have easier ZFS support, I mean, what's not to like there?

13:08.800 --> 13:12.560
I thought on the Linux action show subreddit xoo's take was the best.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.360
Hey, Alan, your troubles are over, Alan.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.320
That's just baiting.

13:16.320 --> 13:16.880
Look at that.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.360
But this is not news.

13:19.360 --> 13:22.000
Like Ubuntu announced they were going to do it first.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.360
Yeah, then everybody's like, oh, well, if it's OK for them to do it, then everybody

13:25.360 --> 13:26.080
can do it.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.120
It appears to be the case.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.840
My concern is how differently it's going to be done in a bunch of different Linux's.

13:32.400 --> 13:37.440
Yeah, because like it seems like only like when you're setting it up in the installer

13:37.440 --> 13:40.720
as someone who's written the installer for ZFS and required multiple iterations to get

13:40.720 --> 13:44.560
it right, are they going to do boot environments?

13:44.560 --> 13:46.640
Because if not, they're kind of wasting their time.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.160
Yeah, I certainly hope so.

13:48.160 --> 13:53.840
I imagine I don't know yet because if they're going to use DKMS to make it work, then I

13:53.840 --> 13:55.760
don't want my boot environment using it.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.760
So I mean, it seems to work, but.

13:59.280 --> 13:59.680
Right.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.040
So, yeah, there's a bunch of questions.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.640
There's having ZFS and there's booting from ZFS.

14:05.440 --> 14:09.840
And then it comes out, you know, at some point, Grub would have to do a release, which they

14:09.840 --> 14:14.080
haven't done in a couple of years in order to actually get all the features we push back

14:14.080 --> 14:16.880
into Grub actually in a version that people might use.

14:16.880 --> 14:21.760
Although random distros might just pull from their head or master branch or whatever you

14:21.760 --> 14:22.880
want to call it and get.

14:22.880 --> 14:26.720
But it seems like that's a bad way to run a software project.

14:27.280 --> 14:31.440
What's the objection with having boot on something else and everything else like all

14:31.440 --> 14:32.640
your main storage on ZFS?

14:32.640 --> 14:33.600
Yeah, I don't see a downside.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.480
There's no objection to that.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.400
It's just you lose boot environments.

14:36.400 --> 14:42.640
So on FreeBSD with boot environments, you can boot off an older a clone of a snapshot.

14:42.640 --> 14:47.040
So, like, before you do a kernel upgrade, you can just roll back.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.320
But you can roll back everything.

14:48.320 --> 14:54.000
Before you run apt upgrade or whatever the equivalent is, you would take a snapshot and

14:54.000 --> 14:58.640
you can roll back so that if the latest package update install the version of GNOME that likes

14:58.640 --> 15:01.440
to crash, you can just be like, give me the one I had 10 minutes ago.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.400
Oh, look, it works.

15:04.400 --> 15:08.800
I don't see how having a separate boot removes your ability to do that.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.320
I'm not a ZFS expert, though.

15:10.320 --> 15:14.720
Well, if the separate boot is not ZFS, then it wouldn't be included in the snapshot.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.720
Other file systems do snapshots, though.

15:19.360 --> 15:22.400
The idea would be one set of tools, though, to manage all of it, right?

15:22.400 --> 15:27.280
So, I mean, there is a disadvantage to managing ButterFS to get your boot environment working

15:27.280 --> 15:31.760
again and then managing ZFS or ZFS to get your data environment and your OS environment

15:31.760 --> 15:32.000
working.

15:32.000 --> 15:32.800
That's not ideal.

15:32.800 --> 15:33.840
It's not optimal, right?

15:33.840 --> 15:36.160
Yeah, the entire point is to keep them in sync, right?

15:36.160 --> 15:41.520
So, it's like, or I actually have online two separate environments that's, hey, this is

15:41.520 --> 15:45.840
FreeBSD 10 with FreeBSD 10 packages and this is FreeBSD 11 with 11 packages.

15:45.840 --> 15:52.480
The thing is, I do go back, though, rebuilding your boot environment is a pretty, like, in

15:52.480 --> 15:57.040
terms of recovering your server and getting it back online, rebuilding slash boot is,

15:57.840 --> 15:59.840
I mean, there's worse things that could happen.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.960
I mean, by boot environment.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.080
Boot environment is what we call the different snapshots.

16:04.080 --> 16:07.440
So, that would be, what, kernel version and everything?

16:07.440 --> 16:09.280
Or what exactly is a boot environment?

16:09.280 --> 16:12.960
The boot environment is a complete snapshot of everything in the system except for directories

16:12.960 --> 16:15.120
you exclude, like your home directory and VAR log.

16:16.160 --> 16:22.720
So, it is the perfectly working kernel and packages and your entire environment that's

16:22.720 --> 16:24.720
not volatile data, basically.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.280
Sort of like Undentified is pointing out, sort of like SUSE is doing right now with

16:29.280 --> 16:30.880
Snapper and ButterFS, but it's...

16:30.880 --> 16:33.040
Yeah, they're copying the ZFS version.

16:33.040 --> 16:33.760
But it's ButterFS.

16:33.760 --> 16:38.640
Yeah, well, it's something Solaris came up with like 10 years ago, right?

16:38.640 --> 16:41.360
And that's where all new technology comes from.

16:41.360 --> 16:45.120
We live in the freaking Star Wars universe where we don't invent anything new.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.160
We just steal older stuff and pretend like it's new.

16:48.160 --> 16:48.560
Oh, God.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.080
Human progress.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.440
Why can't we live in the Star Trek universe where we actually invent new things?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.600
Well, I actually...

16:55.600 --> 16:56.640
Boy, that's a whole other...

16:56.640 --> 16:58.000
Boy, we could do a whole episode on that.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.040
Holy smokes.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.640
So, I'm not quite sure how Antigros is actually...

17:02.640 --> 17:04.080
Rodden, have you had a chance to look at this at all?

17:04.080 --> 17:06.880
Do you have any insights on how Antigros is actually rolling this out or...

17:07.920 --> 17:11.680
No, not the technical aspects of what you're talking about, like the boot environment stuff

17:11.680 --> 17:14.880
like they haven't really given a full detail of that.

17:14.880 --> 17:15.520
It would probably...

17:15.520 --> 17:20.880
Even just usable, you know, ZFS's storage would be very nice to see on Linux.

17:20.880 --> 17:21.600
Yeah, I guess it would.

17:21.600 --> 17:24.080
I think as a first cut, that's almost certainly what will happen.

17:25.040 --> 17:28.960
You know, those advanced restore and recovery stuff I think would be further down the line,

17:28.960 --> 17:32.560
but for a first, given this is going to be our first release with it in,

17:33.200 --> 17:38.000
I suspect it will be mostly focused on storage and you will have to, you know,

17:38.880 --> 17:41.840
do your own thing for how you recover the things that are not ZFS

17:41.840 --> 17:44.000
or the things that are not being snapshoted.

17:44.000 --> 17:44.880
Right, that makes sense.

17:44.880 --> 17:45.680
And that makes sense.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.840
And, you know, that's how FreeBSD did it for a long time.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.880
And even when it supported root on ZFS, many people were like,

17:50.880 --> 17:53.520
I don't trust it enough, including myself.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.160
Yeah, it would probably...

17:54.160 --> 17:58.960
I still have my very first ZFS server, which is still running perfectly fine,

17:58.960 --> 18:04.720
but it's still boots off UFS because I didn't trust ZFS back then.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.840
Now, I actually trust UFS less, but...

18:09.120 --> 18:11.680
Was that what the Chrisney says here,

18:11.680 --> 18:14.320
something about the ButterFS boot support isn't in mainline grub?

18:14.320 --> 18:15.680
Is that accurate?

18:15.680 --> 18:16.240
It is.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.280
Yeah, that does sound right.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.920
It actually depends on what kind of features you've enabled in ButterFS

18:19.920 --> 18:21.440
and of course, as well in ZFS.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.480
I was going to say, because I use sub-volumes to boot from in grub.

18:25.440 --> 18:28.320
And most distros are actually rolling a git version of grub anyway.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.120
There you go.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.960
Kind of taking their own snapshots over time.

18:30.960 --> 18:35.440
If you look at it, it's almost certainly a git version of grub.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.960
Well, it's like I said, grub really needs to, you know, do release.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.720
Hey, man, I'm still sticking with Lilo.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.520
So what's up?

18:44.240 --> 18:45.120
Lilo for life.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.080
Lilo for life.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.040
That's worse than birds.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.080
That's a title right there.

18:48.800 --> 18:49.680
It's worse than birds.

18:49.680 --> 18:50.800
You're right about that.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.200
You know, speaking about living in the Star Trek universe,

18:53.200 --> 18:55.680
I'll tell you what feels like living in the Star Trek universe ting.

18:56.240 --> 19:00.880
Go to right now, linux.ting.com.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.560
But don't get a phone.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.960
This is the worst time ever to get a ting device.

19:04.960 --> 19:05.680
You shouldn't get a phone.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.520
Do not get anything from ting right now.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.400
Okay, okay.

19:08.400 --> 19:08.960
Don't do it.

19:08.960 --> 19:09.600
You told me not to.

19:09.600 --> 19:15.120
Yeah, no, I'm telling you right here on linux unplugged on November 24th,

19:15.120 --> 19:15.760
don't buy anything.

19:15.760 --> 19:17.680
It's the worst time ever to buy something from ting.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.120
Because on Black Friday, they are having a crazy sale.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.880
And if you can wait just a couple of days, I would definitely go that route.

19:24.880 --> 19:29.440
Like 30% off some of their top devices, like free shipping,

19:29.440 --> 19:33.840
starting about 8 a.m. Eastern time, the virtual doors open and you can go cray.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.840
They got great deals on smartphones.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.760
They have a really good, like the best chance to get like the ting sims.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.880
If you have a couple of devices.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.840
$5, maybe I'll pick up.

19:41.840 --> 19:45.040
$5 sims, $5 sims, exactly.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.400
And of course, free shipping on everything.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.200
So you can, I mean, they really are $5 sims, which is awesome.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.520
So go to linux.ting.com.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.320
Then you can combine that with savings for our show.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.720
And you support our show when you go to linux.ting.com.

19:56.720 --> 19:57.600
Why go to ting?

19:57.600 --> 20:00.080
Well, they have a CDMA and GSM network to get to choose from.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.280
So you could be a boss.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.520
But also it's pay for what you use mobile.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.680
No contracts, nor the termination fees.

20:05.680 --> 20:06.720
You only pay for what you use.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.480
It's a flat $6 for the line.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.520
So go to linux.ting.com to support the show.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.000
Check them out.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.960
Try out their savings calculator and go back on Black Friday.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.720
Go get yourself an unlocked device.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.640
Get updates from the Googs or wherever.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.160
I mean, if you get a Googs phone.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.120
You get the updates directly from the Googs on a network

20:23.120 --> 20:25.680
that you only pay for what you use with no contract.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.600
And you get to choose between CDMA and GSM.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.600
That's ridiculous.

20:29.600 --> 20:30.720
linux.ting.com.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.640
Go check them out and go get their Black Friday sale.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.960
I'm tempted to see.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.480
I'm hoping there's a couple of different Android devices

20:38.480 --> 20:39.920
that are on my wish list to go on sale.

20:39.920 --> 20:39.920
Oh, man.

20:39.920 --> 20:40.880
That would be really exciting.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.720
I'm still, where is my phone, Wes?

20:43.520 --> 20:44.560
How cracked is my screen?

20:44.560 --> 20:46.560
How many, I mean, that thing is just, it's all, Wes.

20:46.560 --> 20:47.280
That is ugly.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.400
It is all jacked up.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.720
It is all, look, you see those chips right there?

20:50.720 --> 20:51.200
Yes, I do.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.640
That is a jacked up phone, Wes.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.160
Kind of looks like, does it hurt to touch?

20:54.160 --> 20:55.840
It actually hurts to put up to my ear.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.120
Yeah, it actually does.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.480
So I have, but I have been-

20:58.480 --> 21:00.560
I think it's the representative of this podcast

21:00.560 --> 21:01.280
and the whole network.

21:01.280 --> 21:01.600
Thank you.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.280
You just can't, you can't have a device like that.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.000
I've been holding fast and waiting for the Black Friday sale.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.280
Not only do I love putting a whole bunch of turkey in my mouth,

21:09.280 --> 21:10.480
but I love good sales.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.760
So go to linux.ting.com.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.040
Go get a great deal.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.760
$25 off a Ting device, $25 in service credit,

21:15.760 --> 21:17.520
and you support this show.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.440
And you can read more about their Black Friday sale

21:19.440 --> 21:24.720
on their blog, linux.ting.com.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.720
And thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged Show.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.000
You guys are awesome.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.360
I'm really glad you're doing such a big sale.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.240
That's really cool.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.120
All right, Wes.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.800
So I'm really happy to recommend,

21:33.360 --> 21:35.520
recommend to welcome a representative

21:35.520 --> 21:38.640
from the Vivaldi Project, a new web browser,

21:38.640 --> 21:40.720
really that's designed for their friends, they say.

21:40.720 --> 21:41.920
They have a Linux version out.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.280
You've been checking it out for a little bit.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.160
Yeah, we're running it here today.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.120
Yeah, I've run different builds of it all along.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.640
They have the brand new beta out.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.400
So I installed it last night on my rig

21:50.400 --> 21:51.360
just to give it a try.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.680
And Rory joins us from Vivaldi

21:53.680 --> 21:55.520
to tell us a little bit about their new release.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.800
Rory, welcome to Linux Unplugged

21:56.800 --> 21:58.960
and congratulations on the new beta.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.320
Thanks very much.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.360
We appreciate it.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.600
So you're trying to get the word out

22:03.600 --> 22:06.080
about this desktop browser,

22:06.080 --> 22:08.800
which is sort of entering maybe

22:08.800 --> 22:10.320
the most competitive browser market

22:10.320 --> 22:13.200
we've seen in the last few years with Chrome from Google.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.760
Firefox is really doubling down on features.

22:15.760 --> 22:16.720
Microsoft's got their new Edge.

22:16.720 --> 22:17.680
Even Microsoft.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.240
Yeah, even Microsoft, yeah.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.400
And so are you guys crazy

22:22.400 --> 22:23.920
or do you actually have something here?

22:24.720 --> 22:25.920
You'd think so, but actually,

22:25.920 --> 22:27.360
I think it's a perfect time to do it

22:27.360 --> 22:29.280
because all of those browsers,

22:29.280 --> 22:30.640
the ones that you mentioned,

22:30.640 --> 22:32.160
they're all going in a similar direction

22:32.160 --> 22:34.640
in terms of offering something very simple

22:34.640 --> 22:37.360
for what they believe is the common user.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.560
And what we're trying to do

22:38.560 --> 22:40.080
is we're trying to make something

22:40.080 --> 22:41.680
for everyone else, right?

22:41.680 --> 22:43.520
The common user, but also just people

22:43.520 --> 22:45.440
who want something extra and a bit different.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.560
And so rather than remove features,

22:48.560 --> 22:50.080
which you probably saw the other day,

22:50.080 --> 22:52.880
Firefox are dropping their tab grouping solution,

22:52.880 --> 22:54.240
they're dropping their themes.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.520
We're adding those things.

22:55.520 --> 22:58.720
So this is a browser for everyone else, if you like.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.560
So are you basically saying

23:00.560 --> 23:02.560
it's a browser that appeals to power users

23:03.600 --> 23:06.160
but at the same time isn't too hard to use?

23:06.160 --> 23:07.520
Because I'm looking at it and honestly,

23:07.520 --> 23:10.080
you know, I have to say, using it,

23:10.080 --> 23:12.320
it doesn't feel like a complicated browser.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.480
So how are you delivering something

23:14.480 --> 23:16.880
that isn't reducing features but not being complicated?

23:16.880 --> 23:18.400
Because everybody else tells me

23:18.400 --> 23:19.600
that's completely impossible.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.080
Yeah, I think there are a few things there.

23:22.080 --> 23:24.160
I mean, we've got a very good design team,

23:24.160 --> 23:26.080
so I think it looks nice and clean

23:26.080 --> 23:27.360
in its default layout.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.440
But on top of that, what really works

23:29.440 --> 23:30.720
is the technologies we're using.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.640
There's been a lot of talk of making a browser

23:32.640 --> 23:35.280
with HTML, JavaScript, CSS technologies,

23:35.280 --> 23:36.960
and we're one of the first to release

23:36.960 --> 23:38.080
and we're the first to really do it.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.560
And I think that wraps up how fast we can add things.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.960
And we've been trying to look at those ways of doing things.

23:42.960 --> 23:43.440
Really?

23:43.440 --> 23:44.400
Yeah.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.560
I mean, I guess I knew that,

23:46.560 --> 23:49.680
but you know, actually in using the browser in practice,

23:49.680 --> 23:51.600
I have to say it, to me,

23:52.640 --> 23:55.280
feels like it has the fastest UI elements.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.480
It's very snappy.

23:56.480 --> 23:56.720
Yeah.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.240
I mean, very few glitches.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.480
In your impression and my impression, Wes,

24:00.480 --> 24:01.600
like when you pull, when you like,

24:01.600 --> 24:02.800
say you bring out the bookmarks bar,

24:02.800 --> 24:06.240
I mean, it immediately snaps out

24:06.240 --> 24:08.240
or the downloads immediately snap out.

24:08.240 --> 24:11.360
And it's animated, but it's not exaggerated animation, right?

24:11.360 --> 24:12.720
Like it's like enough animation.

24:12.720 --> 24:13.280
Yeah.

24:13.280 --> 24:17.840
Or what I really like is the way that the tabs

24:17.840 --> 24:20.720
will assume the color of the site you're on.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.120
And then now the tab coloring is based on the site you're on,

24:23.120 --> 24:25.520
but it all happens very nice, very quickly.

24:25.520 --> 24:28.800
So I guess what kind of black magic

24:28.800 --> 24:30.160
is making this feel so fast?

24:31.280 --> 24:32.800
And, you know, my primary experience

24:32.800 --> 24:33.840
has been on the Linux desktop,

24:33.840 --> 24:36.320
but we're now today also we tried it on the Windows desktop.

24:36.320 --> 24:37.760
It also feels very fast.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.080
It feels like maybe it has the best scrolling

24:40.080 --> 24:43.200
out of any of the browsers on the desktop here.

24:43.920 --> 24:46.960
The UI elements are exceedingly snappy.

24:46.960 --> 24:50.000
What is being done there to make all of that happen?

24:50.960 --> 24:52.000
I think it's just a question

24:52.000 --> 24:53.520
of where we are with the web today.

24:53.520 --> 24:56.000
And HTML, JavaScript in particular

24:56.000 --> 24:58.080
has had massive performance increases

24:58.080 --> 25:00.080
and you can just do those kind of things now.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.840
A few years ago, that would have been a pipe dream,

25:01.840 --> 25:03.360
but now we're really there.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.480
And so it's just,

25:04.480 --> 25:06.240
we were the one of the first to kind of try it

25:06.240 --> 25:07.440
and it seems to work well.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.840
I think actually, I'm really glad

25:09.840 --> 25:10.880
that you found it so snappy,

25:10.880 --> 25:12.720
but I think there's even further we could go with that

25:12.720 --> 25:14.240
because for our part,

25:14.240 --> 25:15.600
we know there are things we can improve

25:15.600 --> 25:16.880
and we're definitely working on them.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.160
I wanted to kind of ask you

25:20.160 --> 25:21.680
about the underlying technology

25:21.680 --> 25:25.520
because it seems like the hard problem

25:25.520 --> 25:27.280
you're gonna have with technical users

25:27.280 --> 25:28.720
that are listening to our show

25:28.720 --> 25:30.000
is they're gonna look at this and go,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.920
well, this is based on Chrome.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.680
This is a reskinning of Chromium.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.240
This is Blink or WebKit.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.440
And if I really just wanted to use this,

25:37.440 --> 25:38.560
I could just use Chrome.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.320
I don't need something that just lays down a UI

25:40.320 --> 25:43.360
on top of it and has a bunch of stuff

25:43.360 --> 25:45.200
just built in that I would rather use as extensions.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.680
But that is not actually what's happening here.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.400
What is sort of the go-to rebuttal for that?

25:51.440 --> 25:52.800
I think the thing with extensions,

25:52.800 --> 25:53.520
I mean, they're great.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.680
I used to work at Opera before

25:55.680 --> 25:58.240
and I had 20 plus extensions.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.560
They're good, but they often get in the way

26:00.560 --> 26:02.880
or there's an upgrade and something slightly out of sync

26:02.880 --> 26:04.800
and this extension doesn't work anymore.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.560
So it's about giving a whole package

26:06.560 --> 26:08.640
and making it very simple.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.560
You go into settings, you switch something on,

26:10.560 --> 26:11.520
you switch something off.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.280
You don't have to go and find the extensions.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.520
You install the browser somewhere else.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.960
It's just tweaking a few settings

26:16.960 --> 26:18.160
and you're back to where you were.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.400
So I think it's just that simplicity,

26:20.400 --> 26:23.520
that ease of being exactly how you want it straight away

26:23.520 --> 26:25.520
without having to configure 20 extensions

26:26.160 --> 26:28.000
or worry about will the next upgrade,

26:28.000 --> 26:29.280
will this break my extensions?

26:29.280 --> 26:31.760
It feels to me like it's a guarantee of some features.

26:31.760 --> 26:32.960
Like, well, these are important enough

26:32.960 --> 26:35.040
that they're in our core feature set.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.560
We will, these will always work

26:36.560 --> 26:38.800
and they will work in a really well, really good way.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.280
And like, you know, one of the good examples of that

26:41.280 --> 26:43.280
and this one that I wonder if people have really explored much

26:43.280 --> 26:44.880
is the taking notes and things like that

26:44.880 --> 26:46.320
just built right in.

26:46.320 --> 26:51.200
But you know, Rory, I wonder, it feels like today,

26:51.200 --> 26:52.640
the biggest thing that I miss

26:52.640 --> 26:55.680
when I switch from say Chrome to another browser

26:55.680 --> 26:59.120
is now today when I install Google Chrome,

26:59.120 --> 27:01.760
one of the first things that happens is Google says,

27:01.760 --> 27:04.240
hey, why don't you log into your Google account?

27:04.240 --> 27:07.680
And at the moment that I do that, it pulls down everything.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.560
All of my extensions, all my themes, all my bookmarks

27:10.560 --> 27:12.000
and not only that,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
but it logs me into all the Google properties,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.160
which is a major convenience.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.400
And so when I look at switching to a new browser,

27:18.400 --> 27:20.240
like I did last night when I switched to Vivaldi,

27:20.880 --> 27:23.680
I had to go through the process of importing bookmarks

27:23.680 --> 27:24.320
and all these things.

27:24.320 --> 27:27.200
And I wonder, do you feel like perhaps

27:27.200 --> 27:29.280
this is the biggest area of competition

27:29.280 --> 27:32.480
where the browser maker, like Firefox as well,

27:32.480 --> 27:33.840
now has this sync service.

27:33.840 --> 27:36.400
And essentially it's this backend infrastructure

27:36.400 --> 27:38.080
I rely on for some of these browsers

27:38.080 --> 27:40.160
that's the most appealing aspect to them.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.880
And how does Vivaldi sort of draw me away from that

27:42.880 --> 27:45.840
and give me something else that says maybe also competitive?

27:46.800 --> 27:48.320
Well, I think something you should bear in mind

27:48.320 --> 27:49.840
is we're not anti-sync at all.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.240
I mean, it's something we've put a lot of man hours into,

27:52.240 --> 27:53.840
but we're not quite there yet,

27:53.840 --> 27:55.280
but we fully intend to have sync.

27:55.280 --> 27:58.240
So those kind of things will appear in Vivaldi in the future.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.800
But we're coming up to our first version.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.680
We've just had one beta, so we're not quite there yet.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.760
But yeah, sync is something we want as well.

28:05.760 --> 28:09.200
And sync is something that we intend to deliver in the long run.

28:09.200 --> 28:13.040
So they'll essentially be sort of the same kind of implementation

28:13.040 --> 28:15.200
that I will be able to sync those things across.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.760
And one of the kind of nice power user features I noticed

28:17.760 --> 28:19.440
is right out of the box, you can check a box,

28:19.440 --> 28:20.400
you have a dark theme.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.280
Love that.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.800
Also something else that's very cool

28:22.800 --> 28:25.680
is there is a quick commands, like you hit F2,

28:25.680 --> 28:30.000
and it's a keyboard-based command system for the browser.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.080
Really like that a lot.

28:32.080 --> 28:34.160
What other kind of power user features are in Vivaldi

28:34.160 --> 28:35.120
that maybe I'm not familiar with?

28:36.000 --> 28:38.240
You mentioned the panels on the side

28:38.240 --> 28:40.400
and things that you sort of like notes,

28:40.400 --> 28:43.680
but we also have panels for each of our different properties.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.840
And we also have a thing where you can add a panel.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.880
If you click on the plus, you can add a URL,

28:48.880 --> 28:50.960
and it will add that as a page.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.840
It actually sends a phone user agent.

28:53.840 --> 28:56.800
So it usually gets a page optimized for a phone,

28:56.800 --> 28:58.160
so it has the right size.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.920
And then it's a way of like adding an app

28:59.920 --> 29:00.800
or checking on something.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.520
You can add a page which has maybe nice RSS feed

29:03.520 --> 29:04.720
or some news items,

29:04.720 --> 29:06.640
or maybe you want to stick Twitter in there

29:06.640 --> 29:09.040
and then you can keep track on Twitter or Facebook

29:09.040 --> 29:10.640
or whatever it is you're interested in.

29:10.640 --> 29:11.760
You just add that in the side

29:11.760 --> 29:13.280
and then you can carry on watching.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.520
I love that actually.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.800
That's really cool.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.080
Yeah, that's a great idea.

29:18.080 --> 29:18.640
Picture in picture.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.240
You mentioned the quick commands.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.480
The quick commands, I don't know how much you played with them,

29:22.480 --> 29:24.640
but when you're typing, it can be both,

29:24.640 --> 29:26.160
you can type addresses in there.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.840
It will search your address book.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.280
It will give you the option to search,

29:29.280 --> 29:31.840
but it also will narrow down your list of tabs.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.520
So it's a way to switch tabs.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.400
It also will allow you to type actual commands.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.720
So when you said, when it's called quick commands,

29:38.720 --> 29:39.360
it really means that.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.280
So for example, if I type new,

29:41.280 --> 29:42.960
you'll see in the list below the search engine,

29:42.960 --> 29:45.120
it says new window, new tab, new.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.920
And so they're commands that you can just hit enter on,

29:47.920 --> 29:50.400
arrow down and hit enter and it does the action.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.320
Yeah, like a new private window, for example.

29:52.320 --> 29:52.880
Yeah.

29:52.880 --> 29:53.440
Very cool.

29:53.440 --> 29:53.920
That's very nice.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.600
As someone who's used a lot of like,

29:55.600 --> 29:58.240
you know, like VI type extensions for other browsers,

29:58.240 --> 29:59.600
having those kind of quick commands

29:59.600 --> 30:01.040
just from the keyboard is really nice.

30:01.040 --> 30:01.440
Yeah.

30:01.440 --> 30:01.680
Yeah.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.960
I think having it built in and making sure it works is what helps.

30:04.960 --> 30:07.200
I mean, we have other things as well.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.040
We have a keyboard navigation.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.040
If you go to a page and you hold shift,

30:11.040 --> 30:13.600
you could use arrow keys to go around on links and so on.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.240
And then you can hit enter to go on the links.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.760
I like that.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.240
We also have tab stacking.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.400
So again, you can drag one tab over another.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.120
They will combine.

30:23.120 --> 30:23.840
They're a stack.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.560
You might keep maybe a stack of, say, you're looking,

30:26.560 --> 30:29.360
you're doing shopping or you search for various things

30:29.360 --> 30:30.000
on Google.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
That is really cool.

30:32.000 --> 30:32.640
Yeah, I'm seeing that.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.800
And when you're done, you just delete the whole stack.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.640
You can also, things that are in a stack,

30:36.640 --> 30:40.480
you can right click on the stack and you can choose to tile it.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.160
So you can see two sides, side by side.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.120
Oh, I got to try that.

30:43.120 --> 30:43.680
All right.

30:43.680 --> 30:44.640
I got to try that.

30:44.640 --> 30:45.280
I got to try that.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.280
So I will open up a couple of tabs here.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.960
And I will drag a couple of episodes

30:48.960 --> 30:50.720
of Jupyter broadcasting on top of stuff.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.880
Oh, it's kind of hard to drag it on top of stuff.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.360
But I see.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.280
I'm bound and determined, Wes.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.320
I'm bound and determined to do it.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.920
I think once you just get over it a little bit,

30:57.920 --> 30:59.840
like when the back one fades, then you can do it.

30:59.840 --> 31:00.240
Yeah, OK.

31:00.240 --> 31:00.560
There you go.

31:00.560 --> 31:01.360
It colors slightly.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.160
There you go.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.680
OK, so then how do I stack them?

31:03.680 --> 31:04.320
What do I do now?

31:04.960 --> 31:07.120
OK, there's a couple of different ways you can do it.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.760
There's down at near the bottom of the UI.

31:09.760 --> 31:10.320
Oh, I see.

31:10.320 --> 31:10.880
To the bottom right, there's a little.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.400
Oh, my gosh.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.520
You've got tile.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.240
Oh, my gosh.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.440
That is so cool.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.800
That is so cool.

31:17.680 --> 31:18.560
I'm glad you like it.

31:18.560 --> 31:19.200
Yeah.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.720
That is really kind of something, isn't it?

31:21.600 --> 31:22.640
I could see people, though, who keep

31:22.640 --> 31:23.760
track of a lot of different things.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.520
You know, you're kind of trying to get an overview,

31:25.520 --> 31:26.480
or you have to monitor a certain thing.

31:26.480 --> 31:26.880
Yeah.

31:26.880 --> 31:30.000
Or I was, you know, social media feeds, RSS feeds.

31:30.000 --> 31:30.240
Yeah.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.560
Monitoring for your like, you know,

31:32.560 --> 31:34.800
uptimes and like Nagios type stuff.

31:34.800 --> 31:35.040
Exactly.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.000
That could be super cool.

31:36.800 --> 31:37.520
Huh.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.920
Now, producer Rottencorp, you had something

31:39.920 --> 31:42.640
you want to jump in here with the web panels and extensions

31:42.640 --> 31:44.320
and things and quick options and things like that.

31:44.320 --> 31:44.820
Go ahead.

31:45.520 --> 31:45.840
Yeah.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.920
One of the things I found out that I really liked about it

31:47.920 --> 31:51.520
was one of the, like, there was an extension I had to test

31:51.520 --> 31:56.160
some, like, the tab group concept that Firefox has since

31:56.160 --> 31:57.120
they're getting rid of it.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.800
I was wondering if there was something you could do with,

31:58.800 --> 31:59.760
like, Baldi or something.

32:00.880 --> 32:01.120
Yeah.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.240
I mean, the tab stack.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.480
I actually took, I found a cool extension.

32:07.040 --> 32:11.200
And you can take the extension controls

32:11.200 --> 32:13.120
and turn it into a web panel so that you always

32:13.120 --> 32:14.960
have that extension just quick shortcut.

32:14.960 --> 32:15.200
OK.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.840
You can have, like, just the options and the controls

32:19.840 --> 32:22.160
for a particular extension can also be it.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.280
So it doesn't have to be a website.

32:24.960 --> 32:28.160
So this is a pretty competitive market, Rory.

32:28.160 --> 32:32.400
Do you suppose that the market for the Vivaldi browser

32:32.400 --> 32:35.920
is the user who wants something a little more capable

32:35.920 --> 32:38.640
than just the sort of watered down mainstream browser?

32:38.640 --> 32:41.920
Or is it somebody that is, like, doing research?

32:41.920 --> 32:44.000
What's the, like, when you look at the core demo

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
for the Vivaldi browser, who is it?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.800
And why is the Linux desktop part of that story?

32:52.080 --> 32:54.960
I think it is for those types of users,

32:54.960 --> 32:56.320
but I don't think it's only them.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.000
I mean, a lot of people used to joke back

32:58.000 --> 33:01.040
when we worked at Opera about Opera having no users.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.600
But I was there when we had 60 million users

33:03.600 --> 33:05.760
back for Opera 12 and so on.

33:05.760 --> 33:08.400
And there are a large number of people,

33:08.400 --> 33:10.240
more than you would think, who like to have,

33:10.240 --> 33:11.600
maybe even it's just one feature.

33:11.600 --> 33:12.800
They just appreciate one thing.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.160
They appreciate having notes.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.000
And they don't use any other power user features.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.800
Or they just appreciate having web panels.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.960
So I think it's bigger than that.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.160
But yeah, sure.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.720
I mean, that's our core demographic right now.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.080
That's who we focused on.

33:26.080 --> 33:29.120
The browser is, we call it a browser for our friends.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.680
And really, Jan von Teichner, who's the founder

33:31.680 --> 33:33.520
of both Opera and now Vivaldi,

33:33.520 --> 33:35.360
I mean, that is really what he meant by.

33:35.360 --> 33:36.800
He's making it for the kind of people

33:36.800 --> 33:38.960
who are real fans of the old Opera,

33:38.960 --> 33:40.640
for people like him, for people who want

33:40.640 --> 33:42.720
those power user features first and foremost.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.400
We expect others will come as well.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.520
And then I'm wondering, Rory,

33:45.520 --> 33:46.880
if there's anything you could comment.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.800
I mean, legitimately, if I'm gonna switch to this

33:48.800 --> 33:50.880
as my main browser, one of the first questions

33:50.880 --> 33:56.880
that comes to mind is what steps is Vivaldi taking

33:56.880 --> 33:59.280
to ensure my privacy when you're looking at

33:59.280 --> 34:01.200
upstream Chromium code and you're making

34:01.200 --> 34:02.560
a browser based off that?

34:02.560 --> 34:04.960
Is there things being removed that Google includes?

34:04.960 --> 34:06.720
Is there any kind of tracking?

34:06.720 --> 34:09.280
What's the privacy situation with the Vivaldi browser

34:09.280 --> 34:10.880
versus, say, the upstream project?

34:10.880 --> 34:14.400
Yeah, if you open the settings, just Alt-P

34:14.400 --> 34:16.240
and go to privacy, you'll see that there's

34:16.240 --> 34:18.240
a bunch of stuff that you can tick off.

34:18.240 --> 34:20.400
So if you don't like the Google phishing

34:20.400 --> 34:21.840
and malware protections, for example,

34:21.840 --> 34:22.560
you switch that off.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.840
You switch off diagnostics.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.400
Whatever you don't feel comfortable with,

34:26.400 --> 34:27.440
you can just switch that off.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.160
We also looked at some of the options.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.480
Like, for instance, some people are worried

34:32.480 --> 34:34.960
about the amount of data that, say, Google collects.

34:36.160 --> 34:41.200
And so when we came to do our HTML5 notifications,

34:41.200 --> 34:44.400
when we came to look at things like tracking,

34:44.960 --> 34:46.880
so when you're on Google Maps and you click

34:46.880 --> 34:49.120
to find your location, a lot of people

34:49.120 --> 34:50.480
use a Google service for that.

34:50.480 --> 34:53.360
We actually use one provided by the guys at Mozilla

34:53.360 --> 34:55.520
just to give something different.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.680
So we do look at those kind of issues.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.280
And if people raise them, if they say,

34:59.280 --> 35:01.120
you know what, I don't like the way you do this,

35:01.120 --> 35:03.920
or I feel like this is some form of tracking,

35:03.920 --> 35:05.520
we are very open to adding options

35:05.520 --> 35:06.880
for those kind of things.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.600
Yon has like a catchphrase, which is basically,

35:09.600 --> 35:11.280
when in doubt, we'll add an option.

35:11.280 --> 35:14.080
And we really do do that, which is why a browser which

35:14.080 --> 35:16.560
hasn't even been released has so many options already.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.080
I have to appreciate that.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.080
As somebody who's been using the web browser

35:20.080 --> 35:22.880
for more than six months, it turns out

35:22.880 --> 35:25.040
it's really nice to actually have some configuration

35:25.040 --> 35:26.480
control over some of these things.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.080
So I really do appreciate that.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.520
Roy, is there anything else you want to touch on

35:29.520 --> 35:31.440
before we wrap up on all this stuff?

35:31.440 --> 35:32.320
This has been really cool.

35:33.840 --> 35:37.120
The only thing I'd like to say is that the Linux community

35:37.120 --> 35:38.320
have been great with us.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.560
And at the moment, we have two package types.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.920
We have RPMs and devs.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.760
We do really support the browser with as many distros

35:45.760 --> 35:46.480
as possible, though.

35:46.480 --> 35:49.040
The only reason we don't do more packaging types

35:49.040 --> 35:51.440
is simply because we think that the distros do it better.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.960
So I think it'll happen more when we get to final.

35:54.960 --> 35:57.680
Distros may consider putting us in one repository or another,

35:57.680 --> 35:58.960
which is appropriate.

35:58.960 --> 36:01.200
But we would like to work with package maintainers

36:01.200 --> 36:03.040
to get native packages, because we think that's

36:03.040 --> 36:04.560
the best experience for users.

36:04.560 --> 36:08.080
Our packages are OK, but people who do packaging all the time

36:08.080 --> 36:08.880
do a much better job.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.920
Yeah, I was very thankful.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.640
It was really easy to install from the Arch user repository.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.440
They have the beta in there.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.960
They have the git build, and they have the stable.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.320
And I just installed that real quick,

36:18.320 --> 36:20.720
and I was able to use it for the evening.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.960
You know, actually, the one bit of feedback I would have

36:22.960 --> 36:24.560
is I wasn't able to watch Netflix.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.240
I wanted to watch the new Jessica Jones series,

36:26.240 --> 36:28.160
and I couldn't watch it in the Vivaldi browser.

36:28.160 --> 36:31.280
OK, yeah, we're looking at the Widevine support now.

36:31.280 --> 36:34.160
That's a proprietary component that we have to pick up from.

36:34.160 --> 36:37.280
Yeah, we do do a little trick right now,

36:37.280 --> 36:39.360
because we have to test these things internally.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.680
If you got it from Arch, there's a package there

36:41.680 --> 36:43.120
in the recommends that they suggest,

36:43.120 --> 36:44.720
which gives you H.264 support.

36:44.720 --> 36:47.360
If you install that, we'll also do another trick.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.120
If Chrome happens to be installed,

36:49.120 --> 36:51.360
like as a test while we're seeing how this works,

36:51.360 --> 36:53.680
we'll use their Widevine installation that is there.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.200
So you should be able to use it if Chrome's installed them.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.280
And of course, we don't want to encourage you to install Chrome,

36:59.280 --> 37:01.120
but just in the interim thing.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.400
Yeah, all right.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.400
And Rory, if you wouldn't mind, Heaven's Revenge

37:04.400 --> 37:06.560
has a couple of questions that he wants to ask.

37:06.560 --> 37:07.280
Go ahead, Heaven's.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.440
And I would be curious to hear what you think,

37:09.440 --> 37:10.560
because I've been using it.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.440
I've been pretty impressed.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.400
So fire away.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.240
Hello.

37:14.240 --> 37:19.520
Well, I used to be a very massive Opera 15 or 12 fan

37:19.520 --> 37:20.560
back in the day.

37:20.560 --> 37:24.800
But this is basically a reborn version of the old Opera,

37:24.800 --> 37:28.320
a nice customizable power user version of Opera.

37:29.040 --> 37:33.840
What prevents another company from just buying Vivaldi out

37:33.840 --> 37:39.120
and changing the new wicked Vivaldi into the new Opera

37:39.120 --> 37:41.120
that doesn't have all the power user options

37:41.120 --> 37:44.400
and just destroys the old user power user base

37:44.400 --> 37:45.120
that we used to...

37:45.920 --> 37:47.280
It was beautiful, the old Opera.

37:47.280 --> 37:48.880
And it's just saddening.

37:48.880 --> 37:52.240
And I would hate for the same thing to happen to Vivaldi now.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.160
I think there's an interesting story there.

37:54.160 --> 37:54.960
If you look at...

37:54.960 --> 37:55.760
I don't know how much...

37:55.760 --> 37:58.160
If you're an old fan, you probably remember Jon Pontechno,

37:58.160 --> 37:59.920
one of our two founders of Opera.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.000
And he's the guy who runs Vivaldi.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.480
And it got to a situation where obviously there were more

38:04.480 --> 38:06.640
and more shareholders involved,

38:06.640 --> 38:08.880
and they were able to do things outside of maybe

38:08.880 --> 38:10.240
the way he would have liked it to go.

38:10.240 --> 38:13.840
I think what we have at Vivaldi is what Jon would have wanted

38:13.840 --> 38:14.640
Opera to be.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.240
Our company is wholly owned by him really at the moment.

38:18.240 --> 38:20.080
I mean, the employees have small amounts of share,

38:20.080 --> 38:23.280
but I don't think this is intended to be floated anytime soon.

38:24.160 --> 38:27.040
This is a reaction to the fact that Opera isn't the way

38:27.600 --> 38:29.040
people like Jon wanted it to be.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.920
And so there's kind of a protection there in a way.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.000
He's not going to sell this out anytime soon.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.400
And that those of us who have small shareholdings in it,

38:36.400 --> 38:37.200
neither are we.

38:37.200 --> 38:37.680
This is...

38:37.680 --> 38:39.600
I don't think this is going to be floated anytime soon.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.840
So he's more of the embodiment of the old loved Opera

38:43.840 --> 38:45.120
that we all used to love.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.400
Very much so, very much so.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.280
I mean, Jon is very much that kind of a guy.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.600
I mean, a lot of us joined purely because it was him

38:51.600 --> 38:53.280
and we know his thoughts on the matter.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.200
I mean, I myself was working at Opera.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.400
I had a job there.

38:56.400 --> 38:56.960
There was...

38:58.400 --> 39:00.320
Not long ago, I don't know how much you follow the news,

39:00.320 --> 39:02.720
a bunch of people were fired from the Oslo office.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.520
I was not, but I quit because I specifically wanted to work

39:05.520 --> 39:08.080
with Jon because I know how he feels about these things.

39:08.080 --> 39:08.640
So what...

39:08.640 --> 39:10.880
You know, this is a horrible question to ask really,

39:10.880 --> 39:12.320
because nobody likes to talk about this.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.960
But also, I kind of wonder...

39:14.960 --> 39:18.000
I totally grok why Google makes a browser,

39:18.000 --> 39:21.200
makes sense, I even grok why Apple and Microsoft

39:21.200 --> 39:22.720
make their crappy browsers.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.720
I understand why Mozilla does it.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.680
What is the long-term sort of revenue model?

39:27.680 --> 39:30.640
What's the path to success for Vivaldi?

39:30.640 --> 39:32.400
Obviously, you're probably not going to charge

39:32.400 --> 39:34.000
for the browser itself.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.400
And it may not be in stone yet, but is there sort of...

39:36.400 --> 39:38.800
As somebody who might become really passionate about this,

39:38.800 --> 39:40.240
I like to know you guys are going to be around here

39:40.240 --> 39:42.640
for say, five, 10, 15 years.

39:42.640 --> 39:43.600
What's going to make that happen?

39:44.640 --> 39:46.560
I mean, the revenue model is actually the same

39:46.560 --> 39:48.160
as we had at Opera.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.960
It's the same way that Firefox makes their money.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.560
I mean, there are a few things that you can do

39:52.560 --> 39:55.760
to make money from the users, which also benefit the users.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.760
One of them is doing search partnerships,

39:57.760 --> 40:00.160
and that's where most of the browsers nowadays

40:00.160 --> 40:01.440
make most of their money.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.080
So like, a fraction of a fraction of a penny

40:04.080 --> 40:07.920
for every X number of searches we get paid on.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.600
And so we add some search engines there

40:09.600 --> 40:10.720
and we do deals with them.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.240
We do other small deals as well,

40:12.240 --> 40:14.400
but the idea that we always had at Opera,

40:14.400 --> 40:15.520
and I think we did quite well,

40:15.520 --> 40:18.880
is to add things that are both benefits to the user

40:18.880 --> 40:19.760
and benefits to us.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.680
I mean, people want those search engines anyway, right?

40:21.680 --> 40:23.040
Sure, yeah.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.960
You try to walk that line.

40:24.960 --> 40:26.560
Yeah, exactly, try to walk that line.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.800
And it was feasible to do at Opera.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.960
You need some millions of users to make it work,

40:30.960 --> 40:33.120
but I think that we can get to those millions of users

40:33.120 --> 40:34.560
and it should be self-sufficient.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.680
As it happens now,

40:35.680 --> 40:37.760
to show you the level of commitment that Jon has,

40:37.760 --> 40:39.760
I mean, he's bankrolling pretty much this

40:39.760 --> 40:41.600
until we get to that level.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.840
So when I said he's making this for his friends,

40:43.840 --> 40:45.680
he's doing it, he's putting himself on the line

40:45.680 --> 40:46.720
and he's gonna make it happen.

40:46.720 --> 40:49.360
So, you know, I think you can feel comfortable

40:49.360 --> 40:51.920
because it's different from the old Opera

40:51.920 --> 40:53.920
in that he has much more control here.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.640
And so, of course, we are on Linux Unplugged

40:56.640 --> 40:58.480
and one of the questions can probably be very nicely

40:58.480 --> 40:59.520
summed up by Heaven's Revenge.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.760
I think Heaven's Revenge, you've been asking,

41:01.760 --> 41:04.320
what's sort of the open source story here?

41:04.320 --> 41:07.360
We know it's built on top of some open source technologies,

41:07.360 --> 41:10.240
but some of the things that the Vivaldi's offering

41:10.240 --> 41:11.040
are closed source.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.560
And Heaven's, I don't mean to cut off your question,

41:12.560 --> 41:14.480
but is that essentially what you're asking?

41:15.360 --> 41:18.480
Yes, considering they were touting how fast and fluid

41:18.480 --> 41:19.760
their user interface is.

41:19.760 --> 41:20.320
And it is.

41:20.320 --> 41:22.640
Because it is JavaScript and CSS based.

41:23.280 --> 41:26.400
And since the old, or at least Chromium project

41:26.400 --> 41:27.920
is what they're based upon,

41:27.920 --> 41:30.720
will they go down the old path of Opera,

41:30.720 --> 41:34.400
which is a closed project and a proprietary one,

41:34.400 --> 41:36.800
which prevents a default installation

41:36.800 --> 41:39.600
on a lot of live disks and a lot of distributions?

41:39.600 --> 41:40.160
Yeah.

41:40.160 --> 41:43.840
That is what prevented Opera from being so widely used

41:43.840 --> 41:45.120
on a lot of distributions.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.600
Being legally allowed to, yeah,

41:47.600 --> 41:50.800
like so could a distribution legally redistribute the browser.

41:50.800 --> 41:51.440
Right.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.120
And honestly, there's a lot of people out there

41:54.080 --> 41:55.360
that are looking at this thinking,

41:55.360 --> 41:56.400
if I'm going to switch to something,

41:56.400 --> 41:58.320
I want to be able to trust it.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.640
It's a little more trustworthy if it's open source.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.480
Or at least Firefox and Chromium

42:02.480 --> 42:03.600
just because they're open source.

42:03.600 --> 42:06.880
So Ubuntu won't even give Chrome,

42:06.880 --> 42:08.640
because of its closed nature,

42:08.640 --> 42:10.640
Chromium or Firefox is their default options.

42:10.640 --> 42:12.320
Unfortunately, to that end too, yeah.

42:12.320 --> 42:16.000
So what do we get?

42:16.000 --> 42:16.880
So, okay.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.240
So there are a couple of things there.

42:19.360 --> 42:21.360
Firstly, all the stuff on Chromium,

42:21.360 --> 42:25.360
all of the C++ code and everything that makes up Chromium,

42:25.360 --> 42:28.800
the changes that we make there are essentially to run our UI,

42:28.800 --> 42:31.920
which is written in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and so on.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.560
And all of those changes we make,

42:35.200 --> 42:36.640
some of it we'd have to anyway,

42:36.640 --> 42:40.160
but not everything because there are different licenses

42:40.160 --> 42:41.600
in Chromium and Blink and so on.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.760
We put up a source code.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.720
If you go to vivaldi.com slash source,

42:47.440 --> 42:48.960
you can download the source code package.

42:48.960 --> 42:51.440
And that is basically the Chromium version

42:51.440 --> 42:54.560
we're currently based off plus all of our changes.

42:54.560 --> 42:57.840
And any change that we made will either match license,

42:57.840 --> 43:00.000
say for example, if we'd adjusted FFmpeg,

43:00.000 --> 43:01.600
we haven't, but it's LGPL,

43:01.600 --> 43:04.320
it would inherit the LGPL license.

43:04.320 --> 43:06.640
In any other case, we give it under a BSD license.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.240
The details are explained in the readme

43:08.240 --> 43:09.520
and the license file and so on.

43:10.240 --> 43:13.040
So it's only our UI, which is proprietary.

43:13.040 --> 43:16.000
That is, however, auditable because it's,

43:16.000 --> 43:17.520
you can just get that from the package,

43:17.520 --> 43:18.400
the regular package.

43:18.400 --> 43:21.600
I mean, it's just, as I said, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

43:21.600 --> 43:25.360
It is minified, but you can go through it

43:25.360 --> 43:27.760
and see what it's doing and people have tweaked it.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.200
We have talked internally about possibilities

43:31.200 --> 43:33.600
for other licenses and it's definitely a door

43:33.600 --> 43:34.480
that's open to us.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.480
I think that there are people here

43:36.480 --> 43:37.680
who want that in the team

43:37.680 --> 43:39.920
and that our whole team works together

43:39.920 --> 43:42.320
so we can make that happen, maybe.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.080
But I'm not gonna promise it,

43:44.080 --> 43:45.760
but it's definitely something we look at.

43:45.760 --> 43:51.840
And it is a box that is already being called Pandora

43:51.840 --> 43:53.280
because there's a distribution

43:53.280 --> 43:54.560
we're gonna talk about later in the show today

43:54.560 --> 43:56.880
that's already shipping with Vivaldi as the default browser.

43:57.680 --> 43:59.760
And you know, we're fine with that.

43:59.760 --> 44:00.720
We're absolutely fine with that.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.640
I mean, in Opera back in the old days,

44:02.640 --> 44:03.680
the Opera 12 days,

44:04.400 --> 44:06.320
we had a situation where the license for...

44:07.280 --> 44:09.120
It was quite a proprietary company in some ways,

44:09.120 --> 44:11.440
but we had a license for Linux,

44:11.440 --> 44:13.520
which was different from the other desktop browsers,

44:13.520 --> 44:16.800
and it allowed redistribution and repackaging

44:16.800 --> 44:18.000
to fit the distro.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.600
At some point, we tweaked the license unintentionally

44:21.600 --> 44:24.080
and basically, if you read it literally,

44:24.080 --> 44:25.760
it didn't look like you could redistribute

44:25.760 --> 44:27.760
and a bunch of distros actually dropped us

44:27.760 --> 44:28.720
and it was sad.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.960
And it was a lot of effort to get us back in Arch.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.640
I did a lot of the community work there.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.320
I maintained the package myself for a while.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.480
I got another guy to take over.

44:36.480 --> 44:39.280
He's actually the guy who maintains the Vivaldi package now.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.240
He's one of our volunteers.

44:42.240 --> 44:44.320
We have a small volunteer team who help us as well.

44:45.040 --> 44:48.240
So, you know, we would bend over

44:48.240 --> 44:50.480
to kind of help people get it in the distro.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.000
We would really help them.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.360
If they wanna get something in the distro,

44:53.360 --> 44:54.160
we'll see if we can do...

44:54.720 --> 44:56.640
Tweet the license if that it needs be.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.960
We just, we try to protect certain things.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.160
I get, maybe it's the wrong word,

45:00.160 --> 45:02.720
but we are willing to work with distros

45:02.720 --> 45:04.320
to allow them to distribute it.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.000
It also suits them.

45:06.800 --> 45:07.600
Lovely.

45:07.600 --> 45:09.040
Well, I have...

45:09.040 --> 45:10.320
John is an amazing guy.

45:10.960 --> 45:11.520
Hey, Chris.

45:11.520 --> 45:12.720
No, go ahead.

45:13.280 --> 45:14.960
John was a great man,

45:14.960 --> 45:18.960
but I don't want him to bring his mistakes of Opera into Vivaldi.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.680
Hopefully he learned from the potential mistake

45:21.680 --> 45:23.200
of being the browser closed

45:23.200 --> 45:25.440
and not make the same mistake with Vivaldi.

45:26.240 --> 45:28.240
I think that John is open to things.

45:28.240 --> 45:29.680
As I said, I don't wanna promise stuff

45:29.680 --> 45:32.640
because it's still discussions we have internally,

45:32.640 --> 45:34.640
but I think he's very much open to things.

45:34.640 --> 45:36.720
He likes people messing with the browser.

45:37.440 --> 45:38.800
Back in the old days in Opera,

45:38.800 --> 45:41.920
we had a situation where there was a guy there

45:41.920 --> 45:43.360
who was just a fan

45:43.360 --> 45:46.720
and he used to binary patch Opera to tweak certain things.

45:47.680 --> 45:51.280
Later on, because he was interesting in the community,

45:51.280 --> 45:52.000
we hired him.

45:52.720 --> 45:53.680
That part is great.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.160
Yeah, there you go.

45:54.160 --> 45:57.280
So we're not anti-people messing with it.

45:57.280 --> 45:59.520
And some of them, as I mentioned briefly,

45:59.520 --> 46:01.040
we have this volunteer community,

46:01.040 --> 46:03.600
a group of people who just help us out for free,

46:03.600 --> 46:04.800
who are like in a circle.

46:04.800 --> 46:08.000
They end up on our Slack channel and so on.

46:09.280 --> 46:10.960
One of them is the package maintainer

46:10.960 --> 46:12.240
and those guys have been tweaking

46:12.240 --> 46:13.920
and adjusting small things here and there.

46:13.920 --> 46:16.720
Okay, so to sort of summarize for those listening,

46:16.720 --> 46:19.040
if you are creating a Linux distribution today,

46:20.240 --> 46:22.000
the Vivaldi project on the most part

46:22.880 --> 46:25.360
is okay with you including it in your distribution by default.

46:25.360 --> 46:26.240
Is that correct?

46:26.240 --> 46:27.760
Yes, yeah, yeah, that is.

46:27.760 --> 46:29.920
And if they want to tweak the packaging slightly,

46:29.920 --> 46:31.600
because not everyone's RPM on dev

46:31.600 --> 46:33.120
or they hate our RPM on dev,

46:33.120 --> 46:34.640
so we're cool with that as well.

46:34.640 --> 46:35.360
Sure.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.360
All right, so we'll have links to download it

46:37.360 --> 46:38.160
in the show notes.

46:38.160 --> 46:41.600
It's also in a lot of distributions repositories already.

46:41.600 --> 46:43.600
And I have to say, it's pretty exciting

46:43.600 --> 46:46.320
because it's fast, it is very feature rich.

46:46.320 --> 46:47.440
And if you need to take notes,

46:47.440 --> 46:48.800
if you do research and things like that,

46:48.800 --> 46:50.640
it has some of that stuff built in,

46:50.640 --> 46:53.920
which is nice because I have yet to find an extension

46:53.920 --> 46:55.600
that doesn't drive me fricking crazy

46:55.600 --> 46:56.800
that does that kind of functionality.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.960
So it's nice to just have that included in the browser.

46:58.960 --> 47:00.960
And also feel like the UI makes my computer

47:00.960 --> 47:02.000
feel like a super machine.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.520
Like everything snaps open super fast.

47:03.520 --> 47:05.440
I'm like, oh yeah, it's 2015.

47:05.440 --> 47:06.880
So if you want a browser that feels like that,

47:06.880 --> 47:07.920
go check out Vivaldi.

47:07.920 --> 47:09.120
We have a link in the show notes.

47:09.120 --> 47:11.040
Rory, thank you for joining Linux Unplugged

47:11.040 --> 47:12.400
and telling us a little bit about it.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.000
And congratulations on the new release.

47:14.560 --> 47:15.520
Yeah, thanks a lot.

47:16.080 --> 47:16.960
All right, so check it out.

47:16.960 --> 47:18.480
We'll have a link in the show notes.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.960
And Wes, what do you think after using it for a bit?

47:20.960 --> 47:22.160
Your closing thoughts, sir.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.200
I haven't heard from you.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.680
You know, I'm really happy to hear

47:25.680 --> 47:28.960
that it's built on standard technologies, HTML, CSS.

47:29.760 --> 47:32.640
I have mixed feelings about the closed source nature,

47:32.640 --> 47:33.920
but it does perform really well.

47:34.960 --> 47:37.520
And it is built a lot on our open source tools

47:37.520 --> 47:39.200
that we use anyway, Chromium, et cetera.

47:39.200 --> 47:40.240
This is what I like about it.

47:40.800 --> 47:43.520
What I like about it is it adds some competition

47:43.520 --> 47:44.320
to this landscape.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.680
Yeah, I think it brings a lot of, you know,

47:45.680 --> 47:46.560
it's well designed.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.600
It brings a lot of features.

47:47.600 --> 47:49.520
And even if I don't end up sticking with it,

47:49.520 --> 47:51.760
I think it should probably help the ecosystem.

47:51.760 --> 47:54.080
And I feel like it's a pragmatic competitor

47:54.080 --> 47:56.880
in the sense that it acknowledges some of the innovations

47:56.880 --> 47:58.480
that Google have done are legitimate,

47:58.480 --> 48:00.240
and they really have brought some new blood

48:00.240 --> 48:01.600
into the web browser market.

48:01.600 --> 48:04.400
But at the same time, it's sort of pulling away

48:04.400 --> 48:08.160
some of the black magic and allowing you access

48:08.160 --> 48:09.200
to some of those privacy things,

48:09.200 --> 48:12.640
like being able to opt out of Google's content filter

48:12.640 --> 48:14.240
is actually a big deal because that means

48:14.240 --> 48:16.480
you're sending them a hell of a lot less data.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.480
And it's nice to see someone using the Chromium base

48:18.480 --> 48:20.800
that's not Google but that has a little more heft,

48:20.800 --> 48:22.880
you know, like this will exist for a while.

48:22.880 --> 48:25.840
Right, also, and this is kind of my closing thought on it,

48:25.840 --> 48:29.200
what I really like about it is you have a group

48:29.200 --> 48:32.240
that is just legitimately focused on a great browser.

48:32.240 --> 48:33.360
Yes, exactly.

48:33.360 --> 48:35.520
At the end of the day, Google is focused

48:35.520 --> 48:37.600
on collecting data, selling, advertising,

48:37.600 --> 48:40.960
and really moving their whole web agenda forward

48:40.960 --> 48:43.440
because the web is very important to Google as a company.

48:43.440 --> 48:44.560
Chrome is just a piece.

48:44.560 --> 48:46.480
Chrome is an important piece to that.

48:48.160 --> 48:50.080
One of the things about the Mozilla Foundation,

48:50.080 --> 48:52.560
and obviously with Vivaldi and other projects like them,

48:52.560 --> 48:54.240
I really, really respect the fact

48:54.240 --> 48:56.640
that what they actually are focused on for the most part

48:56.640 --> 48:57.760
is just creating a great browser.

48:57.760 --> 48:59.360
Now, the Mozilla Foundation, you know,

48:59.360 --> 49:00.560
that's not their only focus,

49:00.560 --> 49:02.160
but it's a huge part of their focus.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.160
And at the end of the day, as a user,

49:04.160 --> 49:05.920
I really like where their intentions begin.

49:05.920 --> 49:07.280
And I think that's really awesome too,

49:07.280 --> 49:10.080
so I'm glad to have another thought leader in that space.

49:10.080 --> 49:10.560
So check it out.

49:10.560 --> 49:11.760
We'll have links in the show notes.

49:11.760 --> 49:13.840
And in the meantime, I encourage you to spend

49:13.840 --> 49:15.840
your holiday weekend not consuming turkey

49:15.840 --> 49:17.600
but checking out DigitalOcean.

49:17.600 --> 49:18.960
Head over to digitalocean.com

49:18.960 --> 49:20.880
and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED,

49:20.880 --> 49:23.360
DOUNPLUGGED, one word, lowercase.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.120
You know, it's way better for the waistline.

49:25.120 --> 49:25.680
Exactly.

49:26.320 --> 49:27.440
Don't eat that stuffing.

49:27.440 --> 49:27.920
Nope.

49:27.920 --> 49:29.360
Don't eat that crap cranberry from the can.

49:29.360 --> 49:30.240
Ignore your family.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.320
You should play around with DigitalOcean instead.

49:32.320 --> 49:34.320
Which is way better for your psychology.

49:34.320 --> 49:35.360
Let's be honest.

49:35.360 --> 49:36.080
You know what, guys?

49:36.080 --> 49:36.800
Here's the thing.

49:36.800 --> 49:39.600
I am 33 going on 34.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.000
And let me tell you something.

49:42.000 --> 49:42.960
It doesn't get any better.

49:43.840 --> 49:45.360
The family is, it is...

49:46.560 --> 49:47.360
Let me tell you something.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.280
The family, you could just avoid that.

49:49.280 --> 49:51.680
I can tell you after 33 years, just avoid them.

49:51.680 --> 49:53.520
This is my personal recommendation.

49:53.520 --> 49:54.880
Stay home and play with DigitalOcean.

49:54.880 --> 49:57.520
And if you're not going to do that, like I tell you to,

49:57.520 --> 49:59.600
that's Chris's personal recommendation.

49:59.600 --> 50:00.800
Don't get mad at him, folks.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.400
Yeah, hey, I warned you.

50:02.400 --> 50:05.600
Just carve, if you'll excuse the pun,

50:05.600 --> 50:08.400
carve a little time aside to go play with DigitalOcean

50:08.400 --> 50:09.840
and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.440
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider

50:11.440 --> 50:14.000
dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

50:14.000 --> 50:15.600
for you to get your own Linux rig

50:15.600 --> 50:17.600
up on their super awesome SSD-based cloud

50:17.600 --> 50:21.120
with 40 gigabyte connections all running on KVM

50:21.120 --> 50:22.480
with Linux as the infrastructure

50:22.480 --> 50:24.720
because Linux is a boss, right?

50:24.720 --> 50:27.520
So they got KVM, which is a super great virtualizer.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.080
It's awesome.

50:28.080 --> 50:29.040
It is.

50:29.040 --> 50:31.760
Did you know that we have a KVM rig here in the studio?

50:31.760 --> 50:32.800
I did not know that.

50:32.800 --> 50:36.320
So before DigitalOcean was like a thing in Chris's world,

50:36.320 --> 50:38.160
they existed, but it wasn't in my world yet.

50:39.280 --> 50:42.560
I was out building KVM machines off of old rigs

50:42.560 --> 50:46.160
that are just monsters with ridiculous water cooling.

50:46.160 --> 50:48.720
And I mean, yeah, it is a system, Wes.

50:48.720 --> 50:49.840
And you'd be pretty, I should show it to you

50:49.840 --> 50:50.320
before you leave.

50:50.320 --> 50:50.880
You should, yes.

50:50.880 --> 50:52.800
And anyways, this was how I was going

50:52.800 --> 50:55.120
to grow the Jupyter broadcasting infrastructure.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.080
Thinking about scale here.

50:56.080 --> 50:56.640
Yeah, yeah.

50:56.640 --> 50:59.520
I was going to spin up machines on this rig in my garage.

50:59.520 --> 51:00.960
It's just so ridiculous.

51:00.960 --> 51:03.280
Now that I think about it now, because for $5 a month

51:03.280 --> 51:06.400
I can get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

51:06.400 --> 51:08.560
one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer, right?

51:08.560 --> 51:09.840
That's tier one bandwidth.

51:09.840 --> 51:10.400
That's the beginning.

51:10.400 --> 51:11.600
What tier do you have, Chris?

51:11.600 --> 51:12.400
Here at home, do you think?

51:12.400 --> 51:15.120
I don't even, so for those of you, hopefully,

51:15.120 --> 51:17.200
you don't even know, but we've actually

51:17.200 --> 51:20.080
had to stop recording and rerecord parts of the show

51:20.080 --> 51:22.720
because we've had connectivity issues here at the studio,

51:22.720 --> 51:25.120
which, as Wes can attest, made Chris a little grumpy.

51:25.120 --> 51:25.920
Yes, just a little bit.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.800
I got a little grumpy because I started cussing.

51:28.800 --> 51:30.320
I started talking about how much I spend.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.640
And you know, the thing is, $5 a month,

51:32.640 --> 51:34.320
that's less than a Big Mac.

51:34.320 --> 51:34.880
It's nothing.

51:34.880 --> 51:37.600
It is less than I spent on beverages for this show

51:37.600 --> 51:38.560
by quite a bit.

51:38.560 --> 51:40.560
You go to DigitalOcean, use the promo code DOUNPLUG,

51:40.560 --> 51:41.280
you get $10 credit.

51:41.280 --> 51:43.760
They got data center locations in New York, San Francisco,

51:43.760 --> 51:47.280
Singapore, Amsterdam, London, and a brand new one in Toronto.

51:47.920 --> 51:50.880
And they're super nice, kind of brand new,

51:50.880 --> 51:53.840
not as new as Toronto, but it still smells like that.

51:53.840 --> 51:56.000
It has that new data center smell in Germany.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.200
But it's that interface.

51:59.840 --> 52:00.880
Man, is it that interface.

52:00.880 --> 52:03.040
They have a great interface that really makes

52:03.040 --> 52:05.280
all of the kind of virtual machine management

52:05.280 --> 52:07.120
really straightforward, deploying applications,

52:07.120 --> 52:08.160
destroying your machines.

52:08.160 --> 52:10.080
You wanted to go deploy a free BSD rig,

52:10.080 --> 52:13.840
a Core S rig, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora 23.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.360
Yeah, they have Fedora 23.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.800
You can go deploy them right now.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.240
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG.

52:19.520 --> 52:20.960
You get that credit.

52:20.960 --> 52:21.680
You get that credit.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.160
You put it up in that little spot they got there.

52:24.160 --> 52:25.200
No credit required.

52:25.200 --> 52:26.720
Feel like getting a little credit spot there, Wes.

52:26.720 --> 52:28.320
They got a little credit spot, you know?

52:28.320 --> 52:29.200
That's what they call it.

52:29.200 --> 52:31.200
And you know, the other thing I really like about DigitalOcean

52:31.200 --> 52:33.840
is, well, they got some really, really good tutorials.

52:33.840 --> 52:34.960
They have a brand new one up.

52:34.960 --> 52:37.520
I recommend you go check out How to Create a High Availability

52:37.520 --> 52:41.200
Setup with Heartbeat and Floating IPs on Ubuntu 14.04.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.360
This is a really, really nice write-up

52:43.360 --> 52:46.080
with some super great visuals, the basic understandings.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.040
Because what DigitalOcean has done

52:47.040 --> 52:49.600
is they've hired professional content editors

52:49.600 --> 52:50.880
to actually edit this stuff.

52:50.880 --> 52:51.760
It is good.

52:51.760 --> 52:52.320
It is good.

52:52.320 --> 52:53.920
And it's all just included with DigitalOcean.

52:53.920 --> 52:54.960
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG.

52:54.960 --> 52:55.680
Get a $10 credit.

52:55.680 --> 52:57.360
Go deploy an own cloud server, Minecraft server,

52:57.360 --> 52:58.000
SyncThings server.

52:58.000 --> 52:58.880
My gosh, you guys.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.240
There's so many things you can do with it.

53:00.880 --> 53:02.320
Wes, do you have anything you'd be wanting to add?

53:02.320 --> 53:04.640
It's just, I mean, just the kind of level of stuff.

53:04.640 --> 53:05.520
You don't have to get, you know,

53:05.520 --> 53:08.000
you don't have to buy a really nice edge firewall

53:08.000 --> 53:09.040
that you put on your network.

53:09.040 --> 53:10.480
You know, you could just get floating IPs.

53:10.480 --> 53:13.600
You can have these kinds of enterprise-style setups.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.100
I know.

53:14.800 --> 53:16.000
But for your own peace of mind.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Now, Wes, is there a way I could take

53:18.000 --> 53:23.120
my MB Fedora 23 Droplet and combine floating IPs

53:23.120 --> 53:25.840
so that way I could have high availability MB?

53:25.840 --> 53:26.480
Can you think of?

53:27.840 --> 53:29.120
I'm just spitballing here, Wes.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.240
I'm spitballing with you.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.520
I don't know if that's possible.

53:31.520 --> 53:34.080
But it's open source.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.520
So we can make it happen.

53:35.520 --> 53:36.240
Screw you, Plex.

53:36.240 --> 53:38.320
Go over to digitalocean.com and use the promo code

53:38.320 --> 53:40.960
DOUNPLUG at a $10 credit and try out DigitalOcean.

53:40.960 --> 53:43.040
And say, sorry, family.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.440
I got more important things this holiday season.

53:45.440 --> 53:47.520
That is the holiday spirit here at Jupiter Broadcast.

53:47.520 --> 53:49.200
And use the promo code DOUNPLUG.

53:49.200 --> 53:52.080
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

53:52.080 --> 53:54.640
Linux Unplugged.

53:54.640 --> 53:55.040
All right.

53:55.040 --> 53:57.440
So on this week's episode of the Linux Action Show,

53:57.440 --> 54:01.200
we talked about Solus OS, a really slick, built

54:01.200 --> 54:03.680
from scratch operating system distribution,

54:03.680 --> 54:06.960
if you will, of Linux, GNU slash Linux, by the way.

54:06.960 --> 54:08.080
Don't get that s wrong.

54:08.080 --> 54:09.600
That is embarrassing.

54:09.600 --> 54:11.920
GNU slash Linux distribution.

54:11.920 --> 54:14.080
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

54:14.080 --> 54:15.040
Yeah, there you go.

54:15.040 --> 54:16.480
And we talked about it.

54:16.480 --> 54:17.360
We reviewed it.

54:17.360 --> 54:21.280
It has a really nice desktop called Budgie based off

54:21.280 --> 54:23.680
of a little bit of Gnome.

54:24.320 --> 54:26.560
And I could tell you all I could go on about it all.

54:26.560 --> 54:30.160
But instead, Aiki, who is the guy behind the distribution,

54:30.160 --> 54:31.520
who has joined us before on the show,

54:31.520 --> 54:33.680
has come back on Linux Unplugged to not only do

54:33.680 --> 54:35.360
a little bit of follow up on the review,

54:35.360 --> 54:38.080
but correct pronunciations, tell me anything I've missed,

54:38.080 --> 54:40.800
and maybe hopefully tease the big release.

54:40.800 --> 54:42.480
Aiki, welcome back to Linux Unplugged.

54:43.680 --> 54:44.480
Thank you very much.

54:45.280 --> 54:51.920
So what was the biggest thing I got wrong in my review,

54:51.920 --> 54:53.520
or our review?

54:53.520 --> 54:54.160
Let's blame Noah.

54:54.160 --> 54:54.640
Noah's review.

54:54.640 --> 54:57.040
What was the biggest thing Noah got wrong on this week's

54:57.040 --> 54:59.200
episode of the Linux Action Show while we were talking about Solus?

54:59.200 --> 55:01.920
To be honest, it was mainly just the stuff about Solus.

55:01.920 --> 55:02.400
Yeah, sure.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.440
Yeah, that would make sense.

55:03.440 --> 55:04.880
That would kind of be the range.

55:04.880 --> 55:07.120
Yeah, so anything pertaining to the actual review

55:07.120 --> 55:07.920
was probably wrong.

55:07.920 --> 55:11.440
And so where do you want to start?

55:12.880 --> 55:14.880
Is there anything that really jumped out at you

55:14.880 --> 55:15.680
that was offensive?

55:17.920 --> 55:19.200
No, not offensive as such.

55:20.480 --> 55:24.240
I think there was probably a misunderstanding about what

55:24.240 --> 55:25.120
the whole thing is about.

55:25.920 --> 55:28.640
So we won't be doing a 1.0 until a day later.

55:28.640 --> 55:32.320
Until a date that I haven't got because of Murphy's Law.

55:32.880 --> 55:33.760
Well, wait a minute now.

55:34.880 --> 55:38.160
I saw specific GIF animations that implied it may be coming

55:38.160 --> 55:39.840
to a stocking stuffer near me.

55:39.840 --> 55:40.880
This is your source.

55:40.880 --> 55:41.600
Yeah, GIFs.

55:43.040 --> 55:45.920
But they are GIFs on the Solus Project website.

55:45.920 --> 55:46.640
You didn't say that.

55:46.640 --> 55:48.160
Yeah, there you go.

55:48.160 --> 55:48.560
Yeah.

55:48.560 --> 55:49.040
Busted.

55:51.040 --> 55:54.560
So there's no specific date yet, just sometime before Santa

55:54.560 --> 55:56.320
turns up, which is not hard.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.000
You know, he's fat, so we should make it.

55:58.000 --> 55:58.720
Yeah, he's slim.

55:59.520 --> 56:02.240
Yeah, so sometime before Christmas.

56:02.240 --> 56:04.480
But I mean, there is a lot to be done yet, to be honest with you.

56:05.280 --> 56:08.640
Budgie at the moment is gone for a complete and utter rewrite.

56:08.640 --> 56:15.120
We put normal 3.18 for recently, which I noticed in the words.

56:15.120 --> 56:15.680
I'm not good at them.

56:16.640 --> 56:18.960
When you guys were showing up on the screen last time,

56:18.960 --> 56:22.240
it was shown normal 3.16, which kind of gave me an idea that

56:22.240 --> 56:25.040
that system was badly out of date.

56:25.040 --> 56:26.800
We've upgraded Kernel since then.

56:26.800 --> 56:29.520
We've done a lot of security updates since then.

56:29.520 --> 56:32.640
But in itself, it's not such a bad thing that it is out of date,

56:32.640 --> 56:34.880
because I may be completely and utterly broke, Budgie.

56:37.200 --> 56:41.600
So the 3.18 update, I mean, Budgie's nearly two years old.

56:41.600 --> 56:42.240
Yeah.

56:42.240 --> 56:46.560
So when I started out, it was normal 3.10 or something like that.

56:46.560 --> 56:48.320
We started out with the code base.

56:48.320 --> 56:50.880
And the stuff that we put in there to actually keep it all working,

56:51.440 --> 56:52.640
that's completely broken now.

56:52.640 --> 56:57.120
And GTK and Motör are on less drugs than they used to be.

56:57.120 --> 57:00.400
So all the workarounds that we used to have in place now break it.

57:00.400 --> 57:03.360
So we've had to do a complete rewrite of the Budgie desktop.

57:03.360 --> 57:07.600
But it now looks nothing like the old Budgie if you want it to,

57:07.600 --> 57:08.640
if that makes sense.

57:08.640 --> 57:10.880
It sounds like you're heading towards a cleaner version, though.

57:12.160 --> 57:13.520
Yeah, get rid of the old hacks.

57:13.520 --> 57:15.600
Basically, take out the trash, to be honest with you.

57:16.320 --> 57:18.640
There's a lot of it's built up after the last two years.

57:19.360 --> 57:21.120
So I mean, last two years, I mean,

57:21.120 --> 57:23.520
it's still two years of engineering experience put on top of that.

57:23.520 --> 57:26.560
So you're going to find a lot of stuff that makes you think,

57:26.560 --> 57:27.680
really, was that me?

57:28.400 --> 57:29.120
I'm ashamed.

57:30.160 --> 57:31.280
As in many projects.

57:31.280 --> 57:32.240
Yeah, that does happen.

57:33.040 --> 57:38.080
But OK, so when we were looking at it, I guess it could have been out of date.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.520
I suppose that is possible.

57:39.520 --> 57:42.160
Although I think what it was is I was showing,

57:42.160 --> 57:44.960
so every now and then I kind of waffle on this issue,

57:44.960 --> 57:50.080
almost every other review is a lot of times I get slammed for installing updates

57:50.080 --> 57:51.440
and customizing the distro.

57:51.440 --> 57:53.840
And actually, I'd be curious to hear your opinion.

57:53.840 --> 57:57.040
And then other times I get slammed for not changing the distribution.

57:57.040 --> 58:00.240
So I kind of, when it's like a boutique distro

58:00.240 --> 58:03.280
that is trying to deliver an experience, I try to go all defaults.

58:03.280 --> 58:06.480
And when it is something that I feel like is your day-to-day workhorse,

58:06.480 --> 58:10.000
like an LTS or a Fedora release, I try to customize.

58:10.720 --> 58:13.360
And I'm curious, Ike, so in your experience,

58:13.360 --> 58:15.920
if I was going to do a review of your distribution, say, down the road,

58:15.920 --> 58:19.360
would you prefer that I sort of live in it for a week and customize it?

58:19.360 --> 58:21.600
Or would you like me to go on air and tell people,

58:21.600 --> 58:23.280
you know, this is the experience right out of the box?

58:24.880 --> 58:27.760
Well, you see, it's not up for me to tell you what to do with your computer.

58:28.880 --> 58:31.680
We try and go over with same defaults by default.

58:33.520 --> 58:35.840
You know, you want things to look nice by default,

58:35.840 --> 58:38.960
but by no means are we trying to stop people from customizing things.

58:38.960 --> 58:42.240
I know there are certain design-led projects out there

58:42.240 --> 58:44.880
which would rather you didn't ever post a screenshot

58:44.880 --> 58:48.320
without a wallpaper within a certain hue, shade, and battery level.

58:48.320 --> 58:50.000
But we're not along those lines.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.400
You know, we're not really into the whole hipster culture.

58:52.400 --> 58:54.640
This is exactly how things should be.

58:54.640 --> 58:56.640
You know, if you want to put a picture of a dead pigeon

58:56.640 --> 58:59.520
or a dead budgie on there, for all matter, you can do it.

58:59.520 --> 58:59.920
Yeah.

58:59.920 --> 59:00.960
Really not bothered.

59:01.600 --> 59:02.480
Okay, good to know.

59:02.480 --> 59:03.200
Noted.

59:03.200 --> 59:06.400
So, all right, so I know we're going to retread some ground,

59:06.400 --> 59:08.960
but I, you know, just in case people haven't heard old episodes,

59:08.960 --> 59:10.240
I've got to ask this question.

59:10.960 --> 59:13.200
Are you completely crazy for creating your own desktop?

59:13.200 --> 59:15.680
And why don't you just tweak the GNOME 3 desktop?

59:15.680 --> 59:17.680
Because I don't like GNOME Shell.

59:18.640 --> 59:20.560
So, I like certain things about it.

59:20.560 --> 59:23.760
And when I first started out with Budgie, I thought, well, logical step.

59:23.760 --> 59:27.760
Let's try and, you know, shove a few things in here,

59:27.760 --> 59:28.720
get rid of the overview.

59:28.720 --> 59:31.360
Let's try and put something down the bottom that looks like a panel.

59:31.360 --> 59:34.240
But at the end of the day, as nice as GNOME Shell is,

59:34.240 --> 59:36.080
it is monstrously heavy.

59:36.080 --> 59:36.580
Yes.

59:37.440 --> 59:40.080
So, the computer I'm running on now is actually an Intel NUC,

59:40.080 --> 59:42.000
and it has 16 gigs of RAM.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.720
Now, that's more than most people have for any reason.

59:44.720 --> 59:46.640
Most people have for any day-to-day stuff.

59:46.640 --> 59:48.480
And I probably shouldn't complain, you know,

59:48.480 --> 59:50.800
when I have enough RAM to do everything I want to do.

59:50.800 --> 59:53.200
However, on cold boot with Budgie,

59:53.200 --> 59:55.280
I'm using just under 200 megs of RAM,

59:55.280 --> 59:57.040
and that's obviously with Intel graphics.

59:57.040 --> 59:58.880
If it was Nvidia graphics, you know yourself,

59:58.880 --> 59:59.920
it's going to be slightly higher.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.880
They do tend to leak.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.680
But with GNOME Shell, I'm using something like 760 megs of RAM just to start.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.640
Another problem with GNOME Shell that I found myself,

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.880
because everything is implemented as clutter.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.680
So, they have their own toolkit, which is a fork of MX.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.640
Basically, everything that's on the screen is a frame buffer object.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.640
So, if you, which is basically how clutter works.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.640
Now, when it comes to Budgie,

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:28.000
the only frame buffer objects basically are the windows themselves.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.880
And that's the things that we animate around and we push them around.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.200
When it comes to GNOME Shell, every last thing,

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.680
whether it's the little popover menus or the panel at the top or your wallpaper,

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.000
every single one of those is a frame buffer object,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.080
which is using more of your GPU,

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.400
which obviously means more GPU wakeups.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.480
And if you're using software rendering, that means a lot more CPU wakeups.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.760
That means you're actually using more power than you could be.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.680
And it also means that if you have shared video memory,

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.560
you have less of that to go around for the applications or the games that you're using.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.160
All right. I mean, that's all fair.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.840
But essentially, at the end of the day, though,

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.920
you are also sort of banking on some of the underlying technologies they're iterating on.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:10.000
I mean, obviously, for example, GTK 3.18 was important enough for you

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.600
that you're willing to sort of bump some things around and rework on it.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.520
So there's some underlying technology there that you must seem sound to you, right?

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.600
Yeah, I mean, that's the whole idea.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.560
So the GNOME technology, the GNOME stack, I absolutely love it.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.440
I have my problems and I do rant and bitch, but we all do.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.440
It's stuff that we work with on a daily basis.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.520
The only thing I don't like is the GNOME Shell itself.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.120
That's personally not for me. That's not how I want my desktop.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.440
That's very much, here's the experience you're getting, this is how we see it should be.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.520
But all the rest of the technology like libmotor, glib, valr,

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.680
we use all those stuff and we use them quite proudly.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.960
I mean, me, myself, I'm a member of the GNOME Foundation anyway,

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.480
and I'm quite happy to use GNOME technology and to see other people using it

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.040
and improving, contributing to it myself.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.200
So I try to, when I'm talking to people,

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.720
I try to get them to differentiate between GNOME and GNOME Shell,

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.000
because one is built on the other. It's exactly the same with Budgie.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.160
Budgie is built on GNOME, but Budgie couldn't exist without GNOME.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.160
It's very, very much dependent on it.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.160
And we're happy to integrate with all that,

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.040
because we don't have to go right in our own control centers,

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.200
our own sentence demons and all that crap.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.480
So to me, what it seems like the elephant in the room for a distribution like this

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.840
is sort of the big meta problem.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.960
And that is the community, the documentation, the packages, the how-tos,

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.800
all of the tribal knowledge. And so it seems like you run the risk of

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.440
basically the desktop becoming a feature of something else

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.280
that's based on a more mainstream desktop,

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.560
or I mean a more mainstream distribution of Linux.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.640
So what, when I'm looking at SolarOS,

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.560
what do you feel is the compelling thing about the underlying operating system

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.480
that is powering this pretty cool desktop

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:00.480
that would actually make me choose SolarOS itself

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.840
over, say, Budgie on something that's derived from Arch?

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.720
What is your thoughts there?

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.200
Well, straight off the bat, and I know everyone's going to flame me for this

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.280
and say, how dare you say this? This can't be true.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.360
Solus boots faster than Arch.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.680
I know it's a controversial statement,

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.080
and I'm probably going to be shot in my sleep for it, but it does.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.440
So before I did a reinstall on my Nook,

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.920
Arch, I'm saying Arch now,

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.640
Solus boots in just over a second for me.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:32.320
The highest I got it is 1.189 seconds, and I didn't bother optimizing it anymore.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.840
It did seem extremely fast to me as well.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.240
Yeah, the point is, Solus is not a generic distribution.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.600
While you can take a generic distribution and try and shoehorn it to your needs,

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.920
the fact is that thing can run on everything from a toaster to a satellite,

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.680
whereas Solus can.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.120
You can't put it on a Raspberry Pi, you can't put it on a server,

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.480
you're not putting on embedded hardware,

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.560
you don't have the potential to do any of that.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.920
So there isn't any situation where we have to have 100 different package codes

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.280
or different package conflicts,

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.520
and we have to worry about all these different groups

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.120
and all these different architectures.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.720
Solus is built specifically for an x86-64 computer,

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.840
and only for the desktop.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.600
So there's only a desktop kernel,

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.760
and it's a single kernel that we maintain.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.400
It's our configuration for a 64-bit desktop.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:14.880
Focus.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.680
Yeah, and that's up and down the entire stack.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.000
Now, don't get me wrong, people say to me,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.160
well, why don't you take Debian, you know, strip it down,

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.560
just do a kernel config there.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.840
It's still the same situation,

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.320
because you still have all those packages, right?

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.360
And I can't exactly go through rebuilding the whole distribution.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.880
Now, I've made that mistake before, and that was Solus OS.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:36.800
We all know what happened.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.480
I ended up closing down Solus OS,

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.800
because in the early days when that was happening,

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.840
at the end of 1.3, when we closed doors,

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.000
I had over 7,000 packages that was maintained outside of Debian within Solus,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.520
because the amount of problems I had trying to implement what I wanted to do.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:56.000
So it's actually easier for me to be a from scratch distribution.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.880
The main thing with us is being focused entirely on the desktop.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:03.200
But unlike some of the projects that come out and say,

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.120
yes, we are desktop-orientated,

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.840
we are looking at mainstream desktop usage.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.160
That means, can I use this for my work at the office?

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.080
And for me, I need to do it for my job.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.120
So I'm a software engineer.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.400
I need to be able to do that.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.200
But at the end of the day,

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.040
I still need to be able to go on and watch YouTube.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.360
I still need Netflix.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:24.320
So Aiki, is it your impression really that my question is maybe out of date

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.000
and really the end user doesn't give a shit what the underlying distro is?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.720
And as long as it watches YouTube and reads Facebook

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:35.760
and does Gmail and Google Docs and Office 365 and Chrome or Vivaldi,

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:40.160
is it in your impression that that would be what all that really matters?

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.120
And if you create the own,

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.680
I guess what I'm trying to ask you is,

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.000
do you feel like when I look at your distribution,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.320
I think to myself, well, geez, there's all these packages not available.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.080
But it sounds like to you, that's not even a concern at all.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.840
No, I understand a lot of people are going to say it's like,

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.120
well, you're building this from scratch.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.200
You've got to make all these packages.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.640
And that's going to be very, very difficult.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.400
So we've tackled quite a few problems with the whole packaging situation in Solus.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.560
It got to a point, it was probably about six months back,

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.240
we say, right, all this manual packaging is a complete and utter pain in the backside.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.080
And so the simple answer was, automate the shit out of it.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.120
So I'm going to, I'll give you a link there now on IRC so you can see it yourself.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:25.940
Okay.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.240
Because here's where I'm going with this is, I mean,

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.120
I guess, Ike, what I'm trying to get to is,

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.960
is this maybe coming down to a philosophical difference?

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:47.360
A fundamental, different expectation from who you're creating this distribution for

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.440
and maybe who would normally consider themselves an advanced Linux user.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.800
And the reason why I bring this up is I want to introduce you,

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.480
and of course, I'm sure you're aware of it too,

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:01.440
Velt OS, which is using your desktop environment but built on top of...

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.640
Arch Linux.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.680
Arch Linux.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.320
And it promises you everything Arch has with the rolling base, the AUR,

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.080
but yet this new nice... The package manager that many people already know.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.600
But with this nice new desktop.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.960
Oh, and of course, the Vivaldi browser as default.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.200
What are your thoughts about Velt OS?

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.120
And this seems like a natural kind of open source thing to happen

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.640
when you have a pretty compelling desktop,

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.000
but a base that maybe is not appealing to the more advanced user.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:28.800
Your thoughts, sir?

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:32.480
Sure. I mean, you've got, I say this to everyone.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.600
People say to me about, why didn't you use Pacman for Arch?

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:36.960
And to sum it up in a statement,

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.640
I don't care about package managers.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.160
Okay.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.480
The fact that people still care about them in this day and age

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.480
is nothing short of disturbing for me

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.120
when we're saying that Linux has no mainstream adoption,

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.840
yet it must have the most advanced package manager of rollbacks,

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:53.680
it must have user repositories, it must have exit compression.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.000
Nobody should actually be caring about that in this day and age.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.040
They want Linux to actually get somewhere on the desktop.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:03.120
So in the case of Velt, I mean, that's built on Arch Linux, that's great.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.200
I'm actually concentrating on building something

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.240
that focuses on working from the ground up.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.320
So the user never has to mess about with anything.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.920
At the same time, I don't want to make something

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.160
that's completely condescending to the point

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.240
that it's holding your hand the whole way through.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.840
So you were talking about philosophy.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:21.600
Some part of it is philosophy, the fact that it will get out of your way.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.200
And the other part is that no distribution actually exists

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.680
that is optimized for a desktop experience.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.800
Everything is shoehorned because you take a generic distribution

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.040
and you try and apply it to the task at hand,

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.840
which we've already shown doesn't work.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:40.160
Now, as for Velt OS, yes, they're using Budgie Desktop at the moment.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.120
They've claimed that they're starting their own new desktop.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:47.360
There was a bit of attention about this on Softpedia, as I'm sure you saw.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.640
Initially said that they were forking Budgie Desktop.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.640
They later retracted the statement to say that they wasn't forking Budgie Desktop.

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.680
Now, I went along and looked into their package repos.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.800
I looked on GitHub.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:04.080
They renamed the package to VOS Budgie Desktop and made another change to it.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.760
The mock-ups they've put up in their community,

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.520
I mean, I'm not going to insult their mock-ups.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.920
They're not quite my thing, right?

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.360
They're not quite for me.

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.560
I follow your lead.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.000
But they've never at any stage ever approached us

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.720
about getting changes made in Budgie.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.040
So they themselves are showing their own project immaturity

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.880
by attempting a fork and then, you know,

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.280
then going back and saying, oh, well, we're not forking now

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:33.920
because they was made to look stupid, to be quite honest.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.000
Everyone was saying, why are you forking it?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.280
Well, we're not forking it.

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.320
That's OK.

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.960
But had they just approached us upstream and said, you know,

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.960
these are the changes we're going to put in,

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.760
even the Budgie Desktop in its current iteration

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.000
supports applets, and it can be built out of tree.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.120
It has an API.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.320
You can develop your own plugins.

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.760
You can develop your own applets.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.160
There's absolutely no need for a fork at all.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.200
So if it was another project, I would say, OK,

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.560
maybe you've got something going.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.240
But I don't quite see it.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.240
So you feel pretty soundly that the entire,

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.840
in order for the desktop experience

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.080
that you're trying to create, the entire thing

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.680
needs to be a complete package.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.120
It's not abstractable.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.160
You can't really remove the desktop from the underlying OS

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.120
because the underlying OS is fundamentally

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.520
built to sort of support what the desktop is

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.240
trying to deliver.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.640
Am I following your basic logic?

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.280
Well, I mean, if you really want to go and remove it, you can.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.080
That's not a problem.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.520
I mean, we've got normal shell and repos.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.080
We've got GDM.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.360
So you can switch to desktop if that's up your street.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.040
But I mean, out of the box, nobody

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.560
has to worry about a package runner.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.240
That's kind of the idea we're getting to.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.200
It's an operating system.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.240
You run daily.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.760
It looks after itself.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.280
And this has kind of been my problem

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.560
with distros and operating systems over the years.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.040
We have all these workarounds that we put into place.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.360
We have these config files that we go edit in.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.400
We have these packages.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.200
We go add in because we know that they add the functionality

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:53.760
we need.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.240
Or we have these set fixes that we know always work.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.320
Yet the distribution of the operating themselves

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.560
never does anything about it for you.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.800
Now, my argument should be it's an operating system.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.800
So it should operate.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.120
It should actually do what it knows how to do.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.040
And I don't see any distribution like that.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.920
And that's my argument against any current desktop

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.800
distribution.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.640
They don't look after themselves.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.560
You have to maintain the distribution.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.400
You have to maintain the distribution.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.920
It doesn't maintain itself.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.160
What is sort of the, you know, let's just say,

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.760
let's say you managed to beat Santa.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.400
And as an end user, something I might want to install

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.680
on my machine arrives.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.280
After it's installed for a bit, what does the update picture

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:35.760
look like?

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.640
You know, a few months down the road, a year down the road.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.640
What can I expect as sort of a long-term maintenance

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.680
of my Solus rig?

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.800
So in terms of support, what we decided to do,

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.880
figured it'd be kind of an effort to have like one

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.240
release and then an LTS release.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.560
And to be honest, I'm going to lose count.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.560
And I'm not the best fellow with numbers.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.840
So what we decided to do is we'd do a release.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.760
We'd do that release each year.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.240
And then each release gets a two-year support.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.120
Because ones and twos are very easy for me to add up.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.480
So every two years, you know, your distribution as it was

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.280
loses support.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.880
But you've already had two releases since then.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.760
Do you know?

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.960
So if I release this sometime in December, next December,

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.040
there would be the new release, which would be 2.0.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.800
But the one you're already using would already

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.640
be supported for that next year as well.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.440
Or you can upgrade.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.120
Very nice.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.320
That makes sense.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.280
Some options, yeah.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.720
Wes, any other follow-up questions

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.840
before we wrap up here?

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.880
What have you thought after using it for a bit?

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.080
You looked at VELT OS 2.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.160
Was there something that struck you between the differences?

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.440
VELT did feel a little more bolted together.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.800
You know, it's also very new where Solus has clearly

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:45.440
had a lot of thought.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.560
One of the things VELT gets is sort of inheriting

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.320
sort of all of that work there.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.320
But at the same time, I mentioned this in the review

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.200
on the Linux Action Show.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.720
If you guys haven't had a chance to listen to it yet,

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.400
I wouldn't want to over-promote.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.680
But you might want to go check it out.

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.880
I mean, you just might want to go check it out

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.680
before you finish listening.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:04.320
You definitely should.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:04.720
Yeah.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.560
And in there, one of the things is I really

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:07.920
like the idea of something.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.520
And I don't know if I really touched on it very well.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.800
But what I really like is something

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.800
that's just I'm focused on the desktop.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.520
I'm not worried about ARM and mobile and convergence.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.240
I'm not worried about the server and cloud.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.520
I'm not worried about any of that.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.200
I am worried about kick-ass desktops

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.640
and kick-ass laptops.

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.720
And there is something about starting at the very beginning

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.000
with that intent and moving your project forward

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.560
over a series of years with that intent,

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.480
but not getting so, so, so, so far lost into it.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.000
No offense to the elementary OS folks,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.440
because they still do great work,

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.160
but not getting so lost into it that it takes literally

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.640
years for things to happen, which is just not happening

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.200
for any power Linux user.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.880
So what SolOS seems to be trying to strike the balance of

01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:00.080
is here's something that has a pretty fast development pace.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.400
It really is truly targeted for your high-end workstation,

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.640
an engineering station, a development station,

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.640
a sysadmin station, whatever.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.440
You know, a great porn machine, whatever you want to do,

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.640
it's targeted well for that.

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.440
And you know what?

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.880
Yeah, there's things called the Raspberry Pi.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.480
Yeah, there's things called the Nexus 4

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.600
that you can install images on.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.640
Don't care about that.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.560
There is something about that intention

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.600
that appeals to me quite a bit.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.080
What do you think?

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.760
Well, I think we see that space,

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.680
like just the number of developers

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.120
who end up using MacBooks.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.960
You know, they want that desktop development

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.880
or desktop environment that gets out of their way.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.400
They don't have to worry about package management.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.560
So if SolOS can deliver on some of those things,

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.320
you know, at first I was thinking like,

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.640
well, you know, it's another package manager to learn.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.160
A lot of people like to use Ubuntu on the desktop

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.200
because they use Ubuntu on the server.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.120
But there's lots of people already who, you know,

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.120
use the Mac, use a different environment or Windows.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.200
So if this can be the kind of desktop where you install it,

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.000
you don't have to worry about it.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:50.640
You've got your shell.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.480
You've got, you know, YouTube that works.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.720
And also, it's very pretty and usable.

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:55.680
I could see that.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:58.000
There's something bold about a Linux distribution

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.840
that's saying, yeah, we're for power users,

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.840
but don't think about the package manager.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.480
Right.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.440
There's something kind of bold about that.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.200
I don't know how that's going to shape out.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.600
I mean, I think we'll see when 1.0 is out.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.040
But yeah, you can see how maybe it's time

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.800
we start talking and going that direction.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.480
All right, Aiki.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:15.040
Yeah, go ahead.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.520
Feel free to jump in and tell us how we're wrong.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.440
Well, so I mean, that is definitely one of the things

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.840
that I really don't care about the package manager.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.720
Now, another thing to remember is Solos

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.920
is about having a stable core and up-to-date applications.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.120
Which is a thing of mine.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:33.600
I love that.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.800
I mean, yeah, so I mean, we're using the example here of Arch,

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.200
right?

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.800
Arch Linux is a role in release.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.680
So to give you an example, which many Arch users

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.040
have gone through themselves, you have to go into the block

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.880
because these binaries or these libraries are gone.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.800
So you have to now move these files across,

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.440
which is unavoidable and it cannot be solved

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.800
by their package management.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.560
So the package manager here doesn't mean nothing.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.680
To put a nice label on a package,

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.600
it's a tarball with a bit of information.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.520
It's just a glorified tarball.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.360
That's all a package is, right?

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.720
So as much as somebody might derive from Arch Linux

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.400
and they might have our desktop on it

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.480
and it might make it very, very, very pretty.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.360
At the end of the day, they're going

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.640
to run into these update problems

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.160
because it is a role in release.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.520
Something like a libpng update, which breaks the entire system.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.160
Now, I can imagine there's a few Arch Linux users around

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.280
who can remember that.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.040
Or the rename of the JPEG libraries,

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.240
any one of those incidents.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:28.160
So role in release already has a major disadvantage

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:32.400
in a desktop, which is aimed at not just Linux users,

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.840
at people who just want to use their computer.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.240
They're not going to be able to fix that.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.720
So yeah, that's kind of our take on it.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.240
In terms of adding packages, we're one of the easiest,

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.440
if not the easiest, distribution going to package for.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.040
The average package meter information file that we have

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.040
is probably about 30 lines.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.600
Most of that's auto-generated from a tarball.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:59.600
So adding a package probably takes a couple of minutes

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.560
in our distribution.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.120
So if somebody wants something, we'll add it.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.640
The thing is, we're not going to go around looking

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.680
for the packages to add.

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:08.480
Because at the end of the day, I don't know what people use.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.920
I don't really feel like you need to defend it.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.400
It almost seems like in a year or two,

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.440
it's going to be obvious.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.280
And you just might be a little bit ahead of the curve

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:19.120
because you have the XGG app stuff on the GNOME side.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.040
And also, the KD guy has been talking

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:24.160
about containerized applications that are easily

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.920
portable between distributions.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:28.160
You now have folks like Valve that are shipping

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.040
Steam with the Steam runtime environment where you install

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:34.160
Steam on Fedora and OpenSUSE and on Arch.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.360
And what are you actually getting?

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.400
You're getting an Ubuntu runtime inside your Steam folder.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.040
And they're making this possible now by saying,

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.160
target these libraries.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.080
We guarantee that if they have Steam installed,

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.760
they'll have these libraries because we're

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.040
putting them on the system.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.080
And I think when you have commercial vendors that

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.760
are coming up with solutions like that,

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.440
you have the open source guys that

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.680
are looking at things like XGG app

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.600
and containerized applications.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.680
It is being solved by multiple different sources and forces.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:04.240
And you don't have to really worry about that problem

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.120
maybe in a year or so.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:07.440
Right.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.960
And that's one of the things I've been trying

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.240
to get across a while for people.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.880
So I mean, one of the things we have to accept as a project,

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.880
I mean, we're coming up for a 1.0, right?

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:17.600
Most people are like, who the hell is Solus?

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.320
Never heard of you.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.760
Don't really care.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.840
So we have to acknowledge the fact that we

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.520
will have a 1.0 come out.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.640
This is the distribution Solus come in and out and say,

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.840
hello, we exist now.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.040
You should probably get interested.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.480
Yeah.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.680
Which is something you have to accept.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:34.000
I mean, you've got to put your foot in the door somehow.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.400
But when it comes to 2.0, I mean, one of the things

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.320
we're working towards is making Solus stateless.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.680
It's one of the things I've actually adopted from work,

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.800
which basically means there are no configuration files

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.360
by default.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.320
There are no overrides.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.680
Everything is the same default.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.720
And it would quite literally mean your ETC tree being empty,

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.320
which is something worth thinking about there, right?

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.400
Another thing I want to do when we come up to Solus

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.320
2.0, which I can't do at the moment,

01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.840
because we have to get the distro out there.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.360
We have to get people to know it.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:02.640
They have to say, this is Solus.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.440
Look what we do.

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.960
We're very pretty, aren't we, right?

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.480
You have to do all that sort of thing.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.200
But for 2.0, I mean, you're going to be seeing

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.840
a complete separation between the operating system

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.120
and everything that you have.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.640
Because as far as I'm at, the best example I can give,

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.840
like the 3.18 update that I put in for Gnome.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.640
Now, that was to put the new user land applications in,

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.720
because people want the new pretty knowledge.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:25.840
They love all that shiny stuff.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.520
Thank you, by the way.

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.720
Oh, no, it's absolutely fine.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.000
Google Drive as well, why not?

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.840
But people want all that stuff, which is absolutely fine.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.040
But at what cost?

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.040
That should not break the operating system.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.200
Now, in our case, Budgie would be considered

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.720
part of the operating system.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:43.440
That's the stack in the shell that everybody gets, right?

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.800
Now, that should not be broken.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.600
So when we go towards 2.0, you're going to see

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.040
a separation between that.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.520
Applications will be out in the user's control,

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.600
but you won't be able to break the operating system.

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.120
So an update to an app won't break the OS, and vice versa.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.040
The OS itself wouldn't break the apps,

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.880
which I think is something that really

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.120
needs to start happening for something

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.200
that wants to be mainstream and a desktop.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.360
Well, that's very ambitious.

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:11.440
And I would love it if you would check back in with us

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.800
from time to time and give us an update.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.240
I've also been following the blogs, like the weekly,

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.240
like number 11 just got posted, I believe,

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.760
which has kind of been giving some good insight on updates.

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.640
Exactly.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.600
So Aiki, thank you very much for coming on

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.360
and sharing with us.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.680
And I'm going to keep checking it out.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.760
I now have it installed.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.400
And I don't know, maybe one day.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.000
Yeah, JB community, do the same.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.120
We'll go out, try to break it.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.040
Could be the distro of choice one day.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:39.760
Check back in.

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.880
Do make sure and break it.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.800
And while you're at it, make sure you keep an eye out

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.160
for Budgie Next, which is the replacement for Budgie,

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.840
which is very, very, very sexy, by the way.

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.760
It has a notification center as well.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.280
That is, I mean, that is honestly looking like it's worth

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.600
its own episode to discuss because the video that was

01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.200
posted looked very nice.

01:20:59.200 --> 01:20:59.760
Yeah.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.400
Yeah, it's definitely.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.840
And we have links to all of that in the show notes.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:02.320
All right.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.760
Aiki, you are welcome to stick around.

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.040
Thank you for coming on the show today

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:05.840
and telling us about that.

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:10.080
Before we move on to the last topic, which I hope,

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.040
I hope doesn't get me fired from the show.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.720
Hopefully the boss doesn't fire me.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.280
But before we get to that, I want to talk about our friends

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.960
over at Linux Academy.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.840
Now, Linux Academy is a platform built around educating you

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.400
around all of the technologies that make Linux a really

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.520
awesome platform.

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.880
Of course, Linux itself is good.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.720
And there's tons of stuff you could learn just there.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:32.000
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to get the Linux

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.200
unplug discount.

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:37.280
Linux Academy is not like, I don't even want to point you

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.000
in the wrong direction.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
But let's just say, I don't know if you're familiar

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:40.480
with this, Wes.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.960
But there are a lot of resources online for learning.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.680
Yes, there are.

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.160
Yeah.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.920
And a lot of them have what you might call features that they

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.040
just kind of throw on there.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.240
It's more like a kitchen sink kind of thing.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.280
There you go, Wes.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.560
That's not the Linux Academy.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.640
It was created by people that are actually genuinely

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.800
enthusiastic about Linux and open source.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.160
And then they have the idea, well,

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.400
why don't we just pair up with our friends that are educators

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.760
and get some professors in here.

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.360
And then we have these folks that we

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.160
know that are developers.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.600
They could create this incredible platform,

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:06.480
and they've done it.

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.120
And for me, one of the key features about Linux Academy

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.600
is you log in and you can look at all of the courseware

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.120
and all of these things that are sort

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:17.200
of mythological technologies or skill sets

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.840
that you've only dreamed of before are now

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:23.760
all of a sudden quantified in hours and your commitment.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.760
And that is really a powerful situation.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.840
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to see

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.480
what I'm talking about.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.640
They've got almost 2,000 self-paced courses

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.400
with instructor help available.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.480
Seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from.

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:37.120
The courseware automatically adjusts,

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.640
and so do the virtual servers.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.480
I really like that aspect because they

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:44.160
realize it's not just a Red Hat world or a Debian world.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.520
Or an Ubuntu world.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.320
Thank you, sir.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.440
There's seven plus distributions

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.080
you get to choose from.

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:50.640
They have scenario-based labs, which are really kick ass.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.160
You get to go in there and do something

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.160
that's like something you would do actually at work.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.280
Which, what a concept, right?

01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.960
But they really have thought this out.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.360
Also, they recognize you're probably

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.240
going to want to work on this stuff

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.400
through an SSH connection from your desktop.

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.560
So you can just bring up your favorite terminal application.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.560
You can SSH into a DNS name.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.840
You get access to these things.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.440
If you're doing AWS training, they'll

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.440
spin up the AWS rigs for you.

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.400
It's really cool.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.880
And also, one of the things that I respect

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.040
as somebody who gets super busy with three kids

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.080
and my own business is they have an availability plan.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.400
You can log into the dashboard and tell Linux Academy,

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.480
basically, I'm going to follow the Jupyter Broadcasting

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.320
calendar and make sure I watch every live show.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.400
And every moment where Jupyter Broadcasting isn't live

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.440
make me available.

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:36.960
Or I've got a lot of work and Thanksgiving this week,

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.640
so I'm not available on Thursday.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.840
I'm going to take Friday off.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.320
But you know what?

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.240
I might dedicate four hours on Saturday

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.920
and an hour on Sunday evening after everybody

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:44.640
goes to bed.

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.560
You go into Linux Academy, just kind of give it

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.800
your availability, and it will automatically

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.000
generate courseware that matches that with quiz reminders

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.280
and all of that kind of stuff.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.160
It is really cool.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.560
Also, they've done a whole new update on their CDN,

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:57.840
so things are faster than ever.

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.080
They're downloadable, comprehensive study guides,

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:03.280
the audio stuff, and the video distributions you can watch.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.560
I've heard from several people now

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:10.640
that listen to the Linux Academy stuff in the shower.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:11.280
Wow.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:11.920
Specifically.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:12.960
Huh.

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.160
I mean, you might as well learn something

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:14.960
while you're getting clean.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.160
I'm not making this up.

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:19.600
Like, at meetups, even when I was at Denver,

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.720
he's like, I'm another guy that listens in the shower

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.760
to Linux Academy.

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.120
Like, add me to the list.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.200
I don't know, maybe, you know what?

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.560
Maybe, have you ever heard of shower thoughts?

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.200
Yes, I have.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:31.440
Yeah.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:35.680
What if it's not just like really great ideas

01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:36.960
when you're in the shower?

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.440
What if it's like your brain is in overdrive

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.880
and you can crazy learn?

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.080
What if that's what it is?

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.040
Because I'm not kidding you.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.320
A lot of people have told me they listen

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.600
to Linux Academy in the shower.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.200
And I'm trying to figure out what's going on here.

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:50.000
And now I'm realizing shower thoughts plus training,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.400
oh my gosh, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.320
Go learn all of the fundamental technologies

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:55.520
that make Linux kick ass.

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:56.720
And when you don't have a lot of time,

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.240
they also have dim nuggets.

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.560
These are just like deep dives into a specific area.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.480
Like, here's one on managing iSCSI,

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.080
which you probably are a total expert on

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.440
and don't need any help, I'm sure.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.960
But maybe if you wanted to be set up

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.440
an HTTP secure proxy over SSH or do some SSH tunneling.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.320
And you do want to.

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.520
I mean, if you don't know how now,

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.800
just go learn it right now.

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:15.840
Again, these are nuggets.

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:16.640
And look at this list.

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.320
This list is cray.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:21.120
Everything from reverse tunnels

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.320
to setting up active directory under Linux.

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.320
I'm telling you, they've got it all.

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:29.280
So go check them out at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.600
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.280
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.840
And I hope you guys go eat a whole bunch of turkey.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.840
I know some of you guys will be at least.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.800
Go put, and gals, go put some turkey in your face.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.640
So Wes, kind of a big moment happened this week.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.760
I don't know if you noticed,

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.600
it might have, you might have missed it,

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:52.160
but GNOME turned 20 years old this week.

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.360
20 years old.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.400
That is impressive.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.040
Yeah, it is, man.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:57.280
It's been with us for a long time now.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.520
And it's brought many interesting fundamental technologies

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.600
that we now use on the Linux desktop today.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.040
So it's kind of a big deal.

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.760
And there's a lot still coming to GNOME in 20 years.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.320
Also, another milestone this week.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.240
LibreOffice hit a thousand contributors

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:15.200
going from September 2010 to October 2015.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.640
A thousand developers.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.760
And they have some interesting stats too, you know?

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.880
They pretty much added 16 new hackers a month

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.120
since September 2010

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.440
as a result of a global mentoring effort

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.600
by some of the project founders.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.000
And after five years and a thousand new developers,

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.400
they are sitting in a pretty good position now.

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.080
And they have wide distribution.

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.760
They're really well known.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.880
Default install on many distributions.

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.280
And yet, both LibreOffice and the GIMP

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:49.200
have really failed to unseat

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:51.280
the industry professional products,

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:54.720
like, you know, Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Office.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.200
20 years of the GIMP.

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:03.040
Is it time to just admit that sometimes

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:07.760
open source will never be a completely competitive replacement?

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.260
Wes?

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:10.960
Well, I think there's something to that.

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:14.080
I think you can also frame it in a couple different ways.

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.240
And I think one way to look at it is that, yes,

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:20.240
I mean, there are some reasons that we really should all talk about.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:21.680
You know, that maybe this is the case.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.520
But I think the other way to look at it is that

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.760
maybe it's not as competitive.

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.440
Maybe it doesn't meet the high-end business needs.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.120
You know, maybe professionals aren't using it

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.640
for their day-to-day workflows.

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:35.760
But we do have a very successful, you know, free application

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.320
that is kind of the right of any human to use, right?

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:42.080
Like, as part of a free society, I think we need these essential tools.

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.520
You know, you get a free operating system.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.040
You can get this free image editor.

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.440
And, you know, if you have a business case,

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.800
then you have to shell out for something more.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.320
Let's say after 20 years,

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:53.360
GIMP manages to get to 80% of what Photoshop can do.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.240
Well, then, essentially what you're saying is you flip that around,

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.600
and that means that 80% of humanity now has access to

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.120
a fairly competent photo editor.

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.800
Yeah, right. I mean, it doesn't matter what you make,

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:03.840
how much resources you have.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.240
If you have access to a computer, you can do these things.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.920
You can edit your photos. You can touch things up.

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.600
You know, I think that's success.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.120
I do agree that we need more pressure to reach the higher-end features.

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.200
And I think that we could unseat some of that market.

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.800
It's obviously not happening.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.720
Apparently, I said no at some point instead of GIMP.

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.080
I have no idea. Who can keep it straight?

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:24.960
I was thinking, obviously, so much of GIMP and GTK are closely connected.

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.800
But does anybody in the Mumble Room have any thoughts on,

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.080
here we are 20 years of GIMP,

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.320
and it's still really not quite there yet for pretty much any professional use.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.200
I've dreamed for the day that I could switch my mom,

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.480
a professional graphic artist, to GIMP.

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:37.520
Yeah, I think we all have.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.480
And it's not there yet.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.960
So, Rottencorp, you and I were chatting about this on the pre-show.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.760
What are your thoughts about it, looking at it sort of from a design standpoint?

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:48.640
Well, yeah, I'm actually a professional designer, and I use Photoshop.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:55.200
In an ashamed situation where I don't want to use Photoshop,

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:58.320
but it's the best option, so that's why I use it.

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:02.880
And it's not necessarily the fact that they haven't been pushing it enough.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:08.880
It's mostly the fact that GIMP's problem is that the people who control

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.720
the future of GIMP don't care about community input.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:17.920
So there's been multiple forks that have created things like layer styles

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:23.680
that has been one of the most important things that people wanted from Photoshop.

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.920
People wanted from Photoshop in GIMP for a decade.

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.720
It has actually existed since 2008 as a plugin,

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.840
but GIMP refused to actually look into it at all to give it as a standard.

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:41.200
And there's other things like that, like CMYK also exists as a plugin,

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:44.080
but again, they refused to put it in the main system.

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:48.880
And it took 10 years of people complaining to GIMP

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:53.440
to get them to do a single window mode, and they don't even do it by default.

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:57.840
So majority of people who use GIMP don't even know that there is a single window mode.

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:01.280
So it's mostly the fact that they have a vision.

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.200
If you don't agree with it, they don't care.

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:14.720
And that's what the biggest fundamental of that is the leaders of GIMP are not making progress.

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:20.240
And they have such a huge market in the open source graphic world.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:24.640
There's not really any competitors against them because they just kind of take over.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:30.800
So I think it's mostly they don't really want to progress it as much as it could be,

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:37.520
but also they've already taken so much market away from the people who could do what

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:41.920
the whole community wants that they kind of give up and the developers just go somewhere else.

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:47.120
Poby, I wanted to hear from you because I hear what Rotten Corpse just said and I thought,

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:51.840
okay, I think where a lot of us have been is you've got to throw everything behind GIMP

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.800
because so often in the open source community it's fork, fork, fork, fork.

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:58.320
Everybody's got a revolutionary idea and we constantly are rebuilding the foundation

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.400
and never actually getting to that end user polish.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.600
And I'm curious what your take is, Poby.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.600
Here we are 20 years after GIMP.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:08.560
Have we sort of all been betting on the wrong horse?

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:11.520
Is it just something a matter of wait another 20 years?

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.320
What do you think, Poby?

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:18.320
So this is a tricky one because I'm not a designer. I opened GIMP and I use like three features out of GIMP.

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.520
And it works for you, right?

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:25.520
Right. All I do is set the color levels on a picture of my cat and then

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:28.800
unsharp mask and then export it out as a PNG.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.880
Great post by the way this morning. That was a good one.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.240
Thanks very much. Yeah.

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:34.880
He's very photogenic, my cat.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:40.880
So, you know, I'm not the best person, but in an open source community,

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:46.000
in an open source in general, I think part of the problem is, you know,

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.880
we just don't have enough people working on the thing.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.680
You know, I've mentioned before that hundreds of people at Samsung who work on, you know,

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:59.440
one particular component of their platform or the hundreds or thousands of people at Microsoft

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.680
who work on one particular component.

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:06.640
We've got people who are not necessarily working on this in full time, but part time.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:11.760
They're doing a job, then when they get home and, you know, put their kids to bed

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:15.440
and have made food for the family, then they start hacking on free software.

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:18.560
Or after they finish doing their studies, they're hacking on free software.

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:22.640
Who are we to tell them that they're not doing a good enough job?

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:26.400
And Wimby, I want to give you a chance to sound in here too.

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:30.480
Do you feel like really in the big picture GIMP is actually good enough?

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.520
Well, again, I'm not a professional graphics designer,

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:36.800
so you're asking the wrong person.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.440
No, actually I think...

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:41.200
A bit like Popeye, I'm more of a super user because I use four features from GIMP.

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.000
This is sort of perfect, right?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.400
This is sort of Wes's premise is that really if GIMP gets 80% of the way there,

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:53.200
then that means it appeals to 80% of the users, which is kind of a big deal.

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:56.560
So I'm kind of curious to hear your take as a non-professional designer.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.040
Yeah, no, it does a job for me.

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:05.680
I always install it as the go-to graphics editor on my Linux workstations.

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:14.400
And I think most of my difficulty with using GIMP comes from the fact that I don't know how

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:17.200
to drive graphics applications in the first place.

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:21.280
It's not that GIMP is hard to use, I just don't know how to do it.

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:25.040
So I always have to go and Google, you know, the more complicated things.

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:29.360
But, you know, and the other thing to think about GIMP is if it wasn't for GIMP,

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.040
we wouldn't have GTK.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:31.600
Thank you.

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:32.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.000
And that was sort of what I was implying earlier.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:39.440
The G in GTK is GIMP, it's not GNOME or GNU.

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:42.480
Right, yeah, that was what I was getting to earlier, sort of implying that.

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.760
And Rodin, go ahead.

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:46.480
As somebody who, you know, thinks about this probably a little more than most of us do,

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:50.800
since we're not super power users in graphics, you have a chance to respond.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.360
Go ahead.

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:57.440
Yeah, well, I just wanted to say that, wow, I think GIMP is atrocious for professionals.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.120
Not in the sense that it's, you know, when I say they're not professionals so they don't know,

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:06.480
it's not that it's bad, it's that it's fundamentally garbage.

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:14.560
When the methodologies that for normal proper technique of design are impossible to do in

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:17.120
your application, it's fundamentally crap.

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:20.720
You think it'll never, you think it will never serve the role that the professional needs them?

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.480
No, actually, I don't.

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:29.600
I think the fact that it took 10 years to just get everything in one window means that the fact that

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:36.160
I want non-destructive editing and I want the ability to have CMYK and I want layer styles and

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:42.560
smart objects and all these different things for multiple composites, that there is probably

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:45.600
a minimum 10 years more for one of those.

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.560
Are you going to pay a developer to do that then?

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.520
No, I have Photoshop.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.560
No, but you say, I want this, I want that.

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:59.200
You can't just like rock up to the door, knock on the door of the GIMP developers and then say,

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.400
I want these things.

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:02.240
You should do it because I want it.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:09.360
I want to create, I will happily put my money in where my mouth is for having a GIMP

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:14.640
is not going to be that because GIMP, the people who are behind GIMP don't want to be that and

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:19.520
have specifically said that they have no intention of ever actually competing with Photoshop,

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.560
which is fine.

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:21.600
It's their decision.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:22.400
That's fine.

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:27.040
But people should stop comparing them because they're not even remotely close.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:30.640
That is actually, that is actually just a posse right there.

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:31.920
An interesting point.

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:35.440
You know, I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.120
I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.600
going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.440
to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:50.400
that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.280
not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:56.000
to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.600
that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:02.560
not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.560
going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:11.720
workflow, but people chose to dog on me for the wrong thing.

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:18.040
What I took away from that was there are a great amount of tools on the Linux desktop

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:24.200
right now that we constantly get stuck in the mode of comparing to the proprietary alternative

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:31.000
like Final Cut or Adobe Premiere or in the case of GIMP, obviously Photoshop.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.240
We constantly are doing, well this is not as good as that.

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:39.640
Photoshop is an incredible program with a massive legacy that appeals to a niche.

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:40.640
It's market.

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:44.160
I mean, that's the company for designers, so they have all of the resources there.

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:47.360
Wes, what I've been reflecting on is, so on Sunday's episode of the Linux Action Show

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:52.160
coming up, because of the holiday, we wanted to talk about some open source projects that

01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:55.200
we are genuinely thankful for that have improved our lives.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.200
Well, that's a good idea.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.920
Yeah, so we're going to do like a thanks to open source.

01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:58.920
We haven't done it for a few years.

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:03.720
In fact, I'd love to hear the audience's ideas if you want to go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:10.320
and submit them, but one of the things I was reflecting on about all of this really is

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:19.220
if GIMP never ever is a serious alternative to Photoshop for those really high-end power

01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:24.040
users or designers, that is perfectly okay.

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.560
When we're talking about something that is open source in GPL, we are literally talking

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:33.600
about something that is available to humanity as long as we want to make it possible.

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.320
Photoshop, even though it's going to be a market-dominant thing for 30, 40 years, it

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:43.480
may be around for 60 years, GIMP is literally available to humanity as long as we want it

01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:46.200
to be available and it can continue to get better.

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:52.040
The thing about that is if it is appealing to 80% of humanity and it is available to

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:56.180
80% of humanity for as long as they want it for absolutely free, if they can just get

01:37:56.180 --> 01:38:02.240
to the internet, it fundamentally offers something that Photoshop can never offer and can never

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.240
compete with.

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.600
When you think about it at that level, I'm pretty damn thankful about that.

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:06.600
That's pretty cool.

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.600
Yeah.

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.600
I mean, I know I've definitely needed something in a pinch.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:12.600
I don't have time to, if I was willing to even pirate or buy or any of the options that

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.120
people commonly employ.

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:15.120
I can just get GIMP.

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.160
I know it will work for what I use it for.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.160
I think you just nailed it.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:24.800
I think GIMP just has to continue to iterate, honestly, as long as the project handles new

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.720
leadership and brings in new blood.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:27.840
That is essential, yes.

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:31.840
They can get another 20 years and if they can get another 20 years, then they can just

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:36.640
slowly continue to iterate and yeah, it does suck for those of us in 2015 that want it

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:40.520
all right now, but it is something that's going to be available for a very long time

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:44.340
and they can continue to make it better and better and better and maybe one of the places

01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:50.920
they'll get to is instead of it becoming commonplace to pirate Photoshop, a proprietary crap application

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:56.480
that locks your freedoms down, maybe you just decide to go get GIMP instead.

01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:59.460
Even if they just got, and I think they're damn well close to it, even if they just got

01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:04.080
the status of instead of stealing Photoshop, go download GIMP because if you're the kind

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:08.400
of person that's stealing Photoshop, you probably don't actually need Photoshop to do your job

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:12.320
and so you could probably use GIMP and as long as they can get that reputation, which

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:16.760
I think they're damn close to already with the common person, then it is actually a very

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:17.760
serious thing.

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:19.480
I think it's pretty cool and you know what?

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:24.840
Also, we were dogging on LibreOffice, I feel bad about that.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.480
If you don't like the way LibreOffice looks, which is kind of where I was going, I think

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:31.240
LibreOffice is an awesome project, I hope you guys don't think I was dogging on it,

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:35.480
I think it's very awesome and I used to work in school districts, trust me, I understand

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:36.760
how revolutionary it is.

01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.960
We have a link in the show notes if you'd like to get involved in maybe sprucing up

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:41.960
the look of LibreOffice.

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:44.840
Yeah, I mean that's the thing, it's our project, right?

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:47.640
It's everyone's, so if you want it to be something, go help.

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:51.000
We got a link in the show notes to help out the LibreOffice project to get another thousand

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
developers.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.600
Alright everybody, well thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged,

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:56.560
we'll be back here on Tuesday, go to jplive.tv to watch us live, jupyterbroadcasting.com

01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:00.360
slash calendar, linuxactionshotoutreddit.com to contribute, see you next week.

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.000
And shove some turkey in your face.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Oh!

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Nom nom.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:33.360
Yeah, happy Thanksgiving everybody, see you next week.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:40.680
I will answer Wimpy's encoding questions if he will answer, I have a very, I'm gonna

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:42.120
be very ignorant here.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:47.920
I'm very ignorant, I don't understand why Canadians have Thanksgiving, do people outside

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.440
of the US also have Thanksgiving, is it just a North America thing?

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.440
No, just you.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.600
Okay, alright, so what do you guys do on Thursdays, you're just super annoyed by all of us Americans

01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.600
talking about?

01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.600
It's a normal day.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.600
Yeah.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:00.600
That sounds lame.

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:05.440
I think all the retailers over here have started doing Black Friday, which is ridiculous.

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:06.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:07.440
That needs to stop.

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.760
Yeah, I apologize, I bet it is extremely, extremely annoying.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:12.760
Okay so...

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:15.600
It is because there's never any offers, it's one of these things where everyone says there's

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.600
these big bargains and you turn up and it's like, you know, a bunch of tennis balls and

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.600
some string or something.

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.600
You know what you ought to do?

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:24.240
They're doing it in Germany now too, it's just, it's wrong.

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:29.400
You should just come to the US on Thanksgiving, because here's two things, we really know

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.540
how to eat, and man do we eat.

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:35.160
And the other thing is, besides Christmas, it's like the only other day of the year where

01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.160
everybody's nice.

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:38.560
So if you ever want to come to the US, they will share with you.

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.640
You actually want to have a good experience, you come on Thanksgiving, everybody's nice.

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:42.640
So it...

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:43.640
Chris will have turkey for you.

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:44.640
Yeah, oh yeah, that's true.

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.640
That's true.

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:52.720
Speaking of coming to the US, I've just booked my ticket to come to scale, so are you guys

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:54.640
going to go to scale?

01:41:54.640 --> 01:42:02.040
You know, so, boy, we're actually thinking about not going to scale because...

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:03.040
Fine.

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.040
I know, well...

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:06.120
Because you're going to be there, Popeye.

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:09.960
The timing in January is real bad, it's real bad.

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:14.120
And the thing is, it's because we do a big show at Linux Fest Northwest and I have limited

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.700
funds so I kind of have to pick and choose.

01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:23.560
But the other thing is, scale is a great show and it's a really good show to go to if you

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:26.080
don't go to all the other shows.

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.760
And if you go to all the other shows, scale is just a bigger version of all the other

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:31.760
shows.

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:34.200
But the thing about the other shows is they're a little more intimate, a little bit quieter,

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.640
and a little more focused.

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:42.280
So from terms of content and actual access to the people, we get better results from

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:45.640
some of the smaller shows than we do from scale.

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:52.520
So I'm still kind of like, I'm like 90% decided, but I'm still kind of on the fence about it.

01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:55.880
Scale's almost getting, I don't know, like overdone?

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:56.880
I don't know.

01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:57.880
I don't know.

01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:58.880
I don't know.

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:02.900
I think there's like, so we're having an Ubicon summit thing for a couple of days along with

01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:09.440
scale and I think there's like 20 or 30 of us flying over there, which like never normally

01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:12.960
happens, but there's a whole truckload of canonical people coming over.

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:13.960
Yeah.

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.680
You know, I'm still considering, I am, it is a part of me.

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.360
Not that that's a selling point, just...

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:22.040
It would be nice, you know, I hadn't, it would be nice to just say hi to people in person.

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:27.080
That would be a nice thing, but it's all these other events are really nice and they're really,

01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:36.200
you know, genuine, connected, like personal events and so, I don't know, if scale was

01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:40.880
after Linux Fest Northwest and then I knew how financially devastated I was from Linux

01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:45.880
Fest Northwest, then it would be easier to plan for scale because I could just plan accordingly,

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:50.360
but because scale comes before Linux Fest Northwest, I can't sacrifice Linux Fest Northwest

01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:51.560
in the name of going to scale.

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:52.560
I don't know.

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.560
It's a difficult situation.

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.560
It is a difficult situation.

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:55.560
Isn't Linux Fest Northwest like on your doorstep?

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:57.560
Can't you just like rock up in your trailer?

01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:58.560
Right.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:43:59.560
Right.

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:00.560
But when you...

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:01.560
But he has expectations there.

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:02.560
Well, here's the...

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:03.560
Well, like last year we...

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:04.560
Lazy, lazy...

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:05.560
No, no, no.

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:08.720
See, last year we flew the whole crew in and we did dinner and rooms and, you know...

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:09.720
It was demands for scale.

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:11.520
A live event, right?

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:16.080
So it was a major expense for the network because, you know, mostly all these people

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:17.160
are never actually here.

01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:21.760
So to actually bring everybody together in one place was actually a rather expensive

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:22.760
investment.

01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.760
That was...

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.760
Oh!

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.760
Oh!

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:31.160
So then, okay, so we're gonna talk about Solus, which, am I saying Solus right?

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:32.160
Yep.

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.160
Yeah.

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:34.160
Solus.

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.160
Solus.

01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:36.920
And how do I say the desktop?

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:37.920
Is it budgie?

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:38.920
That's what I...

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:39.920
Budgie.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.920
As in the bird with wings.

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:41.920
Cute little budgie.

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:42.920
The...

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:43.920
Like a birdie?

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:44.920
Birdie?

01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:45.920
Birdie?

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:46.920
Yeah, perky.

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:47.920
Like the bird...

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:48.920
The bird budgie.

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:50.320
I don't fucking know about a budgie bird.

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.240
I know about crows and blue jays, I don't know about a budgie bird.

01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:54.840
I know bungee software.

01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:56.080
I know bungee software.

01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.080
I know that pretty well.

01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:58.080
No, budgie.

01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.080
No, budgie.

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:00.080
I don't know about a budgie.

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:01.080
I don't know about a budgie.

01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:02.080
This is not a list of approved birds.

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.280
It's the kind of bird you'd have in a cage in your house.

01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:05.760
I don't know about a budgie.

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:08.600
Okay, I accept it's a thing, but I've never heard of it before.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.600
And I...

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:10.600
I have...

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:11.600
Bless you, Chris, and your lack of knowledge of the world.

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:12.600
I know, I know.

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.840
But here is the thing.

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.960
You know what I have heard of a billion times over?

01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:17.960
Bungee software!

01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:18.960
Like, haven't you guys...

01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:19.960
Come on, you're a bunch of kids.

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:20.960
You know what?

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:21.960
You're all a bunch of kids.

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:22.960
That's what it is.

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:23.960
Kids and their budgie birds.

01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:24.960
I used to have a budgie.

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:33.200
All right, somebody link me, I want to see what this damn bird looks like.

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:34.200
You know what it is?

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.200
I just don't give a crap about birds.

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.720
I mean, the birds that fly around are great, but I always feel like the birds in the cage

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:41.800
are just super annoying and loud and they poop a lot and they're not all that fun to

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:42.800
look at.

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:43.800
What about penguins?

01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:45.640
I'm telling you, birds in the wild are great.

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:50.240
That kind of bird I can get down with, but the birds that are just in a cage have never

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:51.240
interested me at all.

01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:52.240
I don't know.

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:53.240
I don't want to expand...

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:54.240
Okay, you guys...

01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:55.240
It's another name for the common pet pair.

01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:56.240
Yeah, okay.

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.240
Yeah, I've seen that ugly ass bird that doesn't...

01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:58.760
That looks like a stupid bird that poops a lot.

01:45:58.760 --> 01:45:59.760
Yeah, I've seen that bird.

01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:00.760
I don't know why you...

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:01.760
I'm sorry, I can't...

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:03.560
I don't know why you bang your desk up after that.

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.560
That bird looks like an asshole.

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.560
Well I made it.

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:08.560
Of course it's gonna be an asshole.

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:09.560
Perfectly done.

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:14.120
Perfectly done, perfectly done.
