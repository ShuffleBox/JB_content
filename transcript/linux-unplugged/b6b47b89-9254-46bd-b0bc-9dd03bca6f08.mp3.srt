1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
Wes, did you see this?

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,120
We were talking about this on the pre-show.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,680
Terth in the chat room was, or he is in New York,

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,360
and he found a, I don't know if he's like

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,320
in a Nixon museum or something.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,400
And he found these Nixon cigarettes.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,600
And if you look at that logo on those Nixon cigarettes.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,720
That sure looked like the Windows logo, doesn't it?

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,560
Wow.

10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,160
Nixon Campaign 72 cigarettes.

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,640
These were campaign advertising material.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,740
And they have, that is straight up

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,880
the Windows 10 Windows logo on there.

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,300
One of the designers at Microsoft

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,600
just has that sitting on a shelf in their office.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,600
And you know, you're daydreaming,

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,600
trying to think up the next thing.

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,440
It's right there.

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,040
All that money, and they ripped off a Nixon cigarette.

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,160
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 169

21
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,200
for November 1st, 2016.

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:01:00,280
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,960
that at least 50% of it proudly uses Nano.

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,800
My name is Chris.

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,200
My name is Wes.

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,960
I won't out you, Wes.

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,800
Please don't.

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,960
I got a lot of slack this week.

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,760
I did, I recorded a video in the Linux Action Show

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,160
where I was using, God forbid, Nano.

31
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,000
Ooh.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,820
I know.

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,800
That's just a recipe for flame war, man.

34
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,400
Don't worry, I'm gonna make up for it this week

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,240
with an hour.

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,840
Are you gonna show us your VI skills?

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,880
Yeah, I got true VIM skills, yeah.

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
I'm all about the color coding.

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,520
You know, that's not how I'm gonna make it up for you.

40
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm gonna make it up for you with a great show.

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,680
We have what you would probably classify

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,760
as an oversized show.

43
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,880
Now, we don't have the markers, so we may get a ticket,

44
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,960
but it is a huge update section.

45
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,800
We're gonna get into some big developments this week

46
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,360
that I'm a little fired up about.

47
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,000
Then later on, as we move down into the show,

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,120
we're gonna pick up the speed as we get busting along,

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,720
and we're gonna find some alternative devices

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
to the Roku that run Linux

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,480
that look like they may be coming very soon,

52
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,280
and then we're gonna wrap it all up towards the end

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,760
with some quotes from Mr. Greg KH.

54
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,580
Our favorite.

55
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,120
During a recent fireside chat

56
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,520
about kernel development happening over email

57
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,500
and why they still use email,

58
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,340
the guy says, like,

59
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,440
are you guys just a bunch of gray beards?

60
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,960
Like, why aren't you using Slack?

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,240
As if, like that's, or whatever.

62
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,080
Like GitHub.

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,480
Yeah, yeah.

64
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,240
So they talk about why they still use email

65
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,200
for core Linux kernel development.

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,240
He talks about licensing in a way

67
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,600
that's actually interesting,

68
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,880
and some other interesting tidbits

69
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,080
about a bunch of ex-Microsoft employees

70
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,160
now working full-time on the Linux kernel.

71
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,000
All kinds of stuff.

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,560
So we'll get into all of those quotes

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,600
from his fireside chat once we get through all our updates.

74
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,640
So yeah, we got like a lot of heavy stuff up front,

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,480
and then we're gonna really pick up the speed as we go on.

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
And the people that are gonna help us do that

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,720
is our virtual log, time appropriate greetings, mumbaroom.

78
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,560
Pip, pip.

79
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,380
Hello.

80
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,220
Time appropriate greetings.

81
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,060
Hello.

82
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,880
Hey, what's your podcast?

83
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,720
Oh.

84
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,560
Hello.

85
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,040
I'm not sure what that was there.

86
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,480
I don't know what that was exactly.

87
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,600
Who was that?

88
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,240
Hmm, I don't know, probably a mole.

89
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,960
Let's start with some really nice, like, kind of happy news.

90
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,480
Because sometimes we start with like breaking news

91
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,800
with everything is ruined.

92
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,640
Yes, right.

93
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,240
I thought it would be fun to talk about Mr. Robot.

94
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Six ways Mr. Robot is putting Linux in the public eye.

95
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,200
And this is kind of legit.

96
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,600
I mean, really early on,

97
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,240
they had the gnome KDE clip.

98
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,560
Do you remember that on Mr. Robot?

99
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,280
So I see a running gnome.

100
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,640
You know, I'm actually on KDE myself.

101
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,120
I know this desktop environment is supposed to be better,

102
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,760
but you know what they say.

103
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,040
Old habits, they die hard.

104
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,880
Look at that.

105
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,720
That face is perfect.

106
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,680
I'm like, what the?

107
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,760
I'm an executive.

108
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,240
I mean, why am I even running Linux?

109
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,480
I love that.

110
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
And that was when we actually watched the show.

111
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,320
And they also, recently they showed a screenshot

112
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,160
of Kali Linux.

113
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,000
Hey, look at that.

114
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,840
Which is totally legit.

115
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,680
Bonafide.

116
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,960
And of course, often they'll show shots

117
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,320
of the command line and real shell commands,

118
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,120
which is pretty great.

119
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,160
So I don't know if you are,

120
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,600
now don't know spoilers,

121
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,560
but have you ever watching like TV

122
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,480
when you see like a Linux thing

123
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,920
and it just like totally like, oh my gosh.

124
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,840
Like if you're watching Mr. Robot,

125
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,880
you're getting that all the time probably,

126
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,240
but every now and then you're watching random television.

127
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,880
It adds that like one layer of depth, you know,

128
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,640
it's like, I mean, you're already kind of,

129
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,840
you know, you're going with the show,

130
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,880
you're buying into their storyline,

131
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,720
but when you're like,

132
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,200
it's like fake terminal commands

133
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,040
and you're like,

134
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,640
you could have just filmed a real terminal.

135
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,480
It would have worked fine.

136
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,320
You don't need to like make up this thing

137
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,680
that just like kind of takes me out of the moment

138
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
from the show.

139
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,440
So I appreciate the depth that they go to.

140
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,280
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,160
I was watching a news clip on virtual reality

142
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,000
and you know how the news is about covering virtual reality.

143
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,700
And so they're in a room where the guy's got the headset on

144
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,160
and they're developing new technologies

145
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,280
and it's a typical shot of this guy

146
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,000
making a clown out of himself.

147
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,920
And the news camera pans over

148
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,840
to where the computers are at

149
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
and you know, it's VR.

150
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,120
So I'm thinking this is going to be a Windows box.

151
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,080
And no kidding, it was an Ubuntu Unity desktop.

152
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,720
You see that, you see that dock right on the left?

153
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,560
There you go.

154
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,160
Classic dock with that GTK2 looking bar

155
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,760
that hasn't been updated since 1984.

156
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,640
It looks, I mean, it's, you can't misplace it.

157
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,040
It's Unity and it's all its glory and everything else.

158
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,880
That's awesome.

159
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,280
And I was like, wait, wait, wait a minute.

160
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,380
Hold on.

161
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,360
How come they get VR on Linux

162
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,600
and I don't get VR on Linux?

163
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,440
How do we get that?

164
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,280
How did that happen?

165
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,520
I was watching that and I'm like, hold on now.

166
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,360
How does the CBS move?

167
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,200
They didn't have show notes

168
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,040
telling you how to set that up.

169
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,320
That's the problem.

170
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,480
Yeah, CBS needed to put a link in the show notes for sure.

171
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,800
And so I guess there's some VRs working under Linux

172
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,160
because these researchers were using it.

173
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,240
And so that was one of my most recent,

174
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
sitting there reviewing clips

175
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,960
and I'm looking at this and going, what the?

176
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,320
Where did this come from?

177
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,400
Where did this come from?

178
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,160
Okay, so I also wanted to do another little positive story

179
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,520
that I just wanted to throw out there.

180
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,640
This is your official Linux Unplugged reminder.

181
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,540
It's November.

182
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,840
God damn it.

183
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,040
And there's holidays coming up.

184
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,880
No.

185
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,880
And if you take some pictures and something goes wrong,

186
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,760
I want you to remember that in 169,

187
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Chris and Wes hooked you up

188
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,340
with how to recover those pictures.

189
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,720
This is a great post.

190
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,880
Search and rescue SD card recovery.

191
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,640
He has a Canon EOS 300D.

192
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,660
You know, it's an old SLR camera.

193
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,360
And his SD card file system corrupted or something on him.

194
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,120
He lost all his pictures when he went to Mo's Fest,

195
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,760
the Mozilla Festival a couple of weeks back.

196
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,080
Yeah, and so he wanted to do

197
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,440
the entire restoration under Linux.

198
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,340
And so he goes through the different tools he used

199
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,960
to restore his SD card contents

200
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,560
and recover his photos under Linux

201
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,760
and then documents it all right there

202
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,840
with a nice epic wind screenshot

203
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,760
of the Nautilus file browser full of his restored photos.

204
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,840
And I don't really, we don't need to bust through this

205
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,160
because this is really only applicable

206
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,720
to people that are in this situation.

207
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,200
But it is in the show notes.

208
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,320
It's nice to have because you don't want to be worrying

209
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,640
about where to go find the tutorial

210
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,200
and if it's up to date and all that

211
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,400
when you're desperately trying to recover your files.

212
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Yeah, and I also just wanted to kind of spotlight

213
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,440
really good, you know, this kind of blogging is just great.

214
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,200
It's great when you see this kind of stuff come along.

215
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,060
So I just wanted to kind of give it a little attention

216
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,900
as it were.

217
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,840
There is a story that's been percolating around

218
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,560
for about two weeks now

219
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,480
and it doesn't seem to be dying off.

220
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,560
So I've decided we'd talk about it

221
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
because at first my reaction was like, this is not a big...

222
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,880
Right, what is it, is it anything?

223
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,760
But you know, it's getting,

224
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,800
it continues to get posted on Hacker News.

225
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,360
It continues to get written about.

226
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,960
And so I thought I'd link to the OMG coverage here.

227
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,000
Linux market share has remained above 2%

228
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,160
on the desktop for the third month in a row.

229
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,920
This is according to NetMarketshare

230
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,320
and it's a data analytics company.

231
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,560
I'll tell you where they source their data from in a moment.

232
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,240
But it looks like this has been holding steady since July

233
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,840
and it looks like it's continuing to climb.

234
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,840
In fact, it's gone up to 2.33% since then.

235
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,160
You know, here's the thing, guys.

236
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,680
NetMarketshare bases its data on the number of visitors

237
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,760
to 40,000 websites.

238
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,680
It's not like it's an insignificant sample size,

239
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,120
but compared to the overall Linux desktop market,

240
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,240
there's no way it's representative.

241
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,920
But it's an interesting data point.

242
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,760
You can also look at Wikimedia, which shows 1.2%

243
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,360
if you include Ubuntu, Red Hat, and SUSE,

244
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,920
but doesn't look at other distros.

245
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,920
But, you know, the reality is we'll never have an idea.

246
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,400
We'll never have an idea, but there are-

247
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,360
Even just talking about that's making me realize,

248
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,280
you know, just think about how would you do that?

249
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,120
And it would be hard.

250
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,880
It's a hard thing to get a good number on.

251
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,400
You know what I have kind of relied on

252
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,560
is aggregating different data sources over the years.

253
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,760
So I look at things like these types of reports

254
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,680
from NetMarket, but I also look at the Wikimedia stuff

255
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,800
and I look at Steam and I look at the W3 schools

256
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,000
and kind of aggregate them all together.

257
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
And I will say this, in aggregate, there is an uptick.

258
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
There does seem to be a pretty consistent uptick

259
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,840
in aggregate.

260
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,640
It's nothing major, but then of course,

261
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,280
how you measure these things is pretty difficult.

262
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,600
Yeah, that's definitely true.

263
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,600
The graph is sure not that exciting though.

264
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,960
No, no, it's not that exciting.

265
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,320
You know what is exciting?

266
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,240
Freaking 1.9.22 of wine.

267
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,880
First of all, it lets you play Max Payne 2,

268
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,080
which made me think of you.

269
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,360
But coming just two weeks after the previous wine,

270
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,240
yes, I'm actually gonna report on a version of wine.

271
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Doesn't happen often.

272
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,080
It doesn't.

273
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,960
They've added some nice support for Direct2D.

274
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,860
They've fixed 25 bugs and they've added improvement

275
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,800
to multiple Windows games.

276
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,660
But the one thing that really matters, Wes,

277
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,440
the thing that matters the most,

278
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,920
is they have resurrected support for a game

279
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
from November of 1996.

280
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,080
It's almost perfect.

281
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,960
The anniversary is right here.

282
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,080
It's very important to me.

283
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,120
It was not a good game at all.

284
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,160
It shouldn't have anybody working on it,

285
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,240
but they have done it and it's called Star Trek Horde.

286
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,080
Hold on, buddy.

287
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,900
We need you conscious.

288
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,740
Don't go to one of your Payne trances.

289
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,580
Ah!

290
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,420
Get off!

291
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,240
Furlong!

292
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Furlong, get out of here!

293
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,080
I'm sorry.

294
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,040
You are in a bajani Payne trance.

295
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,320
Your friend Furlong wasn't able to stop it.

296
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,640
The Borg don't seem to notice, though.

297
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,940
They're assimilating you at this very moment.

298
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,940
At least this time, you won't feel it.

299
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,440
Oh, it looks like you're waking up.

300
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,360
So this is like a quick time events driven game, but.

301
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,320
Oh, I see.

302
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,240
Interesting.

303
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,000
There is a star, so they were filming it

304
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,680
using all the existing Star Trek sets

305
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,440
and Star Trek sound effects and the Star Trek directing.

306
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,680
It's our friend John de Lancie.

307
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,600
Yeah, but there is actually one thing

308
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,480
of rather interest canon addition

309
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,720
that they bring to the Star Trek canon in this game.

310
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,320
So if you're a Star Trek fan,

311
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,440
it's worth playing just for that.

312
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,100
So it's kind of cool that it's a game

313
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,120
that if it passed you by and you kind of want to,

314
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,560
it's an interactive Star Trek episode.

315
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,000
If you've ever seen Minecraft Story Mode

316
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,840
or anything like that,

317
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,080
it's basically that with,

318
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,040
and it was the pinnacle of quick time events games,

319
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,320
which is not saying much.

320
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,520
That's great.

321
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,680
It starts like a legitimate game of,

322
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,680
or it starts like a legitimate television show of Star Trek.

323
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,400
Like here, this is gonna get us pulled down, but.

324
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,080
USS Canali to USS Cheyenne.

325
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,000
We are under attack by Borg forces.

326
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,520
Repeat, Borg forces, re-intercept the two Borg vessels.

327
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,440
Can you just mix this with your VR headset?

328
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,080
I'd be entertained for hours.

329
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,920
Actually, that could be pretty good, right?

330
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,320
Especially if you could move around the entire space.

331
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,200
I have the whole thing,

332
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,480
if you would just want to watch it and not play it.

333
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,760
But it's a first person perspective game

334
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
where you walk around the halls of the ship,

335
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,540
interact with officers.

336
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,320
It even has credits and all of the music

337
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,040
just like a Star Trek episode.

338
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,600
It looks like a Star Trek episode

339
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,640
from first person perspective.

340
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,900
This is great.

341
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,080
So it's kind of neat.

342
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,720
Oh, relate, geez.

343
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
Yeah, it's kind of neat though

344
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,080
because you can pick this game up for really cheap

345
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,000
or you can find it online

346
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and now you'll be able to run it under Linux.

347
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,440
It's wild that people are working on that and now it works.

348
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,560
Ridiculous maybe, you might add, pointless.

349
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,560
But also, it's what I love about Wine and Linux is

350
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,040
there is something incredibly nostalgic

351
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,360
about taking some of my favorite old games,

352
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,680
even like ones that I bought on GOG a while ago

353
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,280
that I can now play under Wine

354
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,120
and not have to hassle with a Windows crappy VM

355
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,400
or any of that junk.

356
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,240
Any of that.

357
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,120
It's amazing that Linux can do more.

358
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,960
You wonder at some point,

359
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,520
like some of these older games of Wine

360
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,760
will start being able to be a better place

361
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,280
to run them than modern Windows.

362
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,680
Yeah, maybe they'll do like a hard break one day

363
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,520
on the Windows platform.

364
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,040
They're like, okay, this technical debt

365
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,080
has gotten so crazy,

366
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,560
we're gonna move to the next version of Windows.

367
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,320
Well, they'll probably retain the Linux environment

368
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,720
and they'll use Wine.

369
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,320
Wine in the Linux subsystems around old Windows games.

370
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,720
Okay, great, we've called it here.

371
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,520
Yeah, there's our prediction on the unplugged program.

372
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,560
Yikes, but I do think it's really cool

373
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,520
that they added that stuff.

374
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,400
Hey, before we go any further,

375
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,240
let's talk about the opposite of that complicated mess.

376
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
Let's talk about something that makes mobile simple

377
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,080
and that's Ting.

378
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,480
Go to linux.ting.com,

379
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,440
where they're on a mission to make mobile make sense.

380
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,280
And here's why.

381
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,320
There's no contract, no other termination fee,

382
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,360
and you only pay for what you use.

383
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,120
Six dollars for each line.

384
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
You got one phone, you got three phones,

385
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,440
it's six dollars for each one of them.

386
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,160
It's nice, simple, straightforward,

387
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,040
GSM and CDMA networks that you get to choose from.

388
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,160
And if you're in business,

389
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,840
this is something you should really consider,

390
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,360
especially if you're kind of like a smaller business.

391
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,000
But even anybody that has like,

392
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,400
for me, like with three or four devices,

393
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,320
it's just fantastic.

394
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,240
But even when you go above 10 devices,

395
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,960
the savings is nuts because it's just six dollars

396
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,400
and then your staff's usage.

397
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,000
And if you got Wi-Fi at your office

398
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
and they got Wi-Fi at home,

399
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,360
that's ridiculous what you can get away with.

400
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,640
And it's perfect for those things where like,

401
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,000
well, maybe you need like just a backup

402
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,160
internet connection for your office,

403
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,560
but you're gonna use it what, one time a year?

404
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,400
Yeah, yeah.

405
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,000
It's so nice because if you go over

406
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,440
to the Ting Buy page or the Shop page,

407
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,840
you can just get a little SIM card

408
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,440
and you can put it in a MyFi you get off eBay

409
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,000
or you can get one of the MyFis directly from them,

410
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,280
keep that in your drawer,

411
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,560
and the day your Comcast connection goes out,

412
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,480
you fire this up.

413
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,680
Literally, I've done that twice here at JB.

414
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,440
One time.

415
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,800
Six dollars a month for that kind of like,

416
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,120
you know, just knowing it'll work.

417
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,660
One time, this story is a couple years old now,

418
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,380
but it's such a classic and it's so perfect.

419
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,760
It's just a perfect example is Alan Jude

420
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,600
flew out here to record TechSnap in person.

421
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
How often does that happen?

422
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,920
You know, a couple times ever.

423
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,280
And he shows up and Comcast is down.

424
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,560
And what are we gonna not record?

425
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,400
He's here for the day.

426
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,320
What are we gonna not do a show?

427
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,520
And I gotta show visuals,

428
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,840
I gotta look up stuff for the stories,

429
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,120
he's gotta read sites.

430
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,400
So we set up Ting, we set up a Wi-Fi hotspot on my Nexus,

431
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,040
and just connected our laptops to that.

432
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,200
Our laptops had connection, we recorded two shows

433
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,040
over the Ting connection that day.

434
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,560
Ting saved it and it was just,

435
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,980
that's just so nice, like tethering and stuff,

436
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,080
or hotspot, it's just a check box.

437
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,120
It's not a big deal.

438
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,620
Also, check out the Ting blog.

439
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,840
They went and pulled their Redditors

440
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,360
and they shared seven different hacks

441
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,520
to help save money on mobile.

442
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,380
That's pretty cool.

443
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,320
They also are pushing now the Moto G4 Play,

444
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,720
a pretty nice mid-sized device at a great price, $150.

445
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,560
No contract, no determination fee.

446
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,300
And if you go to linux.ting.com,

447
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,940
you get $25 off your device or $25 in service credit.

448
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,120
linux.ting.com, and a big thank you to Ting

449
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,000
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

450
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,640
All right, before we get into something really heavy,

451
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,120
I do have something really fun

452
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,120
that I just wanted to give a shout out to.

453
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,160
Users over on linux underscore gaming

454
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,400
organized together to bribe Aspire

455
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,400
into porting Civ 6 to Linux.

456
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,960
And it was looking like it was gonna be maybe murky.

457
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,280
They were evaluating the cost, you know.

458
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,920
There's a Mac version they wanna make as well,

459
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,840
and they were nice and public in commenting in thread

460
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,960
saying, you know, we're not really sure

461
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,440
we're in the research stage.

462
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,920
The bottom line is we need to prove to ourselves,

463
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,600
our partners, and to our partners that a Linux version

464
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,080
can perform to our standards, you know, monetarily.

465
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,200
Right, right.

466
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,480
And so the Linux underscore gaming guys and gals

467
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,480
got together and sent them a box of Tiff's Treats,

468
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,200
which is a local Austin cookie company,

469
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,920
and sent them boxes after boxes of cookies.

470
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,400
In fact, they have another one scheduled

471
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,360
to be delivered on Thursday this week.

472
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,640
And Aspire Media, or Aspire, took notice.

473
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,860
And they said, they tweeted out,

474
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,160
this just came in the mail this morning.

475
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,720
Thank you, you lovely Linux people.

476
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,760
Your guilt trip has been accepted.

477
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,600
Hashtag nom, nom, nom.

478
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,300
Then another tweet comes out, says the Linux team

479
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,320
would like to offer their thanks

480
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,640
as with the majority of the companies,

481
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,000
and thanks to Tiffany's Treats.

482
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,280
And then they posted some more pictures

483
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,800
of people passing out from cookie overdoses.

484
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,920
That's a great strategy.

485
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,120
I mean, at some point, everyone in the company

486
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,240
is gonna have stopped by, they're gonna have enough cookies.

487
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,080
Everyone's gonna have some.

488
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,740
Everyone asked where it came from.

489
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,640
Now everyone's talking about Linux.

490
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,480
Yeah.

491
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,820
And it's also got some interesting details

492
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,160
that Blair on the Linux Gaming subreddit shared.

493
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,520
Blair works at Aspire Media.

494
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,200
He says, their team fluctuates.

495
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,240
The Linux, they have asked,

496
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
how many people are on the Linux team?

497
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,800
So the team fluctuates.

498
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,200
Because Mac and Linux teams are shared resources.

499
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,960
I think this is actually a super common setup.

500
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,160
I bet so, yeah.

501
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,800
So it can be as little as 25 or the full company of 70.

502
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,700
Actually, that's not true.

503
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,560
We have a couple of guys dedicated to Android

504
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,280
and an internal IP team working on some secret stuff.

505
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,520
So it's more like 60.

506
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,080
Here's what I want to underscore.

507
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,380
The topic we're about to get into.

508
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,000
We're gonna talk about stuff from a tools perspective

509
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,280
and what end users need perspective.

510
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,580
But I want you to keep in the back of your mind also

511
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,400
the value judgment that companies have to make

512
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,480
when they watch user bases.

513
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,080
Now we just talked about the Linux user base growing.

514
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,200
It's nothing major.

515
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,700
We talked about growth there.

516
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,900
I want to transition from this

517
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,440
and talk about something that I also think

518
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,400
is gonna contribute to more Linux users

519
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,860
which may change companies like Aspire Media's calculus.

520
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
It is the elephant in the room

521
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,240
and I know this is a Linux podcast,

522
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,720
but there is definitely a Linux angle on this.

523
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,100
And it's what everybody on the internet

524
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,200
is freaking out about this week.

525
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
And that is the new MacBooks.

526
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,680
The new MacBook Pros with the touch bar.

527
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,200
Everybody is freaking out about this.

528
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,400
And I guess to highlight,

529
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,000
I won't repeat the things that I've said

530
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,560
in Coda Radio this week,

531
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,480
but I think it is probably worth touching on

532
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,040
the couple of major limitations of the new MacBook.

533
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,320
16 gigs of RAM is gonna be a maximum.

534
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,960
Is an unbelievable limitation.

535
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,840
I mean it's just a ridiculous limitation.

536
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,240
The cost premium too is astronomical on these new MacBooks.

537
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,080
I understand.

538
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,320
It's not like it's got cheaper.

539
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,040
Yeah, this is, I feel like this is gonna be a prime time

540
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,200
to switch a lot of people to Linux.

541
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,840
And here's why.

542
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,820
System76 has been tweeting a bit about this.

543
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,320
They say due to high website traffic after Apple's events

544
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,340
they've had to add more infrastructure.

545
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,240
Emma, the person that takes a lot of the sales calls

546
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,840
at System76 tweeted out that she's getting

547
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,560
more Apple switcher calls than she's ever gotten.

548
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,400
Wow.

549
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,000
Coming into System76 right now.

550
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I wanna kinda, and also a longtime Apple blogger,

551
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,160
John Gruber over at daringfireball.com

552
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,680
took some shots at System76 as a result of this.

553
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,320
So I wanna talk about all of this.

554
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,280
But does anybody in the Mumba Room wanna open up

555
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,200
with their reaction to the new MacBook?

556
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,820
It's all cocky.

557
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,100
I mean when I say, why though?

558
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,600
I mean let's be critical, but let's do it

559
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,480
in like an informed way.

560
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,200
Cause I mean we can't just hate it because it's Apple.

561
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,040
Right.

562
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,360
Let's be realistic here.

563
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Pretend Dell made it.

564
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,800
Yeah, pretend Dell made this or something.

565
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,960
I mean this seems like to me,

566
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,640
but actually you can't do that.

567
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,840
See the reason why you can't do that

568
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,680
is Apple is the only company that makes computers

569
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,560
that run Mac OS.

570
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,400
True.

571
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,320
And so if you require an application

572
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,680
on the Mac OS platform.

573
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,500
That's where you're at.

574
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
You are forced to buy Apple's products.

575
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,820
And so that, I think in this context,

576
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,360
it's way more important that Apple

577
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,920
gets these product releases right.

578
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,800
It's not as easy to forgive a mistake on Apple's case

579
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,860
like it is on Dell.

580
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,000
By the way, do any of us give a shit

581
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,760
that the XPS 13 has a max of 16 gigs of RAM?

582
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,040
Did you know that?

583
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,000
No, we don't.

584
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,840
No, we don't.

585
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,680
Because it's not Apple.

586
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,500
Because it's Dell.

587
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,340
It's Dell.

588
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,960
The Dell XPS 13 that we've all lovingly talked about,

589
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,000
the one I own, the one you own,

590
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,240
has a max of 16 gigs of RAM right now.

591
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,040
But it doesn't matter because it's one

592
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,920
of a hundred different products that Dell sells

593
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,880
and it's one of a million different products

594
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,860
I can run Linux on.

595
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,700
Exactly.

596
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,880
So it doesn't matter.

597
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,620
But when Apple makes this mistake,

598
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,800
when they ship a pro product that only supports

599
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,640
16 gigs of RAM, there is going to be a class

600
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
of high-end users that are gonna look at that

601
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,760
and say, that is a ridiculous limitation

602
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,240
and I'm moving to another platform

603
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,200
and it sure as hell is not gonna be Windows.

604
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,920
And it's not just me saying that.

605
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,640
This is, there is threat.

606
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,400
I thought about doing like just a roundup

607
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,160
of all the different hacker news posts

608
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,740
and Reddit posts and blog posts

609
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,360
and Medium posts about this.

610
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,120
There is hundreds of them right now.

611
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,440
And you know what?

612
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,440
It is, if you do word searches in the comments sections

613
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,920
and in these posts, they're talking about

614
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,320
switching to Linux.

615
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,240
It's wild.

616
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,480
But it makes sense, I think.

617
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,320
It's interesting.

618
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,900
It's because Apple is following the path

619
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,320
of we want thin, light, and high battery life.

620
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,880
And so they can't have two so dims

621
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,480
to support 32 gigs of RAM.

622
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,920
And they're not gonna put a GPU in there

623
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,640
if they don't have to, or at least a beefy GPU.

624
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,760
Because that would take up too much room

625
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,880
and reduce battery life and it would reduce thinness.

626
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,820
Yeah, it appears, so it appears the true reason

627
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,640
behind the lack of 32 gigs of RAM or DDR4 is Intel.

628
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,680
Skylake doesn't support LPD DDR4,

629
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,520
which LP stands for low power.

630
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,400
And Kaby Lake is set to include support

631
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,040
but only for U category of chips.

632
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,040
So again, no LPD DDR4 until 2018 in mobile.

633
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,080
Yep.

634
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,160
Surface Book only goes up to 16 gigabytes too.

635
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,760
But if they had two so dim slots,

636
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,960
so if they sacrifice some space

637
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,360
and some more board real estate,

638
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,160
they could actually do 32 gigs.

639
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,000
Which is what other people are doing with DDR4.

640
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,040
They're doing two so dims that are 16 gigs each.

641
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,560
Now the argument is those types of boards

642
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,880
get way worse battery life.

643
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,800
They do.

644
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,280
And they sacrifice room that you could put batteries in.

645
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
And I think a lot of Apple professionals

646
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,720
would sacrifice battery life

647
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,040
to have a machine that is capable.

648
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,600
Oh absolutely, I think Apple didn't make the compromise

649
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,200
of having a really high-end workstation replacement machine

650
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,800
and they only went with like a lighter, smaller,

651
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,840
better battery life type machine.

652
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,280
Right, when you're making the play

653
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
to the everyman Apple product,

654
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,400
you miss the people in all the businesses

655
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,720
who they get their managers to get them the Mac

656
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,080
and then it sits on their desk plugged into nice monitors

657
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,520
and they want it for the environment that they're used to

658
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,240
and for the Unix command line.

659
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,720
But yeah, if you look at a competing product

660
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,920
like the Surface Book Pro, or sorry, the Surface Book,

661
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,720
and you look at say the X1 Carbon

662
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,680
and you look at the XPS 13,

663
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,560
those also gimp and sacrifice those same features

664
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,760
that you want on a workstation.

665
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,440
Again though, I say the scale of aggression there

666
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,360
or egregion there is much lower.

667
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,840
And I'll get into my personal take on it,

668
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,480
but I wanna give Mohsen Rath a chance to jump in

669
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,400
because he thinks we're just hating on the leader.

670
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,200
So Mohsen Rath, you go and I wanna get your perspective

671
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,600
on it real quick.

672
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,880
Okay, you guys were talking about this a few days ago

673
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,520
on one of the other shows, if I'm not mistaken.

674
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,800
And my understanding with when I'm hearing

675
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,920
all the different arguments

676
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,480
and what I'm seeing in the chat room,

677
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,240
a lot of it tends to be, well, Apple should do this,

678
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,400
Apple should do this,

679
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,720
but you gotta sit there and think to yourself,

680
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,640
Apple's gonna think of the bottom line.

681
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,560
So if they don't think that there's gonna be people

682
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,240
that are going to want to pay for it

683
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,280
based off of the scale that they're going to price it at,

684
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,120
and we were discussing this in the chat room the other day,

685
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,160
well, not in the chat room,

686
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,600
gone to the IRC the other day,

687
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,360
I didn't actually try to do the math,

688
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,320
but you guys have complained about how much it costs

689
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,280
for stuff for Apple before.

690
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,480
The people at RIP Tech Syndicate

691
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,920
complained about this stuff for Apple before

692
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,080
in terms of the prices and the pricing.

693
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,760
Do the math yourself, seriously.

694
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,960
Spend some time on the show right now.

695
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,840
Go to the website, do the scale, right?

696
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,760
Eight to 16 or eight to 12 or however you want to do it.

697
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,680
Do the arithmetic sequence,

698
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,320
see how much it would be for the 32.

699
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,520
Anything else about sizing, battery life at all,

700
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,000
take a look at where the actual price point

701
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,200
according to their would be based off of everything else.

702
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
And then you sit there and ask yourself,

703
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,840
who's going to pay for that?

704
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,320
If you can't see yourself going to pay for that,

705
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,560
then how are you going to see

706
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,280
anyone else going to pay for that?

707
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,120
I think the difference-

708
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,280
If Apple figured that someone would pay for it,

709
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,120
they would do it.

710
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,240
I think the difference here is that

711
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,360
there is a significant amount that,

712
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,880
that would matter a lot to me in my personal life,

713
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,400
but for the business world,

714
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,720
I'm not gonna be paying for it.

715
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,600
My company's gonna pay for it,

716
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,680
and they don't care if it's two grand

717
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,840
or three grand for the most part.

718
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,440
Yeah, I really don't think it's worth,

719
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,480
I mean, it's worth mentioning the base price

720
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,440
in terms of value to the consumer,

721
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,200
but anybody that's gonna use these tools to make money

722
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,880
is gonna think about the price for about two days,

723
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,040
and then when they get to work and start making revenue

724
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,500
based on their work output from this machine,

725
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,640
they're not gonna care so much that it costs them $3,000

726
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,600
and it's a tax write-off.

727
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,160
So the price is worth discussing,

728
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,580
but it's absolutely not one of the primary issues.

729
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,560
I think hands down,

730
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,080
the primary professional issue here is

731
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,100
no expandability internally,

732
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,540
and these machines only get updated every thousand days,

733
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,960
and the 16 gigabyte RAM limitation

734
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,120
for anybody that's working in 1080p plus video is atrocious.

735
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,240
It is, after effects,

736
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
I don't know, unless you've used these tools,

737
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,760
you have to understand that they work

738
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,440
by caching things in RAM.

739
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,840
That's how they are usable,

740
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,520
and you can't work at these resolutions

741
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,320
unless you can cache some of this data in RAM,

742
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,880
and if you don't have RAM, you can't use the machine.

743
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,880
There's actually, the part about the pricing thing,

744
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,240
you gotta point out that Apple has always overcharged

745
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,560
for inferior products,

746
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,520
like them having a higher price.

747
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,440
I don't know if that's totally fair.

748
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,640
I think they start with a base configuration

749
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,440
that's more competitive,

750
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,640
and they don't even bother with a lower end machine,

751
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,640
and then they gouge you on things like RAM and storage a bit.

752
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,480
Yeah.

753
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,300
But I wanna, okay.

754
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,360
You can get every single,

755
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,320
even the MacBook Air when it was out,

756
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,960
you could get his Inbook for the same amount of hardware

757
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,960
for like 300, $400 cheaper.

758
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,040
Yes, but tell me,

759
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,000
how great is ASUS support compared to Apple support?

760
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,880
There's a lot of things.

761
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,680
I mean, there's, yeah.

762
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,520
Apple support is not that good.

763
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,840
Apple support is not that good,

764
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,280
but you can take it into a store,

765
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,400
and they can usually fix your issues there.

766
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,600
ASUS will take at least two months to get back to you.

767
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,040
But again, I don't really wanna get into the,

768
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,680
I don't really wanna get into the price.

769
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,960
I don't wanna get into the price discussion,

770
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,520
because if I'm gonna get a Lenovo laptop or a Dell laptop

771
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,680
that's actually worth me using,

772
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,240
it's also gonna be expensive.

773
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,080
See, I think that's,

774
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,160
I think the price thing is a bit of a misnomer

775
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,980
in this conversation,

776
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,800
because I think you can remove it from the conversation,

777
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,040
and we still have a perfectly viable argument here.

778
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,720
And Popey, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in.

779
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,520
So one of the questions you asked was,

780
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,580
why is it that we hold Apple to a standard

781
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,560
where we complain that they only have 16 gig yet?

782
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,060
All these other manufacturers like Dell

783
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,180
with their XPS 13 and Lenovo with their X1,

784
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,720
they don't get the same kind of flag.

785
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,320
Yeah, they have the similar specs.

786
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,600
And the simple reason is Apple ask for it.

787
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,560
They put themselves up on a pedestal

788
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,880
and do a gigantic PR exercise

789
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,220
to get the whole world watching a live stream

790
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,880
while they announce their products.

791
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,300
And if that doesn't get people critiquing their products,

792
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,740
then I don't know what does.

793
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,340
Dell and Lenovo don't do that.

794
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,140
And so they put out their products,

795
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,020
people buy them, and people move on.

796
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,300
They don't scrutinize the minutiae of those products

797
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,540
anywhere near as much as they do for Apple devices,

798
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,780
because Apple invite that.

799
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,120
So let me tell you about why this matters to me,

800
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,440
because I've spent the last three weeks

801
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,620
trying to exclusively edit segments

802
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,820
for the Linux Action Show in Cadian Live.

803
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,460
And, ooh, will you check that?

804
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,300
I will, yeah.

805
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,120
That might be UPS, thanks, Wes.

806
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,360
The UPS just got here.

807
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,840
And I have mad respect for the work that project is doing,

808
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,940
and I am really happy with their trajectory

809
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,500
on where they wanna go with it.

810
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,460
But it is not, I thought to myself,

811
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,420
it's usable for me when I wanna produce

812
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,660
one 10-minute segment a week.

813
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,900
If I wanted to produce daily video,

814
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,740
or I wanted to move our entire workflow

815
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,900
over to Cadian Live, I still don't think it's,

816
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,220
I think it's still, I think it could be six years out

817
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,260
from where they're even getting close to Final Cut 10.

818
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,040
And the issue is that in the three years

819
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,300
that Apple dropped the Final Cut 10 bomb on the world,

820
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,460
they've progressively made it better and better and better.

821
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,780
And now it's actually a competitive product

822
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,820
that is faster in some regards

823
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,420
than any other editor in the market.

824
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,620
It uses the GPU in a way that most editors

825
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,460
don't even get close, and it is,

826
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,860
the UI is functional, and it's one of these applications

827
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,440
where if you have very little experience,

828
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,460
you can begin to use it,

829
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,340
and then as you grow as a professional,

830
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,900
or as you grow as an editor,

831
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,900
you can learn more ways to take advantage

832
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,740
of this application.

833
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,340
And there is a company, hold on one sec,

834
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,580
there is a company behind it

835
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,960
that is working with the market.

836
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,900
They're working with companies like Canon.

837
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,100
They're working with companies like Blackmagic.

838
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,220
They're creating hard, they're working with partnerships

839
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,380
where they create hardware that works with the product.

840
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,580
And that is something that simply Cadian Live,

841
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,520
or OpenShot, or Shotcut, or any of them,

842
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,180
simply don't have the resource to do.

843
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,180
And last, final point, and this is the really bad one,

844
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,520
is there is a giant pool of talent out there

845
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,180
that knows how to use Final Cut,

846
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,740
and is creating Final Cut professional templates

847
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,740
that look broadcast good, that you can buy for 25, 30 bucks,

848
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,940
and then modify for your own use.

849
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,720
And there's nothing like that for the open source projects

850
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,780
at any scale, at any quality.

851
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,900
And so the fundamental issue is,

852
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,860
and you guys can write it off as Crazy Chris

853
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,140
and his podcast, but the reality is

854
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,380
there is a ginormous market of millions of professionals

855
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,020
and businesses now that produce video content

856
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,580
for this tiny website you may have heard of

857
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,100
called YouTube and many others,

858
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,460
and none of them are doing it under Linux

859
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,820
because these tools are not good enough.

860
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,780
And so people are still gonna be buying Macs.

861
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,100
And this Mac is less Linux friendly

862
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,580
than any Mac Apple has ever shipped.

863
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,820
So it is, the platform is worse,

864
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,580
the people that use these tools are getting locked

865
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,340
into a less and less appealing platform,

866
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,720
and the hardware they are shipping

867
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,020
becomes less and less capable of running Linux.

868
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,660
I just wanted to ask, if you really think Apple's the leader

869
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,660
and everybody else is trying to follow,

870
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,860
or do you think it's the other way around somehow?

871
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,420
I mean, I don't know.

872
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,700
I think they probably just have 15, 20 years experience

873
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,180
making editing software, and they have 15, 20 years

874
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,300
of business relationships to make it a viable editor

875
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,420
for the companies to support.

876
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,660
I think they're kind of experimenting

877
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,760
for the future though.

878
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,460
Go ahead William, what was that?

879
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,840
Yeah, so I think with the whole touchpad thing,

880
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,380
I think eventually what they're going to do

881
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,060
is turn the whole keyboard into just a big LCD panel,

882
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,540
and this is the first step of doing that,

883
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,420
and I think it's kind of an interesting change.

884
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,900
They're experimenting it with the keys

885
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,060
that are less important to you,

886
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,660
so it's not your normal QWERTY alphabet keys,

887
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,340
it's just the F keys which you only use every now and then,

888
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,180
and eventually they're going to expand that downward

889
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,480
into being the whole body.

890
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,320
Maybe.

891
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,160
Maybe?

892
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,520
Okay, Popeye, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in,

893
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,040
and then I'll go to Mohsen Rath.

894
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,860
And then Rath.

895
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,700
All right, that's cool.

896
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,840
Okay, Mohsen Rath, go ahead.

897
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,040
Okay, we had this discussion already,

898
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,560
I think it was like my first or second time

899
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,420
I was graciously allowed to talk on your show there,

900
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,040
about why with your open source argument,

901
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,360
why it is that there's nothing

902
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,680
for the open source argument.

903
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,920
We already had this discussion.

904
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,180
Remember that wishlist of yours?

905
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,960
One of those things is, where all those people go

906
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,240
that crump out, that fail out?

907
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,040
Why is it that they don't just link up,

908
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,440
legion up to one of those open source projects

909
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,920
that is hitting it, that is working out on the same thing?

910
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,600
Where does all that money not go to?

911
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,140
Oh yes, open source.

912
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,440
Where does that money go to?

913
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,960
The people that already are making something.

914
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,680
So remember you were talking about the 15 to 20 years of?

915
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,900
They also have at least, at least 15 to 20 years

916
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,900
of cash in hand, cash invested, cash coming in.

917
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,880
Notice that word that keeps on showing up, cash.

918
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,360
And I say that on purpose because

919
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,120
all those open source projects,

920
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,920
they're going off of donations.

921
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,960
They're going off of people being generous.

922
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,440
They're going off of people doing it for the love of it.

923
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,220
Or some of them are doing it for the hate of it

924
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,140
because they just hate the other products so much.

925
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,660
They're just like, I'm gonna make something

926
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,980
to compare against it.

927
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,240
I'm gonna make something to compete against it.

928
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,800
And until those people,

929
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,360
all those legions of people who are doing

930
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,120
all that hard work, get the same kind of money,

931
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,760
get the same kind of backing,

932
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,560
get the same kind of backup.

933
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,680
And when I'm talking about backup,

934
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,760
I'm talking about those legions upon legions

935
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,280
upon legions of people.

936
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,120
People like, I'm gonna call him out here

937
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,320
because he's awesome, Tilnesh here, who's brilliant.

938
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,340
And he's talked about some of the stuff that he's done.

939
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,560
People like him, people like Rekai, people like yourself,

940
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,520
people like Noah, people like Wes there.

941
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,960
At the same thing, people like Alan

942
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,880
and people like the other Chris.

943
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,400
Without legions of people like them,

944
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,980
not just two, not just five,

945
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,160
we're talking hundreds of people like that

946
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,320
who also have hundreds of thousands of dollars

947
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,940
following them to show up to these projects,

948
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,800
they are not going to be at the same level.

949
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,120
It's not like a sport where you could sit there

950
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,280
and train by yourself and learn the stuff by yourself,

951
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,480
like basketball or football or hockey

952
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,460
or something like that.

953
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,840
Most of those things, you can get yourself

954
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,260
to the state where you need to be

955
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,680
and then it's just a matter of getting the equipment.

956
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,160
It's not like that.

957
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,880
So you gotta remember all the efforts

958
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,980
that all these people are doing,

959
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,360
of course they're gonna be playing catch up.

960
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,800
They're always gonna be playing catch up

961
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,000
until someone gives them the leader position

962
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,360
by literally dumping a ton of people

963
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,520
and a ton of money and a ton of influence

964
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,960
and a ton of equipment in their lap

965
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,560
along with a ton of testers.

966
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,280
I do feel like for the basic editing timeline

967
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,120
and stuff like that,

968
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,300
KDN Live is sitting in a pretty good spot

969
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,120
and they wanna continue focusing on polish.

970
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,640
And so on that note, Rot,

971
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,200
and I wanted to give you the sort of the final word

972
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,180
on the KDN point.

973
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,200
Yeah, I started doing some video tutorials

974
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
and stuff for YouTube

975
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,200
and I decided to exclusively use only Linux tools

976
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,200
and I'm using KDN Live for all the editing and everything.

977
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,020
And I disagree that it's not usable,

978
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,860
but I totally agree.

979
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,460
Oh, it's usable, yeah.

980
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,200
I totally agree with your point about how it's very limited

981
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,600
and it's so much so that I experienced a couple crashes

982
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,720
just by trying to do an effect

983
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,940
that I eventually gave up and just,

984
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,980
I created animations in CSS on the web browser.

985
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,240
Yeah, I've done a couple of work around.

986
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,080
So if you watch this most recent segment

987
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
on the Linux Action Show

988
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,000
where I go over to Angela's house

989
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,960
and set up Open Media Vault,

990
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,360
that was edited under KDN Live.

991
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,380
Oh, cool, wow.

992
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,120
Yeah, so I mean, I've been using it to success,

993
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,880
but I'm experimenting with ideas for next year

994
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,840
where the output volume needs to go up a lot more.

995
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,120
And so that's where I'm worried about these tools

996
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,080
not being up to that task.

997
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,360
And I am sort of in a position of somewhat privilege

998
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,720
right now thanks to you, Wes,

999
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,120
where you set up Arch Linux on my MacBook.

1000
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,040
Oh, right, yeah.

1001
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,960
And so if push-pull comes to shove,

1002
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,460
I can boot in, I got an older version of macOS on there.

1003
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,120
I wonder what happens if I update that to Sierra.

1004
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,740
I'm not really compelled to do so,

1005
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,060
but I have no idea what would happen.

1006
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,960
You think it'd still boot into Arch?

1007
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,880
I mean, I imagine it would change the UEFI variable back

1008
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,100
so that it would boot into macOS, but you could change that.

1009
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,000
And I could boot into macOS, do my final cut thing,

1010
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,320
and then boot back into Arch

1011
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,360
for like everything I actually wanna do.

1012
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,880
And so I don't have to have a solution today,

1013
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,160
and I can continue to try to use KDE Live,

1014
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,560
but on the same hardware,

1015
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,240
because I'm just dual booting,

1016
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,600
there is a 20x speed improvement under Final Cut

1017
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,680
than there is under KDE Live.

1018
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,280
And it's just where it is right now.

1019
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,280
I do wanna make one more point.

1020
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,560
Technically, if you look at the track record

1021
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,220
of development for KDE Live,

1022
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,480
they were not working on KDE Live for like two

1023
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,320
or three years.

1024
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,320
They would like do a little bug phase here and there.

1025
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,400
For the past six, seven months or so,

1026
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,760
they have made incredible strides.

1027
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,480
Like they have fixed most of the crashing bugs

1028
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,840
on most issues,

1029
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,040
and the stability is like astronomically better

1030
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,120
than what it used to be.

1031
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,320
So I think by far, KDE Live is the best free editor

1032
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,120
on any platform.

1033
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
Yeah, I would say it's better

1034
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
than even Lightworks and everything.

1035
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,960
Yeah, I agree.

1036
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,640
And I've been really impressed with how well it's done.

1037
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,680
That's kind of why I wanted to give it

1038
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,680
some try the last few weeks.

1039
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,240
But one last thing before we move off of the new MacBooks,

1040
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,920
just as you might expect,

1041
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,960
there is already a fart app for the new Touch Bar.

1042
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,000
It's called Touch Fart,

1043
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,800
and it's right there.

1044
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,640
You run it.

1045
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Three different fart sounds.

1046
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,460
Yep, yep.

1047
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,080
And the two emoji and one word that say fart.

1048
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,920
So it works with Touch Fart macOS app

1049
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,740
to allow a selection of playbacks

1050
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,180
and predefined fart sounds.

1051
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,200
Right there on the Touch Bar.

1052
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,840
Told you it's useful, Wes.

1053
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,060
Who needs an escape button?

1054
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,900
Yeah, right?

1055
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,240
Just keep using that on hearts.

1056
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,000
All you need is a fart bar and a headphone jack.

1057
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,840
You're good.

1058
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,800
Yeah, I wonder, does it,

1059
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,200
huh, too bad they don't have any preview.

1060
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,760
Sorry, guys, I can't preview for you.

1061
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,200
I think that fart bar will pair well

1062
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,640
with the Cloud to Butt extension.

1063
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,000
Ha ha ha ha!

1064
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,840
Yes, Wes.

1065
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,220
Well said, well said.

1066
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,820
Speaking of the cloud,

1067
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,160
let's talk about DigitalOcean.

1068
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,240
DigitalOcean.com.

1069
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,000
Go build your own cloud over at DigitalOcean.com

1070
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,660
and use our promo code.

1071
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,800
Did you know we have a promo code, Wes?

1072
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,640
It's D-O-Unplugged.

1073
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,460
Do you know that?

1074
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,300
D-O-Unplugged.

1075
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,120
It's new, it's brand new.

1076
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,360
Brand new promo code, D-O, not really.

1077
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,520
Be the first to use it.

1078
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,360
Yeah.

1079
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,280
D-O-Unplugged, one word, lowercase.

1080
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280
I'll give you a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean.com

1081
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,520
and you can go spin up a droplet in seconds.

1082
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,700
And they have data centers in New York,

1083
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,240
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

1084
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,440
London, Toronto, Germany, India.

1085
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,800
And you can either do a monthly plan,

1086
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,300
like they start at like five bucks a month,

1087
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,720
or you can do their hourly pricing.

1088
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,540
I love their three cents an hour rig.

1089
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,260
They have a simple, intuitive interface

1090
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,160
and a really nice, straightforward API

1091
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,400
that's really well supported by the community.

1092
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,060
You can really just probably take advantage

1093
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,160
of the code already written.

1094
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,500
Or you could quickly bang something out

1095
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,960
because the API's well documented.

1096
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,520
And man, speaking of documentation,

1097
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,520
they got tons of good documentation over at DigitalOcean.

1098
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,080
You'll be impressed in the community section.

1099
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,920
There's a how-to up that was posted just three hours ago

1100
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,840
on how to configure Nextcloud on Open21604.

1101
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,680
Wow.

1102
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,720
Yeah, so you can go build your own cloud

1103
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,540
over on DigitalOcean with Nextcloud.

1104
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,680
It's such a neat, like, symbiotic relationship

1105
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,280
between the open source community and D-O.

1106
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,920
Yeah, yeah, and I like that they work

1107
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,440
with the upstream projects, like the different distros

1108
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,040
and even FreeBSD that they have on the systems.

1109
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,860
That's really cool.

1110
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,680
It's in D-O's interest to let you run whatever you want.

1111
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,000
Like, that's what they're there for

1112
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,840
and they're great at it.

1113
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,200
You wanna go kick the tires on something

1114
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,760
or throw it in production, go to DigitalOcean.com

1115
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,520
and use our promo code D-O Unplugged

1116
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,700
and a big thanks to DigitalOcean

1117
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,300
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1118
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,960
Okay, guys, you know I'm always looking

1119
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,640
for something to replace the Chromecast and the Roku.

1120
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,960
And your Amazon stick, Chris.

1121
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,940
I do have a fire here at the studio and I hate it.

1122
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,120
I'm sorry, fire lovers.

1123
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,000
I don't, I got it and I hate it.

1124
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,020
But you know what else?

1125
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:02,080
I would love to eventually replace my Shield TV.

1126
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,440
I had an upgrade, big props to Nvidia.

1127
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,000
They ship monthly updates to this thing

1128
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,860
so you get the monthly Android updates.

1129
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,080
Can I use it as a phone?

1130
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,240
I know, right?

1131
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,500
And so I installed the latest update

1132
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,280
and it began rebooting every three minutes.

1133
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,120
Yikes.

1134
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,200
And I thought I was in a bad situation.

1135
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,960
So I had to do like a mad dash on install applications,

1136
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,840
which turns out for some reason on Android TV,

1137
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,600
if you go into the Android mechanism

1138
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,640
inside the system settings to uninstall applications,

1139
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,200
it doesn't uninstall the application.

1140
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,060
No, you have to go through the Play Store.

1141
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,040
So I went through the Play Store,

1142
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,600
found each application, uninstalled them,

1143
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,680
and then it finally stopped rebooting.

1144
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,120
And even though I love the Shield TV,

1145
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,480
it's the best set top box I've ever had,

1146
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,720
it sort of made me look for something else

1147
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,340
because for a good solid 25 minutes,

1148
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,820
I gotta explain, it's the weekend.

1149
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,200
It is the Pacific Northwest.

1150
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,400
Precious relaxation time.

1151
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,240
It was pouring down rain outside.

1152
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,160
It was miserable.

1153
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,360
Slash beautiful.

1154
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,240
Yeah, at times it was like also like

1155
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,440
right as I needed to go trick or treating.

1156
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,880
So kids went trick or treating on Saturday

1157
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,600
and about a half hour before they went trick or treating,

1158
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,540
it stopped raining.

1159
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,380
Nice.

1160
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,540
And I was like, this is perfect.

1161
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,760
But earlier in the morning at about like 10 a.m.,

1162
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,400
it was miserable outside.

1163
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,720
And I'm like, okay, let's watch a movie.

1164
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Well, watch a movie.

1165
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,160
And dad goes to start a movie

1166
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,540
and it starts rebooting all the time.

1167
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,000
And there is nothing worse as a father

1168
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,240
when you go to like, here children,

1169
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,680
here's the media system I've set up

1170
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,600
powered by all these fancy things that I've figured out.

1171
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,240
And I've got this movie on demand.

1172
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,400
Oh, what?

1173
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,640
And it reboots.

1174
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,480
And dad.

1175
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,320
And then you're sitting there like,

1176
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,800
oh, just a second, just a second, I'll fix it.

1177
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,760
Yeah, yeah.

1178
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,560
So that got me looking at Remix.io,

1179
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,420
a nougat-powered all-in-one 4K device

1180
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,300
that you hook up to your television.

1181
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,560
You know your television, Wes,

1182
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,720
where you have the Android Shield TV hooked up right now?

1183
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,560
That's right.

1184
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,480
You maybe hook this up instead.

1185
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,760
It's something that's on Kickstarter.

1186
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,440
It's got 3,960 backers.

1187
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,080
17 days to go, they had a goal of $250,000.

1188
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,240
And holy smokes, they've already blown past that.

1189
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,080
Woo!

1190
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,360
And they're at $484,000.

1191
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,360
["Danger is Better"]

1192
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,720
I hope this doesn't get us pulled down.

1193
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,240
But you can probably guess what they're doing right now.

1194
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,580
Danger is better.

1195
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,200
Whatever.

1196
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,320
I know how a TV works.

1197
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,680
Yeah, but can your TV do this?

1198
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,960
Clashing my clans in one click.

1199
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,980
So what do you think of a UI on your television

1200
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,480
that uses a mouse and keyboard?

1201
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,160
I have mixed feelings, at least about wider applicability.

1202
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,200
But you know, maybe you get one of those

1203
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,400
little Logitech wireless ones with the built-in trackpad.

1204
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,240
Or it includes its own.

1205
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,520
Let's just say it comes with a nice wireless keyboard,

1206
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,440
mouse set up, maybe a remote combo.

1207
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,840
And this is a little Android box,

1208
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,080
you set it up on your television,

1209
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,680
and you can play, you know, you can play,

1210
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,440
Android, a mouse works surprisingly well with Android.

1211
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,640
It's like they intended it to have a mouse.

1212
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,520
Would you, no?

1213
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,680
You instantly don't like it?

1214
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,500
You wouldn't do it?

1215
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,340
No, I think I would.

1216
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,040
I mean, I have a Upadubat Mate box running on a TV,

1217
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,740
so I think I'm open to it.

1218
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,920
Honestly, it might be my preferred way.

1219
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,760
I think I would still like.

1220
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,780
You know how many people email me and say,

1221
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,000
my media center is VLC hooked up to my PC?

1222
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Right, for me it's Kodi, but same thing, yeah.

1223
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,320
And this is by the same people

1224
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,960
who do the Remix OS, right?

1225
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,200
Yes, and remind me, Remix OS.

1226
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,560
That's the Android Spin 4 x86.

1227
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,280
Yeah, the one that we've actually, I think,

1228
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,280
featured as a, I don't know if we've reviewed it

1229
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,600
on this show or we featured it on last,

1230
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,240
but we talked about it not too long ago.

1231
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,400
I think I even have it on the USB stick still floating around.

1232
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
So they got the Remix IO, which is 99 bucks,

1233
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,560
a 4K TV box, an Android game console,

1234
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,480
and then they have the Remix IO Plus, $130,

1235
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,800
a performance beast to bring out the potential of your TV.

1236
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,640
What the?

1237
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,040
So is this running on an ARM board?

1238
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,240
Do we know, is it x86?

1239
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,000
How do I get the potential out of my TV?

1240
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,080
Is that what you're asking?

1241
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,760
Yeah, it is a ARM processor, yeah.

1242
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,200
The RK399 with four gigs of RAM.

1243
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,800
Okay, four gigs, that doesn't sound bad.

1244
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,520
No, not bad, no fans either, they say,

1245
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,460
so that's kind of nice.

1246
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,300
I'm gonna take that.

1247
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,120
What do you think?

1248
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,680
Does the Mumba Room have any thoughts on this thing?

1249
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,240
I remember that Popey talked about the license

1250
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,480
of Remix OS when we talked about Remix OS the first time.

1251
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,400
Oh, can you remind me?

1252
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,720
I don't recall.

1253
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,640
Did I?

1254
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,760
I think you, in fact, you're giving China access

1255
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,200
to your computer, I think.

1256
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,920
That sounds like Popey.

1257
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,800
Don't think that was me.

1258
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,220
He hates the Chiners.

1259
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,600
I remember hearing they were completely ignoring

1260
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,300
the TPL in some cases.

1261
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,480
Yeah, it's been claimed that they've violated

1262
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,520
the GPL and Apache licenses, yes.

1263
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,960
We're about to get to that topic, as a matter of fact,

1264
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,860
in a little bit.

1265
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,440
Oh, you guys in the Mumba Room,

1266
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,840
you know why I'm covering this.

1267
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,800
I've been desperate to replace the Chromecast,

1268
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,240
and I would love to have something that is usable,

1269
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,720
that has actual useful streaming apps like Netflix

1270
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,120
and Hulu on it, or whatever it is, whatever,

1271
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,520
on a device that I can hook up to my television,

1272
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,660
and honestly, I'd like to be able to buy a couple of them.

1273
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,520
I'd like it to be something that's a product.

1274
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,760
Yeah, affordable enough, something that you can,

1275
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,400
you don't have to build it yourself.

1276
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,480
And it can run Kodi.

1277
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,320
It has to run Kodi, is that a requirement?

1278
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,240
Well, I think, I think so.

1279
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,840
Because, like, is the Roku not good enough?

1280
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,240
Just curious, because I was actually thinking

1281
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,680
about going the Roku route.

1282
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,240
If you want to use Plex, the Roku's good enough.

1283
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,760
The Plex app has gotten, just in the last six months,

1284
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,480
nine months, the Plex app has gotten pretty good

1285
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,320
on the Roku.

1286
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,440
But if you want to use Kodi, and I honestly feel

1287
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,280
like Kodi is a better experience.

1288
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,920
Do you really care what the hardware is?

1289
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,340
No, I don't so much, as long as it's something

1290
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,180
that is sustainable.

1291
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,400
Are you more interested in the software

1292
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,600
that's running on it?

1293
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,840
I am more interested in having access to Kodi and Netflix.

1294
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,640
The software, like Kodi and Plex and stuff?

1295
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,440
Yeah, and Netflix, yeah.

1296
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,040
That's really true, and I want something

1297
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,360
that I can plug in, and God, I would just love

1298
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,280
to not have to worry about it for three or four years.

1299
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,560
Like, I would love something that I could run

1300
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,560
for three or four years.

1301
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,060
Something that, like, had the notion to support

1302
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,680
the open source stacks that you're gonna run,

1303
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,500
but could also interface with the proprietary stuff,

1304
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,040
and was an appliance.

1305
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,280
Yeah, yeah, Roku looks awesome for, you know,

1306
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,120
the price in which you get it.

1307
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,040
It's the kind of thing I'd like as well, yeah.

1308
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,160
What are you doing right now?

1309
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,360
Do you have a Roku, or do you have a device like it?

1310
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,760
Uh, Chromecast.

1311
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,580
No, it's all Chromecast here, but I would like something

1312
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,880
that I could install on.

1313
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,680
So anytime you want to watch something on the TV,

1314
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,480
you're using your phone to cast it?

1315
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,320
Or a computer.

1316
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,000
Hmm, that's a lot of work.

1317
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,240
That's how we do it here in the studio, too,

1318
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,640
and it's just, it's a lot of work.

1319
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,200
And it doesn't always, like, sometimes the phone

1320
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,160
loses connection with the playback control,

1321
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,440
and that's really frustrating.

1322
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,720
YouTube in particular?

1323
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,320
Yeah, which just doesn't make any sense.

1324
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,480
Or you, like, get the volume, and then you can't,

1325
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,160
the volume's all offset, yeah.

1326
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,600
The other thing, too, is if you don't have an Android TV,

1327
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,760
and you haven't experienced this,

1328
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,880
the YouTube app on Android TV is actually really good.

1329
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,720
Really?

1330
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,360
It's my favorite YouTube experience.

1331
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,100
It's way better than on the desktop.

1332
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,480
I feel like it surfaces more interesting videos

1333
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,240
than the desktop does, and it displays them in a way

1334
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,280
that's easier for me to see them.

1335
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,920
Playback is phenomenal.

1336
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,840
You don't get comments, you can't click on, like,

1337
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,600
when people say, like, click this link or something.

1338
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,360
Oh, it doesn't support the annotations

1339
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,200
or anything like that, but for just playback

1340
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,000
and the way it buffers really intelligently,

1341
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,080
and it auto-scales the resolution perfectly,

1342
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,880
which, trust me, I'm working on MiFi here.

1343
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,600
It really does a good job.

1344
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,920
240p is your best friend.

1345
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,520
Since I've gotten the Shield TV,

1346
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,720
it has transformed my television watching to,

1347
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,080
I have stopped watching traditional television.

1348
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,680
Like, I only got to season one of Mr. Robot,

1349
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,520
and I stopped watching.

1350
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,720
Yeah, me too.

1351
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,080
Because I'm watching everything on YouTube now.

1352
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,520
It's really kind of fun, because I'm getting

1353
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,400
what feels like much more real, genuine content.

1354
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,520
Yeah, exactly, and it has, thankfully,

1355
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,120
pretty good Linux support and interface, too.

1356
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,640
Yeah, and so we'll see, we'll see.

1357
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,840
I'm on a mission to eventually,

1358
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,380
I would like that set-top box that I could get

1359
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,320
for family members for Christmas,

1360
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,560
or I could get for myself.

1361
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,040
The Shield TV is very expensive,

1362
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,240
and it feels like it's not Nvidia's even top three priority,

1363
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,400
so like, when's my long term?

1364
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,640
Am I gonna get three years out of this?

1365
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,520
Right, they could drop that, shift, whatever, anytime.

1366
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,880
It is a good demonstration of their chipset platform,

1367
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,880
so from that perspective, it's particularly fun,

1368
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,800
because there are some great games on there.

1369
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,920
It has sort of a console-like experience.

1370
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,800
It's a tuned, complete little package, right?

1371
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,560
But you know what I kind of fantasize about

1372
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,720
is like a Intel NUC type thing, but with a real GPU,

1373
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,480
running Steam OS with Kodi included in it,

1374
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,080
so like, it's Steam OS, but it's primarily a Kodi box,

1375
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,900
that in Kodi, there's like a Steam OS option,

1376
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,740
like you don't have movies and TV.

1377
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,440
Oh, like a Kodi plug-in to list your games

1378
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,280
and then watch them.

1379
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,000
And then it flips over to a Steam OS desktop,

1380
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
which is running big picture mode or something like that.

1381
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,520
Maybe it's even like X on another...

1382
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,120
Yeah, yeah, on another TTY or something,

1383
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,240
and it's like its own dedicated big picture mode,

1384
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,760
and then I've got a full-fledged Steam OS machine,

1385
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,920
and then if there was some sort of in menu,

1386
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,880
I could flip back to the Kodi experience,

1387
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,760
and now I have a multimedia machine.

1388
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,360
Even if it's gotta be like a little PC, I would love to have...

1389
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,200
That would be amazing.

1390
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,520
That's what I want, and I want it to run Steam OS,

1391
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,200
because then it's more of a Linux box,

1392
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,360
and I can play the games I really like.

1393
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,640
See, the one thing here...

1394
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,480
Oh, go on.

1395
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,840
You wouldn't want it to run Steam OS at the moment

1396
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,320
because it's just broken and crashes.

1397
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,320
Oh, well, okay.

1398
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,560
But the caveat, the Steam OS isn't sucking at the time.

1399
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,900
Okay, one of the better runtimes for Steam

1400
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,720
and then the Steam games.

1401
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,440
See, I think the caveat for me is I kind of enjoy

1402
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,400
some of the Chromecast that I can sit

1403
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,960
and then queue something up easily.

1404
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,200
That is nice about Android TV.

1405
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,280
I'd like them to build the Chromecast stuff into Shield.

1406
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,400
Yeah, or if there's...

1407
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,240
I know I've seen a couple, like...

1408
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,060
The Shield has it.

1409
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:50,900
I've been to Steam OS.

1410
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,600
That's a nice thing, too, is...

1411
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,100
Yeah, you still have that functionality with Android TV,

1412
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:55,940
is that...

1413
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,280
Yeah, and so I think I've seen a couple

1414
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,640
attempted open source type replacements,

1415
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,660
or even something where you could take a link

1416
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,340
and then get a plugin that could go like,

1417
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,600
hey, send this to my Kodi box and play that,

1418
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,440
play the link from YouTube with YouTube DL.

1419
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,360
Michael's working on that.

1420
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,580
Yeah, go, tell him about it.

1421
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,380
Yeah, it's a cast, spelled with a K, for Kodi,

1422
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,520
and it's basically exactly that.

1423
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,000
It's more of a plugin structure like you just mentioned

1424
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,240
where you tell it a URL,

1425
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,040
and then the plugin figures out what add-on

1426
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,400
and what player in Kodi.

1427
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,520
Ooh, that sounds beautiful.

1428
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,560
Kodi already does that using the core app.

1429
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,940
No, that's just on the phone.

1430
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,920
That doesn't work on the desktop,

1431
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,040
so you can't send the information on your desktop.

1432
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,560
Yeah, it only works on your phone,

1433
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,960
so the core app is fantastic for the solution on the phone,

1434
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,380
but it doesn't support every single plugin structure,

1435
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,640
so I'm gonna try to submit some of my code to the core app

1436
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,200
so they can fix the arbitrary add-ons

1437
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,440
that are not necessarily common,

1438
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,680
and then that's basically the idea,

1439
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,680
is just to take the casting idea

1440
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,560
and put it to the improved core

1441
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,600
and also make a laptop version so you can just,

1442
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,000
my version actually works with local files

1443
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,360
on your computer as well.

1444
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,120
Oh, that is slick.

1445
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,560
I'm gonna check that out tonight.

1446
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,320
Yeah, that is, yeah, I love Kodi.

1447
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,720
I just love it so much.

1448
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,960
It's come so far.

1449
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,800
I got the...

1450
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,720
Mine uses Samba for the local stuff,

1451
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,320
and it's going to use NFS as well.

1452
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,320
Nice.

1453
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,800
I've been really, it's such a simple, obvious plugin,

1454
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,780
and I forget what it's called.

1455
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,960
I've mentioned the name before, though,

1456
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,940
so it is linked somewhere in the JB site.

1457
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,520
It is just the dumbest extension or plugin

1458
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,000
or whatever you call it on Kodi

1459
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,040
that just plays the next file in order,

1460
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,440
like Netflix does when you get to the end

1461
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,000
of a Netflix episode, it autoplays the next episode.

1462
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,080
This just auto, so if you're watching DuckTales

1463
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,640
and you got two seasons of DuckTales

1464
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,000
and you're on season one.

1465
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,480
You know what you're doing for the next 12 hours.

1466
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,760
Yeah, you got automatic DuckTales.

1467
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,600
Yeah, right?

1468
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,780
And so that's, I love that feature.

1469
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,520
I love it because I can just sit back

1470
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,600
and I don't have to look for the remote.

1471
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,720
I just, it's nice to be able to modify it

1472
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,360
in a way that feels like it's genuinely my setup.

1473
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,040
I also, I want to encourage you

1474
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,520
to make something also feel like your own,

1475
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,360
and that's your education, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1476
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,200
Linux Academy just announced another round of funding.

1477
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,920
Huge congrats. What?

1478
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,160
That's great. Yeah.

1479
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,280
Every time they do this, they invest deeply

1480
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,120
into Linux Academy content, and they get staff on board

1481
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,320
to make sure old content stays relevant.

1482
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,160
They get new staff to write the good stuff

1483
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,920
that you've been looking for with products

1484
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,280
that are exploding right now.

1485
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,600
They have research and development.

1486
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,360
Of course, they even have instructors

1487
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,800
that you can access to get real mentoring

1488
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,720
from a human being, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1489
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,320
Hands-on, scenario-based labs

1490
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,280
that give you real-world experience.

1491
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,240
You get to SSH into the server and own it

1492
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,560
and bang around and alter the distro

1493
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,520
based on your preference,

1494
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,360
so that way you can learn on the distro you need.

1495
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,360
You can prepare for a cert

1496
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,360
using their practice exams and quizzes,

1497
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,280
and I think one of the things that I like

1498
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,240
is these features that we're introducing

1499
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,360
that involve the community.

1500
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,080
First of all, I like that the community

1501
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,200
is stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members,

1502
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,480
but they have these custom randomized decks of cards

1503
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,680
where you can study and practice,

1504
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,960
and these cards can be forked by community members

1505
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,400
and improved upon, kind of like an open-source project.

1506
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,920
Another thing they've recently introduced

1507
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,480
is public profiles, so you can brag

1508
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,040
or demonstrate the hard work you've been doing

1509
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,240
at Linux Academy.

1510
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,160
They've got also courses if you wanna get your search

1511
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,080
and new iOS and Android apps.

1512
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,680
They're busting out new stuff all the time,

1513
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,720
and now they just secured another round of funding.

1514
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,560
It's just gonna get better.

1515
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,600
It's gonna keep going.

1516
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,600
They've recently also launched seven-day free trials.

1517
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,560
Free?

1518
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,200
Seven-day free trials, so you can go get a little taste

1519
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,840
over at Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

1520
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,840
and a big thank you to Linux Academy

1521
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,520
for sponsoring the unplugged program.

1522
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1523
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,680
That was my Fox News swish.

1524
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,520
Did that work?

1525
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,520
I think it landed.

1526
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,360
It's...

1527
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,240
I'm just gonna say that regardless.

1528
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,080
It's supposed to sound...

1529
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,920
No one tell him otherwise.

1530
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,280
It's supposed to sound a little bit like this.

1531
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,280
Speaking of breaking news,

1532
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,920
this happened a couple of weeks ago,

1533
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,760
but we just got the audio and video online this week.

1534
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,080
Linux maintainer, Greg Kh, he supports the LTS kernel,

1535
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,880
the USB subsystem, and a bunch of other subsystems

1536
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,200
that are absolutely essential to the function

1537
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,680
of your Linux box, and he's been around

1538
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,160
in Linux development since, well, forever,

1539
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,360
and he was at a Linux Foundation event,

1540
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,120
and he was doing a fireside chat.

1541
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,000
Ooh, did you hear the bombing?

1542
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,840
We have a bomber plane.

1543
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,660
Oh no.

1544
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,500
Duck and cover everybody.

1545
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,600
They knew we were about to talk about this.

1546
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,640
They knew this was coming,

1547
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,880
and he had a couple of choice quotes.

1548
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,640
We were just talking about licensing

1549
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,000
and other things like that,

1550
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,520
and I wanted to kind of jump in on some of this,

1551
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,120
but let's start with an interesting stat.

1552
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,800
Do you have a rough guess, Wes,

1553
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,160
how many people join the Linux kernel development team

1554
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,420
per month?

1555
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,260
Man, I have no idea.

1556
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,560
Let's go with 10.

1557
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,480
Okay, that's a good, that's what,

1558
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,320
I would probably would've,

1559
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,360
I actually would've guessed like four,

1560
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,160
because it seems like a pretty tight-knit team, right?

1561
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,760
I would've guessed like four.

1562
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,920
Greg actually shares the number with us,

1563
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,120
and it turns out, Wes, it's a bit larger.

1564
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,960
Freshman.

1565
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,920
But we have high school students working on the kernel,

1566
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,160
so, yeah, but I mean, there's always new people,

1567
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,180
our community, again, 200 new developers every three months.

1568
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,020
That's huge.

1569
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,800
200 to 300, is that what he just said?

1570
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,240
Community, again, 200 new developers every three months.

1571
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,060
Yeah. Wow.

1572
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:17,900
That's huge.

1573
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,800
So we have people coming in.

1574
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,840
Yeah, and it's not, I mean,

1575
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,240
we're not just talking about young people,

1576
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,060
people who switch from other industries, right?

1577
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,640
There's a whole, there's a learning curve,

1578
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,480
no matter where you're coming from.

1579
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,300
Now, catch this little stat.

1580
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,360
Oh, yeah, I mean, if you look at Seattle,

1581
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,680
so that's where I used to live,

1582
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,500
I mean, Seattle is filled with ex-Microsoft developers

1583
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,080
working on Linux right now.

1584
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,880
Amazon, Facebook, Google, Valve,

1585
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,080
all ex-Microsoft developers contributing to Linux,

1586
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,920
which is great.

1587
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,360
We want those engineers, we want those people,

1588
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,240
and they're doing really good stuff there.

1589
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,960
I didn't know he moved out of the Seattle area.

1590
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,080
Yeah, I didn't know he was on Mercer Island.

1591
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,160
I was always gonna go have dinner with Greg.

1592
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,320
Just waitin', waitin'.

1593
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,760
Does anybody in the mobile room know where Greg lives now?

1594
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,600
Anybody?

1595
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,900
Shower him, anybody wanna go be creepy and find out?

1596
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,080
Cause I've been fantasizing about getting a burger

1597
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,960
with Greg for a while now and recording that.

1598
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,640
So that's gotta be a thing, that's still gotta happen.

1599
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,680
All right, but that's not what was interesting.

1600
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,480
I thought that was a fun to know fact.

1601
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,320
Just a tidbit.

1602
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,680
But we recently tried to cover the two

1603
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,920
very different approaches to license enforcement

1604
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,600
that are developing in the Linux kernel.

1605
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,600
There's the Greg Linus method of a long burn,

1606
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,800
work with these people over a decade.

1607
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,480
And then lazily you could say

1608
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,200
there's the software conservancy method

1609
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,200
where you try to work with them and when things fail,

1610
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,040
you quickly escalate to lawsuits.

1611
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,200
And Greg was asked about that.

1612
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,960
And I think you can tone, you can tell by the tone

1613
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,920
and you can tell by the slight awkwardness at the beginning.

1614
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,360
This is an extremely sensitive topic

1615
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,720
for Greg and the Linux Foundation and the Linux community.

1616
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,180
So pay attention to sort of the awkwardness

1617
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,400
of this question too.

1618
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,880
Healthy discussion on the kernel summit mailing list

1619
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,360
on the topic of licenses.

1620
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,000
And how can I describe it?

1621
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,200
You're gonna let me go here?

1622
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,440
I'm gonna let you go.

1623
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,000
Well, as much as you want.

1624
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,840
There's some interesting points raised.

1625
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,960
And I guess, well, let me,

1626
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,820
do you wanna describe the discussion?

1627
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,200
I think you probably remember it.

1628
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,560
Awkward.

1629
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:26,840
Yes, so the discussion came up about GPL enforcement.

1630
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,400
And what to do about that.

1631
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,920
And people's statements saying,

1632
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,640
making the claim that if we don't enforce the GPL,

1633
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,640
it's the same as the BSD license.

1634
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,480
And I called bullshit on that.

1635
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,120
Oh, dang.

1636
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,380
That's flat out false.

1637
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,720
And because that's not true, that's flat out false.

1638
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,140
And what we're seeing these days,

1639
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:52,080
I mean, yes, people violate our license.

1640
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,200
That always happens.

1641
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,140
It's gotten better.

1642
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,320
I don't know if anybody remembers the 1990s

1643
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,200
when people were shipping close source,

1644
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,540
ethernet drivers, SCSI drivers, controller drivers,

1645
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,420
everything, it was crazy.

1646
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,600
We are a lot, lot better.

1647
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,600
One of the biggest violators of the GPL used to be Intel.

1648
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,740
And now they're our biggest supporter.

1649
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,120
On more ways than one, financial, code, contributions,

1650
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:17,960
everything else.

1651
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,840
And that happened due to us working with them.

1652
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,480
And so my main point about GPL compliance is

1653
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,040
everybody owns their copyrights.

1654
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,800
You're free to do however you wish

1655
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,020
with those copyrights and enforcing them

1656
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,920
and getting the code.

1657
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,240
But use your judgment.

1658
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,200
The judgment should be not necessarily

1659
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,800
you have to get the code.

1660
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,440
Because if you go into a company with lawyers

1661
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,880
knocking on the front door,

1662
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,800
you're gonna get, the walls are gonna come down

1663
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,200
and you're gonna alienate everybody in that company.

1664
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,040
Let's stop right there.

1665
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,760
I think this is such a key argument.

1666
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,440
And it's one that if you come at it

1667
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,880
from a pure legal argument or a raw analysis of the license,

1668
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,320
that it doesn't resonate, it doesn't make sense to you.

1669
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,640
And this is where the software conservancy is coming from.

1670
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,120
And it's easy to be on that, right?

1671
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,400
Like we wanna protect these rights,

1672
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,960
that's what the license is about.

1673
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,960
But you also have to consider the bigger picture.

1674
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,140
And I think unless you have spent decades

1675
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,360
working with developers and changing their mind over time

1676
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,320
and working with them to be more interoperable with Linux

1677
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,840
and then reaping the benefits of that,

1678
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,160
you fail to understand how important

1679
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,380
that particular process is.

1680
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,280
And what he's talking about here is

1681
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,700
when we get into these legal enforcement battles,

1682
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,320
these companies shut down.

1683
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,600
And any contributions we were gonna get go away.

1684
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,360
And all of the naysayers in the company

1685
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,640
are all of a sudden proven right.

1686
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,040
Use your judgment.

1687
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,020
The judgment should be not necessarily

1688
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,600
you have to get the code.

1689
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,240
Because if you go into a company with lawyers

1690
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,360
knocking on the front door, you're gonna get,

1691
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,600
the walls are gonna come down

1692
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,140
and you're gonna alienate everybody in that company

1693
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,320
that was using Linux.

1694
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,520
Because inside every company when you start using Linux,

1695
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,700
you have two camps.

1696
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,800
One is like, oh, those hippies and punks,

1697
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,540
we can't use this crazy stuff.

1698
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,380
And then you convince them and you finally get that.

1699
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,600
And if one of those people, those crazy hippies and punks

1700
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,440
shows up at the front door with a lawyer,

1701
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,020
boom, you proved them right.

1702
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:09,080
You were wrong, doors come down, everything works bad.

1703
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,360
But if as a developer you go to that same company

1704
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,860
and contact the developers in there and say,

1705
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:17,520
hey, what can I do to help you get your code merged

1706
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,840
into the kernel?

1707
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,340
And that's a totally different way of working with them.

1708
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,940
That says, hey, the community's willing to work with you,

1709
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,380
willing to invest their time with you,

1710
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,080
willing to make your product better.

1711
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,160
And that's the best way to work forward.

1712
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,080
We have seen it time and time again

1713
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,060
that when you go in with lawyers or representatives

1714
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,720
of the developers and not the developers themselves,

1715
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,760
the walls come down, all contact gets shut off.

1716
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm working with a silicon company today

1717
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,360
that has been shipping Linux on their product

1718
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,120
for eight, nine years.

1719
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,000
No code has ever come out of them.

1720
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,320
The developers inside the company reached out,

1721
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,580
I met some of them and they're saying, help us.

1722
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,400
I'm like, okay, great, we'll work with you.

1723
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,680
And the thing is, the code from this company

1724
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,400
is usually almost always is crap.

1725
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,080
We don't want that code.

1726
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:04,800
We really don't.

1727
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,440
I mean, you might want to get that one device working,

1728
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,280
but you really want is that company and those developers

1729
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,400
in that company to become part of our community

1730
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,560
and then label us to grow.

1731
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,280
Because the only way we're gonna survive

1732
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,680
is if we continue to grow

1733
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,380
and continue to bring more people in.

1734
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,300
We're gonna age out, we pass away,

1735
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,320
we move on to other things.

1736
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,560
We need more people in our community in order to survive.

1737
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,800
So you work with that company,

1738
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,640
you make them reliant on Linux,

1739
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,520
you make them realize that working with the community

1740
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,360
actually saves them time and money,

1741
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,760
which has been proven over and over and over.

1742
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,640
And then they're now reliant so much on Linux

1743
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,160
that they have to invest.

1744
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,200
They are part of the community, they rely on it.

1745
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,020
And it works.

1746
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,920
Look at all the sponsors and look at all the people

1747
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,600
who've been contributing to Linux over time.

1748
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,280
Again, I'll point out as Intel

1749
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,320
is the perfect poster child for this.

1750
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,320
They now do everything on Linux

1751
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,060
and they used to be our worst violator.

1752
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,880
It can happen, things can change.

1753
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,980
And we're in it for the long haul.

1754
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,960
We don't want just the instant code dump.

1755
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,760
We want you to work together

1756
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,160
and become part of our community.

1757
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,680
We're in it for the long haul.

1758
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,440
We don't just want the instant code dump.

1759
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,560
I like this.

1760
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,160
I like everything about this.

1761
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,560
Mohsen Rath, you had a comment on it.

1762
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,400
Go ahead.

1763
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,380
Mohsen, oh sorry Mohsen Rath, you're muted.

1764
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,720
Start over again, that was my bad.

1765
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,920
Sorry about that, okay.

1766
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,220
So I believe that you guys had this argument

1767
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:23,440
a few times over on both Linux Unplugged

1768
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,640
as well as Linux Action Store.

1769
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,540
Are you accusing me of repeating

1770
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,240
because these clips are brand new, sir.

1771
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,680
These are brand new clips, certified.

1772
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,760
The clips are new.

1773
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,800
The clips are brand new,

1774
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,960
but the argument is an old one.

1775
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,120
Which argument would you say that it's enforcement?

1776
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:38,960
Yeah, yeah.

1777
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,360
As Talness put it right there,

1778
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,040
coders versus lawyers in terms of

1779
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,680
do you want to take the open hand

1780
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,840
or do you want to take the closed fist?

1781
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,720
But as I remember watching,

1782
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,720
actually I wasn't watching,

1783
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,280
I was reading it in a comic book,

1784
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,480
the closed fist can still be used to protect

1785
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,300
whereas the open hand can be used to harm.

1786
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,680
So the end result is you have to sit there

1787
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,760
and take each company as a fresh approach.

1788
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,080
You take the most genial, the most open approach.

1789
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,640
You start with that one first

1790
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,500
and you work your way down the line.

1791
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,720
Because as they said, they used to have beef with Intel.

1792
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,560
Intel could have said,

1793
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,560
hey, you know this open source thing?

1794
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,860
You guys don't have real lawyers and stuff like that.

1795
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,400
We do, we now own you, your family,

1796
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,480
your entire genetic line, your computers,

1797
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,960
your cars, everything.

1798
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,640
Thank you for being our work slaves, enjoy.

1799
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,580
They could have done that because it's Intel.

1800
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,200
Much like Apple, much like Google now,

1801
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,720
they had the money to do that.

1802
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,260
But they instead, they were just like, you know what?

1803
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,680
We want them to use our product in a fashion

1804
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,680
that everyone can benefit.

1805
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,980
So we're gonna just walk to them real nice

1806
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,880
and talk to them real nice first,

1807
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,640
see if they see things from our perspective first

1808
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,360
before showing up with lawyers, quote-unquote,

1809
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:56,000
showing up with the FDA or whichever law enforcement it is

1810
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,960
kicking down the door and saying, you stole our stuff.

1811
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,100
Yeah, I would say, what I think,

1812
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,000
what I like to look at this situation

1813
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,840
as regular everyday Linux users,

1814
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:13,840
it's happening at a level that is really kind of obscure to us.

1815
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,040
We're not really cognizant of these kinds of things going on

1816
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,160
but there is, between the core contributors to the kernel

1817
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,280
and the software conservancy, which is a new group set up,

1818
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,600
I mean, there is a new level of argument brewing

1819
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,360
that we don't really have any involvement with.

1820
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,000
We can only just sit back and watch

1821
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,600
and it doesn't directly affect us,

1822
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,600
yet it could have long-term ramifications.

1823
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,360
And it's fascinating that there's this disconnect there.

1824
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,640
There's this whole thing brewing under the surface

1825
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,240
and we just get little glimpses of it from time to time.

1826
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,480
I think it's been an argument,

1827
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,480
as Moser Rath has pointed out,

1828
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,360
it's been a conversation for as long

1829
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,760
as this has been a particular issue,

1830
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,200
especially as GPL software

1831
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,240
has begun to get widespread adoption.

1832
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,280
I think it really marks the distinction

1833
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,760
between the Linux community and the wider GPL community,

1834
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,160
free software community, et cetera.

1835
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,320
And I wonder if it's not turning

1836
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,780
to a more significant volume now,

1837
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,460
now that you have the conservancy

1838
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,840
and you have new offenders that are in the mobile space

1839
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,840
that are particularly egregious.

1840
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,440
ARM platform has a lot of issues around it.

1841
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,460
I wonder if it's not being ratcheted up to a new level now.

1842
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,520
And I don't wanna go as far as to call it a cold war

1843
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,600
because that feels like it's adding a hype spin

1844
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,440
that's undeserved,

1845
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,440
sort of like that airplane bomber in the background.

1846
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,760
But I do feel like it is definitely something

1847
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,800
that desperately is getting close to needing a resolution.

1848
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,960
And I don't know if there's one on the horizon

1849
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:44,160
because there's some big fiefdoms being set up.

1850
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,360
And you have people that are in positions that are,

1851
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,960
I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm worried

1852
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,560
that people like Greg and Linus

1853
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,500
could eventually get burned out by this kind of stuff.

1854
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:00,520
Or there could be some sort of developer loss

1855
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,720
as this battle goes on.

1856
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,680
And that's the part I look at and wonder

1857
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,360
if we'll have longer ramifications

1858
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,040
on the quality of Linux code.

1859
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,000
That's the only kind of point.

1860
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,800
I know that's an extrapolation,

1861
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,880
but if you think about it,

1862
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,560
if I'm Greg and I'm 20-plus years, whatever, into this,

1863
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,240
you know what, I've made my bones,

1864
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:20,280
I've made my reputation, I don't need this bullshit.

1865
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,380
I don't need to go to events carrying two lawyers

1866
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:25,760
because of what this has led to.

1867
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,300
I don't need that hassle.

1868
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,480
You know what, guys, I've made my peace,

1869
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,120
good luck with everything, I'm moving on.

1870
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,360
I don't think that's a reasonable thing

1871
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,240
when you're getting down,

1872
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,360
because as somebody in Greg's position,

1873
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,960
you have to look at this and go, this is obvious.

1874
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,960
You are getting in the way of my ability

1875
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,680
to make this thing better.

1876
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:49,080
And all I wanna do is make this a better thing,

1877
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,000
and you're making it harder for me to do that,

1878
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,240
and I've dedicated my life to this, and I'm done with this.

1879
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,620
And that doesn't seem like an unreasonable position

1880
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,560
for someone that's worked as long as he has to do this.

1881
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,280
And I'm sure it can feel like other people

1882
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,360
who may feel that they have a legitimate claim

1883
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,240
or are representing those who do have a legitimate claim,

1884
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,360
I can see how that might feel like an outside influence

1885
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,320
that's trying to hurt or do something

1886
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,480
that you don't feel is best for you.

1887
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,840
Imagine, say, Greg or somebody like Greg

1888
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,840
felt they were on the precipice

1889
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,720
of finally getting a company to come along

1890
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,760
and really get involved at Linux,

1891
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,560
and another group starts up a legal battle,

1892
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,920
and it totally shuts down all of the progress

1893
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,400
you've been making for the last three years.

1894
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,400
How excruciatingly frustrating would that be?

1895
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,480
And that's where I worry it's going.

1896
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,560
W.W., you wanna jump in?

1897
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,520
Go ahead, sir.

1898
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,760
Well, I do understand your...

1899
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,200
I fully acknowledge that your point

1900
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,840
of him possibly getting burned out

1901
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,960
and getting sick of being open

1902
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,160
and just trying to be nice to people and get them in.

1903
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,240
I don't think when he does get people in,

1904
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,840
that's all he's doing.

1905
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:00,120
When you really want to impart something

1906
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,800
to a lot of people,

1907
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,640
and you want to make it great and open source,

1908
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,720
you don't just want to impart just the code.

1909
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,600
You want to impart your passion

1910
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,920
and what drives you to do this

1911
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,040
and put in the effort that you do

1912
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,560
to make it great and open source.

1913
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,200
And I would like to think that maybe Greg

1914
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,920
and others of similar mindset

1915
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,280
would be putting in that effort

1916
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,440
to have people not just contribute back

1917
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,680
and contribute open source code,

1918
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,120
that they try to contribute that sentiment

1919
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,960
that they feel of why they're doing this

1920
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:46,000
to other people so that they continue

1921
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,920
to have that feeling

1922
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,600
and they continue to want to make open source great.

1923
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,360
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

1924
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,200
I hope so.

1925
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,440
And why don't we wrap this all up

1926
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,680
on a more positive, just sort of funny,

1927
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,840
tongue-in-cheek note.

1928
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,280
Why the hell does the Linux kernel team

1929
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,640
still use email for so many damn things?

1930
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,760
So, doesn't the reliance on dusty old email,

1931
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,760
doesn't that just make us look

1932
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,280
like a bunch of old gray beards?

1933
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,280
You know, like get off my lawn type.

1934
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,240
So, you know, it's 2016.

1935
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,080
I mean, come on, Greg.

1936
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,200
Email, that's our patch review system.

1937
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,840
Can we do better?

1938
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,320
Give me the 30 second pitch.

1939
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,720
30 second pitch is there's nothing else better.

1940
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,160
There's nothing else faster.

1941
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,080
There's nothing else more in use by the whole world.

1942
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,040
Email, plain text works great

1943
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,120
for people who can't use GUIs,

1944
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,760
have intermittent email access to the internet.

1945
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,520
English is not their first language

1946
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,720
and connectivity issues again.

1947
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:44,480
And for review, I mean, as proof in the talk before mine,

1948
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:50,040
I reviewed 53 patches and accepted 13 of them in 15 minutes.

1949
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,600
And, Garrett, there's no way.

1950
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,760
There you go.

1951
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,000
Greg, you don't need no Slack.

1952
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,520
Although, seriously, you should check out Mattermost

1953
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,360
and Matrix.

1954
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,200
Or Rocketrat.

1955
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,040
Yeah, Matrix.

1956
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:02,880
Yeah.

1957
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,800
And then, eventually, maybe one of them.

1958
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,920
Well, I think with Matrix, they'll all work together.

1959
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:07,840
Oh, it's beautiful.

1960
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:08,880
You know what else works together?

1961
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,720

1974
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:12,920

1977
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,320
they like they like savings here means it's an hour earlier right that happens

1978
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,280
this Sunday here in the States that you know we have a double last coming up

1979
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:37,280
this Sunday by the way everybody and it's getting screwed by daylight savings

1980
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:41,320
although I'll have an extra hour of sleep so it's interesting see yeah you

1981
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,560
guys already did that that was Bush thing huh well you guys oh man it's

1982
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,600
still confusing the whole thing how many years later has it been since this got

1983
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,440
out of sync and it's still confusing yep well I'm glad you made a Popey I really

1984
01:10:52,440 --> 01:11:02,560
appreciate it connection issues earlier I don't know why yeah I saw that he sent

1985
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,680
me a note that sucks that sucks hey you know what I forgot to mention during the

1986
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:10,120
cadian live discussion is today I've been shooting a video behind the scenes

1987
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,640
here JB just a little bit bits and pieces specifically to do an editing

1988
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,040
comparison in cadian live and an editing comparison and final cut it's like

1989
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,880
science if I remember I will do follow-up next week on the episode and

1990
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:26,000
tell you let's all remind him yeah I am supposed to ask you something before I

1991
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,360
start poppy before are you if you have you bailed already yeah no he's still

1992
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,480
there he's still there I guess I'm supposed to ask you was it it's um I

1993
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:39,920
forgot I forgot what I'm supposed to ask you about a quote the cloud being other

1994
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:55,000
people's computers what is this what am I what is it did know I put you up to

1995
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
this I think I think maybe if you go three steps remove that may be the case

1996
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,520
I'm not sure it's been passed to me through a series of messengers who I'm

1997
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:09,640
sure this conversation have you what is it well I don't remember much these days

1998
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:14,440
but I do seem to recall I get irritated when people say it because it doesn't

1999
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,280
have to be the case the cloud or the cloud is other people's computers which

2000
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,880
one the cloud is other it's the cloud is other people computers because the fact

2001
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,120
is that doesn't have to be the case you can have your own orchestration of

2002
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,200
computers that you could call a cloud and it's your own private computers but

2003
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,400
yes not to be someone else's would you agree though when people say the cloud

2004
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,480
they're generally referring to hosted services generally referring to a public

2005
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,160
cloud but you could still have a private cloud is yeah well of course which is

2006
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:42,600
your own yeah of course but you could but I mean I think in general when

2007
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:47,600
people refer to the cloud they're referring to Azure Amazon digital ocean

2008
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,040
rackspace certainly micro services things like that that's what they're

2009
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,640
referring to I I think don't you depends who you ask because some people for some

2010
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,640
people cloud is Dropbox and for other people cloud is just you know a picture

2011
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:04,160
on a diagram it depends who you ask and I think you and people of your level of

2012
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:09,200
intelligence saying that know exactly what it means and I think you know what

2013
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,520
public and private clouds are I feel like if you're like private clouds are

2014
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:17,600
like local clouds could be the fog I'm looking across the room well at my next

2015
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,440
cloud box right yeah I guess I see your point but I also feel like it's good to

2016
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:27,040
remind people that the cloud can also be a sort of a marketing obfuscation tool

2017
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:33,600
sure can be but it doesn't it's not it's not a blanket whenever I hear it it's

2018
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:39,160
it's it's always seen as like this is the only state that like the cloud is

2019
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:42,960
somebody else's computer fact end of story and that just doesn't tell the

2020
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,360
whole story that's because when most people set up a server they don't call

2021
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,800
it the cloud they call it my server that's because they only have one if

2022
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,640
they had multiple than they would call it like I call my own I don't call I

2023
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:57,040
have I have a bunch of servers I don't call it my cloud no but mine orchestrate

2024
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:00,000
with each other in a way that it's not important which one I'm actually hitting

2025
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,960
okay well so then that okay do you okay all right so it's more sort of obscure

2026
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,440
and you can't really tell where you're actually going necessarily I'll tell you

2027
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:13,360
honestly I generally prefer this version because it makes the cloud less

2028
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:18,960
bullshitty hype but they were it but I still think the main issue is when you

2029
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,480
if you were to take a room of a thousand geeks a like you're at a conference and

2030
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,840
ask them what's the cloud I think they would all think it's it's a it's

2031
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,400
services hosted by it by a third party I think to an end-user where the cloud

2032
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,600
terminology is important it's just to emphasize that they don't have to worry

2033
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,440
about storing their own data that someone else is going to handle that

2034
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:43,520
when I think of cloud I think of managed infrastructure yeah exactly it's

2035
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:49,240
yeah yeah yeah contract service level agreement with that company and you know

2036
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,840
they're providing a service in the same way that you're paying for your

2037
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,680
utilities at home hey it's not the water utilities it's somebody else's water

2038
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:03,120
it's not okay I like that argument too I still feel like though that this is

2039
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,640
pretty down in the weeds and that's your main core issue with this is it so far

2040
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:11,360
down the weeds is like it's like arguing that you shouldn't call a tissue paper

2041
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:18,000
Kleenex no no no no I it's it's just that I don't like that that's the only

2042
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,360
side of the argument that's ever expressed and it's and it's used as a

2043
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:26,000
stick to beat cloud as if cloud is a bad thing and you should never use it

2044
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,880
because it's somebody else's computer it's bullshit all your services were

2045
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,920
already running on someone else's computer they were just maybe doing it

2046
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,960
less scalably yeah yeah mm-hmm I guess I see your point I see your point I just

2047
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,440
don't see like it's I think that's a losing battle it's a language battle

2048
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:46,240
that's been lost so it is thanks for bringing out yeah I guess you know how

2049
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:53,120
about this is a line build your own cloud yeah I've done that thanks
