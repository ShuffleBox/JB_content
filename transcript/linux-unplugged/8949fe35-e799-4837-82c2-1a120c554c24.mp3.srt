1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Well, first and foremost, it is great to have you back, Wes.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,600
Thank you.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,160
It is awesome to be back.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,440
I missed the show while I was away.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,040
We missed you.

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,320
And now you're like a well-traveled man.

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,560
I can be like, oh, yeah, my buddy Wes,

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,400
he goes to Bali for vacations.

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,560
Hey, you know it.

10
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,560
Yeah, you can increase your coolness factor.

11
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,360
Just latch right on.

12
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,600
You're always welcome.

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,360
Now, in your wild world travels, Wes,

14
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,480
have you ever seen anything as wild as a Commodore 64 running

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,120
Slack?

16
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,720
Oh, my.

17
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,200
No, I have not.

18
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,160
Brent found this and sent it to me during the week.

19
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,700
And he's like, you've got to see this.

20
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,520
This is Slack running on a Commodore 64.

21
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,600
And you've got to think, how is that even possible?

22
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,320
Well, a Raspberry Pi is involved with a little bit of Linux,

23
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,760
of course.

24
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,520
You see, the C64 has an extension port

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,600
called the, quote, user port, which via an adapter

26
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,960
can communicate over RS232 serial.

27
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,360
So this guy connected that user port to an RS232 serial USB

28
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,560
adapter connected to, well, a Raspberry Pi.

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,840
But the part that I like is the cable description.

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,560
This is the cable that he used.

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,520
And I think it's great.

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,440
It was an artisanal, locally sourced, homemade cable

33
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,560
with a user port connector on one end

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,760
and a USB TTL RS232 converter on the other.

35
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,000
He says the fastest he got this thing to communicate,

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,800
the fastest you could use Slack, was 1,200 baud,

37
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,400
or 150 bytes per second.

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,840
That should be enough for anyone.

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:47,520
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 257 for July 10, 2018.

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,120
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk

41
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,240
show that, unbelievably, is already live again from Texas.

42
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,040
My name is Chris.

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,000
My name is Wes.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,840
Hello, Wes.

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,820
Oh my gosh, it's good to have you back,

46
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,400
you world-traveling suave man, you.

47
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,280
Good to have you here.

48
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,160
It's amazing.

49
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,960
And I get back, and suddenly you're not here?

50
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,160
What is going on?

51
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,200
I know.

52
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,120
We're just two podcasters passing in the night.

53
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,600
As my plane is taking off, your plane is landing.

54
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,280
It's been like that since my first Texas trip.

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,660
Just kind of the way it worked out.

56
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,280
But I'm glad, after all that, we're back together again.

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,040
Someday we'll see each other again in the real world.

58
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,920
But we have the magic of technology,

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,080
so we're here anyway.

60
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,040
One day.

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,400
And that event may be barbecue that brings us together.

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,160
But coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged

63
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,360
program, a great bunch of community news you can use,

64
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,040
including a really popular open source app that's

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,120
asking for your attention.

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,520
We have a couple of Firefox fast takes

67
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,080
that you probably need to know about.

68
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,040
And then we'll get into the Ubuntu corner.

69
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,160
A couple of new announcements coming out of the Ubuntu

70
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
project, as well as some things around them.

71
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,840
And then holy crap.

72
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,920
Holy crap.

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,320
Wine is so old, but like in an awesome way.

74
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Now it's also going to get cheaper car insurance.

75
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,960
We'll tell you about some new milestones for wine

76
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,240
and some big changes that are coming to the project.

77
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,640
New architectures, et cetera.

78
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,480
And then, later on in the show, we now

79
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,280
have the results from the recent Gentoo hack.

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,740
We know what happened.

81
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,920
We know what went wrong.

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,280
They've posted an entire postmortem.

83
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,780
And it's in-depth.

84
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,880
It's detailed.

85
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,720
And I think it's educational.

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,680
So we'll cover that.

87
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,480
We'll describe what happened.

88
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,440
And then maybe talk about the bigger picture

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,360
about Linux distributions maintaining infrastructure.

90
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,400
Now, I will admit I may have some sysadmin bias

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,480
in this particular segment.

92
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,120
But I'm really looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts.

93
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,960
Like our mumble room, let's bring them in.

94
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,120
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

95
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,800
What's up?

96
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,160
Hello.

97
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,080
Hello.

98
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,960
And you may have noticed in that,

99
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,720
I don't know what you call that, those series of voices there,

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
there is one Mr. Brent in there.

101
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,520
Brent is joining us via the mumble room this week.

102
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,360
Brent, so glad to have you here as well.

103
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,760
Hey, it's great to be with both of you this week.

104
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,560
Absolutely.

105
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,280
Yeah, all of us need to get together in the studio.

106
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,560
How fun would that be?

107
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,000
The three of us in studio doing a show, eating some barbecue.

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,240
I'm salivating already.

109
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,920
Yeah.

110
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,440
This needs to happen, doesn't it?

111
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,600
Didn't that happen already?

112
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,360
Wasn't that the first experience on the show for me?

113
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
That's why we know it needs to happen again, Brent.

114
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,120
We know it works.

115
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,620
Obviously.

116
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,600
Every single week it should happen, I think.

117
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,560
That'd be great.

118
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,400
Yeah, we'll just get this huge budget,

119
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,200
and we'll just fly you out every single week for the show,

120
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,080
like some sort of high end radio show or something.

121
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,800
You know, I could stay for more than a week.

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,520
There you go.

123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,000
Now you're thinking, yeah, we could just set you up

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,240
a little room in the studio.

125
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,840
I've got the space.

126
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,020
Decent connection, decent Wi-Fi, all the things you need.

127
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,320
I did sleep in the studio last time, if you remember.

128
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,240
That's right.

129
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,440
Yeah, that's how our barbecues go.

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,800
And if you're lucky, a little Levi comes and snuggles

131
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,240
with you.

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,800
Man, I tell you what.

133
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,240
That is the hardest part about traveling is that dog.

134
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,520
I miss that dog already.

135
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,480
All right, well, let's get into the community news

136
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,560
that you can use.

137
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,280
Let's start with KDN Live's significant refactoring

138
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,000
that they're doing that they're asking for testing.

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,360
I feel like this is a really big deal because this,

140
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,080
at least in my view, is open source's most

141
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,000
potential Final Cut killer.

142
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,920
Let's put it that way.

143
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,760
It's really coming along.

144
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,120
And they've added a couple of new features

145
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,320
that I think are really handy, including

146
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,320
proper slow motion video support, massive improvements

147
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,280
to their timeline, the ability to automatically separate

148
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,720
clips that have both video and audio tracks, which

149
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,320
is very handy when you're trying to remove what we have is

150
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,560
what we call is scratch audio on the camera.

151
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,040
So you record scratch audio on the camera, and then you

152
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,040
record the actual source audio using a professional microphone

153
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,720
going into a professional recorder.

154
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,600
And it's really handy to be able to just drop

155
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,200
the audio from the video, separate it out,

156
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,680
and then get rid of your scratch audio.

157
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,200
So that's coming in there now.

158
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,400
Support for generating lower resolution video

159
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,200
in the timeline preview, which means

160
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,240
it makes it easier to work with something like 4K

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,600
video on a machine that maybe can't render 4K in real time.

162
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,280
They're changing the layout of the keyboard.

163
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,880
Yeah, and it's a lot of stuff.

164
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,560
And just a bunch of other enhancements.

165
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,920
So it's available now as an app image

166
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,200
if you want to help them test it.

167
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,000
And they're trying to get the word out there.

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,720
They've been contacting a few media outlets

169
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,920
and saying, hey, can you spread the word

170
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,960
that we need people to test this?

171
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,560
We really need people to test this.

172
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,720
Time to bring back the video version of Last Then,

173
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,200
isn't it?

174
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,600
Just kidding.

175
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,440
You know what's funny is when I saw this story,

176
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm like, oh, that's so nice.

177
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,880
I'm glad that this is really improving.

178
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,920
And there was a version of me that

179
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,120
would have been almost hyperventilating with excitement.

180
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,040
But since we've spun down some of the video stuff,

181
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,360
I've really taken a break from video editing.

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,920
It's been easier on my body.

183
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,240
My RSI issues have started to clear up a little bit.

184
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,440
And it's just.

185
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,040
You've been less depressed, happier,

186
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,600
and maybe if you're lucky, by the time

187
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
you come back around and are doing video again,

188
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,920
Linux will be the best of the lot.

189
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,280
I would be amazing because it sure is for audio production.

190
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,640
I tell you what, it really is.

191
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,240
And that's the thing about where I'm at with audio production

192
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,040
is I enjoy it.

193
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,840
I like it.

194
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
I feel good about it on Linux.

195
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,200
I want to do it on Linux.

196
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,880
I don't have to force myself to do the audio production

197
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,560
stuff on Linux.

198
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,400
I want to do it on Linux because it's, in my opinion, the best.

199
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,160
It's just actually a good tool set.

200
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,040
Yes.

201
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,200
And so that's where I would love to see video get to.

202
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,760
And part of what's really helped me switch my workflow over

203
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,720
is also at the same time switching my workflow

204
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,160
on the desktop over to the Plasma desktop.

205
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,400
And so I've been following the desktop's developments

206
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,520
pretty closely.

207
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,920
And there's some new features that

208
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,200
are coming to future versions of Dolphin

209
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,960
that I think are really slick, especially

210
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,640
if you're a Telegram user.

211
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,920
And it's built around this new framework called Purpose.

212
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,040
And it's got its own dedicated blog post.

213
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,440
I'll try to put a link in the show notes

214
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
if you guys want to know more about it.

215
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,440
But the idea is it's an extensible framework

216
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,840
to fulfill the developer's purpose

217
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,920
while providing abstraction.

218
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,800
Yeah, I know.

219
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,560
Right now, they really don't have much going on other

220
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,480
than this new Share menu that's coming to Dolphin.

221
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,520
And if you've been following the weekly usability posts,

222
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,640
there has been some talk about this new Share menu.

223
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,760
When you right click on a file, it

224
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,440
does a lot like you would expect to do, say, on a mobile device.

225
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,920
You can share it to KDE Connect.

226
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,840
You could share it to a Bluetooth device.

227
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,640
And they're collapsing some of the stuff that's

228
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,600
in the menu into this new Share menu.

229
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,680
But you could also do things like Telegram

230
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,800
because the system will detect what applications you

231
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
have installed, or like Nextcloud, another example,

232
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,600
or maybe Imgur or Twitter.

233
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
There's a lot of extensions you could put in there.

234
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,200
And then you can right click on a file.

235
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,240
There'll be a built-in Share menu, built-in Plasma.

236
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,360
Anything that uses that framework can get access to it.

237
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,520
So soon, on your Linux desktop, if you're

238
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,360
using the Plasma desktop, you could right

239
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,320
click on the document, select Telegram,

240
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,880
then choose the contact, just like you

241
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,400
do on your mobile device.

242
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,360
And right now, it's in development.

243
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,200
And they just put up a blog post answering

244
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,800
some of the questions about, like, what

245
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,480
about adding more clutter?

246
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,840
Or what about accidentally sharing a file and all

247
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
of that kind of stuff?

248
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
He has answered all of those questions.

249
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,080
And it's worth calling out, if nothing other than to talk

250
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,560
about the rapid improvement that we're

251
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,040
seeing on the Plasma desktop, even though there's recently

252
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
been some complaints about communication

253
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,440
between developers and the visual design group.

254
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,120
Actual Plasma itself is progressing extremely fast.

255
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,960
And we've really now entered a flip-flop situation

256
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:38,200
where, generally, GNOME is considered the slower, heavier,

257
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,000
more less stable, I'll put it nicely, desktop.

258
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,120
And Plasma has become the fast, lean, efficient desktop

259
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,120
that has all these new things coming to it.

260
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,480
I feel like they've flip-flopped in a bit.

261
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,760
And you really see that the Plasma desktop is moving

262
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,400
forward fast with some of these new features.

263
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,880
The Share menu is great.

264
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,040
And I recommend reading the link in the show notes

265
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,680
if you're curious about the implementation.

266
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,920
It's one of these small things that really, I think,

267
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,880
draws a contrast between Plasma and Gnome Shell.

268
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,800
Files over the years has gotten simpler.

269
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,680
For better or for worse, it's gotten simpler and simpler.

270
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,800
Whereas Dolphin has managed to get simpler by default

271
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,040
but more powerful when you need it.

272
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,440
And that is the balance that I find myself to prefer.

273
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,760
They do seem to sometimes err on the side of features,

274
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,680
but they get back to that usability balance over time.

275
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,480
I love this kind of stuff and this kind of communication.

276
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,360
That's part of it, Wes, like this clear communication

277
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
about this is why the project is doing this,

278
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,200
this is how it's going to work, it's coming down the road,

279
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,040
prepare yourself.

280
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,120
I love that kind of stuff.

281
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
I think that's huge.

282
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,240
And it really seems like Plasma team

283
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,760
has done a lot of slower efforts over the years

284
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,840
that we're now seeing with solid foundations laid

285
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,600
with some clear purpose, if I can say that.

286
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
They can iterate fast, they can change things,

287
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,440
and as long as they communicate clearly,

288
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,520
we're not left in the dark.

289
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,120
So we don't have to speculate, oh,

290
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,840
which feature is going to disappear next?

291
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,520
What horrible thing are they going to add?

292
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,240
They've thought about it.

293
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,600
It's clear that they're thinking about a wide range of users.

294
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,480
So you and I might love all these features.

295
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,520
But as you say, there's tons of ways

296
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,000
to disable it if you're never going to use it.

297
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,720
And it doesn't add a whole bunch of clutter for everyone.

298
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,920
Yeah, it's interesting that they're

299
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,280
including the option to disable it.

300
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,440
Like, oh, you don't ever just want this at all to show up?

301
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,760
All right, you can just turn it off.

302
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,720
Instead of just, no, it's baked in now.

303
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,440
You can just use it.

304
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,440
I do think I have gotten really used to doing that on Android,

305
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,240
you know, just be able to send it right to an app

306
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,200
and have that all work after I've installed it.

307
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,040
So I will be using this in Telegram probably from day one.

308
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Yeah, Telegram, Slack, Imgur too.

309
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,800
I mean, how handy would it be to quick screenshot,

310
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,040
right click, upload to Imgur, although you can actually

311
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
do it within Plasma's screenshot tool.

312
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
But the whole point, right, is that maybe you

313
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,600
started a new image hosting platform.

314
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,880
You're not as popular as Imgur, and this can work for you too.

315
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,840
Yeah, that is very nice.

316
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,560
So let's talk about the AUR for a moment.

317
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,960
We've recently had stories about a crypto miner

318
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,720
that made it into the Snap store.

319
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,520
We also talked about some crypto miners

320
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,320
that made it onto Docker Hub for quite a while.

321
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,080
It was really pretty embarrassing.

322
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,160
And now, almost as if we could just check them off a list,

323
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,360
we now have a story about the Arch Linux AUR repository

324
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,920
containing malware.

325
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,600
Don't panic.

326
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,760
It's already been resolved, and it's already been cleaned up.

327
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
But it is interesting.

328
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,560
It seems to be a trend we see.

329
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,800
Now, the thing about the Arch user repository

330
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,640
is from the very beginning, they warn you

331
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,680
that it is user-submitted software,

332
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,760
that you should double check all of it.

333
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,560
And when you follow the Arch guide,

334
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
like the first time you're getting started with Arch,

335
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,120
they have you build things from the AUR by hand.

336
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,880
So that way, you learn how the package build files work.

337
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,320
You can see what URLs it's calling, things like that.

338
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,760
So in Arch's defense, they do warn the user

339
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,960
as much as possible.

340
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,440
But I'm surprised this almost hasn't happened before.

341
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,240
There's been a full investigation now

342
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,840
that shows that a malicious user with the nickname Xactor

343
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,120
modified, on June 7, an orphan package that

344
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,400
didn't have an active maintainer, something called

345
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,920
AcroRead, hmm, Acrobat, I don't know, never heard of it.

346
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,600
The changes included a curl script

347
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,400
that downloads and runs a script from a remote site.

348
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,920
It then installs persistent software

349
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,840
and configures systemd to start it up from time to time.

350
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,760
I love it when systemd is involved.

351
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Now, there was two packages total that were modified.

352
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,200
They were both modified by the same person.

353
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,920
And the investigation reveals that the executed scripts were

354
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,120
just doing data harvesting about your machine, your machine ID,

355
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,240
the output of uname a, the CPU information, the PacMan

356
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,680
output of information, and the output of systemctl list units.

357
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,160
The harvested information was then

358
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,160
transferred to a pastebin document.

359
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,520
And the AUR team discovered that the scripts contained

360
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,200
a private API key, which shows this was probably

361
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,800
done by an inexperienced hacker, because you can track that down

362
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,200
to somebody.

363
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
But the purpose of gathering that system information

364
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,080
remains unknown.

365
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,880
Just doing like a system scan, you know?

366
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,000
Isn't that funny?

367
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,040
And using systemd, too, to make sure it starts.

368
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,080
I really do kind of wonder what, well, I mean,

369
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,000
systemd is just so reliable, Chris.

370
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,640
That's a natural choice.

371
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,760
It does definitely seem like sort of inexperienced

372
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,640
in that if you wanted to do damage,

373
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,960
you could do a lot more damage.

374
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,840
You could also probably get more sensitive information

375
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,280
if that's also what you wanted.

376
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,040
So it is kind of peculiar.

377
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,040
And you're also right that we all use helpers, or at least

378
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,560
most of us, but to the AUR's credit,

379
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,600
package builds are actually pretty simple.

380
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,720
And so if you do have the time, especially if you don't use

381
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,080
that much AUR software, it's pretty reasonable to go look

382
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,520
at least before installing something.

383
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,640
Just go scan the package build.

384
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,000
It's pretty easy to see, does this

385
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,160
point to the real Git sources?

386
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,360
Does this point to an HTTPS website hosted

387
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,960
by the organization that maintains this project?

388
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,200
That will help a lot.

389
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,920
Yeah, especially for the system you're putting in production.

390
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,360
I think there's a definite room for improvement around GPG key

391
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,560
handling, though.

392
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,960
So I can't remember what the package was,

393
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,560
but sometimes you see these pinned comments

394
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,040
at the top of the AUR that say, oh, just copy paste this key

395
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,040
into your key ring, and it will be fine.

396
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,360
Yeah.

397
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,960
Yeah.

398
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,120
That's a great point, Alex.

399
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,320
There is some room for improvement there, isn't there?

400
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,560
It was caught pretty quickly, it seems, and taken care of,

401
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,520
and a full investigation was done.

402
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,680
So on the other end of this, it's pretty well handled.

403
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,040
What are your thoughts on it, Brent?

404
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Well, I have to say I'm a relatively new AUR user,

405
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,120
so it's amazing.

406
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,720
I call myself relatively new, but there's

407
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,840
a surprising number of packages I'm pulling from there.

408
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,680
But I was taught very early on in the process

409
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,480
from some forums and things like that,

410
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,960
that actually you should really look at the package builds.

411
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,560
And they're super simple, I've been looking at them.

412
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,280
And I did catch actually something

413
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,960
last week that was a little bit curious to me,

414
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,240
and so it just allows you to do a little bit of extra homework.

415
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,520
And in this case, it was my lack of maybe technical knowledge,

416
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,320
and it allowed me to learn a little bit more

417
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,040
about how it all worked.

418
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,840
But I really think that's essential for everyone

419
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,400
to be extra cautious, let's put it.

420
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,960
Yeah, really, the rule of thumb is

421
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,760
if it's user-submitted software, well, really, hell.

422
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,560
I mean, even the stuff that's, quote unquote,

423
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,480
curated by Fortune 500 companies or whatever they are,

424
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,200
it still has crap in it, so it's tricky.

425
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,120
But definitely more caution is needed

426
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,400
when it's a user-curated or user-submitted, quote unquote,

427
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,200
app store.

428
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,520
Yeah, it's a good reminder.

429
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,120
Yeah.

430
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,680
All right, let's do a couple of Firefox fast takes,

431
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,600
just a couple of little things to know about.

432
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,520
Firefox for Android is entering a maintenance phase

433
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,800
as the team is preparing to completely replace it.

434
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,600
So if you're a user of Firefox and Android,

435
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,840
which I have been for a little bit,

436
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,240
it's entered a maintenance phase,

437
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,480
meaning that they're not going to give

438
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,240
any updates for the foreseeable future except for major bug

439
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
fixes and security updates will still come down.

440
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,680
That's according to Emily Kager, the mobile engineer at Mozilla.

441
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,280
It sounds like Mozilla is working

442
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,280
on an entirely new browser based on open source

443
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,360
components in Android.

444
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,720
And Android components, quote, is the actual name of it,

445
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,880
is a collection of Android libraries

446
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,200
that can be used to build browsers or browser-like

447
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,240
applications.

448
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,120
Something tells me they're probably not going

449
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,680
to be using Gecko, though, they'll probably

450
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,320
be using the Chromium backend stuff in WebKit.

451
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,800
What do you think, Wes?

452
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Is that a bit of a loss to have another?

453
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,680
I mean, this has kind of been the way

454
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,600
it's been going for Firefox and mobile for a long time,

455
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,040
though, so I suppose not.

456
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,840
I suppose it's not really much of a loss.

457
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,800
I mean, in a historical sense, it might be.

458
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,680
I get that.

459
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,840
I mean, Gecko's been rendering my things

460
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,640
for so long now on a number of platforms.

461
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,720
But it does seem like this is also maybe a sign of them

462
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,400
taking Android as more of a primary platform.

463
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,880
I think so many people use Chrome or other browsers there.

464
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,480
I, too, have been using Firefox and Android,

465
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,420
and honestly, I really like it.

466
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,680
It's one of my favorite mobile browsers,

467
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,280
and if they can make something even better,

468
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,000
even more tightly integrated and focused on that platform,

469
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,080
I'm excited to see it.

470
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,240
Yeah, you know, I started using it

471
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,000
to sync bookmarks and passwords, but for iOS users,

472
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,680
there seems to be another solution.

473
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,200
And I think they just launched this.

474
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,080
You found this, Wes.

475
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,840
It's the Firefox Lockbox.

476
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,760
And this is the password management component

477
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,760
of Firefox broken out as a standalone mobile application.

478
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,360
The idea, I would assume, the use case idea

479
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,760
is you have all of your websites and passwords saved

480
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,360
on Firefox on your desktop.

481
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,080
And then you go to your mobile device,

482
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,960
and you don't have access to any of them.

483
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,880
So Lockbox gives you access to those passwords.

484
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,240
It uses their back-end sync.

485
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,680
It's 256-bit encrypted, it says.

486
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,740
And you sync down your usernames and passwords

487
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,480
using this Lockbox app.

488
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,800
And I was talking with Wes about this,

489
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,120
and I was like, Wes, what do you think the use case is

490
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,320
for this, which is when you point out for people

491
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,920
using it on their desktop.

492
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,600
And I remembered that Noah used to do this.

493
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,160
I don't know if you recall, but he used to use Firefox

494
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,920
as his primary password manager for a long time.

495
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,620
Yeah, he was looking at us kind of funny.

496
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,840
He was like, what are you guys doing?

497
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,200
My browser has all my passwords.

498
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,760
It's already right there.

499
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,980
I think he was sort of eventually had

500
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,080
to replace it with a Homeworld solution,

501
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,960
just in part because mobile.

502
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,120
So Lockbox is only for iOS today,

503
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,640
and they just launched it today.

504
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,880
They may be rolling out an Android version soon.

505
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,340
But it's kind of interesting to see where all this is going.

506
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,560
And then one last Firefox fact for you.

507
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,920
A little fast take here.

508
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,360
There is a big update for you Ubuntu users running Firefox.

509
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,120
Firefox 61 is now available today,

510
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,100
as we're recording, in the repo.

511
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,800
Now, that's a nice update.

512
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,440
And it's even available for you LTS users, I believe.

513
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,480
So go out there and get your upgraded Firefox.

514
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,480
So you'll get Firefox 61, which includes several new features.

515
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,440
And it's nice to see that the LTS is

516
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,820
getting the latest versions.

517
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,320
It is actually really nice, because the latest versions

518
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,160
are great.

519
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,660
Now, if you do want to stay a little more up to date,

520
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,000
I will say just downloading the tarball of Firefox

521
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,460
and sticking it somewhere in your home

522
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,480
here and adding that to your path also works very nicely.

523
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,960
Yeah, that is a good way to do it, isn't it?

524
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,840
Yeah, that's what I do on most of my platforms.

525
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,240
And no failures yet.

526
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,760
I kind of stopped getting all worried about the version

527
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,800
after Quantum shipped.

528
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,260
Then I kind of was like, OK, well,

529
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,080
I got the major version once I got to 60.

530
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,040
But it'd be nice to get to 61.

531
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,160
It's good to see.

532
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,960
All right, well, if that's the Firefox fast takes,

533
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,080
is what I was calling them.

534
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,600
You like that?

535
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,480
Fast takes, Firefox fast takes.

536
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
It's so fast now, right?

537
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,680
Quantum fast.

538
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah, exactly.

539
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You got it.

540
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,120
Let's do the Ubuntu corner.

541
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,520
Speaking of Ubuntu, they launched this week

542
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,720
the minimal Ubuntu, which is not the same thing

543
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,560
as the minimal install or the server install.

544
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,680
It's minimal Ubuntu.

545
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,640
I don't understand why you're confused on what

546
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,040
the problem is.

547
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,440
But the idea is pretty slick.

548
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,020
It's a small footprint of Ubuntu that's

549
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,480
meant for fast virtual machine provisioning.

550
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,880
So imagine an AWS infrastructure that

551
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,120
has to spin up 1,000 instances at once.

552
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,640
You think I'm exaggerating.

553
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,120
I'm not.

554
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,220
They really, really care about the spin up time.

555
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,000
I heard this from an AWS engineer directly.

556
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,520
They are constantly pushing back on Canonical and Red Hat

557
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,400
to shave down the boot time.

558
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,680
Because you multiply that by 1,000 in some cases.

559
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,840
And so if you can shave down the boot time

560
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,680
and shave down the image size, it really matters.

561
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,840
It might not matter for us on our laptops,

562
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,800
but it really matters for really large cloud deployments.

563
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,360
And that's exactly what these are for.

564
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,600
This is really Ubuntu designed to be

565
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,120
deployed by machines, not humans.

566
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,880
So think of it in that context.

567
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,600
Yeah, exactly.

568
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,280
I'm really excited for this.

569
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,800
Just because for many cases, Ubuntu server is great,

570
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,380
but it's still kind of stuck in the era of bare metal servers.

571
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,220
I remember the argument when system B came out

572
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,680
and everyone was like, well, why do we

573
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,080
need servers to start fast?

574
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,240
You start it once and you reboot it, maybe never.

575
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,560
But in the days of clouds and functions

576
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,900
as a service and all the different sorts of containerized

577
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,940
options we have today, you're starting stopping

578
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,400
immutable deployments.

579
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,160
Everything moves very quickly.

580
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,480
And if you can get this down in an image everywhere,

581
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,520
it really scales.

582
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,400
Plus, I don't know about you, but when I'm making images

583
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,960
for other people to use, I want to customize that.

584
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,600
And I want to start with as lean a base as possible.

585
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,120
I don't have to go in and remove or disable services

586
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,280
that I don't need or no one knows what they do.

587
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,600
This just starts as a super lean core,

588
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,800
add on everything you want, do some customization,

589
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,080
make a new AMI, and you're good to go.

590
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,680
Yeah, especially in the context of quote, unquote,

591
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,720
serverless computing.

592
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,520
Serverless computing, it just means

593
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,400
they're taking care of the server.

594
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,180
They're standing up an entire Linux instance

595
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,260
and then tearing it down once the processing's done.

596
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,340
They need that to be fast.

597
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,760
But Brent, you're pointing out there's

598
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,120
other aspects besides the speed of the boot

599
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,600
when you minimize like this.

600
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,680
There's other advantages.

601
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,920
Yeah, I had, I guess, kind of a little bit of a question.

602
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,240
There's a section there that says minimal security

603
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,960
cross-section comes with this minimal Ubuntu.

604
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,920
And I just wondered if anybody from the community

605
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,960
or maybe Wes has any thoughts on that.

606
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,440
Yeah, well, less attack surface means

607
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,960
it's by default less likely to get exploited.

608
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,340
Now, it's still something you attach to the network, right?

609
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,240
It's still running a full Linux stack.

610
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,080
I mean, it is Ubuntu.

611
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,120
You can install any package you want on it.

612
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,640
I think that's it right there.

613
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,800
It's not some magic layer of security.

614
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,980
It's just that when you install the default Ubuntu server,

615
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,120
there are a lot of things which are super handy

616
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,480
and make it really easy for users

617
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,120
to get started with that are just enabled by default, right?

618
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,040
So the Snap service is running.

619
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,320
LXD might be running.

620
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,720
But if you don't use those things, you don't need it.

621
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,680
And unfortunately, not everyone, even some sysadmins,

622
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,760
know enough to go how to go prune that,

623
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,300
how to disable the services, how to check for those things.

624
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,160
So if you can just start from a really clean minimal base,

625
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,200
it's better for everyone.

626
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,800
There's some real numbers here, too.

627
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,480
They say that the images are less than 50%

628
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,360
of the size of a standard Ubuntu server image.

629
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,160
And they boot up to 40% faster than standard Ubuntu.

630
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,800
But that doesn't mean they're necessarily the fastest.

631
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,040
Does it, 10-bit?

632
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,680
No, I was checking for Onyx.

633
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,400
And Michael did some tests.

634
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,160
And Clear Linux was the big winner.

635
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,640
Minimal Ubuntu is definitely better.

636
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,200
But Clear Linux was still four times.

637
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,800
That's a great point.

638
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,840
There's still other.

639
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,640
Many people are still going to run Docker containers

640
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,440
with Alpine.

641
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,560
Or if you have particular needs, there are a lot.

642
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,040
What I think Ubuntu makes a special impact here

643
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,240
is that you still get all of the comfort of using Ubuntu

644
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,680
like you do on any other platform.

645
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,720
All the things are there.

646
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,680
You can still install devs that you need to.

647
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,600
It'll just work.

648
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,880
Whatever happened to unikennels?

649
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,680
Do you remember them?

650
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,880
Yeah, that's a good question.

651
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,840
I haven't heard as.

652
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,120
I mean, they're interesting.

653
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,520
I haven't heard very much.

654
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,760
There's been less buzz these past two years.

655
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,040
I don't know if that's just because serverless and Lambda,

656
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,680
et cetera, have taken over that space.

657
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,200
Or maybe it's just incubating in the background.

658
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,560
Now, Badger, weren't you thinking

659
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,920
that maybe Atomic from Fedora makes this a bit less relevant?

660
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,200
Yeah, I think so startup time is one thing.

661
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,280
And I guess I hadn't really thought about the scale

662
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,200
Amazon run at.

663
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,440
I go around to a lot of different customer sites.

664
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,560
And I see people with 400, 500 EC2 instances in just

665
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,000
their test environment alone.

666
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,240
It's pretty crazy.

667
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,600
And you multiply that across all the different companies

668
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,320
across the world.

669
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,080
The scale that Amazon are running at is mind boggling.

670
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,760
But then for me, I think if you look at an Atomic OS

671
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,440
has a read-only file system.

672
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,440
And so there's a lot less tinkering

673
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,520
needs to actually occur.

674
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,600
So you can almost basically boot from a known state.

675
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,520
And it's kind of like how Apple deal with hardware.

676
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,480
So they know exactly what's under the hood.

677
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
So they don't have to do a whole bunch of checks

678
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,240
like a PC BIOS would or something.

679
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,120
So it's that similar sort of principle.

680
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,400
Yeah, yeah, just if you don't have

681
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,320
to worry about the drive changing at all,

682
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,760
you could launch as fast as you can

683
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,720
initialize the hardware support you can launch.

684
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,520
That's right, yeah.

685
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,280
Yeah, that is a good point.

686
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,400
I feel like the broader context for this, too, is containers.

687
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,440
Because this isn't just for spinning up VMs.

688
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,440
It's also for spinning up an Ubuntu inside it

689
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,720
a container so you can start with something minimal

690
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,720
and build your container environment around it, I think.

691
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,120
There's other solutions for that,

692
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,120
but I feel like this would be a pretty good one.

693
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,200
And because it's just an app getaway,

694
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,880
you can get anything else loaded in there that you need,

695
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,240
which is really convenient.

696
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,040
Yeah, I think you hit it on the head right there, right?

697
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,760
Like that you don't, it may not be the best

698
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,480
if you have particular needs, then maybe look elsewhere.

699
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,160
But if you were just already using Ubuntu,

700
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,000
it got a little bit better today.

701
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,200
Yeah.

702
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,640
Now they just got to work on the branding

703
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,560
because there's too many minimals at this point.

704
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,400
And you know, it's tough when you have an OS that

705
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,640
runs on IoT devices, it runs on cloud devices,

706
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,520
it runs on laptops and desktops, and now apparently

707
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,080
on floating AIs that will go up into space.

708
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,520
Ubuntu is also running on an astronaut AI.

709
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,160
It's called Simon, C-I-M-O-N, and Joey has a great write up

710
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,360
over at OMG Ubuntu all about it.

711
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,040
And it's one of six experiments.

712
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,280
It was recently launched to the International Space Station

713
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,720
as part of the ESA's International Space Station

714
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,640
program, the Horizon Mission.

715
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,400
It's not science fiction though.

716
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,920
It is an autonomous AI powered assistant

717
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,000
that can see, hear, and understand and speak

718
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,240
with the astronauts.

719
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,760
And it's got a touch screen on it.

720
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,200
When you minimize the Simon application,

721
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,600
there is an Ubuntu desktop.

722
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,280
It's just like right there.

723
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,880
And you can open up files and browse the file system

724
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,520
on this floating robot.

725
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,880
And it's really cool.

726
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,600
It's about the size of a beach ball with one side of it

727
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,840
flat that has an LCD screen and a somewhat freaky face,

728
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,080
I'll be honest.

729
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,800
And I just love the concept of this.

730
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,600
There's so many things they can use it for.

731
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,680
As we go out deep into space, it's

732
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,000
much easier to send robots than it is humans.

733
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,580
But the other thing you have to consider

734
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,320
is this isn't something that's going

735
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,640
to turn on your smart lights.

736
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,160
This can be very, very purpose built

737
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,120
to know very, very deep knowledge

738
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,920
about the particular experiments they're working on.

739
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,000
It's not going to answer when Walmart down the road opens up.

740
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,200
It's not going to know that.

741
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
But if you need to know the molecular structure

742
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,080
of this rock, it's going to know that in and out

743
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,840
and be able to display that on the screen.

744
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,880
If you think about how useful having a smart home with data

745
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,800
about your house or about your car is,

746
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,200
you take that to the next level here, wow.

747
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,640
You're right about the face, though.

748
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,840
The face is creepy.

749
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,000
And I'm just imagining a Hal-style moment there.

750
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,760
And the face, you know, the smile turns into a frown.

751
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,520
And oh, Podbe Dois, whoops.

752
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,240
Yeah.

753
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,480
Yeah, uh-oh, yeah, it gets angry all of a sudden.

754
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,560
All right, well, here is one of the scientists

755
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,240
who's been working on it, explaining how

756
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,760
this works better than I can.

757
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,120
My name is Till Eisenberg.

758
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,760
I'm from Friedrichshafen, the project manager

759
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,880
of the project Simon.

760
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,600
Simon weighs about five kilograms

761
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,520
and has a diameter of 32 centimeters.

762
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,080
He has a velocity of about one meter per second,

763
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,840
which is rather slow.

764
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,480
But it's quite comparable with the normal movement

765
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,560
of a crew member.

766
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,840
He's equipped with a display of eight inches, which

767
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,440
was chosen because this gives the ability

768
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,800
to display a complete face.

769
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,440
Simon stands for Crew Interactive Mobile Companion.

770
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,160
And it's meant to be a social interactive free-flying object

771
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,920
who shall assist the crew during extensive tasks

772
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,040
and to reduce stress.

773
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,760
Simon will assist Alexander Guest during his next mission.

774
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,960
He will assist him during two different tasks.

775
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,720
So we will be able to provide him

776
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,800
with the good advices during complex procedures,

777
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,520
as well as assist him in social interaction

778
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,960
or by social interaction, and will provide additional data

779
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,560
to the science group, like video data,

780
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,280
or during complex tasks to validate the exact process.

781
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,000
They go on, too, to talk about how

782
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,480
if they're working somewhere where

783
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,600
they have decent connectivity, they're

784
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,200
going to still use offloaded cloud processing to help

785
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,880
with Simon's intelligence.

786
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,640
And when they're somewhere where they don't have connectivity,

787
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,680
which I guess there is connectivity in parts of space,

788
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,520
but when they're somewhere where they don't have connectivity,

789
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,160
it can work offline.

790
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,920
The majority, though, right now, of the AI work

791
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,680
is taking place on IBM's Watson Cloud Service.

792
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,720
And the language comprehension is being done by that,

793
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,960
although they're working on some local language processing,

794
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,240
but they don't talk about what technology

795
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,560
they're using for that.

796
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,600
And they say the earthly link may

797
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,600
seem antiquated by comparison, but it has its upsides.

798
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,520
He can download new software, and they can improve things

799
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,720
in batch processing.

800
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,960
So he can come up with solutions like offload it to the cloud.

801
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,360
It'll chew on it, and then they'll

802
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,480
send it back to him, depending on the bandwidth.

803
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,800
And then he can give the results to the astronauts

804
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
working at the station.

805
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,400
I know this is early days, but I will be very curious to see,

806
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
after six months or a year, or however

807
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,280
long this project runs, how useful is it?

808
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,800
Do they get real benefits?

809
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,560
Because if so, I assume this will

810
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,600
be the first of a long line of AI assistants in space.

811
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,120
Yeah, the first AI assistant in space is pretty, pretty neat.

812
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,560
Let's bring it down to Earth, though,

813
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,200
and talk a moment about the Gnome desktop.

814
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,800
A lot of love these days from us for plasma.

815
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,640
But things over in the Gnome camp

816
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,920
are slowly but surely getting better.

817
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,560
A lad on Twitter tweeted that we could look forward

818
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,280
to some serious performance improvements

819
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,360
and included a picture of a slide

820
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,840
from Gwadek, which just wrapped up the Gnome conference.

821
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,680
And there was a lot of talk about improving

822
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,500
the performance in Gnome.

823
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,240
And in the slide, too, I noticed they specifically

824
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,600
call out those jerks at Canonical

825
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,360
for all the good work they're doing to actually help

826
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,140
get really deep into the performance issue and solve it.

827
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,360
So it looks like the kumbaya of Canonical and Gnome

828
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,520
continues because they give them a particular call out

829
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,160
of thanks in this slide.

830
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,840
And it seems that we may see even more performance

831
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,140
improvement announcements soon coming from the Gnome project

832
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,480
because they're touting them at Gwadek this year, which

833
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,120
I am very happy to see.

834
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,880
So don't become a plasma user just yet, Wes.

835
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,680
Yeah, I know, right?

836
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,800
I think this is also just another good case of a bunch

837
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,000
who is used in so many ways.

838
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,720
And I think it's pretty easy.

839
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,240
The way I use Gnome, I don't care as much

840
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,800
about the performance for 90% of them

841
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,000
because I have a web browser, and I have a terminal,

842
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,160
and maybe I'm developing something,

843
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,880
and the rest doesn't matter too much.

844
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,320
But let's say you're a video editing professional using

845
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,840
Ubuntu on your powerful workstation.

846
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,480
Suddenly, that matters a lot.

847
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,000
So I think the focus of end user deliverables

848
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,640
that Ubuntu can bring is just going

849
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,200
to keep these improvements coming.

850
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,080
Well, I look forward to it.

851
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,840
And it's a whole group effort now.

852
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,200
There's so many major distributions

853
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,240
that are shipping Gnome that hopefully we

854
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,280
will start to see some.

855
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,620
That's what we've all been hoping,

856
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,160
is that when everybody kind of focuses on it, not everybody,

857
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,400
but when so many desktops focus on it,

858
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,960
maybe we'll get real results.

859
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,560
That might be what we're seeing now.

860
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,100
And it's a whole group effort, but it's

861
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,600
really great to see Canonical sticking with it.

862
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,840
Now, I got to tell you, we had a story

863
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
that I decided not to include, but now I kind of

864
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,680
wish we did because it was about setting up

865
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,960
enterprise-grade Wi-Fi.

866
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,040
Holy smokes.

867
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,720
Holy smokes.

868
00:33:52,720 --> 00:34:00,120
If anybody out there has solutions for like home,

869
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,000
what am I looking for here?

870
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,640
Not like a DDWRT solution, but what

871
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,520
is the latest in Linux solutions for Wi-Fi?

872
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,140
This isn't a question for the audience.

873
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,760
What is the latest in firmware replacement on a router device

874
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,960
or even better, ones you build with like a PC or something?

875
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,520
I'd love to know.

876
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,560
I've been living in Wi-Fi hell for about three days.

877
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,160
Things are looking better now.

878
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,080
I was so worried today because I'm down here at Linux Academy.

879
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,960
And today was the first of several, I think,

880
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,040
five live streams they're doing to announce

881
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,320
all this new content that they're launching in July.

882
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,360
And I got here on Saturday, had a nice chill morning,

883
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,560
got in here around 9 AM Sunday morning,

884
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,600
started setting up for Linux Action News.

885
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,040
And I pretty quickly discovered that I was dropping packets.

886
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,800
And it was really hard for Joe to even understand

887
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,840
a word I was saying.

888
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,600
I mean, harder than normal, right?

889
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,920
Not just because you're mispronouncing things.

890
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,200
Yes, exactly.

891
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,480
I didn't know what it was.

892
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,720
Was it Wi-Fi?

893
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,000
Was it something on the network?

894
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,720
You know, on a Sunday, 9 AM, 10 AM, I'm the only one here.

895
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,800
So it's not like it's somebody torrenting stuff.

896
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,760
Nobody's here.

897
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,400
Most of the machines aren't even here.

898
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,920
Most of them are laptops.

899
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,440
So I started going through all of these old school

900
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,480
troubleshooting processes that I used to go through.

901
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,440
Can I ping the router?

902
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,960
Am I dropping packets here?

903
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,200
Am I dropping packets when I go here?

904
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,240
Can I do all these trace paths and all that kind of stuff?

905
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,760
Started running around with a dongle and a spool of ethernet,

906
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,560
trying different jacks to see if anything was live.

907
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,520
But the folks here at Linux Academy, about a year ago,

908
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,280
refurbed the building a bit.

909
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,320
And at that time, they deployed what's called, like,

910
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,200
a common generic term, enterprise-grade Wi-Fi,

911
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,320
as if there's some committee that reviews and measures Wi-Fi

912
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
to determine if it's enterprise-grade or not,

913
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,840
stamps it, like the USDA-grade beef.

914
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,600
I assume it's one of those things where that's

915
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,560
what the vendor says, and you pay enough for it

916
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,960
that that's the title you get.

917
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,640
Yeah.

918
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,360
I think that's exactly what it is.

919
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,240
Everybody you pay said it's enterprise-grade,

920
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,640
so therefore it is enterprise-grade.

921
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,920
I mean, that's what you tell the boss, right?

922
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,760
And they're like, oh, yeah, good work, IT.

923
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,280
Yeah, and that is true.

924
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,600
I tell you, that is so true.

925
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,440
And I'm sitting here going, well, Wi-Fi is still Wi-Fi,

926
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,880
and I'm doing VoIP.

927
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,720
And any kind of disruption really

928
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,280
messes with the VoIP call.

929
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,560
And so we did a bunch of troubleshooting.

930
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,680
Stefan, their network engineer, he helped me out, too.

931
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,640
At least I assume he's their network engineer,

932
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,340
because the man really knows his stuff.

933
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,900
And we actually still haven't tracked it down.

934
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,880
I don't know exactly what it is, and of course,

935
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,620
I'm the only jerk that's having an issue,

936
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,200
because I'm the only jerk trying to do

937
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,000
a live, high-quality, high-bitrate VoIP call.

938
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,800
Everybody else is browsing the web, doing email,

939
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,720
and they're all on Wi-Fi, because they're just

940
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,560
on laptops.

941
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,280
And most laptops that they buy now

942
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,560
don't even have ethernet ports.

943
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,620
So everybody's on Wi-Fi.

944
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,960
The Wi-Fi network's just got all of these machines on it.

945
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,540
So I'm like, no, I want to go ethernet.

946
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,560
Did you see the post on Ars Technica over the weekend

947
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,360
about Wi-Fi?

948
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,300
Is that what you're talking about?

949
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,520
Yes, yes, that's the one.

950
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,480
I thought it was a great read.

951
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,000
It's like six pages long and doesn't

952
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,360
have a huge amount of detail.

953
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,520
Well, it has some detail, but yeah, I've

954
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,400
used ubiquity gear at home for the last two or three years,

955
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,720
and it's been genuinely pretty flawless.

956
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,400
You just set it and forget it, which is exactly what you want

957
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,520
from Wi-Fi.

958
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,400
And they have PS Sense on the front end.

959
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,280
That's great.

960
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,880
See, I think that's what they have here, but not the PS

961
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,640
Sense on the monitor at all.

962
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,800
But Stephanie's coming out.

963
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,560
He's going to bring a spool.

964
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,000
We're going to wire me in a jack,

965
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,280
because there's no jacks that are hot,

966
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,560
because everything's on enterprise ethernet,

967
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,120
or Wi-Fi ethernet.

968
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,320
You still can't beat a cable, can you?

969
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,280
No, no.

970
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,460
But ironically, the solution was, really,

971
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,720
the only solution was I had to get outside the network.

972
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,840
It's a particular challenge, too,

973
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,260
because normally when I come down,

974
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,280
when I go places to do the shows, I always take the RV.

975
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,840
And I've done it so many times, and it's kind of expensive.

976
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,760
So I was starting to really question

977
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,600
the practicalness of that.

978
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,160
Really, do I need to take an RV, a 40-foot-long RV,

979
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,360
every time I go somewhere?

980
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,160
That is too much.

981
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,200
It is way more efficient to fly down there and just

982
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,080
do the shows from one of the recording booths for a week,

983
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,200
or more, maybe.

984
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,880
Potentially, actually, two weeks.

985
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,840
So whatever I could fit in my backpack

986
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,040
is what I brought with me.

987
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
And then everything else got ordered from Amazon

988
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,920
by Linux Academy.

989
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,520
And all of the gear that Wes and I use and Noah

990
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,880
use in our mobile setups, they pre-bought and had it

991
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,640
here for me.

992
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
I get everything all hooked up, got all my gear,

993
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,520
same exact software setup, same software

994
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,840
I used on the last trip with my XPS 13.

995
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,600
Really, I thought I had it all dialed in,

996
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,020
and I started having these issues.

997
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,520
And I start thinking, you know, if I was in the RV,

998
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,480
I would have three cellular networks.

999
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,040
I would have three laptops I could switch between.

1000
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,760
I have Wi-Fi I could connect to.

1001
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,960
And plus, I have a booster on the top of my RV

1002
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,760
that can pick up Wi-Fi signals from two miles away.

1003
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,120
It's insane.

1004
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,080
It has this little tiny device that

1005
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,640
is just this incredible booster.

1006
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,020
So there's a lot of flexibility.

1007
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,240
Plus, I can move, and I can just go somewhere else

1008
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,440
that has better connectivity.

1009
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,840
That has saved your butts a number of times.

1010
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,520
Yeah, and so this trip, I'm like, oh, boy.

1011
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
So what can I do?

1012
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,880
Because I don't have the RV.

1013
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,600
I don't have any other equipment with me.

1014
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,180
And I need to get outside the network.

1015
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,200
So I went and I got a MiFi.

1016
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,120
I went and got a MiFi.

1017
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,840
I might return it within 14 days.

1018
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,480
But you know, it's another device

1019
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,880
with another payment and all that kind of stuff.

1020
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,880
But it was what you have to do to do the show.

1021
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,920
And so now, it seems to be holding up mostly.

1022
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,600
Do you guys not have tethering over there?

1023
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,400
Because over here, I just switched my phone

1024
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,080
into a hotspot, and off I go.

1025
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,240
Yeah, the issue is the room I'm in,

1026
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,160
which is in the center of a very large building,

1027
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,560
and then it's a thick wall with sound insulation.

1028
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,880
And so the only thing that gets signal in here is Verizon.

1029
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,440
So I had to get a Verizon MiFi.

1030
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,640
Otherwise, I would just use my, that's what I've done before,

1031
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,120
is I just turn on tethering on my Nexus.

1032
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,320
But that's the way it goes sometimes.

1033
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,720
Maybe can we buy like a second one of those boosters

1034
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,480
and just sort of strap it to your back.

1035
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,440
You can walk around with that at all times.

1036
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,080
Dude, a podcasting backpack.

1037
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,840
Yeah, right?

1038
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,480
Right?

1039
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,080
Yeah, and just put like a Linux box in there.

1040
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,600
So that way, we can say it runs Linux.

1041
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,920
Yeah, a little nook sitting at the bottom.

1042
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,840
It'll be perfect.

1043
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,760
Then you're going to look like the guys in Silicon Valley

1044
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,760
walking around the convention and trying to hack everyone.

1045
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,720
Oh, yeah.

1046
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,960
Oh, I already do.

1047
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,320
I have been out on the street, and it's

1048
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,280
like if I'm with a couple of people,

1049
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,560
this has happened a few times.

1050
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,680
I think it's even happened when I've been around you, Wes.

1051
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,280
People will stop and go, hey, what are you guys doing?

1052
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,760
What's going on?

1053
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,280
Is there a computer convention?

1054
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
Is there some sort of computer convention in town?

1055
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,160
Yeah, exactly.

1056
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,840
But you just get enough of us in one room,

1057
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,560
and I guess it is a computer convention.

1058
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,160
I guess we just look it.

1059
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,520
So yeah, it's been a bit of an interesting problem.

1060
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,720
But man, if the guys here haven't been awesome to work

1061
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,360
with trying to track it down and troubleshooting stuff

1062
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,840
and turning off all the packet inspection

1063
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,560
to make sure if that's not it and that kind of thing.

1064
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,080
So the live stream went pretty well.

1065
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,200
It didn't disrupt the live stream much.

1066
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,160
There's a couple of dropouts because of it,

1067
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,960
but it was a little more tolerant.

1068
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,720
So that was nice.

1069
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,040
And the big launch, we had lots of people

1070
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,520
show up and watch the live stream, so that was cool.

1071
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,520
You can probably find it on Linux Academy's YouTube channel

1072
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,480
if you want to check it out.

1073
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,040
We had a fun little bit in the beginning,

1074
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,600
and I was there for the whole stream, so that was fun too.

1075
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,240
And now I'm just kind of hanging out here

1076
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,080
for a couple of days.

1077
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,920
They have one more on Thursday.

1078
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,720
I haven't booked a return flight,

1079
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,560
so I'm thinking about hanging out until the weekend

1080
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,400
and then being here for the Thursday stream too.

1081
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Oh yeah, you should, just a little week in Texas, why not?

1082
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,240
It's nice.

1083
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,920
Plus it's like, I just have this total nightmare vision

1084
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,160
of me flying out of town,

1085
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,480
and then that's when something goes wrong with the Linux box

1086
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,240
or the OBS machine.

1087
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,280
Something's gonna happen

1088
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,960
because I just got them all switched over.

1089
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,320
You need to protect the reputation of Linux, Chris.

1090
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,640
If there's one point to your entire existence, this is it.

1091
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,280
Well, the thing too is the guy that's in charge here

1092
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,920
of the live stream, he's a photographer

1093
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,120
and a videographer and a good one too,

1094
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,680
but he's never used OBS before.

1095
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,400
So it's been of a training process and all of that.

1096
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,720
So I may be here till at least then,

1097
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,120
but pretty happy the first one went through pretty well.

1098
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,520
And if we track down this network issue,

1099
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,440
I think the next one will be really smooth.

1100
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,160
And it's a process.

1101
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,880
It reminds me when you're the one person

1102
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,520
having issues with the network,

1103
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,480
it is what you were asking for is a leap of faith

1104
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,600
by the people that you were asking for their time

1105
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,440
to troubleshoot it.

1106
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,480
Like I felt constantly like I had to continue to prove

1107
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,160
that really I know what I'm doing,

1108
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,240
there really is an issue here.

1109
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,080
Do you know what I mean?

1110
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,000
Like when it comes to the network.

1111
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,560
It's up to you to prove that it's not just your problem,

1112
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,960
that it's actually a systemic network wide problem.

1113
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,440
And of course, because network engineers

1114
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,800
are bothered all the time, right?

1115
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,120
Everyone loves to blame the network.

1116
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,680
So of course, that's a natural defensive position.

1117
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,200
Plus from what it sounds like,

1118
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,120
if you're just browsing the web

1119
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,360
or doing various office related tasks,

1120
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,040
that is so different than any sort of real time

1121
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,400
video streaming protocol.

1122
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,240
So it's just a different use case too.

1123
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,080
Yeah, so true.

1124
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:19,040
And it's like way more intolerant of outages and breakups

1125
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,480
where like a web browsing session or Slack chat

1126
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,840
won't even notice a, I'll give you an example.

1127
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,200
So it's not that bad.

1128
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,200
I would say, so I'll ping Google DNS, say 800 times.

1129
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,480
And in that 800 times, I may drop 0.5% of the packets.

1130
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,400
You know, it's really small.

1131
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,880
It's like a very small amount.

1132
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,880
But what it equates to is about every minute or so,

1133
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,160
maybe every 30 seconds or so,

1134
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,560
there is about a second or so of my speech

1135
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,800
that's completely lost.

1136
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,080
And you have no idea what I'm saying.

1137
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,680
We just had to kind of grind through land

1138
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,200
and code a radio the last couple of days.

1139
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,280
So I knew it had to get fixed.

1140
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,000
But tracking that down has sent me like down

1141
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
the old Google's searching for like tools on Linux

1142
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,840
to like send bandwidth checks and like try to figure out

1143
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,720
where I might have a lot of latency

1144
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,600
or try to figure out where something's dropping packets.

1145
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,720
Like it's kind of been a fun adventure again.

1146
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,760
And getting to talk to lingo to the network guy,

1147
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
talking to him about drop packets

1148
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,520
and going to the patch panel,

1149
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,080
seeing if I can't patch in my ethernet to the switch.

1150
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,160
You're back on the front lines.

1151
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,560
The whole lingo has been fun.

1152
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,760
All right, let's keep going though.

1153
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,840
A lot of you, at some point,

1154
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,200
have tried to get something working with wine.

1155
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,120
And maybe you were successful, maybe you weren't.

1156
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,840
But the 4th of July marked wine's 25th frigging birthday.

1157
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,320
25 years since the first stable, not a Windows emulator.

1158
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,440
The first year brought the all-important support

1159
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,160
for Microsoft Solitaire.

1160
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,960
And by 1996, the wine developers managed to get Word

1161
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,440
and Excel to run.

1162
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,200
It, however, would be another 12 years

1163
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,040
before the software was declared stable.

1164
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,360
Version 1.0 was released in 2008.

1165
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,040
And in the intervening years, the wine team bounced around

1166
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,800
to several different licensing models for code,

1167
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,720
starting with BSD style,

1168
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,440
before eventually landing on a limited GPL,

1169
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
followed by a number of flame wars

1170
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,120
that lasted for a long time,

1171
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,160
which you can still find archives of.

1172
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,200
As wine slogged its way towards its first stable release,

1173
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,920
a brief period of commercial support from Corel propped up

1174
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,400
for a bit that eventually faded away

1175
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,360
when the Canadian company departed from it all in 2001

1176
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,440
to focus on its slow decline.

1177
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,040
Windows came around,

1178
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,520
which promised to offer easy Windows applications

1179
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,600
while switching over to Linux.

1180
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,040
Microsoft noticed that the name was close to Windows,

1181
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,600
took issue with that,

1182
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,280
and started the process of suing them.

1183
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,440
They went to court in 2002.

1184
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,160
Lindos lost.

1185
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,640
But Microsoft did something interesting.

1186
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,880
They opted for a retrial

1187
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,600
and ended up paying Lindos $20 million

1188
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,320
to purchase the trademark.

1189
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,120
And then Lindos was renamed to Linspire,

1190
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,800
which has actually just recently come back to life

1191
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,760
when it launched under new ownership earlier this year.

1192
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,120
I did a review of their release, one release ago.

1193
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,920
You may remember Transgaming got in the mix for a while.

1194
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,960
And Transgaming did something interesting.

1195
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,240
They really got a fork of wine that focused on DirectX.

1196
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,520
And that ended up kind of really pushing forward

1197
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,280
wine as a project in the direction of DirectX,

1198
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,080
which has been huge for wine.

1199
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,520
And has developed in its current form

1200
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,720
for wine and has developed and has continued.

1201
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,800
They've just recently released 3.11, which is stable.

1202
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,880
Yesterday, they released 3.14 testing,

1203
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,000
or I'm sorry, 3.12 testing.

1204
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,080
And they have also big news from WineConf.

1205
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,560
They're beginning progress on arm support.

1206
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,400
What?

1207
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,520
For wine.

1208
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,840
Yeah.

1209
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,720
That's, it's like using, I don't, I mean,

1210
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,120
this is really something,

1211
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,240
but this is actually what Microsoft is doing too.

1212
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,200
It's using x86 on arm emulation

1213
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,200
to run 32 bit and 64 bit binaries on arm.

1214
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,760
So I don't even, not only do I not need

1215
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,440
to actually run that operating system,

1216
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,280
I don't even need that architecture.

1217
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,320
What a world.

1218
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,640
Yeah, that's hilarious.

1219
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,040
In fact, it really makes me just respect wine even more.

1220
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,440
It may be slow, but as arm CPUs get faster,

1221
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,760
it may, you never know.

1222
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,240
Also, it looks like there has been some solid progress

1223
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,200
on wine on the Tegra-based Shield,

1224
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,720
which is running Android as well.

1225
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,760
On the NVIDIA Shield running Android,

1226
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,760
they showed Notepad++ and Age of Empires

1227
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,560
running under wine on Android on the NVIDIA Shield,

1228
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,840
which I love the NVIDIA Shield, it's been pretty great.

1229
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,600
And they also talk about Vulkan support and whatnot.

1230
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,040
We'll have a link in the show notes

1231
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,680
if you guys want to read up about that.

1232
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,120
And one other little note in there,

1233
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,960
and I've been a long time advocate of crossover office,

1234
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,040
they mentioned that CodeWeavers is still,

1235
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,360
for a long time now I believe, employing about 50%

1236
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,960
of all of the wine developers.

1237
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,800
Wow.

1238
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,520
It's a big deal, yeah.

1239
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,440
And I just noticed they had a new version out

1240
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,720
that I haven't bought yet, that I was kind of on the fence

1241
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,840
because I don't really need it anymore,

1242
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,360
but I think I'm going to do it.

1243
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,320
I mean, it's almost been worth it just to support this,

1244
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,080
right, like this is awesome.

1245
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,040
You know, I've talked to Jeremy, their CEO, a long time ago.

1246
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,200
I had a lot of respect for him when I talked to him.

1247
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,040
And then when I saw that now for a long time

1248
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,400
they've been employing over, not only do they employ 50%

1249
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,280
of the wine developers, but then they kick that stuff

1250
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,000
upstream too.

1251
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,680
It's not like they're locking it behind some sort

1252
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,280
of proprietary re-license and then

1253
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,800
you have to buy it to get it.

1254
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,640
They're still kicking that stuff upstream.

1255
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,120
They're just so confident in their product

1256
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,760
that they feel like they can sell it too.

1257
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,320
And it's a great UI that sits on top of wine

1258
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,840
that if you need business-grade wine that

1259
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,960
is really easy to walk through, it

1260
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,160
has specific profiles for each application,

1261
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,920
it sets up bottles so that way each wine configuration

1262
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,160
doesn't disrupt the other, or you

1263
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,400
can install multiple applications

1264
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,320
in a single bottle, and it has step-through wizards

1265
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,200
that will pull down installers off the internet

1266
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,280
if they're out there, it's great.

1267
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,840
And I really think that CodeWeavers is a solid company,

1268
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,400
so I think after the show I'm going to go buy myself

1269
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,040
a copy of Crossover Office.

1270
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,000
I think it's worth it.

1271
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,360
And man, more power to the wine projects.

1272
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,160
25 years in, we might not be running all of the Windows apps

1273
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,960
we thought we would 25 years into it, maybe not,

1274
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,200
but it's still pretty cool what they're pulling off.

1275
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,160
All right, we have to keep going because I

1276
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,640
want to get to the Gen 2 stuff, and we've been catching up,

1277
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,560
so we've taken a little bit extra time here.

1278
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,880
But it's just good to chat.

1279
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,160
Now it's like the old shows back together again.

1280
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,040
It's just so much fun.

1281
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:58,960
It's beautiful.

1282
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,280
Let's talk about Ting, though.

1283
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,120
Let's talk about Ting.

1284
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,880
Go to linux.ting.com.

1285
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,920
This is, boy, do I miss having my multiple Ting access points.

1286
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,280
This is how I do it because I have a phone on Ting,

1287
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,600
and I have two MiFi devices, a CDMA device and a GSM device.

1288
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,220
The reason why I can afford to do that,

1289
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,800
it's not because I'm some big baller here.

1290
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,000
It's because it's $6 a month for the line,

1291
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,160
and then just my usage on top of that.

1292
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,360
That's a pretty understandable business expense for what I do.

1293
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,680
$6 a month, and if I don't use them, I don't pay.

1294
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,560
Just pay for the line.

1295
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,080
That's it.

1296
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,480
That's easy.

1297
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,080
It's really simple, and that's why the average Ting bill is just $23

1298
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,280
per phone per month.

1299
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,480
It's a fair price for how much you talk, text, and data you use.

1300
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,480
And when you go to linux.ting.com, they'll

1301
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,000
take $25 off a device if you want to get one from Ting directly.

1302
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,480
If you bring one, and remember, it's CDMA and GSM.

1303
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,240
So if you want to bring a device, and there's

1304
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,920
a lot that are supported, just check their BYOD page.

1305
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,080
They'll give you $25 in service credit,

1306
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,880
which will probably cover more than your first month

1307
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,240
potentially.

1308
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,720
They have a fantastic control panel

1309
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,280
where you can see your usage at a glance

1310
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,680
and take complete control.

1311
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,680
You can set alerts.

1312
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,200
You can turn services off.

1313
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,360
You can activate devices through their website.

1314
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,320
And if you ever get stuck, they just really

1315
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,920
have great customer service, the best customer

1316
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,000
service in the industry.

1317
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,800
And that's something that Ting can focus on

1318
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,880
in a really particular kind of way.

1319
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,560
So not only do they have great prices,

1320
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,960
not only do they have a great device selection,

1321
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,680
but they make flexible usage, like the kind that I use,

1322
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,440
where I have one phone and then two different MIFIs, possible.

1323
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,200
It means that when I'm trying to do a show,

1324
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,700
I can switch between those devices

1325
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,160
just by changing my Wi-Fi network on my laptop.

1326
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,800
I love it.

1327
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,840
They also have a great blog.

1328
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
They just did a tiny home post a little bit ago,

1329
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,160
which I'm partial to, being that I live in one.

1330
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,640
And it's pretty cool.

1331
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,720
They really get this stuff.

1332
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,820
And that's what I love about Ting.

1333
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,280
And I'd love you to get some Ting.

1334
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,800
So go to linux.ting.com and check them out.

1335
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
They're a great service.

1336
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,000
Also, thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring

1337
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,560
this episode of the Unplugged program,

1338
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,320
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1339
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,480
You go there, you sign up for a free seven-day trial,

1340
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,520
and you support the show.

1341
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,080
It's a platform to learn more about Linux, anything

1342
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,400
that runs Linux or that Linux runs on top of.

1343
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,440
And today, they just launched new Azure courseware,

1344
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,520
some Linux Essentials courseware,

1345
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,360
and, man, Wes, it's a perfect courseware for the TechSnap

1346
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:16,860
audience.

1347
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,960
It's a full deep dive into continuous integration

1348
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,160
and deployment.

1349
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,480
And on top of that, when you're all done with the courseware,

1350
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,800
you actually set up a whole system.

1351
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,560
You really go through and implement every aspect of it.

1352
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,560
And they've broken it out into different areas.

1353
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,000
And the thing that I learned today

1354
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,360
that I didn't know before is, so say they've

1355
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,160
itemized continuous integration and deployment courseware

1356
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,760
into eight major sections.

1357
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,440
If you just needed to brush up on the Kubernetes aspect,

1358
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,560
you could jump right to step six.

1359
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,960
It will fill in all of the required stuff

1360
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,360
and build the server infrastructure

1361
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,560
that you would have had to go through to get there,

1362
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,600
just so you can deep dive on that single topic,

1363
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,000
take it, and learn more.

1364
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,440
That is the difference when you use Linux Academy, right?

1365
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,600
Who else has thought about this this seriously?

1366
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,880
They're trying to do so many different things

1367
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,700
that they just can't have this level of polish and attention

1368
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,640
to detail.

1369
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,680
And if you want to get the next promotion,

1370
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,720
you really want to prove that you've learned something,

1371
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,040
I can think of nowhere better.

1372
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:13,720
That's right.

1373
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,600
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug.

1374
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,560
They're going to have another live stream

1375
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,600
on Thursday, July 12 at 10.30 Chicago time.

1376
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,520
That's central.

1377
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,320
And the word on the street, although I

1378
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,200
haven't seen the deets, but the word on the street

1379
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,080
is they have a bunch of Red Hat related announcements

1380
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,120
on the Thursday show.

1381
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,760
So check that out.

1382
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,160
And they're also hiring.

1383
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,440
I wanted to make a little mention of this.

1384
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,880
They are looking for a full stack node developer,

1385
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,280
if that's something that you might be interested in.

1386
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,720
They also are looking for a senior Ruby developer,

1387
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,920
as well as a customer support manager,

1388
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,760
Ruby on Rails developer, and a Microsoft Azure training

1389
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,680
architect.

1390
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,160
Now that's a lot of positions.

1391
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:01,040
So I would say there's an email address I gave out last week.

1392
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,440
And I think that's the same one.

1393
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,580
I don't remember what it was.

1394
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,400
I'm sorry.

1395
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,160
I can't recall.

1396
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,680
Brent, do you happen to remember randomly

1397
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,160
what email address I randomly said last week in the show?

1398
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,760
I'm sorry, I have no idea.

1399
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,640
No, I can't recall either.

1400
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,880
But if anybody in the chat room knows either,

1401
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,320
maybe put it in there.

1402
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,120
Because there is a lot of positions here.

1403
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,400
And it's a really cool company.

1404
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,820
I've been down there hanging out with them for a while.

1405
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,920
And I totally think that if you are in this area

1406
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,720
and you listen to the show, some of these actually,

1407
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,600
all of the ones I just listed, except for the customer support

1408
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,560
manager, are all telecommute jobs.

1409
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,480
So you don't even have to be in Texas.

1410
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,240
You can be wherever you're at.

1411
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,440
That's pretty awesome.

1412
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,200
So check it out.

1413
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,800
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to get the deal.

1414
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,920
And you know what, do this.

1415
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,520
If you want to apply for the positions,

1416
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,320
I have a special email address that's

1417
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,320
set up just for the Jupyter Broadcasting audience.

1418
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,060
So you kind of get the hotline treatment.

1419
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,280
So if you really are interested, it

1420
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,200
may be worth listening to the sponsor section

1421
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,760
of last week's episode.

1422
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,360
But otherwise, I'll give you a little hot tip.

1423
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,080
linuxacademy.workable.com.

1424
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,320
I have them all listed there.

1425
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,360
linuxacademy.workable.com.

1426
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,320
I think if you're a listener of this show, that

1427
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,600
might put you ahead of the list.

1428
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,640
So go check that out.

1429
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,400
And if you really want the fast line,

1430
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,440
go listen to last week's episode and grab the email address.

1431
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,980
And then maybe remind me what it was.

1432
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,120
Also, a big thank you to DigitalOcean.

1433
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,360
deo.co slash unplugged.

1434
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,800
Go there to get a $100 credit at DigitalOcean when you sign up.

1435
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,720
You've got to use that URL, though, to get that.

1436
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,320
deo.co slash unplugged.

1437
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,820
You can build applications super fast

1438
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,120
on DigitalOcean's crazy quick infrastructure.

1439
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,280
Enterprise-grade SSDs, 40 gigabit connections

1440
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,720
coming into the hypervisors.

1441
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,800
Of course, they're running Linux, KVM,

1442
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,120
to virtualize it all.

1443
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,600
And they have industry-leading price

1444
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,920
to performance, predictable cost and billing.

1445
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,160
And I love these optimized compute types.

1446
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,040
While you were out, Wes, we set up a PeerTube instance

1447
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,360
on a DigitalOcean droplet using their super crazy fast,

1448
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,920
high-end Xeon CPUs, where you get two dedicated.

1449
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,760
Oh.

1450
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,000
So cool, Wes.

1451
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,080
Because I've encoded these exact videos many times.

1452
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,400
So I really get into a sense of the speed up on DigitalOcean.

1453
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,200
And it's so nice.

1454
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:10,960
It's just right there.

1455
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,700
They also have these mix-and-match droplets

1456
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,960
now, where you can set the different, like,

1457
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,080
maybe you want more RAM.

1458
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,620
Or you can say, you know what, I just

1459
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,880
want all in SSD, as well as block storage.

1460
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,560
It's so slick.

1461
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,600
And the whole thing is easy to manage

1462
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,920
with their fantastic dashboard.

1463
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,360
And they're easy to use API.

1464
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,280
If you just want to do it via script

1465
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,280
or use your favorite language, it's

1466
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,600
really easy to get started.

1467
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,520
And they got great documentation, data centers

1468
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,280
all over the world.

1469
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,920
This is the bar, you understand, right?

1470
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,840
DigitalOcean is the bar that everybody else in this game

1471
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,240
is trying to catch up to.

1472
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,400
The problem is, when you're ahead,

1473
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,440
you just got to stay hungry.

1474
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,600
And you can stay competitive.

1475
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,800
And that's exactly what DigitalOcean's done.

1476
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,200
Now they're offering $100 credits to try it out.

1477
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,160
That's insane.

1478
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,200
Take advantage of that before they stop doing it,

1479
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,360
because that's insane.

1480
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,220
It's so great.

1481
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:04,580
do.co.co.co.co and a big thank you to DigitalOcean

1482
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:09,480
for sponsoring the unplugged program, do.co.co.co.

1483
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,300
All right, well, last week we talked about Gen2's GitHub

1484
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,000
repo getting owned.

1485
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,920
It wasn't a massive, massive blunder,

1486
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,760
because they weren't really anything more than mirrors.

1487
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,280
But now it turns out that it was a bit of a rookie mistake.

1488
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,120
And I say that with love, much respect

1489
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,840
to some of the very, very technical people

1490
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,400
over in the Gen2 community.

1491
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,480
In fact, yeah, there's some people in the security industry

1492
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,840
that only use Gen2 because of some of the people involved

1493
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,600
with the project.

1494
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,600
So I say this with no disparity to the people involved with Gen2,

1495
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,680
but it helps me make a larger point.

1496
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,840
And that is, after looking through this

1497
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,920
and thinking about some of the other recent distro snafus,

1498
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,920
things like expiring SSL certifications,

1499
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,760
project leaders randomly quitting,

1500
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,200
leaving nobody with access to any of the infrastructure,

1501
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,080
there's just been example after example

1502
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,840
after example this year of projects

1503
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,440
getting this stuff wrong.

1504
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,640
And in the case of Gen2, they just

1505
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,520
owned up to it on their own Wiki page.

1506
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,520
They say the attacker gained access

1507
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,500
to a password of an organization administrator.

1508
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,120
Evidence suggested a password schemes

1509
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,960
was used to disclose on one site made

1510
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,000
it easy to guess the password for unrelated web pages,

1511
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,120
i.e. using the same password on multiple websites.

1512
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,120
The Wiki page also reveals that the project got lucky.

1513
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,800
The attack was loud.

1514
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,840
Removing all of the developers caused everyone

1515
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,280
to get emailed if they had been more careful and more

1516
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,080
selective, like figured out somebody

1517
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:43,080
that hadn't been active for a while and just removed them

1518
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,680
and then got in, it would have taken much longer for the Gen2

1519
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,040
project to notice.

1520
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,480
But the credentials were taken, and they did a noisy attack

1521
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,120
where they did something that notified all of the developers,

1522
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,600
and so it alerted them to it.

1523
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,240
And those are the things that really kind of,

1524
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,760
that was the thing that saved them.

1525
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,120
But the thing that caused the issue

1526
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,960
is a shared password as well as GitHub failing

1527
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,560
to block access to repositories via Git,

1528
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,560
resulting in malicious commits being extremely accessible.

1529
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,200
So Gen2 had to force push over as soon as these things were

1530
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,840
discovered, and credential revoking procedures

1531
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,320
were incomplete for them.

1532
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,920
And they also didn't have a backup copy of the Gen2 GitHub

1533
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,760
organization details.

1534
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,440
So that made it particularly hard.

1535
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,880
And the systemd repo turned out not to be mirrored.

1536
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,600
It was stored directly on GitHub.

1537
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,520
So there was a couple of things, oh, as well

1538
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,720
as some communication snafus.

1539
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,080
But my core point that I'm trying to make

1540
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,720
is this is clearly not the stuff that distros

1541
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,240
are super strong at, as it probably shouldn't be.

1542
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,240
You know, they're developers.

1543
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,280
They're maintainers.

1544
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,880
They're organizers.

1545
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,960
But they're not necessarily sysadmins,

1546
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,000
or maybe some of them are.

1547
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,280
But that isn't what they're spending their time doing.

1548
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,600
And I'm not trying to make a case for putting everything

1549
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,640
in the cloud here, Wes.

1550
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,960
But do you kind of follow my logic?

1551
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,760
Like, I kind of come from the school of thought

1552
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,160
that developers should develop software,

1553
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,360
and sysadmins should manage servers.

1554
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,160
And recently, the Gnome Foundation

1555
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:14,200
just launched new positions specifically

1556
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,880
to take off the server administrative burden

1557
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,960
from the developers and people in the foundation.

1558
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,080
What's the compromise here?

1559
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,920
Because obviously, projects don't have unlimited budgets.

1560
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,440
They can't hire people full time to do this.

1561
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,920
And there's only so many people to do the work.

1562
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,680
But yet, there's obviously a certain amount

1563
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,800
of neglect that goes when you have too many hats on.

1564
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,280
What's the solution for this?

1565
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,520
Solve it, Wes.

1566
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,160
Yeah, I'll solve the whole thing, and maybe world peace

1567
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,120
while I'm at it.

1568
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:40,840
I do think you're right.

1569
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,080
Like, when we talk about the split between developers

1570
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,480
and admins, it's not about even skill sets

1571
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,320
or anything like that.

1572
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,600
It's really what you're saying.

1573
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,600
Too many hats, when you have too many jobs

1574
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,720
and you're thinking about too much

1575
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,840
and too many responsibilities, you get sloppy.

1576
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,920
I'm sure the people involved here,

1577
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,800
they probably even knew somewhere in the back of their mind

1578
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,840
that this wasn't the best password policy.

1579
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,180
And you know what, I'll fix it next weekend

1580
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,040
when I finally have an ounce of time.

1581
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,160
I'll sit down, and I'll get this right,

1582
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,020
and I'll finally install that password manager

1583
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,160
that I've been meaning to.

1584
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,400
But that's never going to work.

1585
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,640
And so whether you're a developer or anything else,

1586
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,560
you really do need people that your job

1587
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,960
is maintaining infrastructure.

1588
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,300
And it's not sexy, and it might not even be fun,

1589
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,840
especially when, as you say, right,

1590
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,400
a lot of these people, these are volunteers.

1591
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,720
You're trying to contribute to open source

1592
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,040
for the benefit of everyone.

1593
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,420
And you're excited about scratching the itch

1594
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:30,400
or improving the awesomeness of the build system

1595
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,440
or whatever else it is you're interested in.

1596
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,360
And if you try to take on too many things,

1597
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,560
it's just gonna fail.

1598
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,880
So if you can find people who are willing to be humble

1599
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,220
and just say like, yes, I'm gonna administer.

1600
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,180
I'm gonna be an administrator.

1601
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,100
I'm gonna be an overseer.

1602
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,840
I'm just gonna make sure that all the central parts

1603
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,920
that no one else thinks of,

1604
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,700
and it just has to run in the background,

1605
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,800
will actually work.

1606
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,100
And ideally, if you could have some sort of funding

1607
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:52,940
to make sure that happened,

1608
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,480
because that's probably especially hard

1609
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,880
to find volunteers for, that would be even better.

1610
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,440
Yeah, yeah.

1611
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,920
Brandon, what do you think of the idea

1612
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,880
of the free and open source software community

1613
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,040
coming together with essentially

1614
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,120
like an open best practices,

1615
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,200
like a comprehensive best practices

1616
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,400
that many, many, many projects could contribute to?

1617
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,600
What about something like that?

1618
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,720
Yeah, it seems to me like these are the types of problems

1619
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,680
that would exist with almost any project, right?

1620
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,680
So I think because we have such strong community,

1621
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,560
even if you're making quasi-competitive products,

1622
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,000
everyone needs this infrastructure

1623
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,480
to make their work happen, right?

1624
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:32,160
So what if we can maybe all get together

1625
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,800
and create some kind of, this might be a dream,

1626
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,720
but some kind of best practices,

1627
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,760
I don't know if it's a document or some kind of,

1628
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,400
maybe it's a conference or something

1629
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,400
where everybody can just be up to date on this,

1630
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,200
and some of the developers can maybe lean

1631
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,200
on some of the projects who are a bit more expert.

1632
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,680
Or maybe what about some sort of donated auditing time,

1633
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,640
where you could get in security experts

1634
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,120
to go into an organization and do periodic assessments

1635
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,160
to say like, hey, where are you at?

1636
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,080
What can you improve?

1637
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,740
Yeah, you would think there would be people

1638
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,920
in the community that have that particular skill set

1639
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,160
that could be a way they contribute,

1640
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,880
but there would need to be some structure around it,

1641
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,980
because otherwise you could get people

1642
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,720
just banging on doors they shouldn't.

1643
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,160
Eric, you think maybe I'm just a DevOps hater?

1644
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,360
You say DevOps aims to solve this.

1645
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,200
I say DevOps is the problem.

1646
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,840
DevOps is a philosophy, first and foremost.

1647
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:28,520
It's not a position, it's not supposed to be click-baity.

1648
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,300
It's a philosophy, it's a way of doing work.

1649
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:36,300
It's with the way that the founding team folks,

1650
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,360
it was just a bunch of people that were at a conference

1651
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,640
that were sitting down talking over drinks

1652
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,540
and basically came up with this entire philosophy.

1653
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,220
It's a way of doing work.

1654
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:52,800
You break things down into one or two week sprints.

1655
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,460
You take tasks one at a time.

1656
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,680
You sit down with the developers,

1657
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,520
with the security people, with the network people,

1658
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,800
with the business, with the systems administrators.

1659
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,800
Everybody sits down at a table and prioritizes work

1660
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,920
and what can I get done this week?

1661
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,480
What needs to get pushed to next week?

1662
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,960
And that's where a lot of these tool sets have come in.

1663
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,360
The CI, CD, continuous integration,

1664
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,360
continuous deployment type of an approach

1665
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,680
comes from this DevOps philosophy.

1666
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,360
So if you've got all of your code for your infrastructure,

1667
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,560
for your network, for your applications

1668
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,240
in a GitLab instance,

1669
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:37,240
and that's managed by a tool like Jenkins

1670
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,040
that will automatically set up new builds

1671
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,180
that talks to a tool like SaltStack

1672
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,780
that automatically provisions and monitors

1673
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,720
your infrastructure to make sure that,

1674
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,920
well, the server crashed so I'm gonna rebuild another one

1675
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,520
and tell the load balancer to point to this IP address

1676
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,480
instead of the bad IP address.

1677
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,280
It's a philosophy and it only works well

1678
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,720
as the people that are implementing that philosophy.

1679
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,080
Yeah, and it does seem like the tools are getting better

1680
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,680
and they're getting more complicated too,

1681
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,760
but it seems like the tools around this,

1682
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,080
what has been a philosophy for years now,

1683
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,260
are actually starting to catch up with the philosophy.

1684
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:13,400
Would you agree with that, Wes?

1685
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,440
Yeah, I mean, it's really like anything else.

1686
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,500
I think when you can have better communication,

1687
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,200
better communication around shared goals in particular

1688
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,280
and have stakeholders working closer together,

1689
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,120
that's a benefit.

1690
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,320
Now, it's not a silver bullet, right?

1691
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,260
So anytime you have more things to do

1692
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,080
than you actually have manpower or time to do,

1693
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,260
you're trying to do too much,

1694
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:33,880
you'll still face the same problems.

1695
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,460
Yeah, I like that you got the word stakeholders

1696
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,300
that worked in there, that's well done.

1697
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:42,320
Now, Brent has an idea, maybe we just simplify this.

1698
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,040
Something a little easier than a comprehensive guide,

1699
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:45,880
right, Brent?

1700
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,480
Yeah, I remember, I wish I could remember

1701
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,400
what it was called, and maybe someone in the community

1702
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,700
can help me out on this, but I remember Noah talking,

1703
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,480
it might have been like even six weeks ago on Ask Noah

1704
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,680
about exactly this, a type of checklist

1705
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,840
that you could look at your own systems

1706
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,360
and see if they were secure with basically,

1707
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,960
you didn't have to be creative to come up with a checklist.

1708
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,960
It was right there and it was being distributed

1709
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,320
by one of the organizations, I forget what it was.

1710
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,880
A checklist isn't a bad way to go,

1711
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,280
even if it was something that was sort of generic

1712
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,040
that you could at least say we followed

1713
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,320
this community checklist.

1714
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,280
I feel like there is something here.

1715
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,560
Yeah, I mean, a checklist is good,

1716
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,560
I think you need, a checklist is helpful,

1717
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,760
it's a start, right, but you still do need that person

1718
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,320
who has enough time and focus and skill

1719
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,240
to run through the checklist and know

1720
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,560
which ones are actually checked or not.

1721
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,760
Yeah, that is a really fair point.

1722
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,160
And maybe the checklist is a little bit too surface,

1723
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,200
you know, you need to understand

1724
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,600
what's happening below the checklist.

1725
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,740
Yeah, and that is sometimes what I worry is happening,

1726
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,320
and this is just me being a curmudgeon,

1727
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,480
is we have, what DevOps to me really is,

1728
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,880
is it's getting software developers more empowered

1729
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,600
to just deploy things that they need to do their job

1730
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,360
and not have to sit around and wait for the sysadmins

1731
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,200
to set the system up and then this tedious back and forth

1732
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,960
where something isn't configured quite right,

1733
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,280
and you know, the sysadmin has no idea

1734
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,080
how the software works, and the software developer

1735
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,840
has no idea what the sysadmin's doing,

1736
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,960
and the whole momentum there really caught,

1737
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,440
and I guess another way to put that is

1738
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,080
the demands to speed up software development

1739
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,480
have sort of put us down this path

1740
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,400
where developers are deploying infrastructure.

1741
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,520
And when I started in the IT industry,

1742
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,040
those two lines were never crossed,

1743
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,240
and they generally didn't get along super well either,

1744
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,200
either sides of the camp were always grousing

1745
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,760
about the other side of the camp,

1746
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,400
so it wasn't an ideal solution.

1747
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:45,120
And Linux really is an operating system

1748
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,240
designed for system administrators, it really is.

1749
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,040
If you think about it, you have to be root

1750
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,560
to install software, well, who's root?

1751
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,960
The system administrator, and if you think about the repo,

1752
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:56,800
what is the repo?

1753
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,240
The repo is an all-knowing person

1754
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,320
who has blessed this package

1755
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,000
as being possible to install on your system.

1756
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,840
That's the mindset of a sysadmin,

1757
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,840
and snaps and Docker and AppImage and Flatpaks and DevOps

1758
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,160
are all about collapsing that resistance down

1759
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:19,080
to the developer can publish and the user can install it.

1760
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,960
And sometimes the user is the developer.

1761
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,720
And that mind shift has been good

1762
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,640
for the pace of software development,

1763
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,280
and it's led to things like incredible cloud infrastructure

1764
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,400
and things like AWS Lambda and DigitalOcean

1765
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,680
one-click deployments, which I use the hell out of.

1766
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,360
So it's not all negative,

1767
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,960
but my core issue has always been

1768
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,640
as we go down this path is you become less

1769
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,640
and less of an expert.

1770
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,000
You are required to be less and less of an expert

1771
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,120
to set up really complicated systems.

1772
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,760
Whereas in the past, your level of knowledge

1773
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,080
basically had to match the level of complication

1774
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:56,920
of those systems.

1775
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,200
It was a one-for-one thing.

1776
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,640
To get that sucker working,

1777
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,520
you knew exactly how it worked in and out intimately.

1778
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,120
That is no longer the case.

1779
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,360
There is now a massive gap between knowledge and complexity.

1780
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,080
And that's not necessarily a bad thing,

1781
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,880
but I think it does lead us down this path

1782
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,040
where you can over-deploy an infrastructure.

1783
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,480
You can build yourself a kingdom that traps you.

1784
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,760
And then it's a lot to manage.

1785
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,000
You've got multiple people trying to get the stuff.

1786
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,720
You start sharing passwords.

1787
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,920
You're using three different things

1788
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,000
to coordinate the team's communication.

1789
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,640
Nothing is super solid

1790
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,000
because there's not one really uptight person

1791
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,200
who is worrying about all of that stuff constantly,

1792
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,360
saying, we need to be doing this.

1793
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,720
We need to be fixing this.

1794
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:40,200
And if you don't have a team or a person

1795
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,120
or whatever to do that,

1796
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,760
and you leave it up to just the developers

1797
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,560
or the distributions or the projects

1798
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,120
who are busy doing other things to maintain it,

1799
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,560
I feel like this is going to be a systemic issue

1800
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,480
that constantly plagues busy,

1801
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,120
overtaxed open-source projects

1802
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,760
and could even, over time,

1803
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,200
lead to a bit of a reputation as amateur

1804
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,320
and that a lot of these projects

1805
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,720
don't have their shit together

1806
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,800
and that they constantly are having issues.

1807
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,400
I mean, going all the way back to Mint breaches,

1808
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,640
I mean, we can just sit here and rattle off

1809
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:16,640
mistake after mistake after mistake

1810
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,560
that has really just boiled down to,

1811
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,320
oops, we missed that, or we didn't really know,

1812
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,080
or something changed that we weren't aware of,

1813
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,520
or the project lead who had all the access left.

1814
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,280
And every time you just go,

1815
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,120
you smack your head and you go,

1816
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,520
God, that's amateur hour.

1817
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,920
It's a gray area in many ways,

1818
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,800
because you're right, we have so many tools.

1819
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,960
And in many ways, that's good

1820
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,800
because a lot of times, if they're done well,

1821
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,800
it means it's easier to get it right, right?

1822
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,640
So if you're on Amazon

1823
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,040
and you're deploying a load balancer,

1824
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,520
it will handle all, you know,

1825
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,560
if you have SSL on there and you have it provisioned,

1826
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,840
you know, it will have the best ciphers,

1827
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:47,680
they take care of it.

1828
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,040
It gets upgraded automatically.

1829
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:49,880
So that's nice.

1830
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,840
You don't have to go learn the horrible world of SSL.

1831
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,880
At the same time, you're right that if it's so easy

1832
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,640
to build yourself this giant, complicated mountain

1833
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,840
and no one really understands how it works,

1834
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,840
that will fall down.

1835
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,480
And that's where I think maybe sometimes

1836
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,120
it's a little bit of a fallacy that,

1837
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,120
just because you've, you know,

1838
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,520
you've quote unquote gone DevOps or whatever else,

1839
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,160
that doesn't mean you can't have individual experts

1840
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,440
and you can't have people that happen to know more

1841
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,840
about a part of the system than others

1842
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,120
or are specific domain experts.

1843
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,200
And at the same time, it reminds me of sort of unit tests

1844
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,000
for software development and all the safeguards

1845
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,160
and everything else, there's really no substitute

1846
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,000
for attention to detail and caring about the software

1847
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,720
or systems that you're crafting.

1848
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,840
Yeah.

1849
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:30,800
Well, there you have it.

1850
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,960
I'm just putting out there that would be great

1851
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,840
if somehow we could really come together on,

1852
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,960
even if it was a checklist, that'd be fine,

1853
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,240
that'd be a great starting point

1854
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:43,120
or a guide, a Wiki of best practices.

1855
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,160
The problem would be anything like this ever getting traction

1856
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,120
and it would take a lot of buy-off,

1857
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,080
but it really seems like if we could give these folks

1858
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,600
that are too busy to, if you think,

1859
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,960
if you have the mindset ever

1860
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,080
when you're managing your infrastructure,

1861
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,920
that, oh man, this is this tedious thing

1862
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,840
that I just have to get done so that way we can do X,

1863
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,520
you're probably not the person that should be managing that.

1864
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,200
You should be the person that's looking forward

1865
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,840
to setting that stuff up so that way you can do X.

1866
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,880
And if you're in that position where like,

1867
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,240
oh man, this thing again, all right,

1868
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,960
well, we gotta go get that thing set up on GitHub

1869
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,040
so we can just do this, please,

1870
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,040
so that way we can get back to work.

1871
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,680
If that's how you feel about it,

1872
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,600
it's probably a sign that your team

1873
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,080
needs somebody else doing that work.

1874
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,080
And so if we could make that person's job,

1875
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,400
because that's not always an option,

1876
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,040
if we can make that person's job and life

1877
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,240
a little bit easier with a checklist or a guide

1878
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,560
or some sort of community resource that says,

1879
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,160
these are at least the minimums that you should be doing,

1880
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,120
I think that would be extremely valuable.

1881
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,120
So I hope we see it, who knows?

1882
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,480
You never know, you never know, you never know.

1883
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,280
Maybe I'll travel around in my RV

1884
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,320
and I'll advocate it on every Linux event I go

1885
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,560
and one day something will happen, maybe.

1886
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,320
In the meantime, where should folks

1887
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,840
get more Westpain in their life?

1888
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,240
Oh, you can find me on Twitter at Westpain

1889
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:02,400
or stay tuned from some exciting new TechSnap episodes

1890
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,040
coming to a podcast near you.

1891
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,840
Ooh, TechSnap.Systems slash subscribe.

1892
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,360
Brent, do you have anywhere you'd like to send

1893
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:13,240
the good folks any tips, tricks

1894
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,960
to get more Brent in their life?

1895
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,880
Yeah, sure, you can either come to Northern Ontario

1896
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,480
and I'll tour you around or you can hit me up on Twitter,

1897
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:25,280
Brent, at Brent Gervais, B-R-E-N-T-G-E-R-V-A-I-S

1898
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,640
or BrentGervais.com.

1899
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,880
That's great, that's great.

1900
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,320
Now I know if I ever go there, I'm gonna contact you.

1901
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,360
If I ever go back to New York City, I'm gonna contact XMN

1902
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,400
and if I ever go down to Seattle, I contact Wes.

1903
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:39,280
I am really covered now, at least on the major coast.

1904
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,200
You can follow me, I'm at Chris Ellis.

1905
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,720
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

1906
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,280
Links to build the community.

1907
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,960
Well, you know what, really, if you think about it,

1908
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,440
we have a very wide ranging network of experts,

1909
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,760
probably in every major city.

1910
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,680
So anywhere we wanna go,

1911
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,240
there's probably gonna be somebody there.

1912
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,160
If you'd like to join us or get links

1913
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,000
to anything we talked about,

1914
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,240
we have all that stuff detailed at linuxunplug.com,

1915
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,840
linuxunplug.com slash 257.

1916
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,800
The live show is at jblive.tv on a Tuesday

1917
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,680
and I may be still down in Texas

1918
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,160
by the time you hear us again.

1919
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,560
I just don't know, but thanks so much for joining us

1920
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,600
and we will see you right back here next week.

1921
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:25,600
is

1922
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:52,560
Thank you, guys. That was a lot of fun. Thank you, Mumble Room. You guys were great as always.

1923
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,560
Stars, as always, that Mumble Room. Brent, the mumble worked pretty good. You sounded

1924
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,960
pretty good during the whole show, too, so I'm glad that worked.

1925
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,720
That's kind of unbelievable. It's great. We kind of pulled that together last minute,

1926
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,720
didn't we?

1927
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:07,160
Yeah, yeah. And, Eric, it's good to hear that whatever was wrong with your mixer last week,

1928
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:10,400
the highs are a little better this week.

1929
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:14,600
Yeah, that was fun to find out after the fact.

1930
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:19,680
Yeah, the kids love the knobs on the mixer, man. They love the knobs on the mixer. Look

1931
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:26,080
at that, Daddy. Security amateur hour coming in by Architect right now. The Traveling LUP

1932
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:32,500
Roadshow, we need up-tights. That's funny. Do you have any hot travel tips to leave us

1933
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,700
with, Wes, before we part?

1934
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:37,440
Buy a Kindle and spend your whole time using it.

1935
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,560
Oh, did you get a Kindle?

1936
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,300
I did. I don't know how I didn't have one already in that I'm a pretty big reader. I've

1937
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,360
just been stubborn and sticking to the old dead tree matter.

1938
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,840
But it's an Amazon product.

1939
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,400
Yeah, I was conflicted, but, boy, I was glad I had it on that 12-hour flight.

1940
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,080
I got a Switch for this trip.

1941
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,280
Oh, really? Oh, nice.

1942
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:00,080
Yep. Yep, I got Odyssey and Mario Kart. Man, those games at 60 bucks a pop, though, that

1943
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:06,920
is outrageous. So I'm going to wait a little bit for the others, but so much fun. Much

1944
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:11,920
better than I expected. It has a kickstand on the back, so you can take the handles off

1945
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:17,960
and it's just so much fun to play with the kids. It has been great. It is better than

1946
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:22,760
expected. And the fact that it uses USB-C to charge is an absolute perk.

1947
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,760
Loved it.

1948
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:29,240
Mm-hmm. Yeah. So I'll have some Switch time while I'm on this trip. So by the time I get

1949
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,480
back, I'll probably have a pretty good take on the device and might be ready to try to

1950
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,480
put Linux on it.

1951
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:45,480
Oh, do it. Yes.
