WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.960
We are in an alternate location today.

00:02.960 --> 00:03.800
We are in a backup location.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.160
Super secret.

00:05.160 --> 00:08.160
Location A was right outside

00:08.160 --> 00:11.640
where they have this secret room that we can go into,

00:11.640 --> 00:13.520
but we're not allowed to tell you what is said in there

00:13.520 --> 00:14.840
and we're not allowed to record anything.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.680
Oh.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.320
But outside that room, we set up camp

00:17.320 --> 00:18.240
where they have these tables

00:18.240 --> 00:20.520
and that's where we did Coda Radio Live yesterday.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.360
Right. Yeah.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.160
So we were at the Hilton in downtown Seattle

00:23.160 --> 00:24.160
at the Sprint event.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.280
And the problem was, is next to the Sprint event,

00:28.280 --> 00:30.360
the room over, so the doors are side by side,

00:30.360 --> 00:31.680
they're two different ballrooms,

00:31.680 --> 00:35.160
and the door over was a practical marketing strategy,

00:35.160 --> 00:36.040
training session.

00:36.040 --> 00:36.880
Oh boy.

00:36.880 --> 00:37.960
And so all of these people

00:37.960 --> 00:39.720
who have been sent to practical marketing training

00:39.720 --> 00:41.440
by their companies were coming out

00:41.440 --> 00:45.060
and seeing these two guys in apparently servant clothing,

00:45.060 --> 00:46.480
asking us questions like,

00:46.480 --> 00:48.160
what's the bathroom code?

00:48.160 --> 00:49.440
Where do I get food?

00:50.320 --> 00:53.040
My favorite one is a lady interrupted Coda Radio

00:53.040 --> 00:55.560
to ask me if they have non-dairy creamer.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.040
Like you're sitting here doing the live show.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.080
I have this headset on.

00:58.080 --> 00:58.900
Oh my God.

00:58.900 --> 00:59.740
Which is the headset

00:59.740 --> 01:00.880
like the ESPN broadcasters are wearing, right?

01:00.880 --> 01:01.720
We're coming into,

01:01.720 --> 01:03.680
we have both Noah and I are sitting there talking.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.240
We're loud because we're on the air.

01:05.240 --> 01:06.260
We're looking at our laptops.

01:06.260 --> 01:07.560
We have a mixer there.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.560
There's wires everywhere.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.160
So clearly you're there to take live questions

01:11.160 --> 01:12.000
about the hotel.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.360
Non-dairy creamer.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.440
So today we're like, boy,

01:14.440 --> 01:16.320
we should really find an alternate location.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.680
We should really, cause that didn't work well

01:17.680 --> 01:19.400
cause we got interrupted a couple of times.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.480
And we arrive at outside the secret room again

01:23.480 --> 01:28.480
to discover a bit of, I would say, hushed chaos.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.600
Like the room was tense.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.800
And we're like, what's going on?

01:31.800 --> 01:33.120
Why is the room so tense?

01:33.120 --> 01:34.480
Did somebody fart?

01:34.480 --> 01:36.760
And so we're walking around

01:36.760 --> 01:38.280
and I'm trying to get on the wifi

01:38.280 --> 01:39.240
and I'm getting frustrated.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.000
And I give my laptop to Noah.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.380
I say, Brown bear, will you get me on the wifi?

01:42.380 --> 01:43.220
I got it.

01:43.220 --> 01:44.040
He's got the special touch.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.880
Yeah, I got a touch base with JV1.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.000
And as I'm walking around,

01:47.000 --> 01:47.920
Wimpy comes around the corner and says,

01:47.920 --> 01:49.640
oh, the wifi is down.

01:49.640 --> 01:50.480
What's that?

01:50.480 --> 01:51.300
Oh no.

01:51.300 --> 01:52.280
The network's down here at the switch.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.440
The switch lost its config.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.720
And the APs that are wired into the switch

01:56.720 --> 01:58.560
are essentially without any network connectivity right now.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.000
You get a little tipsy with the switch.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.440
You misplace it and you leave it behind at the bar.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.320
And it was this weird experience.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.680
So right before that,

02:05.680 --> 02:07.700
I don't know if you were there for this happen,

02:07.700 --> 02:09.160
but I was just walking away.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.000
So it was in the, yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.040
I was just walking.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.760
I was just going into the restroom

02:12.760 --> 02:13.640
or coming out of the restroom.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.320
And this guy, this weird old guy,

02:15.320 --> 02:17.560
and you all know what I'm talking about, right?

02:17.560 --> 02:18.800
Like he has his phone in his hand.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.080
What you're gonna look like in about 45 years.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.560
Yeah, but this guy, it's like,

02:23.560 --> 02:24.720
you're not quite sure if he knows

02:24.720 --> 02:25.920
that the screen is on or off,

02:25.920 --> 02:27.240
and he's not quite sure what those icons are.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.960
And he's mumbling about, I can't get connected.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.080
Are you on the wifi?

02:30.080 --> 02:31.320
That's when he comes up to Noah.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.160
As I'm walking away here, hey, are you on the wifi?

02:34.160 --> 02:35.000
The wifi.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.480
So I said, no.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.280
And then I was afraid he was gonna want me

02:38.280 --> 02:39.240
to help him with his phone,

02:39.240 --> 02:40.440
and maybe he wanted to be my friend

02:40.440 --> 02:41.560
or something else terrible like that.

02:41.560 --> 02:42.880
I do not have time for this.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.880
And so I was looking at him.

02:44.880 --> 02:45.720
I just kind of brushed it off.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.000
And then he mutters.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.320
He goes, oh, we lost the switch configuration,

02:49.320 --> 02:51.520
and I, ah, so the whole wifi's down.

02:51.520 --> 02:55.520
And I was like, dude, wifi does not come from switches.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.120
Wifi comes from access points.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.680
And this further confirms that you are some old guy

02:59.680 --> 03:01.600
that doesn't know how to use this technology.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.200
Obviously, the wifi works just fine.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.960
I'm not connected.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.000
And then Wimpy comes out and says, oh, the wifi's down.

03:07.000 --> 03:07.920
And then it dawns on me,

03:07.920 --> 03:10.160
that dude is actually the tech from the hotel.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.080
He's here to fix it, and he was probably right.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.720
It probably was a lost configuration.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.880
So the hotel went into problem-solving mode

03:15.880 --> 03:18.160
because they got a big client here, Canonical,

03:18.160 --> 03:21.600
who is doing, has people, has industry

03:21.600 --> 03:24.040
from all over Washington and local areas here,

03:24.040 --> 03:27.200
working on things that are all connected to the internet.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.120
And this is a big part of why they're here.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.600
And so the hotel has a problem to solve.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.560
And I see these,

03:33.560 --> 03:35.640
I see all these different discussions going on.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.760
I got a little audio, but I might tell the story again,

03:37.760 --> 03:40.440
and Linux one plugged a little bit with the audio.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.200
But they decide we gotta move hotel rooms.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.400
Long story short, we decide we gotta move hotel rooms.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.820
Yeah, and so we're now in the backup location.

03:47.820 --> 03:50.080
That's a big backup last-minute change.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.320
But now here we have wired, we have wired ethernet.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.660
We've got like, we've got 300 up, 300 down.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.640
So we're sending uncompressed PCM audio

03:56.640 --> 03:58.480
for this live event from downtown Seattle.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.320
That's amazing.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.880
Live from downtown Seattle,

04:01.880 --> 04:06.880
this is Linux Unplugged episode 234 for January 30th, 2018.

04:06.880 --> 04:19.800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged,

04:19.800 --> 04:22.160
Jupyter Broadcasting's weekly Linux talk show

04:22.160 --> 04:24.800
that is live from a Canonical Snap event

04:24.800 --> 04:26.440
in a fancy hotel ballroom.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.400
My name is Chris.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.240
My name is Wes.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.400
Hello, Wes.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.240
Hello, sir.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.080
Nice to see you downtown.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.280
So I came to you this week.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.120
You sure did.

04:33.120 --> 04:33.960
Well, you're so nice.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.240
Well, you know, that's the least I could do

04:35.240 --> 04:36.600
when Canonical's in town.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.840
Yeah, we're gonna give you a peek

04:37.840 --> 04:40.640
at what it takes to actually make a Snap package.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.200
Get a company on board with Snaps.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.760
We're at a SnapCraft summit right now.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.520
But we also have some breaking news

04:46.520 --> 04:48.280
12 minutes before the show went on the air.

04:48.280 --> 04:51.160
We'll talk about, we have big other community news

04:51.160 --> 04:55.200
we will discuss as well as a very frank discussion

04:55.200 --> 04:58.600
about Gnome, something I'm trying for a little bit.

04:58.600 --> 05:02.680
And we'll end it with my favorite terminal emulator

05:02.680 --> 05:03.520
of all time.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.360
Whoa.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.200
Yeah, yeah.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.640
Those are strong words, Chris.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.480
I know, I know.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.800
And Wes, if that's not enough, Noah's here too.

05:09.800 --> 05:10.960
Hello, brown bear.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.080
Hey, thanks for having me.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.560
Yeah, hey, thank you for running the board

05:13.560 --> 05:14.400
during the show.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.220
Yeah, no problem.

05:15.220 --> 05:16.060
I've actually, I've gotten two,

05:16.060 --> 05:18.020
we'll see if we, we'll see if I do a good job,

05:18.020 --> 05:20.080
but I got the bottom two of your show now.

05:20.080 --> 05:20.920
That's true, yeah, yeah.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.000
You are a machine.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.200
Yeah, you know what you ought to do?

05:23.200 --> 05:25.880
I don't know, man, we should pull someone in for Ask Noah

05:25.880 --> 05:27.520
because Ask Noah's coming up right after the show.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.720
We're doing that live from here too.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.560
Oh, yeah?

05:29.560 --> 05:30.880
One of us ought to crash his show.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.720
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

05:31.720 --> 05:32.540
Make it fair.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.320
Yeah, all right, well, let's also have the Mumble Room

05:35.320 --> 05:36.960
crash our show because every single episode

05:36.960 --> 05:39.280
of the Unplugged program is joined by our virtual lug,

05:39.280 --> 05:42.240
even when we're alive on this occasion in downtown Seattle.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.160
Hello, Mumble Room, time appropriate greetings.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.840
Well, hey, how's it going?

05:47.840 --> 05:48.680
Hello.

05:48.680 --> 05:51.240
Hello, hello, you know, the old saying,

05:51.240 --> 05:53.640
a watched Mumble Room doesn't boil.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.360
I have no eyes on the Mumble Room today,

05:55.360 --> 05:56.680
but I am told that we have great.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.640
They're stronger than ever.

05:57.640 --> 05:58.960
Yeah, we have a great turnout today.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.880
It just takes us being live at a canonical event.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.360
So what is this thing that we're at?

06:03.360 --> 06:05.840
These sprints is kind of a rough definition.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.400
Well, canonical describes it as something

06:08.400 --> 06:11.280
similar to old-style bar camps.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.520
And it's an agenda that's totally free-form.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.200
The attendees drive the agenda.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.120
And that kind of sounds like, oh, it must be free-floating.

06:20.120 --> 06:24.400
But holy hell if these guys don't hustle their asses off

06:24.400 --> 06:25.680
from actually 8 AM.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.960
Technically, it starts at 9 AM, but they technically

06:27.960 --> 06:30.040
start at AM, really, because they

06:30.040 --> 06:32.360
have a company breakfast where everybody starts networking

06:32.360 --> 06:34.880
and setting up expectations for the day at 8 AM.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.720
They start on the schedule at 9 AM,

06:37.720 --> 06:39.560
and they don't finish until 6 PM.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.640
And it is go, go, go, go, go the entire time.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.640
So they work with a bunch of different companies

06:43.640 --> 06:46.360
that have come in, in what they say from companies

06:46.360 --> 06:50.680
from different domains, from GUI to electron-based

06:50.680 --> 06:53.320
applications and all kinds of things in between,

06:53.320 --> 06:54.760
robotics included.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.520
They all bring these different companies

06:56.520 --> 06:59.960
in to work on a common set of frameworks and SNAP packages

06:59.960 --> 07:03.000
and so we are here to observe that.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.080
And this event is pretty different than the New York

07:06.080 --> 07:07.240
event.

07:07.240 --> 07:11.360
It is much, much more of a nose to the grindstone,

07:11.360 --> 07:13.520
work really hard, which I thought New York was,

07:13.520 --> 07:15.760
because it's not like they were screwing around in New York.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.440
But this is at a whole other level,

07:17.440 --> 07:18.520
because there's some big names here,

07:18.520 --> 07:19.640
which we'll talk about more in a little bit

07:19.640 --> 07:21.340
that we've chatted with.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.640
And so I think the pressure is really on to produce something.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.880
And there's areas here that are off limits to us,

07:28.880 --> 07:31.080
but they're still very accommodating.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.680
Right now, we're not in an area where

07:32.680 --> 07:33.880
there's any canonical folks around us,

07:33.880 --> 07:35.880
because everything they're talking about,

07:35.880 --> 07:37.320
they're being very careful because of the partners

07:37.320 --> 07:39.760
involved, not because they really have a preference,

07:39.760 --> 07:41.240
but their partners have a preference.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.920
Strategic partnerships, you have to do it the right way.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.240
Speaking of strategic partnerships,

07:46.240 --> 07:50.760
this will be impacting you and I on TechSnap in the near future.

07:50.760 --> 07:55.840
Just before we went on air, now it's like 15, 16 minutes ago,

07:55.840 --> 07:58.360
Jim Whitehurst, CEO of Red Hat, just

07:58.360 --> 08:02.440
tweeted and announced that Red Hat has acquired CoreOS

08:02.440 --> 08:04.040
as part of their Kubernetes strategy.

08:04.040 --> 08:04.800
Is that right?

08:04.800 --> 08:05.120
Yeah.

08:05.120 --> 08:05.880
Wow.

08:05.880 --> 08:06.720
Yeah.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.480
Isn't that huge?

08:07.480 --> 08:08.320
That is huge news.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.000
Yeah.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.120
So Red Hat is going to be acquiring CoreOS, expanding,

08:12.120 --> 08:15.160
this is the tweet, expanding their hashtag Kubernetes

08:15.160 --> 08:18.080
and hashtag containers leadership.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.320
That's not even really an overstatement there.

08:20.320 --> 08:25.200
Like, CoreOS is defining some of the core fundamentals

08:25.200 --> 08:26.400
about containerization.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.080
And they, I think, have sort of prevented

08:29.080 --> 08:31.520
the total Docker takeover of containerization

08:31.520 --> 08:32.520
to some degree.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.000
Yeah, I think it's also been really interesting,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.440
and it makes sense that Red Hat would be also interested,

08:36.440 --> 08:37.600
is that they've really been approaching it

08:37.600 --> 08:38.360
from the platform.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.860
You know, Ubuntu has their own Kubernetes sort of spin

08:40.860 --> 08:42.520
and set up, but there's a lot of people that just,

08:42.520 --> 08:44.860
they're rolling it themselves on whatever infrastructure.

08:44.860 --> 08:47.240
CoreOS provided a whole stack.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.600
You had a lot of tooling built in and a whole environment

08:49.600 --> 08:51.240
designed with that first.

08:51.240 --> 08:55.560
What about the, doesn't some of the cloud first initiative,

08:55.560 --> 08:58.120
what is that we talked about last week in TechSnap?

08:58.120 --> 09:00.040
Oh, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.040
Yeah, that's part of the subpart of the Linux Foundation.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.120
Isn't there some technology in that group that's from CoreOS?

09:06.120 --> 09:07.600
Yeah, the Rocket Runtime.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.880
Right, and now Red Hat owns that.

09:09.880 --> 09:10.680
They sure do.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.600
And so one of the core container technologies

09:13.600 --> 09:15.800
that the Linux Foundation is putting their weight behind

09:15.800 --> 09:17.240
is something that Red Hat owns.

09:17.240 --> 09:21.720
Yeah, it really gets them a piece of the market.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.360
Yeah, that sure does.

09:24.360 --> 09:27.440
And that just happened, I mean, the ramifications of that

09:27.440 --> 09:29.160
are going to be really big.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.720
We just did, to sort of perfect timing,

09:31.720 --> 09:35.800
go to TechSnap.Systems, and we just did an introduction

09:35.800 --> 09:36.680
to Kubernetes.

09:36.680 --> 09:37.840
Episode 353.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.440
Thank you.

09:38.440 --> 09:43.240
Yeah, episode 353, TechSnap.Systems slash 353,

09:43.240 --> 09:44.720
Too Many Containers.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.380
And it's an introduction to why are people even

09:47.380 --> 09:49.720
talking about Kubernetes, where did it come from,

09:49.720 --> 09:51.760
what is its open source heritage,

09:51.760 --> 09:54.240
and why is it getting so much credence and credibility

09:54.240 --> 09:55.560
right now in the marketplace?

09:55.560 --> 09:58.280
Why has it come from like zero to 100 miles per hour

09:58.280 --> 09:59.800
in the last year and a half?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.960
What is all that about, and what does it accomplish?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.960
That's explained in 353.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.280
And then if you listen to that, and then you

10:06.280 --> 10:08.600
hear this Red Hat news, it really

10:08.600 --> 10:10.040
puts it all in context.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.760
That's really good timing on that episode.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.480
I'm just saying.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.000
It sure is.

10:13.000 --> 10:13.920
I was kind of really glad we did that.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.320
I'm sure there's going to be a ton more as this develops.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.000
We'll actually see what changes.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.800
Yeah, man, I don't know, Noah.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.600
I know that you work a big part in virtualization.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.040
That's a huge part of what you do.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.240
Much with containers, are they at the alta speed?

10:27.240 --> 10:29.240
No, not really.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.160
And part of that is a lot of our businesses,

10:32.160 --> 10:34.700
we do subcontracting for some very large businesses

10:34.700 --> 10:38.440
like Walmart and Sport Clips and stuff like that.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.920
But the primary focus of our business

10:40.920 --> 10:44.320
is all in a lot of really small businesses, right?

10:44.320 --> 10:46.200
And so for there, if there is containerization,

10:46.200 --> 10:48.200
we're the ones that are doing the containering.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.360
But for the most part, we're just virtualizing that stuff.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.940
It's nice to have tools to manage all that when

10:51.940 --> 10:52.920
you've got a lot of them.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.520
When you get a chance, check your Discord chat.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.400
Got to scroll down to the bottom.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.800
Put like a thumbs up in there for me or something, you know?

10:57.800 --> 11:01.740
So Noah has, not only is he providing the connectivity,

11:01.740 --> 11:03.560
because he's, well, I guess technically the hotel's

11:03.560 --> 11:04.680
providing the connectivity.

11:04.680 --> 11:08.120
But the gear he brought, he has whittled this thing down

11:08.120 --> 11:11.840
to this incredible tiny package that he can throw in a bag.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.720
Yeah, you guys can't see it, but from our perspective,

11:13.720 --> 11:16.560
it's like a mostly empty table with a couple laptops

11:16.560 --> 11:19.400
and a magic machine making this whole thing possible.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.640
And by the way, the laptops are, right now,

11:21.640 --> 11:25.000
I'm simple-helped into a client's computer.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.840
So I'm not, the laptop has nothing to do with

11:26.840 --> 11:27.680
the actual show.

11:27.680 --> 11:28.500
Yeah, exactly.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.080
The laptops are just for our web browsers and our chats.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.640
Like there's nothing, the reason why I bring this up

11:33.640 --> 11:36.040
is years past when we've done live events

11:36.040 --> 11:39.060
for the last Linux Action Show or this show,

11:39.060 --> 11:41.160
like there's literally been events where we're building

11:41.160 --> 11:43.720
entire PCs hours before we go on air.

11:43.720 --> 11:47.000
And it's like this complicated, thick, multi-computer,

11:47.000 --> 11:50.940
three-laptop, huge sound mixer operation.

11:50.940 --> 11:53.600
You wouldn't even need two people to carry this setup.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.800
It's really remarkable.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.160
And it's all because this guy's been playing around

11:57.160 --> 11:58.120
with the actual radio.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.720
Turns out, he becomes a radio professional.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.360
All of a sudden, he gets the inside secrets,

12:01.360 --> 12:02.200
stuff they don't tell the podcast.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.560
I guess they already figured that out.

12:03.560 --> 12:04.880
Who would have thought?

12:04.880 --> 12:06.660
I guess it's something they've had to solve before.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.400
Speaking of something you have to solve,

12:08.400 --> 12:12.360
the cellular companies in this country have gone crazy.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.520
Solve that high bill, switch to Ting.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.720
Go to linux.ting.com, it's a smarter way to do mobile.

12:17.720 --> 12:21.480
Your average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.120
It's pay for what you use.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.920
A fair price for however much you talk,

12:24.920 --> 12:27.620
however much you text, and however much data you use.

12:27.620 --> 12:28.780
More on that in a moment.

12:28.780 --> 12:31.480
They have nationwide coverage, no contracts,

12:31.480 --> 12:34.780
it's $6 for your line, and then it's pay for what you use.

12:34.780 --> 12:36.760
Well, when it's $6 for the line,

12:36.760 --> 12:39.180
that enables cellular connectivity at a level

12:39.180 --> 12:41.040
that you don't normally think about

12:41.040 --> 12:42.800
how you can integrate cellular connectivity.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.360
And I'll give you an example.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.380
If you go to linux.ting.com, check out their store page.

12:47.380 --> 12:50.180
It's like shop, but first go to linux.ting.com.

12:50.180 --> 12:51.020
Support the show, right?

12:51.020 --> 12:51.860
You gotta go there.

12:51.860 --> 12:53.060
$9 SIM card.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.900
Sure enough, this maniac across the table from us,

12:57.900 --> 13:01.700
Noah's got a couple of these Ting SIM cards in his bag.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.720
Yeah, he's got them right on his belt, right?

13:03.720 --> 13:05.560
He just whips them out, ready to go.

13:05.560 --> 13:06.760
It's funny you say that, actually.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.440
He has them in his credit card holder.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.500
So he's got a wallet credit card holder

13:10.500 --> 13:14.280
with one credit card and multiple Ting SIM cards.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.640
It really is how he does it.

13:15.640 --> 13:18.040
And so a canonical employee comes out,

13:18.040 --> 13:18.960
and he's from London,

13:18.960 --> 13:21.520
and he doesn't have any cellular service.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.260
He's got one of these cell phones

13:23.260 --> 13:24.400
that he brought a cell phone with him,

13:24.400 --> 13:25.600
but he doesn't have a SIM card.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.800
And it was just a meet and greet

13:27.800 --> 13:29.680
the night before the whole event kicked off.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.160
And we're just sitting around drinking some Mac and Jacks,

13:32.160 --> 13:35.020
and he mentions, you know,

13:35.020 --> 13:36.540
I kind of wish they had Wi-Fi down here

13:36.540 --> 13:38.520
because this phone's dead without Wi-Fi

13:38.520 --> 13:39.920
because I don't have a SIM card in there.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.600
And Noah says, well, would you like one?

13:41.600 --> 13:43.340
And the guy looks at him like maybe Noah's

13:43.340 --> 13:44.600
like a salesman or something.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.880
And he's like, what are you offering?

13:45.880 --> 13:47.200
He's like, no, really, I just carry these around.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.040
And you know what?

13:48.040 --> 13:48.860
You don't even have to put it on.

13:48.860 --> 13:49.700
I'll just activate it.

13:49.700 --> 13:50.540
It's six bucks.

13:50.540 --> 13:51.380
What do I care?

13:51.380 --> 13:52.200
I'll just turn it off after the weekend.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.040
And he just gives,

13:53.040 --> 13:54.560
so sure enough, he gives the guy the SIM card,

13:54.560 --> 13:56.840
activates it on the spot, gets it all going.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.640
The guy comes back, pops it in.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.440
The only thing that slowed us down,

14:00.440 --> 14:02.480
the only hitch is that he didn't have

14:02.480 --> 14:03.800
one of those SIM remover pins.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.860
You mean those tiny little pins, yeah.

14:05.860 --> 14:07.760
But actually we realized we were at a hotel.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.200
You just go to the front desk, they'll probably have it.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.960
So that was a resolvable problem.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.720
But the story just relays the flexibility

14:14.720 --> 14:15.560
you have with Ting.

14:15.560 --> 14:16.600
What other network could you do?

14:16.600 --> 14:17.560
I don't think it'd be possible without it.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.440
And when it's your own device,

14:18.440 --> 14:19.440
when you're trying to troubleshoot something,

14:19.440 --> 14:20.880
it's that same kind of flexibility.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.320
If you wanted to buy a phone,

14:22.320 --> 14:23.680
they have a bunch of great devices.

14:23.680 --> 14:24.960
If you want to bring a device,

14:24.960 --> 14:26.920
they have CDMA and GSM networks.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.640
Just check their BYOD page.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.100
Now, I was mentioning the data.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.560
So they have a post right now.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.240
I've mentioned it on a couple of other shows,

14:33.240 --> 14:34.280
but I haven't mentioned it here.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.040
And I just want to draw some attention to it.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.880
They have a Hack Your Phone Plan blog post,

14:37.880 --> 14:39.640
which I love because they've essentially

14:39.640 --> 14:42.160
written up everything I do as a Ting user.

14:42.160 --> 14:45.160
And it's how to have a smartphone plan under $20.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.520
And that's really just because Uncle Sam's cut.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.920
Otherwise, it'd be like $16.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.700
I mentioned this on Linux Action News.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.240
I'm probably going to mention it one more time

14:52.240 --> 14:53.120
just because this is it.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.480
People ask me all the time,

14:54.480 --> 14:55.800
how do you have three Ting phones

14:55.800 --> 14:57.320
and you're paying like around 40 bucks a month?

14:57.320 --> 14:58.440
How are you doing that?

14:58.440 --> 14:59.520
Well, this is how I do it.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.240
That's the thing, they're even telling you.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.080
They want to help you out and help you save money.

15:03.080 --> 15:03.920
They're honey badger, dude.

15:03.920 --> 15:04.760
Exactly.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.820
So check it out, linux.ting.com.

15:06.820 --> 15:09.120
It is a better way to do mobile.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.200
Linux.ting.com, big thank you to Ting

15:11.200 --> 15:14.520
for sponsoring the unplugged program.

15:14.520 --> 15:18.080
So I was kind of planning to have somebody join us today

15:18.080 --> 15:20.400
for the show to talk about the SnapCraft event,

15:20.400 --> 15:23.440
just because why not get it from the horse's mouth.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.920
However, they're really busy.

15:25.920 --> 15:26.760
I was going to say,

15:26.760 --> 15:27.800
sounds like they've got a lot on their plate.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.440
And so these guys are so dedicated to this thing

15:30.440 --> 15:34.460
that we are scheduling our interviews after hours tonight.

15:34.460 --> 15:36.060
And we're going to be conducting interviews

15:36.060 --> 15:37.800
into the evening when they're done working

15:37.800 --> 15:40.120
because they got a lot of stuff they're trying to accomplish.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.960
And then the other thing, the other wrinkle

15:41.960 --> 15:43.180
is everybody's moving hotels around

15:43.180 --> 15:45.080
because of the connectivity issue.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.680
So that added a wrinkle to our plans.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.080
But I have been collecting audio snippets here and there

15:51.080 --> 15:53.920
and interviewing people, doing sidebar conversations.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.200
So we still have tons of stuff to talk about.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.480
And I want to back up just a little bit

15:57.480 --> 15:59.760
because we got an email into the show a few weeks ago

15:59.760 --> 16:01.080
and it said, you're talking about Flatpak,

16:01.080 --> 16:02.000
you're talking about snaps.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.240
I have no idea what you're talking about.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.840
And I think it's because we've gotten so far

16:05.840 --> 16:07.460
into universal packaging.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.200
We've gotten so far into this discussion now.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.020
There's some users out there

16:10.020 --> 16:11.640
who just haven't used them at all.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.340
Yeah, and so snaps are containerized software packages

16:14.340 --> 16:16.560
that are supposedly supposed to be really simple

16:16.560 --> 16:18.100
to create and install.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.860
And in modern terms, when you say simple to create,

16:20.860 --> 16:23.560
a lot of times what they're talking about is automated.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.480
So you can connect it to like a GitHub repo.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.400
And every time you upload a new build to GitHub,

16:28.400 --> 16:30.840
it also generates a snap package.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.000
Some CI server somewhere goes, does a new build,

16:33.000 --> 16:34.520
runs tests, publishes it out there.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.920
Yeah, and then the snap software on the client itself

16:37.920 --> 16:41.400
checks in every 24 hours and can auto update if set.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.360
And so it can be a way for like say Telegram

16:43.360 --> 16:45.320
to just constantly be publishing new versions of Telegram,

16:45.320 --> 16:47.560
auto update like you would a smartphone app only.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.000
And the risks of doing that are minimal

16:50.000 --> 16:51.320
because all of the dependencies,

16:51.320 --> 16:53.960
all of the changes are contained to the snap.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.920
The snap actually mounts as a file system

16:56.920 --> 16:59.360
and it's a runtime in there.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.040
And they have these portals out,

17:01.040 --> 17:02.680
I think that might be Flatpak terminology,

17:02.680 --> 17:04.520
but it's essentially to have these portals out

17:04.520 --> 17:06.640
that allow them to get access to certain things.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.480
I think that right there.

17:07.480 --> 17:08.640
So like as a normal user,

17:08.640 --> 17:10.400
I think right now I'd still be asking,

17:10.400 --> 17:11.420
all right, so I can package them.

17:11.420 --> 17:12.260
How is this different?

17:12.260 --> 17:13.600
I already make devs today.

17:13.600 --> 17:17.400
Why would I wanna try one of these new types of dependent,

17:17.400 --> 17:19.040
you know, new types of systems?

17:19.040 --> 17:20.520
Right, well, so let me tell you

17:20.520 --> 17:24.600
who some of the people I've talked to while we've been here

17:24.600 --> 17:27.120
to kind of put this in perspective.

17:27.120 --> 17:31.400
Because I think that kind of makes the difference

17:31.400 --> 17:33.960
because you gotta view it from their perspective.

17:33.960 --> 17:36.520
Was it last week or two weeks ago,

17:36.520 --> 17:37.800
we looked at MB and Plex.

17:37.800 --> 17:38.920
Yep.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.820
And I remember one of the things that I didn't expect

17:41.820 --> 17:43.000
when I started looking into,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.200
well, what does Plex do that is open source?

17:46.240 --> 17:48.640
And I discovered they have just this monstrous amount

17:48.640 --> 17:50.220
of open source projects.

17:50.220 --> 17:53.040
Their GitHub page is like three or four pages deep

17:53.040 --> 17:53.980
of open source projects.

17:53.980 --> 17:55.480
You just next, next, next, next, next,

17:55.480 --> 17:58.160
and there's still the full page of open source projects.

17:58.160 --> 18:03.040
And they target my QNAP.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.840
They target my Linux box.

18:04.840 --> 18:08.400
They target Windows, Macs, Android devices,

18:08.400 --> 18:09.880
all these different NAS devices.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.660
All the smart TVs in the world.

18:11.660 --> 18:13.760
Anything that can either be a Plex client

18:13.760 --> 18:16.640
or a Plex server, they're targeting it.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.000
So they actually have a team

18:19.000 --> 18:21.500
that is just packaging up software constantly.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.920
This is what this team does.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.120
And how do you suppose they do that?

18:25.120 --> 18:28.400
They do it with a series of scripts and systems.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.200
Different for each different platform.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.020
And every time it's time to add another platform,

18:33.020 --> 18:35.280
it's this whole, geez, can we do another batch of work?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.680
Can we do another platform?

18:36.680 --> 18:38.640
Can we deliver it on a regular basis?

18:38.640 --> 18:39.920
What are the esoteric issues?

18:39.920 --> 18:41.640
Because this is ARM version this,

18:41.640 --> 18:43.360
and this is an x86 version.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.160
And then, oh, by the way, on some of these systems,

18:46.160 --> 18:47.920
we're shipping something that opens up a web server

18:47.920 --> 18:50.120
and listens to incoming connections and has an API.

18:50.120 --> 18:51.700
Yeah, right, yeah, exactly.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.300
Which is candidate number one

18:53.300 --> 18:55.160
for containerized applications,

18:55.160 --> 18:57.160
is anything that's taking remote connections.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.420
So you can start to understand

18:58.420 --> 19:00.520
how a universal packaging format

19:00.520 --> 19:04.760
is extremely appealing to a company like Plex

19:04.760 --> 19:07.040
that is contemplating, well, geez,

19:07.040 --> 19:11.080
imagine if Chris's QNAP that runs Linux

19:11.080 --> 19:12.720
actually has Ubuntu on it,

19:12.720 --> 19:15.040
could just install Snap packages.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.040
And then they could write one package.

19:17.040 --> 19:20.840
And the thing about Snaps is you can have one Snap name,

19:20.840 --> 19:24.400
and you can have a 32-bit version, and a 64-bit version,

19:24.400 --> 19:27.760
and an ARM 32-bit version, and an ARM 64-bit version,

19:27.760 --> 19:29.320
all published to the Snap store.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.200
And when the user searches, Snap search Plex,

19:32.200 --> 19:33.040
they just get the one that matches their-

19:33.040 --> 19:35.900
Right, the client picks the architecture you're on, and-

19:35.900 --> 19:38.520
That also solves another huge problem for them.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.680
So Plex is one of the companies that's here.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.560
Slack is here this week.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.000
Folks from the Azure team are here this week.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.960
Electron, specifically the builder side of Electron,

19:48.960 --> 19:53.040
so maybe output to Snaps from Electron builder.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.000
Right from the tooling.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.920
.NET team is here, Skype team is here,

19:55.920 --> 19:58.240
and Visual Studio Code team, as well as several,

19:58.240 --> 19:59.840
I mean, those are just the companies

19:59.840 --> 20:01.960
that I can remember talking to.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.320
But there's several other companies here,

20:03.320 --> 20:05.160
probably another handful of companies that are here,

20:05.160 --> 20:07.520
all talking about how to solve these problems,

20:07.520 --> 20:09.160
or this is what it can't do for me yet,

20:09.160 --> 20:11.620
or this is what we'd like to see have done with it.

20:11.620 --> 20:15.120
And then Canonical, and the people here in these rooms,

20:15.120 --> 20:17.960
have to sit back and listen to all these people and go,

20:17.960 --> 20:19.200
yeah, that's something we could do,

20:19.200 --> 20:21.600
or, boy, I'm not sure if there's a use case,

20:21.600 --> 20:23.360
but maybe we can make a compelling argument.

20:23.360 --> 20:27.160
Their stance is, you give me a good enough reason, Plex,

20:27.160 --> 20:28.480
and maybe we'll add that,

20:28.480 --> 20:30.800
because we're in that phase right now.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.320
And that's an important step, right,

20:32.320 --> 20:34.480
is to solicit input from all the different parties

20:34.480 --> 20:35.760
that might use your tooling,

20:35.760 --> 20:37.920
so you can make the right design decisions.

20:37.920 --> 20:42.000
And I feel like it is a competitive advantage

20:42.000 --> 20:43.080
that Canonical has

20:43.080 --> 20:45.240
for specifically driving this kind of adoption.

20:45.240 --> 20:48.520
So I talked about what does it take to build a snap?

20:48.520 --> 20:53.520
Well, it takes more than having a technical idea

20:56.680 --> 20:58.960
and a way of building something.

20:58.960 --> 21:03.000
It takes a business calling another business

21:03.000 --> 21:04.860
and saying, you have something of value

21:04.860 --> 21:06.360
that a user base wants.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.440
We'd like to work with you,

21:07.440 --> 21:10.000
and we'd like to solve a problem that you're having.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.240
And that business goes,

21:11.240 --> 21:13.080
we would really like that problem solved.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.560
We will send resource X, Y, and Z to location B

21:16.560 --> 21:18.080
that you have chosen business,

21:18.080 --> 21:19.720
and the business is very good.

21:19.720 --> 21:24.480
We will send personnel A, B, C, and D to this location,

21:24.480 --> 21:25.760
and they will resource together.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.800
Right, the kind of really boring, everyday details

21:28.800 --> 21:31.760
that just needs to happen to make this make progress.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.200
One of the few things that bureaucracies

21:34.200 --> 21:36.280
are actually particularly good at

21:36.280 --> 21:37.840
is this particular thing.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.920
And when you're trying to get outreach and adoption

21:39.920 --> 21:42.360
from folks like Electron and Unity

21:42.360 --> 21:44.400
and Microsoft Azure,

21:44.400 --> 21:48.560
you need somebody that's picking up the phone

21:48.560 --> 21:50.200
and calling somebody else on the other end of that phone.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.360
And as awesome as open source volunteers

21:52.360 --> 21:53.480
and other things can be,

21:53.480 --> 21:55.180
sometimes you just need someone whose job it is

21:55.180 --> 21:57.680
explicitly to, nope, you'll be there these regular hours,

21:57.680 --> 21:58.500
and you're making the phone call.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.800
And you call it, well, you're on developer outreach.

22:00.800 --> 22:01.640
That's what you might call it.

22:01.640 --> 22:02.640
You're on developer outreach,

22:02.640 --> 22:04.360
and so you're gonna be on developer outreach.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.040
Well, what that means is it's your job

22:07.040 --> 22:09.720
to get snaps adopted.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.760
So go out there and find people that have problems to solve

22:12.760 --> 22:15.000
and start solving them so that way we get adoption.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.320
But somebody up ahead looking at the 50-foot level said,

22:19.320 --> 22:21.200
you need to drive adoption for this.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.600
How we're gonna drive adoption for this

22:22.600 --> 22:24.280
is by listening to what they need,

22:24.280 --> 22:25.800
adding it back into the product,

22:25.800 --> 22:27.720
and then working with them to solve the problems.

22:27.720 --> 22:31.200
So for Plex, that individual's gonna walk back

22:31.200 --> 22:33.240
pretty much knowing this is gonna work for us or not.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.200
Like, there is real, tangible value for Plex.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.400
We spoke with insiders.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.760
We've got commitments or not.

22:37.760 --> 22:38.680
We did an attempted,

22:38.680 --> 22:40.560
because the other thing is they're writing real code here too.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.520
It's so they're, if you got an idea, let's write it out.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.280
We can't go in the rooms.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.120
We can't talk about it.

22:47.120 --> 22:47.960
But at the same time,

22:47.960 --> 22:49.760
like they've invited us to their Slack discussion.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.800
So I'm seeing things that they're producing.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.720
Oh, interesting.

22:53.720 --> 22:57.040
And I can see things they're experimenting with

22:57.040 --> 22:58.560
that they might try adding.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.840
And you see it's, hey, you know, I'm just making,

23:00.840 --> 23:02.240
I'm not gonna give any specific examples,

23:02.240 --> 23:05.200
but Bob from Microsoft has this idea

23:05.200 --> 23:07.400
of how we could scale this this way.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.600
And I just did, I just, I just tried this.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.000
So check out this branch and give it a go

23:11.000 --> 23:11.880
and let me know what you think.

23:11.880 --> 23:12.880
And then you see somebody else go,

23:12.880 --> 23:13.920
well, yeah, that's a great idea,

23:13.920 --> 23:15.880
but what about this dependency over here?

23:15.880 --> 23:19.240
And it, to me, what it feels like a little bit is

23:21.440 --> 23:22.840
sort of putting it directly.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.920
You have a bunch of, you get a bunch of heavy hitters

23:27.920 --> 23:29.600
together in a room for a little while.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.120
And when they're out working in the remote field,

23:32.120 --> 23:34.080
they're good, they're producing stuff.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.880
They have control over their own,

23:35.880 --> 23:37.680
they are masters of their own domain.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.560
But sometimes for it to really hum,

23:40.560 --> 23:42.640
you gotta get all the heavy hitters in one room

23:42.640 --> 23:44.440
and you gotta connect them with partners

23:44.440 --> 23:46.320
that you've created these relationships with,

23:46.320 --> 23:47.920
and they gotta send their heavy hitters.

23:47.920 --> 23:52.440
And it, to me, what I've noticed now here

23:52.440 --> 23:55.680
and at NYC is it seems like you can get

23:55.680 --> 23:58.680
eight or nine months of work done in four or five days.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.000
Yeah, right, you have the right incentives

24:00.000 --> 24:02.400
and you have synchronous communication, right?

24:02.400 --> 24:03.640
All the people you want to talk with

24:03.640 --> 24:05.200
or who could knock down walls for you,

24:05.200 --> 24:06.240
they're right next to you.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.360
And they're going to breakfast with you,

24:07.360 --> 24:08.360
they're going to dinner with you,

24:08.360 --> 24:09.200
and they're at the lunch.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.720
That's the whole point of every one of your conversations.

24:10.720 --> 24:11.920
Yeah, and you know, they're breaking off

24:11.920 --> 24:14.040
into like beers on this night and stuff like that.

24:14.040 --> 24:14.880
And you know what happens?

24:14.880 --> 24:15.720
They talk about work.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.880
In an excited way, right?

24:16.880 --> 24:18.320
That's where you can really have those good ideas.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.480
That's what they all have in common, right?

24:19.480 --> 24:20.320
Is they have work.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.280
And so same with the folks that they're bringing in

24:22.280 --> 24:23.160
from out of town.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.800
I feel like part of this discussion too should be that

24:27.800 --> 24:29.960
a lot of these are companies or projects

24:29.960 --> 24:34.960
that haven't fit into the typical Linux dependency story.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.800
They're not part of Fedora.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.680
They're not part of the standard Debian distribution.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.600
They're really third party packages

24:40.600 --> 24:42.960
and we haven't had a consistent answer.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.040
And so that's why it's important that we have businesses

24:45.040 --> 24:48.200
and major Linux stakeholders who are pushing forward on this.

24:48.200 --> 24:52.880
Yeah, and it doesn't necessarily detract from AppImage

24:52.880 --> 24:57.200
or Flatpaks either because I think what it really is doing

24:57.200 --> 25:00.160
is it's just defining each of their marketplaces.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.480
Like this is going to be the area

25:01.480 --> 25:03.800
where snaps are especially competitive.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.840
But I was having this conversation with Noah,

25:06.840 --> 25:09.600
an area where I think Flatpaks are more competitive

25:09.600 --> 25:12.520
is when you want to subscribe to an entire repository

25:12.520 --> 25:14.360
of available possible software

25:14.360 --> 25:16.480
that you could install and update at any future point.

25:16.480 --> 25:20.400
And so as just an example, as Flatpaks,

25:20.400 --> 25:22.440
the number one competitor to snaps,

25:22.440 --> 25:24.720
essentially all of the development builds

25:24.720 --> 25:27.720
of GNOME software are available as Flatpaks.

25:27.720 --> 25:30.800
In the past, to get development builds of GNOME,

25:30.800 --> 25:33.520
like if you wanted to run the next version of GNOME,

25:33.520 --> 25:35.440
you would either have to run some distro

25:35.440 --> 25:37.200
that was way out on the edge,

25:37.200 --> 25:39.160
but even that would generally be delayed,

25:39.160 --> 25:41.560
or you could get these builder scripts

25:41.560 --> 25:46.560
that GNOME had created to build GNOME from source.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.240
Right, it's not just apt-get.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.480
It's like, okay, go figure out everything you need to know

25:50.480 --> 25:52.480
to be a GNOME developer just to try this out.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.880
And that's one thing when you're building an application,

25:54.880 --> 25:56.880
when you're building in a desktop environment

25:56.880 --> 25:59.400
and it's something that's getting frequently updated.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.320
Yes, multiple layers of dependencies,

26:01.320 --> 26:02.320
multiple applications.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.320
And then imagine if you're a GNOME developer

26:04.320 --> 26:06.120
and you just want to test against

26:06.120 --> 26:07.760
the latest version of gedit.

26:07.760 --> 26:08.720
What a nightmare.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.160
Because you don't need all of GNOME,

26:10.160 --> 26:11.520
but that's how you get it.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.360
So what they've done is they've broken out

26:13.360 --> 26:14.880
all the development packages of GNOME

26:14.880 --> 26:16.200
into individual Flatpaks.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.600
And so you subscribe to the Flatpak development repo

26:19.600 --> 26:23.240
and you can get nightly, you can get different betas,

26:23.240 --> 26:25.760
and I'm just giving kind of a rough example,

26:25.760 --> 26:28.600
but you can subscribe to the software that you want,

26:28.600 --> 26:30.240
and then from that repo you can install

26:30.240 --> 26:32.560
and choose Polari or gedit.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.440
You know, things, just individual components.

26:34.440 --> 26:35.280
Interesting.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.080
And they come down as Flatpaks, self-contained,

26:37.080 --> 26:39.360
they don't mess with your main GNOME desktop's GTK

26:39.360 --> 26:40.200
dependencies.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.160
It's all packaged, compartmentalized, contained for you.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.280
And I think that's something that Flatpak

26:44.280 --> 26:46.280
will continue to be more competitive at

26:46.280 --> 26:47.840
than Snap packages are.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.400
Because Snappaks are like delivering

26:49.400 --> 26:50.960
an individual application.

26:50.960 --> 26:54.920
And Flatpak is capable of delivering an entire repository

26:54.920 --> 26:57.840
that could show up as a browseable software menu

26:57.840 --> 26:59.800
in GNOME software.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.640
Whereas Snappaks show up as individual Snap entries.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.480
Right.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.800
I think it also kind of says, you know, this is still new

27:05.800 --> 27:07.600
and we're still really fleshing out

27:07.600 --> 27:09.080
what the full problem domain is.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.560
What problems need to be solved

27:10.560 --> 27:12.200
and in what approach will you take?

27:12.200 --> 27:14.300
Yeah, they're just, they're not sitting still.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.140
No, right?

27:15.140 --> 27:15.960
It's very exciting.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.360
They're like, well, we're going to figure out our stuff

27:18.360 --> 27:19.880
right now.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.960
So I think Bashful Fruit, you in the mobile room

27:21.960 --> 27:23.800
said that your team in engineering

27:23.800 --> 27:25.340
is looking at using Snaps.

27:25.340 --> 27:26.880
Tell me about that a little bit.

27:26.880 --> 27:31.880
Basically, here, I'm, yeah, hey, hey, how it goes.

27:32.860 --> 27:36.620
Okay, so we are basically looking to use Snaps

27:36.620 --> 27:39.140
to package up a bunch of our, I don't know,

27:39.140 --> 27:40.780
I'm going to call them enterprising apps.

27:40.780 --> 27:42.660
It has to do with remote access, things like that.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.820
But we have Linux agents, Linux clients,

27:44.820 --> 27:45.900
all that other kind of stuff.

27:45.900 --> 27:48.860
And on an offhand chance today in a meeting,

27:48.860 --> 27:50.060
I made a mention about them.

27:50.060 --> 27:51.420
And now all of a sudden I've got like two or three

27:51.420 --> 27:53.400
engineering teams coming over to talk to me about it

27:53.400 --> 27:54.240
because they didn't know.

27:54.240 --> 27:59.060
Now they kind of are peaked and interested and looking to go.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.700
You've been experimenting, snapping up a few things,

28:02.700 --> 28:04.380
haven't you?

28:04.380 --> 28:05.340
Yeah, I got a few things.

28:05.340 --> 28:09.340
I mean, up on the forums and stuff, I just finished Restic.

28:09.340 --> 28:11.940
Popey took over the MumbleSnap that I started

28:11.940 --> 28:14.740
mostly just because I got sidetracked.

28:14.740 --> 28:18.780
And other than that, yeah, and then we're also looking

28:18.780 --> 28:20.800
at how we're going to leverage it and Budgie as well.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.740
So lots going on.

28:24.740 --> 28:26.860
Yeah, the Mumble one could be particularly helpful for us

28:26.860 --> 28:28.900
because sometimes people get hung up on installing Mumble

28:28.900 --> 28:29.940
before they can join the show.

28:29.940 --> 28:31.580
I mean, some people have problems with that.

28:31.580 --> 28:33.740
So being able to just say, install this,

28:33.740 --> 28:35.240
snap install Mumble.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.940
Oh, that'd be great.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.440
I literally installed it right before the show.

28:40.660 --> 28:43.500
So yeah, you've had some experimentation.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.460
So you feel like you're comfortable recommending it

28:45.460 --> 28:47.420
to your place of work, huh?

28:47.420 --> 28:48.260
Yep, definitely.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.400
I don't see any problems with it.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.060
Any of the little points to be ironed out,

28:53.060 --> 28:54.620
they're already on their way.

28:54.620 --> 28:56.940
So I mean, that's exactly why they're doing this

28:56.940 --> 28:57.980
get together, so.

28:59.260 --> 29:00.940
The main thing for me is theming,

29:00.940 --> 29:02.460
but they're working on that.

29:02.460 --> 29:03.300
Yeah, there's some-

29:03.300 --> 29:05.780
Some of the server side stuff too, so.

29:07.500 --> 29:10.140
I know that there's a sort of a big push on that right now.

29:10.140 --> 29:12.420
I believe I've seen some threads going on about it

29:12.420 --> 29:15.020
and they're looking at how they're going to sort of make

29:15.020 --> 29:15.900
that look and work.

29:15.900 --> 29:18.260
And I'd even seen another thread where they're talking

29:18.260 --> 29:21.420
about being able to distribute themes as a snap.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.380
So don't like 100% quote me on that,

29:23.380 --> 29:25.540
but I've seen some talk about that as well.

29:26.900 --> 29:29.300
But the fix is coming.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.740
Hey, look at that, Dan from elementary says

29:30.740 --> 29:32.460
he's using the mumble snap too.

29:32.460 --> 29:33.540
Nice.

29:33.540 --> 29:35.180
Dan actually has a little news from the project

29:35.180 --> 29:36.580
I think we're going to talk about here in just a moment.

29:36.580 --> 29:38.540
So Dan, get your medium post ready.

29:38.540 --> 29:40.820
We'll bring that up here in just a couple of minutes.

29:40.820 --> 29:41.660
I don't know.

29:41.660 --> 29:42.700
Do you have anything else you think we should mention

29:42.700 --> 29:43.540
about the event?

29:43.540 --> 29:45.580
I think I'll probably play some of the audio we have

29:45.580 --> 29:47.820
next week once we've had a chance to just review everything.

29:47.820 --> 29:48.660
Yeah.

29:48.660 --> 29:50.860
Initial impressions as our first.

29:50.860 --> 29:53.660
My initial impressions, I guess would be

29:53.660 --> 29:57.480
that it's been interesting to get insight

29:57.480 --> 30:00.300
into the culture and community and stuff like that.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.180
And being able to have some of the discussions,

30:02.180 --> 30:03.860
even though we can't talk about them on air,

30:03.860 --> 30:08.100
even though we can't record them or anything like that,

30:08.100 --> 30:11.940
it informs our opinion and it makes us valuable

30:11.940 --> 30:14.500
as a contact network because we're the only broadcasters

30:14.500 --> 30:15.340
that are here.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.180
That's true.

30:16.180 --> 30:18.220
There are so many people that have this kind of insight.

30:18.220 --> 30:19.380
We're lucky it's in our neck of the woods.

30:19.380 --> 30:20.220
Yeah.

30:20.220 --> 30:22.700
Well, you know, I think they recognize

30:22.700 --> 30:25.060
that Jupiter Broadcasting is more important than that

30:25.060 --> 30:26.700
because they brought us all the way up to New York

30:26.700 --> 30:27.540
for that too, right?

30:27.540 --> 30:28.360
Yeah, yeah.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.200
In the same way.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.040
Well, we brought ourselves out there,

30:30.040 --> 30:30.880
but we were invited.

30:30.880 --> 30:31.700
Invited, right.

30:31.700 --> 30:33.460
So from the perspective of when people are looking

30:33.460 --> 30:34.900
for tech news, and this is something I talked about

30:34.900 --> 30:37.580
on our Snow Show last week, when people look for tech news,

30:37.580 --> 30:39.700
you want people that have informed opinions,

30:39.700 --> 30:41.980
people that are inside of the things

30:41.980 --> 30:43.700
that they are talking about.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.260
Man, I can't make the case any better.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.060
I mean, we're sitting here with the Ubuntu guys

30:47.060 --> 30:49.260
at the same rally where they're figuring this stuff out.

30:49.260 --> 30:50.460
I don't want to give the impression though

30:50.460 --> 30:51.460
that we're also getting like,

30:51.460 --> 30:52.660
we're not getting the red carpet either.

30:52.660 --> 30:53.480
Like we're working it.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.140
Like we have to work for what we're getting too,

30:55.140 --> 30:56.220
which is fair, fair enough.

30:56.220 --> 30:57.260
I mean, they're here doing their thing.

30:57.260 --> 30:58.100
We're here doing our thing.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.060
That's how it should be really.

30:59.060 --> 30:59.900
Yeah.

30:59.900 --> 31:00.720
But yeah.

31:00.720 --> 31:01.740
Okay, Mumbler, I thought I heard somebody speaking.

31:01.740 --> 31:03.100
Does anybody want to jump in before we,

31:03.100 --> 31:05.320
yeah, last bit of, yeah, go ahead.

31:06.180 --> 31:10.340
I wanted actually to say that even though I can enjoy

31:10.340 --> 31:12.020
that Canonical is doing all of this,

31:12.020 --> 31:14.140
I just wish that they actually were,

31:14.140 --> 31:17.980
had a more concerted developer documentation set.

31:17.980 --> 31:20.700
And when they decide to build something,

31:20.700 --> 31:22.700
to build that something actually maintain it.

31:22.700 --> 31:27.260
As a developer, being a company or being, you know,

31:27.260 --> 31:28.920
just an open source developer,

31:28.920 --> 31:31.140
I want to be able to go to Canonical's page

31:31.140 --> 31:34.340
or Ubuntu's page and go to developer docs.

31:34.340 --> 31:36.720
Click there, click there, learn about that stuff

31:36.720 --> 31:40.020
that there are the recommended tools

31:40.020 --> 31:43.320
and be able to build, not need to attend an event

31:43.320 --> 31:45.020
to figure how the things work.

31:45.020 --> 31:47.380
I understand that they're doing research

31:47.380 --> 31:50.320
and that's what they want to get out of that type of event

31:50.320 --> 31:52.300
and so that they can build it better.

31:52.300 --> 31:55.320
But you know, if they just actually do that part well,

31:55.320 --> 31:57.640
I don't think we wouldn't even be spending that much

31:57.640 --> 31:58.900
discussing these events.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.540
Every company does these events.

32:00.540 --> 32:03.300
I'm not taking this as a wild thing.

32:03.300 --> 32:04.260
I think I disagree.

32:04.260 --> 32:06.500
So I would say, first of all,

32:06.500 --> 32:11.460
I wouldn't necessarily undersell docs.snapcraft.io.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.140
I would check out docs.snapcraft.io

32:13.140 --> 32:14.740
because it's pretty good documentation.

32:14.740 --> 32:17.660
But the thing is, and somebody who's had clients,

32:17.660 --> 32:20.140
it was an IT relationship, but I can tell you,

32:20.140 --> 32:22.620
there are certain companies because of their status,

32:22.620 --> 32:23.820
because of their workload,

32:23.820 --> 32:25.900
because of their funding structure.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.840
There is a trillion different reasons,

32:27.840 --> 32:30.100
but I can tell you for sure that some of them

32:30.100 --> 32:32.340
just have to have, by the way, Noah's got a call.

32:32.340 --> 32:34.260
That's Noah's emergency Batline phone right there

32:34.260 --> 32:35.740
if you heard that.

32:35.740 --> 32:37.500
I can tell you there is some companies

32:37.500 --> 32:39.140
that really have to have their handheld

32:39.140 --> 32:41.820
and I don't want to sit here in Microsoft Bash,

32:41.820 --> 32:43.780
but sometimes if you want to get Microsoft

32:43.780 --> 32:45.100
to play ball a little bit,

32:45.100 --> 32:47.940
you know, it just seems to be the way it goes.

32:47.940 --> 32:49.780
I agree though, it would be great

32:49.780 --> 32:50.900
if everybody could be involved

32:50.900 --> 32:52.540
or if they could live stream this,

32:52.540 --> 32:53.700
that would be really useful.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.260
Look, no, not even asking for that.

32:55.260 --> 32:56.100
That would even, you know,

32:56.100 --> 32:58.580
if you just kind of get a...

32:58.580 --> 33:00.340
This is one of the things that I've pointed out

33:00.340 --> 33:02.820
multiple times that I believe that elementary

33:02.820 --> 33:04.740
has done better than any other distro.

33:04.740 --> 33:06.620
It has a set of tools that you can follow.

33:06.620 --> 33:08.940
Like I'm not particularly a huge fan

33:08.940 --> 33:10.700
of everything elementary does,

33:10.700 --> 33:12.500
but this is the one thing done right.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.140
You can look at it and know,

33:14.140 --> 33:15.940
okay, this is what I need to pick up

33:15.940 --> 33:17.420
to build for elementary.

33:17.420 --> 33:19.660
And you go to Windows, Windows says,

33:19.660 --> 33:21.500
C-sharp is the way to develop Windows.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.340
Have you checked out that?

33:22.340 --> 33:23.180
Apple says Swift.

33:23.180 --> 33:24.100
I mean, I'm looking at it right now.

33:24.100 --> 33:24.940
No, hold on a second.

33:24.940 --> 33:26.580
First of all, I don't know that Windows,

33:26.580 --> 33:28.140
I don't know that Windows is...

33:28.140 --> 33:29.300
I don't know that you can compare the two.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.580
Can you really compare Windows with Canonical?

33:31.580 --> 33:32.420
No.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.460
I mean, I would say just check out docs.snopcraft.io.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.380
I'm not here to defend them.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.100
I'm not here to say that one is better

33:37.100 --> 33:38.820
or how they do it is better.

33:38.820 --> 33:41.180
From my perspective, this is sort of

33:41.180 --> 33:43.780
the way the business industry works.

33:43.780 --> 33:46.980
And they're not doing it because it's not documented.

33:46.980 --> 33:48.700
Because, and all again, all of this,

33:48.700 --> 33:51.060
even like the YAML files and all of that

33:51.060 --> 33:53.700
is pretty well documented.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.380
So I feel like it's more about

33:56.380 --> 33:57.800
connecting with certain companies

33:57.800 --> 33:59.220
that need their hands held,

33:59.220 --> 34:00.520
that need that one-on-one

34:00.520 --> 34:02.980
or have a special pony problem.

34:02.980 --> 34:05.380
And then the reason we're here

34:05.380 --> 34:07.660
is to relay that that's what this is about.

34:07.660 --> 34:10.100
There's a motivation from Canonical's standpoint

34:10.100 --> 34:11.780
to have Jupyter Broadcasting here.

34:11.780 --> 34:14.140
And it's not because they're big fans of Linux Unplugged.

34:14.140 --> 34:14.980
I mean, maybe it is.

34:14.980 --> 34:17.540
But I think it's probably because they want somebody

34:17.540 --> 34:20.820
relaying to the community what happens here.

34:20.820 --> 34:23.980
And what they want, and they're not telling us

34:23.980 --> 34:24.860
what to say, but...

34:24.860 --> 34:25.700
Talking about it, right?

34:25.700 --> 34:27.180
But Canonical wants to be shown

34:27.180 --> 34:28.620
that they're building these things.

34:28.620 --> 34:29.660
They're building these things.

34:29.660 --> 34:31.140
And this is what's happening in these events.

34:31.140 --> 34:33.380
So I think, because I think what the narrative could be

34:33.380 --> 34:34.980
if this wasn't, if we weren't here

34:34.980 --> 34:38.060
and there wasn't a third party sort of arbiter eyes

34:38.060 --> 34:39.300
on these, somebody could say,

34:39.300 --> 34:40.560
well, they're having these secret meetings

34:40.560 --> 34:41.620
with these secret companies.

34:41.620 --> 34:43.980
And they're not even saying what companies are there.

34:43.980 --> 34:45.460
They're not even disclosing any of this.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.460
They're just doing all these things behind the scenes

34:47.460 --> 34:48.660
and pulling the Canonical strings

34:48.660 --> 34:50.460
so that way Mark Shalloworth can orchestrate

34:50.460 --> 34:52.500
his master takeover over the Linux landscape

34:52.500 --> 34:55.700
because Mark Shalloworth wants to dominate Linux via snaps.

34:55.700 --> 34:59.200
And that is the narrative that gets perpetuated

34:59.200 --> 35:00.540
when they do these kinds of events.

35:00.540 --> 35:02.300
I think they've gotten hip to that.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.500
And they realize that they have to have

35:04.500 --> 35:05.740
some eyes on it.

35:05.740 --> 35:08.220
They have to have somebody watching, otherwise-

35:08.220 --> 35:09.140
That don't have an agenda.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.380
Yeah, otherwise it just gets spun like crazy.

35:11.380 --> 35:15.260
I mean, I can tell you that if this was like a,

35:15.260 --> 35:16.740
if this was like one of those,

35:16.740 --> 35:17.660
we'll have them come in here

35:17.660 --> 35:19.880
and we'll just have them just tell people what we're doing.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.340
And then we don't have to,

35:21.340 --> 35:22.680
you know, we'll just, this will all be taken care of.

35:22.680 --> 35:23.520
We wouldn't start the show

35:23.520 --> 35:25.540
with a Red Hat story buying out CoreOS

35:25.540 --> 35:27.780
because that's something that is directly goes

35:27.780 --> 35:29.100
against what Canonical's interests are

35:29.100 --> 35:31.000
in the enterprise and server market.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.500
I think it's, so they understand

35:32.500 --> 35:33.340
that we don't really have any,

35:33.340 --> 35:34.860
we don't have a particular skin in the game,

35:34.860 --> 35:36.960
but they still want people to know what happened.

35:36.960 --> 35:37.800
Right.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.220
And because otherwise it does come across as some,

35:40.220 --> 35:42.460
like it comes across as if Mark Shuttleworth

35:42.460 --> 35:44.340
is pulling some sort of puppet string.

35:44.340 --> 35:45.180
Yeah, exactly.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.020
He's not even here.

35:46.020 --> 35:46.840
He wants snaps to still feel like, you know,

35:46.840 --> 35:49.460
it's a community effort by an open source company.

35:49.460 --> 35:50.300
Yeah.

35:50.300 --> 35:51.300
Even if you don't get to see every last thing that-

35:51.300 --> 35:53.420
Right, I mean, the people that are working on it

35:53.420 --> 35:54.780
that are interfacing with these companies,

35:54.780 --> 35:59.780
like the Azure team and Plex are Wimby and Popey.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.940
And the people from Canonical, you've heard of before,

36:02.940 --> 36:04.340
they're just doing it in a setting

36:04.340 --> 36:07.220
that's sort of like common ground.

36:07.220 --> 36:09.140
Yeah, and I would be great, like,

36:09.140 --> 36:10.700
if you could have like pop-up, you know,

36:10.700 --> 36:13.540
how about this as an idea, like pop-up snap events

36:13.540 --> 36:16.620
where you need to different locations at a lug meetup

36:16.620 --> 36:20.840
or at a Linux event, maybe there's other ways to do this.

36:22.260 --> 36:25.620
But I don't think with, I think, I guess what I get back to

36:25.620 --> 36:29.700
is if AppImage had been doing this for every six months

36:29.700 --> 36:31.460
for the last couple of years,

36:31.460 --> 36:33.260
they'd probably be way ahead.

36:33.260 --> 36:37.220
If Flatpaks had, if Red Hat was cutting,

36:37.220 --> 36:40.740
I mean, $50,000 checks every six months,

36:40.740 --> 36:43.340
I mean, New York was way more than $50,000 probably.

36:43.340 --> 36:46.500
But this, you know, this is probably a 50, 25,

36:46.500 --> 36:49.100
you're paying all these people, you got hotel rooms,

36:49.100 --> 36:52.500
you got dinner, lunch, drinks for everybody for a whole week.

36:52.500 --> 36:53.820
It really shows an investment by the company.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.780
You're flying these people out from the UK,

36:55.780 --> 36:56.740
I mean, the majority of the staff

36:56.740 --> 36:58.180
are all coming from London and other places

36:58.180 --> 37:00.320
all over the world, they're not coming from the States.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.060
Some of them are, but most of them aren't.

37:02.060 --> 37:05.680
And that is a huge financial investment.

37:05.680 --> 37:08.040
I gotta believe that if Flatpaks did that,

37:08.040 --> 37:12.020
if another packaging format were doing that,

37:12.020 --> 37:13.380
it could do that, they would be doing that,

37:13.380 --> 37:14.340
because this is what it takes.

37:14.340 --> 37:16.380
It takes a sort of industry collaboration

37:16.380 --> 37:18.640
because you're reaching out not to other,

37:19.660 --> 37:20.800
you're not reaching out to businesses

37:20.800 --> 37:22.060
that have been making an open source product

37:22.060 --> 37:23.360
for the last 15 years, right?

37:23.360 --> 37:25.700
You're not trying to get crossover to package as a snap,

37:25.700 --> 37:27.180
because eventually they're gonna see the light

37:27.180 --> 37:28.020
because they're smart folks

37:28.020 --> 37:29.380
and they work in the open source community.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.940
You're reaching out to companies

37:30.940 --> 37:32.780
that have never done this shit before.

37:32.780 --> 37:35.140
And if I'm gonna pivot the packaging of my product,

37:35.140 --> 37:37.100
I wanna know there's someone I can call on the other side

37:37.100 --> 37:38.460
and be like, look, we need to get this fixed,

37:38.460 --> 37:39.300
you said you would help us.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.100
You want me to retask this 25-member team

37:42.100 --> 37:44.500
to package in your package format?

37:44.500 --> 37:46.500
How is this not a play for you to take over Lyft?

37:46.500 --> 37:48.420
You gotta make it as easy for them as possible.

37:48.420 --> 37:49.780
What problem are you solving for me

37:49.780 --> 37:51.620
to even wanna consider this, right?

37:51.620 --> 37:53.700
But there is also a comfort level in,

37:53.700 --> 37:55.580
oh, I can call up this canonical company

37:55.580 --> 37:57.180
and I can tell them they've gotta fix this problem

37:57.180 --> 38:00.740
or else we're out, so I see both sides of it.

38:00.740 --> 38:03.340
I do see both sides of it and I see why they have us here.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.540
I see what, I know what their motivation is.

38:05.540 --> 38:07.580
They want to make sure it's sort of understood

38:07.580 --> 38:09.440
what they're trying to do.

38:09.440 --> 38:10.280
It's a complicated thing.

38:10.280 --> 38:11.120
It really is.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.300
And we're here to observe like flies on the wall, Wes,

38:13.300 --> 38:15.260
searching out bandwidth at every opportunity.

38:15.260 --> 38:16.820
Linux-based flies, let's be clear.

38:16.820 --> 38:19.300
Yeah, hey, you know, there's one nice thing

38:19.300 --> 38:20.420
about coming to these kind of events

38:20.420 --> 38:24.780
is just about everybody, it's like a 95% Linux operation.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.660
You got a few people coming in from different companies,

38:26.660 --> 38:27.940
but even the people that are coming in

38:27.940 --> 38:31.380
from different companies, a lot of them are running Linux.

38:31.380 --> 38:32.220
Nice. Yeah.

38:32.220 --> 38:34.300
And it's a lot of MacBooks running Linux.

38:34.300 --> 38:35.580
It's a lot of MacBooks running Linux.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.500
Okay, I can take that.

38:37.500 --> 38:38.860
I saw some Unity bars. You walk around,

38:38.860 --> 38:39.700
you walk around, you see the front of it

38:39.700 --> 38:41.660
and it's like, oh man, and then you start walking around

38:41.660 --> 38:43.340
behind them, start looking over their shoulder

38:43.340 --> 38:45.580
and they're like, ah, those are all Mac.

38:45.580 --> 38:46.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.

38:46.820 --> 38:49.940
It's all Unity. You wanna see a tricked out setup.

38:49.940 --> 38:51.060
Oh, I know what you're gonna say.

38:51.060 --> 38:53.820
Wimpy's XPS 15 with Ubuntu MATE, he's got.

38:53.820 --> 38:54.980
Is that Ubuntu MATE? Yeah.

38:54.980 --> 38:57.060
Or is it Windows? No, no. Or is it Mac?

38:57.060 --> 38:57.900
Or, or, ah.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.140
He's got, he's got. I don't even know.

38:59.140 --> 39:00.780
He's got like, he's got all these different desktops

39:00.780 --> 39:02.020
set up with different stuff.

39:02.020 --> 39:03.380
Plus he's got virtual machines

39:03.380 --> 39:05.620
and he's got experimental high DPI builds

39:05.620 --> 39:08.420
where like stuff is dialed in on this version of MATE

39:08.420 --> 39:09.980
that is like, he's getting ready to, you know,

39:09.980 --> 39:11.020
put out there. Yep.

39:11.020 --> 39:15.140
Ooh, I had not seen it in person and it is.

39:15.140 --> 39:16.900
All the new hotness right there.

39:16.900 --> 39:19.620
It looks amazing.

39:19.620 --> 39:21.660
I think he's switching people to it just by.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.020
Just by using it, being around it.

39:23.020 --> 39:23.980
Yeah, Popey's switching.

39:23.980 --> 39:25.260
Yeah, Popey's like, I'm gonna give it,

39:25.260 --> 39:26.340
I'm gonna give it a go.

39:26.340 --> 39:27.620
Yeah, so, yeah.

39:27.620 --> 39:29.740
I actually, I actually switched, not to MATE.

39:29.740 --> 39:30.740
I switched to something completely,

39:30.740 --> 39:33.860
I got rid of, I got rid of my desktops.

39:33.860 --> 39:35.540
I won't go, I'm gonna save it for the show,

39:35.540 --> 39:37.100
but here, I'll give you a little hint.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.020
If you can, you can see right there.

39:39.020 --> 39:39.860
You see that right there?

39:39.860 --> 39:43.540
Oh, we're gonna, we're gonna, I gotta do an ad.

39:43.540 --> 39:44.380
We gotta do an ad, then we're gonna.

39:44.380 --> 39:45.200
You're right, yep.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.040
I just got distracted.

39:46.040 --> 39:46.860
All right, so let me tell you about DigitalOcean

39:46.860 --> 39:47.700
and then we'll get back there.

39:47.700 --> 39:49.380
DigitalOcean.com, I didn't forget.

39:49.380 --> 39:50.660
I just meant, I was just getting there.

39:50.660 --> 39:54.660
DigitalOcean.com, go over there and sign up.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.420
You know what, in fact, why don't,

39:56.420 --> 39:57.740
I'm gonna make this up right now.

39:57.740 --> 39:58.980
Let's just use a promo code.

39:58.980 --> 40:00.340
Let's just say it's DO Unplugged.

40:00.340 --> 40:02.460
Let's just say that, DO Unplugged, one word.

40:02.460 --> 40:04.020
You apply it to your account, you get a $10 credit.

40:04.020 --> 40:05.760
Let's just say, once you have a $10 credit,

40:05.760 --> 40:07.580
you can run the $5 rig two months for free.

40:07.580 --> 40:08.420
Let's just say that.

40:08.420 --> 40:09.980
And then maybe you discover

40:09.980 --> 40:11.260
that this machine's incredibly powerful

40:11.260 --> 40:12.700
and you didn't know Linux could do that much

40:12.700 --> 40:13.660
for $5 a month.

40:13.660 --> 40:14.580
And then say you get hooked,

40:14.580 --> 40:15.540
you wanna deploy another machine.

40:15.540 --> 40:16.740
Maybe you got an application you wanna deploy.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.180
You can get deployed, I mean,

40:18.180 --> 40:19.300
you got deployments for days.

40:19.300 --> 40:20.900
Deployments for days.

40:20.900 --> 40:22.220
You know, and if you wanna go play

40:22.220 --> 40:24.740
with some of that fancy new snap technology,

40:24.740 --> 40:26.940
go spin up an Ubuntu machine on DO, perfect.

40:26.940 --> 40:28.340
You can set up an automated build system

40:28.340 --> 40:29.580
or you can just play with some snaps.

40:29.580 --> 40:30.420
Boy, can you.

40:30.420 --> 40:31.900
The nice thing about DigitalOcean too

40:31.900 --> 40:33.060
is you just don't have to deal

40:33.060 --> 40:34.980
with any of those complex pricing structures.

40:34.980 --> 40:35.820
It's just simple.

40:35.820 --> 40:36.660
You always know what you get.

40:36.660 --> 40:38.980
It's predictable, it's scalable, it's reliable.

40:38.980 --> 40:41.240
99.99% uptime.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.860
You have an SLA for all services.

40:42.860 --> 40:44.980
You can deploy an entire application stack.

40:44.980 --> 40:49.420
Like the base Linux system, the software,

40:49.420 --> 40:53.460
like it's a GitLab, everything in one click.

40:53.460 --> 40:55.340
Or you can deploy the base Ubuntu system

40:55.340 --> 40:58.020
or base CoreOS system or CentOS system

40:58.020 --> 40:59.420
and then build on top of that.

40:59.420 --> 41:02.780
You get SSH access in, you get HTML5 console access.

41:02.780 --> 41:03.980
You can just get started faster.

41:03.980 --> 41:05.300
If there's some new open source project

41:05.300 --> 41:06.700
you wanna try out, see if it's worth your time.

41:06.700 --> 41:07.900
You don't wanna muck up your system.

41:07.900 --> 41:08.940
Oh, it's the best for that.

41:08.940 --> 41:10.260
So what I do, I go to this.

41:10.260 --> 41:13.500
And then the thing is, is it's so fast.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.580
It has easily increaseable storage.

41:15.580 --> 41:17.460
It has eight data centers all over the world.

41:17.460 --> 41:19.000
DigitalOcean's got data centers for days,

41:19.000 --> 41:20.060
data centers for days.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.500
So I just leave it in production.

41:22.500 --> 41:23.340
I just think it's perfectly good.

41:23.340 --> 41:24.860
And they've got all the little things

41:24.860 --> 41:26.380
you might want to make that work too.

41:26.380 --> 41:28.900
Firewalls, monitoring, built right in.

41:28.900 --> 41:30.780
Yep, yep, easy, easy peasy.

41:30.780 --> 41:32.400
In fact, it's really easy now

41:32.400 --> 41:35.700
with their new DigitalOcean spaces to do automated backups.

41:35.700 --> 41:38.680
If you check out their community page,

41:38.680 --> 41:41.320
they posted on my birthday a blog,

41:41.320 --> 41:43.660
or no, I guess a tutorial, because blog

41:43.660 --> 41:44.500
would be underselling it.

41:44.500 --> 41:48.140
Because these are well-crafted, well-written tutorials.

41:48.140 --> 41:49.820
Beautifully done, elegant tutorials.

41:49.820 --> 41:51.420
Johnny Ive white room tutorials.

41:51.420 --> 41:52.260
And they're great.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.740
And so this is one about doing automated backups

41:54.740 --> 41:56.100
with DigitalOcean spaces.

41:56.100 --> 41:57.100
Go there, try it out.

41:57.100 --> 42:00.860
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

42:00.860 --> 42:02.640
I wouldn't be in this hotel ballroom

42:02.640 --> 42:03.660
if it wasn't for DigitalOcean.

42:03.660 --> 42:06.020
So thanks DigitalOcean, and thanks to you guys

42:06.020 --> 42:06.860
for sponsoring the show.

42:06.860 --> 42:10.020
DigitalOcean.com.

42:10.020 --> 42:12.420
Linux boot, let Linux do it, is their tagline.

42:12.420 --> 42:14.700
And that should be everyone's tagline.

42:14.700 --> 42:15.820
Just let Linux do it.

42:15.820 --> 42:17.100
That should be Ask Noah's tagline.

42:17.100 --> 42:18.520
Yeah, right, so I think the big deal here

42:18.520 --> 42:21.340
is that from the user perspective, UEFI works okay.

42:21.340 --> 42:24.460
But it's a giant, bigger than the kernel,

42:24.460 --> 42:25.780
inscrutable code base.

42:25.780 --> 42:27.260
It's a big mess.

42:27.260 --> 42:29.940
And we already have a code base that we know and love.

42:29.940 --> 42:30.780
And it's called Linux.

42:30.780 --> 42:32.980
Yeah, and it does a great job, it does.

42:32.980 --> 42:36.540
And so they write, are you tired, like this,

42:36.540 --> 42:38.560
are you tired of reinventing the wheel

42:38.560 --> 42:41.620
by implementing drivers for firmware again and again?

42:41.620 --> 42:43.660
Not with Linux boot.

42:43.660 --> 42:44.500
To the rescue.

42:44.500 --> 42:47.380
Yeah, I know, just set it and forget it.

42:47.380 --> 42:50.100
So Linux boot is a firmware for modern servers

42:50.100 --> 42:52.580
that replaces specific firmware functionality,

42:52.580 --> 42:56.840
like UEFI DXE phase, with a Linux kernel and a runtime.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.680
They say it will improve boot reliability

42:58.680 --> 43:01.540
by replacing the lightly tested firmware in drivers,

43:01.540 --> 43:04.260
improves boot time by just removing unnecessary code,

43:04.260 --> 43:07.740
makes it 20 times faster to boot,

43:07.740 --> 43:09.020
which is actually kind of nice on a server,

43:09.020 --> 43:11.380
especially when you're trying to get up in an outage.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.860
And they say it's a proven approach

43:12.860 --> 43:14.860
for almost 20 years in military, consumer electronics,

43:14.860 --> 43:16.500
and supercomputing systems,

43:16.500 --> 43:18.540
whenever reliability and performance are paramount.

43:18.540 --> 43:20.440
I don't actually know what that means,

43:20.440 --> 43:22.700
because the only supercomputers that I've had experience with

43:22.700 --> 43:25.060
are actually often initiated by other computers.

43:25.060 --> 43:28.000
So an entire standard PC boots up

43:28.000 --> 43:31.220
and then initiates the cluster of supercomputers.

43:31.220 --> 43:32.060
So I don't really know what that means.

43:32.060 --> 43:33.300
Yeah, I'm a little curious what they mean.

43:33.300 --> 43:34.780
But I'll go with it, I'll roll with it.

43:34.780 --> 43:36.980
I mean, you know, Linux has been data center for a while.

43:36.980 --> 43:38.500
And they may just mean the approach, too.

43:38.500 --> 43:40.540
You know, they just mean simplifying

43:40.540 --> 43:42.340
and relying on one shared code base.

43:43.460 --> 43:45.740
Linux boot, linuxboot.org.

43:45.740 --> 43:47.940
See, I'm pretty excited, because you know me, Chris.

43:47.940 --> 43:49.380
I just love me some Kexec.

43:49.380 --> 43:51.220
And that's a whole integral part here.

43:51.220 --> 43:52.540
You are a big guy.

43:52.540 --> 43:53.620
So that's how they're doing this?

43:53.620 --> 43:54.860
Well, yeah, so the idea here is that-

43:54.860 --> 43:56.900
Wes will literally go two weeks

43:56.900 --> 43:58.700
and not even install a bootloader on his machine.

43:58.700 --> 44:00.340
He's like, I just Kexec it.

44:00.340 --> 44:02.060
I just load in the one that works and Kexec it.

44:02.060 --> 44:04.220
Yeah, it works so well.

44:04.220 --> 44:05.340
Yeah, so the idea here, right,

44:05.340 --> 44:06.740
is like you still have some firmware,

44:06.740 --> 44:07.580
and that'll vary.

44:07.580 --> 44:08.660
Maybe it's a little bit of UEFI.

44:08.660 --> 44:10.380
Maybe it's core boot or, you know,

44:10.380 --> 44:13.660
you boot on one of those ARM systems.

44:13.660 --> 44:15.180
That does some of the firmware initialization,

44:15.180 --> 44:17.460
the bare sort of stuff to get the CPU started,

44:17.460 --> 44:19.500
the system running, and then you just boot a kernel.

44:19.500 --> 44:21.620
Because the kernel already has a whole bunch of code

44:21.620 --> 44:23.660
for driver and device initialization.

44:23.660 --> 44:24.500
I see.

44:24.500 --> 44:25.340
So you get that.

44:25.340 --> 44:26.660
You have a little helper in it, RAMFS, if you need.

44:26.660 --> 44:28.620
There's a couple different implementations of that.

44:28.620 --> 44:31.380
And then, you know, get your root device supported.

44:31.380 --> 44:33.860
You do some pixie booting if you need to.

44:33.860 --> 44:36.620
Once you get the real kernel, Kexec in there.

44:36.620 --> 44:37.460
Away you go.

44:37.460 --> 44:38.280
Bob's your uncle.

44:38.280 --> 44:39.120
Yep.

44:39.120 --> 44:39.960
That is great.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.300
It's funny how quickly,

44:42.300 --> 44:43.740
I guess funny isn't the right word to say,

44:43.740 --> 44:46.700
but it's awesome, it's so badass,

44:46.700 --> 44:49.500
how Linux really gets its shit together quickly

44:49.500 --> 44:50.340
on this stuff.

44:50.340 --> 44:51.500
It's like, oh, we've got these three or four

44:51.500 --> 44:54.640
technology stacks that we could leverage to do this now.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.620
Where like stuff in Windows comes along,

44:56.620 --> 44:59.260
and it'll literally sit in Windows for 20 years unused,

44:59.260 --> 45:01.140
and it just never gets taken advantage of.

45:01.140 --> 45:02.820
The system never really improves.

45:02.820 --> 45:05.120
But we come up with these three or four disparate projects,

45:05.120 --> 45:06.340
and we all combine them together,

45:06.340 --> 45:08.780
and now you've got a head secure runtime.

45:08.780 --> 45:12.060
You're using Nerfs for, or just Nerf and Uroot,

45:12.060 --> 45:16.500
and a NITRAMFS, and all this crazy great kernel functionality

45:16.500 --> 45:18.900
that are all being written by different people.

45:18.900 --> 45:20.460
And smoosh it all together,

45:20.460 --> 45:22.540
and I think you've got something great

45:22.540 --> 45:23.420
that seems like it doesn't happen

45:23.420 --> 45:25.020
on the commercial platforms as much.

45:25.020 --> 45:26.020
And it's interesting here too,

45:26.020 --> 45:28.580
because you see some of the big names involved here.

45:28.580 --> 45:29.920
People like Google and Facebook,

45:29.920 --> 45:32.580
and they're seeing some real problems they have

45:32.580 --> 45:35.900
in their actual businesses that they're trying to solve.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.540
And they're doing that by leveraging open source technology,

45:38.540 --> 45:39.820
working together to extend it,

45:39.820 --> 45:41.780
which is pretty exciting.

45:41.780 --> 45:42.900
Well, we'll see.

45:42.900 --> 45:45.220
We'll see how long it takes to actually get out there.

45:45.220 --> 45:47.740
Yeah, right now there's about two test devices you can use,

45:47.740 --> 45:49.700
so whether or not the C's real world data set

45:49.700 --> 45:50.620
or deployments, I don't know.

45:50.620 --> 45:51.740
I just want it on a laptop.

45:51.740 --> 45:52.580
Yeah, exactly.

45:52.580 --> 45:54.220
Ooh, you know, that would be so great.

45:54.220 --> 45:55.060
Something on there.

45:55.060 --> 45:56.780
So yeah, I guess I'm feeling this

45:56.780 --> 45:58.220
because I've been reloading machines.

45:58.220 --> 46:01.300
Again, this is the cross that I bear.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.500
I can't help myself.

46:02.500 --> 46:03.340
I can't help myself.

46:03.340 --> 46:04.840
Yeah, you stopped being the Linux switcher,

46:04.840 --> 46:06.620
and yet you're still the Linux.

46:06.620 --> 46:08.120
Somehow, somehow.

46:08.120 --> 46:10.280
Yeah, so Marko is just joining us.

46:10.280 --> 46:13.140
Marko joining us live over at jblive.tv.

46:13.140 --> 46:15.500
We do Linux Unplugged live on Tuesdays.

46:15.500 --> 46:18.980
This week we're on location in downtown Seattle,

46:18.980 --> 46:22.300
and we are live at a canonical Snap event,

46:22.300 --> 46:24.060
their January SnapCraft Summit,

46:24.060 --> 46:25.580
I think is what they're calling it.

46:25.580 --> 46:27.900
And we're here sort of being flies on the wall.

46:27.900 --> 46:30.300
And so Wes is joining me, Noah is joining me,

46:30.300 --> 46:31.540
and the Mumble Room is joining me,

46:31.540 --> 46:33.780
and now Marko in the chat room is joining us.

46:33.780 --> 46:35.100
So you can join us too.

46:35.100 --> 46:37.340
Go to discord.me slash Jupiter Colony,

46:37.340 --> 46:39.100
and the chat room, there's a Linux Unplugged chat room

46:39.100 --> 46:41.380
in there that goes all the time.

46:41.380 --> 46:43.700
So if you wanna join the show and talk about anything

46:43.700 --> 46:46.180
that you saw going across the chat screen,

46:46.180 --> 46:47.120
if you watch the video version,

46:47.120 --> 46:49.220
you can go in there and find it, you can get links.

46:49.220 --> 46:52.780
The conversation continues in there.

46:52.780 --> 46:55.620
So there's a really big conversation kicking off this week

46:55.620 --> 46:58.700
around client-side decorations again.

46:58.700 --> 47:00.800
I don't know if you guys remember client-side decorations,

47:00.800 --> 47:02.800
but they're like those header bars on No Maps,

47:02.800 --> 47:04.660
GEdit's got it, Corebird's got it.

47:05.860 --> 47:10.100
Funny, most GNOME desktop applications have it now

47:10.100 --> 47:12.140
except for Nautilus and Terminal,

47:12.140 --> 47:14.460
which is the ones I use the most.

47:14.460 --> 47:18.140
But client-side decorations is sort of solving

47:18.140 --> 47:19.800
a couple of problems for the GNOME desktop,

47:19.800 --> 47:21.340
and so they're pretty hot on it.

47:21.340 --> 47:25.700
It is solving some Wayland transition issues

47:25.700 --> 47:28.560
where applications would be responsible

47:28.560 --> 47:30.640
for drawing their own decorations.

47:30.640 --> 47:32.740
And when I say decorations, I'm talking like the title bar.

47:32.740 --> 47:34.940
I'm talking like the close, minimize, maximize.

47:34.940 --> 47:36.620
The title bar around your application,

47:36.620 --> 47:37.860
the borders around your application

47:37.860 --> 47:39.660
are often referred to as decorations.

47:41.180 --> 47:45.620
And the GNOME project is pretty keen on the idea

47:45.620 --> 47:48.840
of applications drawing their own borders,

47:48.840 --> 47:52.940
drawing their own titles, their own decorations,

47:52.940 --> 47:55.500
and doing it in a way that sort of brings everything

47:55.500 --> 47:56.740
into that bar.

47:56.740 --> 47:59.540
So instead of having a separate file edit menu

47:59.540 --> 48:02.460
and a title bar, it's all in one combined bar.

48:02.460 --> 48:05.260
And if you go look at screenshots of GNOME Builder,

48:05.260 --> 48:07.400
you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

48:07.400 --> 48:10.340
And in a blog post that they did recently,

48:10.340 --> 48:12.260
there is, Tobias, I believe, did it,

48:12.260 --> 48:13.980
there is a blog post that shows,

48:13.980 --> 48:15.860
what would Telegram and Slack look like

48:15.860 --> 48:18.060
if they use client-side decorations?

48:18.060 --> 48:19.980
And they're down there towards the bottom of the post.

48:19.980 --> 48:23.380
And I gotta admit, it legitimately looks good.

48:23.380 --> 48:26.720
And this is a conversation that they've started before

48:26.720 --> 48:29.900
that the folks on the Plasma and KDE side of the camp

48:29.900 --> 48:34.060
have rejected, saying, we've come up with a cross-desktop

48:34.060 --> 48:35.860
protocol that we could use,

48:35.860 --> 48:37.500
we have these server-side decorations

48:37.500 --> 48:40.160
that we think are great, and oh, by the way,

48:40.160 --> 48:41.880
if you've got client-side decorations,

48:41.880 --> 48:44.280
if that application crashes, well, it's responsible

48:44.280 --> 48:46.380
for drawing title bars, so now the title bars crash,

48:46.380 --> 48:47.860
so it's much harder to move it around,

48:47.860 --> 48:51.020
and the windows froze, and they've been iterating

48:51.020 --> 48:53.020
and discussing these problems and iterating

48:53.020 --> 48:54.900
on that discussion, what's wrong with client-side

48:54.900 --> 48:58.500
decorations, and so there was just sort of a stalemate.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.740
Gnome went ahead and just kept doing some stuff,

49:00.740 --> 49:03.940
client-side decorations, CSDs, but it kind of slowed down,

49:03.940 --> 49:04.780
not a lot of projects.

49:04.780 --> 49:06.100
Probably haven't even talked about it

49:06.100 --> 49:07.420
for it seems like at least a year.

49:07.420 --> 49:10.740
No, although in the background, so Firefox 59's

49:10.740 --> 49:13.460
coming out next, and it's implementing client-side

49:13.460 --> 49:17.100
decorations as an option when you go configure the toolbars.

49:17.100 --> 49:20.400
So I thought, I really need to get a perspective on this,

49:20.400 --> 49:23.460
because as funny as it is, this problem isn't going away,

49:23.460 --> 49:27.780
and every time it comes up, each camp gets even more

49:27.780 --> 49:30.340
sort of entrenched in their view of what's right

49:30.340 --> 49:33.540
and what's wrong, and the language is getting

49:33.540 --> 49:35.580
a little more hostile now, it's getting

49:35.580 --> 49:38.200
a little more aggressive, and so.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.580
Away from a technical discussion,

49:39.580 --> 49:42.980
and suddenly people have stakes now, and it's emotional.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.540
And so what is it all about?

49:44.540 --> 49:46.460
Does this even matter?

49:46.460 --> 49:48.780
Is this all a bunch of crap for very little gain?

49:48.780 --> 49:53.240
So I wanted to understand why the Gnome project wants this,

49:53.240 --> 49:54.980
because I get why the K-Win developers

49:54.980 --> 49:57.620
think it's not so great, and we'll get to all of that

49:57.620 --> 49:59.860
in just a moment, I'll talk about some of that.

50:02.060 --> 50:05.020
So, even though I thought I was gonna be staying

50:05.020 --> 50:09.560
on Unity 7 until 1804 came around, I.

50:09.560 --> 50:12.220
You've been singing Unity's praises for months now.

50:12.220 --> 50:15.980
I thought, you know, I need to just have

50:15.980 --> 50:18.380
some handle on this, so I Gnomed up.

50:19.220 --> 50:20.400
I Gnomed up all over the place.

50:20.400 --> 50:22.180
I started with that Arch machine that you had

50:22.180 --> 50:23.980
on the MacBook, got it all up to date,

50:23.980 --> 50:25.360
got my Gnome 3 all dialed in, I was like,

50:25.360 --> 50:26.500
all right, well now I'm just gonna move another machine,

50:26.500 --> 50:27.940
another machine, another machine, it's how I do.

50:27.940 --> 50:30.000
And each time I sort of build on it and build on it.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.660
And I went all in, I got a beta build of Gnome,

50:34.660 --> 50:36.140
or I'm sorry, I had a Firefox 59,

50:36.140 --> 50:38.380
so I had Firefox with client-side decorations.

50:38.380 --> 50:40.520
I configured MailSpring to use client-side decorations.

50:40.520 --> 50:43.260
I loaded up CoreWord, which uses client-side decorations.

50:43.260 --> 50:44.080
I went.

50:44.080 --> 50:44.920
You went full CSD.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.720
Yeah, I went full CSD, full, full CSD.

50:46.720 --> 50:48.340
So I'm gonna talk a little bit about that.

50:48.340 --> 50:51.520
I want to talk about what Martin, the K-Win developer,

50:51.520 --> 50:54.180
why he doesn't like this, and where I ended up.

50:54.180 --> 50:56.060
And then we'll wrap it all up, like I said,

50:56.060 --> 50:57.600
at the top of the show with an app pick

50:57.600 --> 50:59.640
that I think's the best terminal emulator I've ever used.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.220
So that's where we're going next.

51:01.220 --> 51:03.500
So why don't we take a moment and thank Linux Academy.

51:03.500 --> 51:05.420
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

51:05.420 --> 51:07.660
You go there to sign up for a free seven-day trial.

51:07.660 --> 51:09.660

51:09.660 --> 51:11.440
It's a full-featured training library

51:11.440 --> 51:13.580
with everything you need to learn new skills

51:13.580 --> 51:15.260
and advance your career in Linux

51:15.260 --> 51:16.180
and open source in general.

51:16.180 --> 51:19.740
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

51:19.740 --> 51:21.380
Go there, sign up for that free seven-day trial

51:21.380 --> 51:24.840
and get a sense of the scale of the platform.

51:24.840 --> 51:25.980
How about that, huh?

51:25.980 --> 51:28.420
That's, I get a sense of the scale of the platform.

51:28.420 --> 51:29.540
It really is, it's everything you need,

51:29.540 --> 51:32.620
from hands-on labs to instructor mentoring,

51:32.620 --> 51:34.860
learning paths, which are a series of courses

51:34.860 --> 51:36.500
and content that is planned by instructors

51:36.500 --> 51:37.940
for specific career tracks.

51:37.940 --> 51:40.420
If you're busy as heck, they got course schedulers

51:40.420 --> 51:42.060
so you can set a timeframe and fit to it

51:42.060 --> 51:43.840
and it'll help you set learning goals.

51:43.840 --> 51:46.240
If you're a bad tester, they have practice exams

51:46.240 --> 51:48.380
to help you get ready for certifications,

51:48.380 --> 51:49.620
test what you've learned,

51:49.620 --> 51:51.780
and they also have courses created specifically

51:51.780 --> 51:53.820
to prepare you for certification exams.

51:53.820 --> 51:56.260
They have cloud servers that they spin up on demand

51:56.260 --> 51:57.920
to help you do the courseware

51:57.920 --> 52:00.540
in real-world production situations.

52:01.420 --> 52:02.820
Shoot, that's worth it right there.

52:02.820 --> 52:05.020
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

52:05.020 --> 52:08.940
And you can also go all NOAA, go full Brown Bear

52:08.940 --> 52:11.580
and go offline with their comprehensive study guides,

52:11.580 --> 52:14.060
their lesson audio, their personal notebooks.

52:14.060 --> 52:16.100
You don't need the cloud for any of that.

52:16.100 --> 52:18.140
You can learn Linux with that stuff too, offline.

52:18.140 --> 52:21.460
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

52:21.460 --> 52:24.340
And check out the community section, like the forums.

52:24.340 --> 52:26.980
You may find a fellow Jupiter broadcasting member lurking.

52:26.980 --> 52:28.040
There's plenty of them.

52:28.040 --> 52:29.980
A vibrant community that's there to help you.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.580
They fork study cards.

52:31.580 --> 52:32.860
They really make it worth it.

52:32.860 --> 52:34.940
And then Linux Academy is revising content.

52:34.940 --> 52:35.900
They're keeping it up to date

52:35.900 --> 52:39.060
and they're adding new content and an incredible clip,

52:39.060 --> 52:41.180
consistently making your subscription worth it.

52:41.180 --> 52:42.900
Right, I mean, they can't make it no work.

52:42.900 --> 52:44.140
You're still gonna have to put in some time,

52:44.140 --> 52:45.620
learn the content, play around with Linux,

52:45.620 --> 52:48.340
but they knock down just about every single other obstacle

52:48.340 --> 52:49.180
I can think of.

52:49.180 --> 52:50.020
And they're gonna help you get your head around it.

52:50.020 --> 52:50.860
Yeah.

52:50.860 --> 52:54.620
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

52:54.620 --> 52:56.500
So let's talk about the Kaywin side of things here.

52:56.500 --> 52:58.220
So Gnome likes it for the aesthetic value

52:58.220 --> 53:00.300
that solves some Wayland problems for them.

53:00.300 --> 53:01.820
And the number one thing is it uses less

53:01.820 --> 53:02.660
vertical real estate.

53:02.660 --> 53:04.140
You know, you're getting less stuff up in the top.

53:04.140 --> 53:05.780
Some of the well done ones, it looks pretty nice.

53:05.780 --> 53:06.820
Yeah. I don't hate it.

53:06.820 --> 53:07.940
And on widescreen displays,

53:07.940 --> 53:10.380
it's nice to get more vertical real estate.

53:10.380 --> 53:13.300
But Martin on his blog writes that

53:14.580 --> 53:18.220
he's not a big fan of this and he calls it a situation.

53:18.220 --> 53:21.060
He says that the Gnome shell and Western require client

53:21.060 --> 53:24.420
side decorations, but KDE Plasma and Sway do not.

53:24.420 --> 53:26.180
In fact, the Plasma folks,

53:26.180 --> 53:28.780
which I believe Martin was the one who drafted this,

53:28.780 --> 53:31.100
created a protocol supported by GTK,

53:31.100 --> 53:33.420
although it is broken currently, I've been told,

53:33.420 --> 53:35.780
that allows to negotiate with Wayland compositor,

53:35.780 --> 53:38.340
whether it's using server side decorations

53:38.340 --> 53:40.180
or client side decorations.

53:41.060 --> 53:43.340
In fact, he says the don't believe Gnome,

53:43.340 --> 53:45.140
don't implement CSDs.

53:45.140 --> 53:47.420
You can ask them to support server side decorations

53:47.420 --> 53:48.260
if that's how you feel.

53:48.260 --> 53:50.260
They could do it because they need to do it

53:50.260 --> 53:52.440
for X Wayland anyways.

53:53.460 --> 53:54.620
That's a good point right there.

53:54.620 --> 53:57.020
If you've got to do it for X Wayland anyways.

53:57.020 --> 53:58.020
Hmm.

53:58.020 --> 53:59.540
He says that I totally don't understand.

53:59.540 --> 54:01.660
I totally understand you toolkit developers

54:01.660 --> 54:03.900
that don't want to implement your own client side decoration.

54:03.900 --> 54:06.500
It's a lot of work and it's difficult to make it look good

54:06.500 --> 54:09.580
and not alien on different desktop environments.

54:09.580 --> 54:10.420
I don't know.

54:10.420 --> 54:12.460
You know, I don't know.

54:12.460 --> 54:15.780
If you ever seen Slack on Windows or Mac,

54:15.780 --> 54:17.820
I think that's using client side decorations essentially.

54:17.820 --> 54:22.180
So you can make it work, but they have a good point.

54:22.180 --> 54:25.060
You have to solve this problem for X Wayland anyways.

54:25.060 --> 54:27.660
You still have all of these developers

54:27.660 --> 54:29.460
who aren't going to want to create that

54:29.460 --> 54:31.800
because it's a pretty big visual piece of your application

54:31.800 --> 54:33.920
all of a sudden that you maybe aren't even out

54:33.920 --> 54:35.300
for designing correctly.

54:36.220 --> 54:37.300
So I see both sides of the camp.

54:37.300 --> 54:38.580
So I say, I got to just run these.

54:38.580 --> 54:40.220
I got to run this.

54:40.220 --> 54:42.540
And I'll say, you know, I'll say it's nice.

54:42.540 --> 54:45.500
It is really nice from a visual standpoint,

54:45.500 --> 54:50.100
but I ran it for just three days.

54:50.100 --> 54:53.100
And in that time, sure as shit,

54:53.100 --> 54:55.600
Gnome crashed on me four times at least.

54:56.740 --> 54:59.180
And our friends at Canonical just recently iterated

54:59.180 --> 55:01.620
that one of the reasons they're shipping XOR and 1804

55:01.620 --> 55:05.540
as default is because when Gnome crashes,

55:05.540 --> 55:08.580
when Gnome shell crashes on Wayland, it is catastrophic.

55:08.580 --> 55:09.580
Oh yeah, I mean, that's it.

55:09.580 --> 55:10.860
It is the display server.

55:10.860 --> 55:11.700
That's it.

55:11.700 --> 55:13.380
See, when you're on X, yeah, when you're on X,

55:13.380 --> 55:15.620
you have the luxury of X still running.

55:15.620 --> 55:18.260
You can reconnect to X and Gnome just sort of pops back up

55:18.260 --> 55:20.140
and your applications look all shitty for a second

55:20.140 --> 55:21.460
and everything's fine.

55:21.460 --> 55:24.580
But on Wayland, it's a crash.

55:24.580 --> 55:28.820
And I'm sitting like, this thing crashed on me four times,

55:28.820 --> 55:31.140
four times in three days.

55:32.300 --> 55:35.980
And oh my gosh, if Gnome hasn't had some Gnome issues here.

55:35.980 --> 55:37.500
This isn't, I don't mean to be a Gnome bashing issue,

55:37.500 --> 55:38.500
but this matters.

55:38.500 --> 55:39.700
You've had full crashes.

55:39.700 --> 55:41.700
And if we were in a Wayland future.

55:41.700 --> 55:43.500
Well, here's my issue.

55:43.500 --> 55:45.940
We went to sit down to do shell prep today.

55:45.940 --> 55:48.900
And I think I was sitting there next to you

55:48.900 --> 55:51.340
for when I pulled my laptop out for 35 seconds,

55:51.340 --> 55:52.180
oh, Gnome crashed.

55:52.180 --> 55:53.580
And what was frustrating was I was,

55:53.580 --> 55:55.420
the reason I pulled my laptop out.

55:55.420 --> 55:56.260
You had a great idea.

55:56.260 --> 55:57.860
Why have the memory fish of a goldfish?

55:57.860 --> 55:58.700
Yeah, you have the memory of a goldfish.

55:58.700 --> 55:59.980
Yeah, and so I wanted to dump something down

55:59.980 --> 56:02.780
and I opened up a text editor, got one sentence into it

56:02.780 --> 56:03.860
and the whole thing just dumps.

56:03.860 --> 56:05.380
Of course, I lose all my work.

56:05.380 --> 56:06.420
And you don't know what you were trying

56:06.420 --> 56:07.260
to write down anymore.

56:07.260 --> 56:08.460
Right, well, it was frustrating.

56:08.460 --> 56:10.820
And then I went to recover

56:10.820 --> 56:14.100
and the entire, the system locked up so hard

56:14.100 --> 56:15.620
that I had to physically power the computer off

56:15.620 --> 56:17.140
and then power back up.

56:17.140 --> 56:18.220
And by the time I got through that

56:18.220 --> 56:19.940
and remembering my encryption password

56:19.940 --> 56:22.100
and getting back into Linux

56:22.100 --> 56:23.540
and opening up the text editor

56:23.540 --> 56:24.780
and getting back to what I was doing,

56:24.780 --> 56:26.060
by the time I did all of that,

56:26.060 --> 56:27.780
I forgot what I was going to say,

56:27.780 --> 56:29.220
which turned out not to be a big deal

56:29.220 --> 56:31.620
because about five minutes after that, it crashed again.

56:31.620 --> 56:32.860
And then we closed and moved rooms

56:32.860 --> 56:34.980
and I came back into a different room

56:34.980 --> 56:36.540
and it crashed a third time.

56:36.540 --> 56:37.820
And so, and the question,

56:37.820 --> 56:39.700
what you and I were talking about is.

56:39.700 --> 56:40.740
What are they going to do about this?

56:40.740 --> 56:41.700
Yeah, I'm the dedicated,

56:41.700 --> 56:43.380
I'm a pretty dedicated Linux user, right?

56:43.380 --> 56:44.700
Like to the point that, you know,

56:44.700 --> 56:46.380
if my choice was between Linux

56:46.380 --> 56:47.540
and no computer at all,

56:47.540 --> 56:48.900
I'd probably use no computer at all.

56:48.900 --> 56:50.940
And if I am getting frustrated

56:50.940 --> 56:52.980
and joking about, well, maybe I should use Windows

56:52.980 --> 56:53.900
so at least I can get through the show

56:53.900 --> 56:54.980
and then I'll go back to using Linux.

56:54.980 --> 56:56.860
If I'm making those jokes,

56:56.860 --> 56:58.020
what is the next guy that's like,

56:58.020 --> 56:59.780
ah, I was kind of in between, but you know.

56:59.780 --> 57:01.380
And here's what has me scared a little bit.

57:01.380 --> 57:02.740
And I mean scared,

57:02.740 --> 57:03.980
it actually really is something

57:03.980 --> 57:06.700
that I'm a little worried about here is

57:06.700 --> 57:09.500
the GNOME team has a fork in the road ahead of them.

57:09.500 --> 57:11.340
And what they're discussing right now

57:11.340 --> 57:14.460
up on their Wiki and on the IRC room and whatnot

57:14.460 --> 57:18.860
is GNOME 4, do we re-architecture GNOME

57:18.860 --> 57:20.240
and make it modular?

57:20.240 --> 57:21.780
So we break out mutter,

57:21.780 --> 57:24.220
we break out all the compositing stuff completely separately.

57:24.220 --> 57:25.980
We break out the shell,

57:25.980 --> 57:27.540
we break out the graphics effects,

57:27.540 --> 57:30.580
we break out the extension architecture,

57:30.580 --> 57:34.200
which also means we create a standard API.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.780
We have to create an IPC communication system

57:36.780 --> 57:38.340
for all these different modularized components

57:38.340 --> 57:39.740
to communicate with each other.

57:39.740 --> 57:42.260
There can't be any drop in state or delay,

57:42.260 --> 57:44.320
or, and if we do that,

57:44.320 --> 57:46.960
we break every single extension in existence today.

57:48.520 --> 57:50.140
And mind you today, these guys,

57:50.140 --> 57:51.900
the way the extensions work in GNOME Shell 3

57:51.900 --> 57:56.520
is they're just hot swapping out JavaScript code

57:56.520 --> 57:57.580
in the GNOME Shell.

57:57.580 --> 57:59.580
It's not like these extensions are talking to GNOME

57:59.580 --> 58:02.780
and saying, I would like to put a meter up in the toolbar.

58:02.780 --> 58:05.740
They're just slicing that code in their hot dog style,

58:05.740 --> 58:07.340
a hot dog down a hallway.

58:07.340 --> 58:10.340
And that is dangerous.

58:10.340 --> 58:12.380
That's not how you want a professional desktop run.

58:12.380 --> 58:13.220
You know what I'm saying?

58:13.220 --> 58:15.660
Like, so they, but at the same time,

58:15.660 --> 58:17.360
critical functionality of GNOME 3

58:17.360 --> 58:19.460
is provided by these extensions.

58:19.460 --> 58:20.820
And we want that, we would,

58:20.820 --> 58:22.220
especially if GNOME's gonna concentrate

58:22.220 --> 58:23.460
on sort of a small core,

58:23.460 --> 58:25.980
you're gonna need those for a workable desktop.

58:25.980 --> 58:27.680
And so the GNOME project's like,

58:27.680 --> 58:28.780
well, you know, we tell people

58:28.780 --> 58:30.120
if we get rid of the system tray

58:30.120 --> 58:31.820
to go to the top icons extension.

58:31.820 --> 58:33.820
Well, we tell people when we get rid of desktop icons

58:33.820 --> 58:35.260
to go to the desktop extension.

58:35.260 --> 58:37.860
And now do we go break all extensions on people?

58:37.860 --> 58:40.180
Imagine if Firefox took away bookmarks

58:40.180 --> 58:42.820
and said, we'll just use an extension for bookmarks.

58:42.820 --> 58:44.500
And then two releases later,

58:44.500 --> 58:46.180
they broke the bookmark extension.

58:46.180 --> 58:47.920
So there's no more bookmark extension.

58:47.920 --> 58:49.700
Well, you just told me to get the bookmark extension.

58:49.700 --> 58:51.540
How can you go and break it two releases later?

58:51.540 --> 58:52.840
That's the position they're in now.

58:52.840 --> 58:54.900
So they either break all extension in existence

58:54.900 --> 58:57.860
that make GNOME a usable environment to begin with,

58:57.860 --> 59:01.120
or they kick the can down the road.

59:01.120 --> 59:03.140
They create maybe an API or something,

59:03.140 --> 59:06.080
and they don't address this core architectural issue

59:06.080 --> 59:08.020
that if you think about it is a massive challenge.

59:08.020 --> 59:10.180
And so it's not that I,

59:10.180 --> 59:13.020
GNOME is my favorite desktop environment, hands down.

59:13.020 --> 59:16.120
It's the one I, if it never crashed on me,

59:16.120 --> 59:16.960
it would be the one-

59:16.960 --> 59:17.800
You'd be there all day.

59:17.800 --> 59:20.540
I'd be at the top of the roof right now at this hotel,

59:20.540 --> 59:23.900
29th floor, screaming about how great GNOME Shell is.

59:23.900 --> 59:27.820
I just, I can't when I can't even make it a few days

59:27.820 --> 59:30.220
without it taking a huge dump on me.

59:30.220 --> 59:33.300
And now having a little more insight

59:33.300 --> 59:35.860
into what's causing these problems,

59:35.860 --> 59:40.180
I see that they have a massive technical hurdle to overcome.

59:40.180 --> 59:41.020
And-

59:41.020 --> 59:41.900
It feels very different, right?

59:41.900 --> 59:44.340
Like for a while, especially after like 320 or something,

59:44.340 --> 59:46.500
we kind of talk about, GNOME felt stable again, right?

59:46.500 --> 59:47.860
It was like, okay, let's see what they've done.

59:47.860 --> 59:50.020
As any software project grows though, right?

59:50.020 --> 59:51.980
And as you add more extensions,

59:51.980 --> 59:53.740
and the answer can't be no extensions.

59:53.740 --> 59:56.060
It just loses, it just,

59:56.060 --> 59:57.740
I think also Wes, the thing is,

59:57.740 --> 01:00:01.500
it's the Wayland pressure because now crashes

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.120
have way more consequence.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.020
It's not just a repop of the shell.

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.500
It's you lose everything that you're working on

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.580
and you reboot the machine.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.260
And we're in that awkward middle ground now

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.260
where before it was sort of like,

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.100
oh, if Wayland's a crashy mess, it doesn't matter.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.460
No one's really using it,

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.700
but people are starting to use it for real things

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.500
in real production applications.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.860
And if it's not up to the task, that's a serious issue.

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.700
Yeah, well, they're making hard decisions in GNOME Shell

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:30.380
that if they can't figure out how to do it in Wayland and X,

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.740
and they can only figure out how to do it in Wayland,

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.100
they just drop the X version.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.180
Some of the things we're seeing happen to GNOME Shell

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:37.060
are really about getting ready for Wayland.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.540
And just a couple of weeks ago,

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.540
we talked about how the Kaywin project

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.220
is a Wayland first project now.

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:45.500
And X11 is now in indefinite maintenance mode for them.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.300
So we are making that transition.

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.140
It's happening whether you want to or not.

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.140
Fedora's shipping it, Ubuntu 17.10 is shipping it.

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:55.980
And GNOME is making a huge ask with these client-side

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:59.740
decorations when they're in sort of a tedious position.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.220
Because the tedious part of it is,

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:05.460
they have bigger distro support than they've ever had.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.660
All of the major distros are shipping GNOME desktops

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.340
right now, all of the corporate desktops.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.180
It's kind of their heyday in one sense.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:11.700
Right, unless you're Blue Systems,

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:14.660
everything you're shipping is a GNOME desktop.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:17.180
So they are in a great position,

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.980
but the tedious part of it is they can't really use

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:21.380
that leverage because there's these fundamental

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.420
architectural issues that everybody

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.660
behind the scenes is going,

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:25.980
this is a big problem, I don't know what the hell

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.820
we're gonna do about this, I'm freaking out.

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.140
Yeah, what's gonna happen with GNOME, we don't know.

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.940
Yeah, and so it was with that background

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:34.780
that I was like, okay, this is an interesting time

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:35.840
that they're choosing to bring this up.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.220
Dan, I don't know if we have Mr. Dan Rabbit's audio again,

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.180
but I wonder if anyone has thoughts on the client-side.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.300
Yeah, Dan, what do you think about this client-side

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.660
decoration conversations come up again,

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:49.140
especially from an elementary OS desktop standpoint?

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.780
Well, we've been all in on client-side decorations

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:56.740
for a couple of releases now, so they work fine.

01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:01.740
And like you said, the space-saving thing is really good.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.860
One big thing about client-side decorations that you get

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.820
is they're actually integrated with applications

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.980
that wanna use the dark style instead of server-side

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.500
decorations that aren't aware of the application's content

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.460
so they can't adapt correctly.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.700
We also have a facility in elementary OS for developers

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.380
to be able to set brand colors in their applications.

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.740
So a lot of the title bars for applications in App Center

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.420
are branded colored instead of just plain,

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.860
you know, with the same for every app.

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.520
Like there's a lot more interesting color in the UI.

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.600
Yeah, I have seen that and I do really like

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.540
the way that looks.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.220
I've also seen people make certain buttons stand out more

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.540
that, you know, like my eyes drawn to it more

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.840
because it's like a certain color of blue

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.940
that really pops or something.

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:46.500
So that's, you know, and the red buttons really stand out.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.820
Don't click that unless you really wanna lose this document.

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:50.700
I like that.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:55.460
So do you have any kind of sense of where the Kwin project's

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.940
coming from and see like that?

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.540
Well, do the server-side decoration thing instead

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.220
because you still gotta solve this problem for Exwayland.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.780
I mean, I don't know.

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:09.620
I'm not sure I fully understand the argument against

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:12.900
having client-side decorations, to be honest.

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.140
It kind of seems like you can do everything

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.000
you could do with server-side decorations

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.820
with client-side decorations.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.940
I know I see some people saying like,

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:24.340
oh, well, that means that all the apps draw

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:25.740
where their own window positions are

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.900
and I don't want my apps to have

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.740
different window button positions.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.980
That's not really how it works on the GTK side.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:33.860
Like it's a widget and you as an app developer

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.860
just use the widget and you pack everything

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:38.180
in between the window decorations.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:41.800
But GTK itself decides where the buttons go.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.780
So if it was solved in that same way

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.700
with a Qt widget on their side,

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.000
like that completely removes that argument too.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.260
Yeah, it does seem solvable on their side.

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.480
In fact, it almost seems like it'd be easier for them

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.680
to support the client-side decoration stuff.

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.220
So I teased it a bit.

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:03.100
Do you want to also touch on the switch from CMake

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:04.900
while we have you?

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:06.100
Yes, that'd be great.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:09.500
Yeah, cause audio dropped out back there.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.340
Yeah, no, that's okay.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:11.160
We'll circle back to this.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.940
So yeah, tell me about the switch from CMake

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.820
and what's that all about?

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.840
And what are you switching to?

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.700
Yeah, so we're actually really excited about this.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:21.060
So we were running, if people don't know,

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.660
like CMake is a build system

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:26.120
and a build system is what you use to take your source code

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.860
and turn it into like executable binaries.

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:31.660
So every application has to have a build system

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.420
of it has compiled code.

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.220
We're using CMake for a long time

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.300
and CMake's pretty good.

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.980
But one of the things we have to do to make CMake work

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:43.020
for all our use cases is we carry like this big set

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.620
of modules that helps us do things like internationalization

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.740
or using like G resource

01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:52.940
or like all kinds of little plugins like that.

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.260
Well, we recently-

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.420
So you need to have that sort of hack those on.

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.660
Yeah, and so developers kind of have a choice

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.880
where they either add a dependency package

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.080
that is only shipped in elementary OS

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.100
or they shove all these modules into their upstream project

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:09.740
and try to stay in sync with our module package.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.840
That's like not a super great experience.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:17.700
But we've been looking a lot into the Mason build system

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.940
because more and more people are adopting it.

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:24.100
It's in system D now, it's in GTK plus.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:28.520
And so we've talked with their developers upstream

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.480
and we're actually able to get some patches in there

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.900
to solve some issues we had with Bala support

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:37.300
and translations and things like that.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.820
And they've been super awesome and responsive to us.

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.180
And we're totally all in on Mason.

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:45.060
We're migrating all of our projects over to it.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.100
That's awesome.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:48.920
Wow.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.980
From like a project standpoint,

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:56.820
is that like something you guys like have like a powwow on

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.900
or is that like somebody decides on high?

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.620
Like what's the structure on making a change like that

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:03.100
in elementary?

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.100
It kind of started off as just like a,

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.580
hey, have you heard of this Mason thing?

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.860
Like, oh yeah, I don't know, yeah.

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:11.580
And then like, I think actually it was me

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.780
who first used it in one of my little side projects.

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.220
And then I showed somebody and I was like,

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.040
hey, check this out.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.540
And it was like the amount of lines of Mason it took

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:23.000
to build the app was like such this tiny,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
like neat, nice little file that everybody was like,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.180
holy crap, I got to look at that, you know?

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:32.180
And so it just kind of spread out from there.

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.540
Yeah, and then we're all kind of like,

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:35.740
okay, let's just do this for everything now.

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:37.940
Those are the best guys.

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:38.760
That is great.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.360
I got to say, I really appreciate that your blog post

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.340
had such an easy example,

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.900
because I've seen a lot of other projects write

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.740
about switching and it's easy to say,

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.300
oh yeah, it's an easier config,

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:48.440
but your example really lays it out.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.740
Like it's just simpler.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.580
Yeah.

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:51.420
Yeah, I will link to that.

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:52.240
Thanks, yeah.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.460
That is a very good point.

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:56.860
I want to now, I want to shift back to,

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:59.180
let's wrap up this plasma conversation real quick.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.740
Thank you, Dan, for the insight on that.

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.980
I was curious, I've been really getting

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.700
the elementary OS itch recently.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.380
Trying to hold off on the itch before release

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:08.780
just so I don't, but boy do I,

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.020
every time you come on here, it gives me the itch.

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.380
Or that's the rash, I'm not sure.

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:13.700
But either way, I appreciate it.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.500
Thank you very much for giving us the update.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:18.940
So this was sort of, I sort of did this too,

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:21.980
because Wimpy's like, you need to try out plasma on Wayland

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:24.700
and see what that's like compared to a gnome on Wayland

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.240
if you're having all these troubles.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.380
And as is typical, Wimpy was right.

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:34.380
And so I tried out KDE Neon, I got the user edition,

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:38.420
and I loaded it on the AirMaster broadcast machine

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.400
that's having some issues.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.660
I loaded it on my laptops,

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:46.220
and I've been sort of changing my perspective

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:47.500
on plasma desktop.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.100
I've always liked it initially,

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.740
and I tend to sort of trail off,

01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:53.700
because I tend to start to get annoyed

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.340
with having to change all of these settings.

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.020
Every time, the first time I launch

01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:59.260
any plasma desktop application,

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.260
I just have to go through all these configuration changes.

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:03.540
Everything, Dolphin, every app on the desktop.

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:04.780
You know, if you have, like this,

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.900
my XPS 13 has a high DPI screen.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:11.420
I gotta change, I have to go into the display output,

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.520
and I have to scale the display output.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.760
I have to go into the font settings,

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.540
I have to scale up my fonts.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.780
I have to go down to my panel, I have to resize my panel,

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:21.180
and I have to go into the mouse settings

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.700
and change my mouse cursor to support high DPI.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.300
So it supports high DPI if I change four different settings

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:28.860
in four completely different locations

01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:31.560
in the system settings, then I get high DPI.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:35.020
After I've done all that, you know, it's nice, it's fine,

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:36.920
it's great, I don't need to change it again.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.560
That's true for everything, Dolphin, console,

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.400
everything's like that.

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.900
Having those knobs are nice on one system

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.540
if you really want it to be just the way you want,

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:44.860
but when you have five systems,

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.060
you kind of just want the nice default.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.380
I was laughing, like I got into a,

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:48.580
I got down into it, and I'm like,

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:51.700
yeah, I'm like configuring how many lines my screen scrolls

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:53.940
when I move my mouse scroll wheel one notch.

01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.860
I'm like, this is probably at a level of detail

01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:58.220
I don't need to be at anymore.

01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.860
So that in the past would piss me off,

01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:01.180
like what are these guys doing?

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.940
Why don't they just add some sane defaults?

01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:05.020
Why doesn't anybody just add a sane default?

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.820
But I'm flipping on that now.

01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:08.360
And I have a different perspective

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:11.660
after getting just dumped on by Gnome a lot.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:13.140
You know, this is an ongoing issue.

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:14.700
It affects our OBS where I get the studio.

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:16.740
It's a constant problem.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.980
And I've come to the realization that

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.660
having to change defaults for six months

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:24.720
is a lot better than having my desktop

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.020
crash on me all the time.

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.960
And so if I'm gonna live with one annoyance,

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.700
I'll live with the fact that I can change the defaults,

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.360
and if nothing else, maybe this will finally

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.380
get me off my butt to actually sync

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.080
my configuration amongst my machines.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.180
I've threatened to do it for years.

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:38.140
You have threatened to do it for years.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:38.980
You know what I mean?

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:39.800
Yeah, absolutely.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.640
Every time I get into Plasma,

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.460
I start to threaten it even more,

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.540
but now that I'm sitting around West

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:44.420
doing tech snap all the time,

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.980
I think I may finally get off my duff

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.100
and sync this config around.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.580
Wes, are you a C file fan?

01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:51.740
You know, I have used it, but I don't use it currently.

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:52.580
Oh, okay.

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.260
What do you, are you Dropbox?

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:55.920
Are you a sync thing guy?

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.120
I have a sync thing for some things,

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:00.340
and then some Chef-based config for other things.

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.620
Okay, so what would it take to get you

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.900
to try C file for syncing these configs?

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.240
Just some time to do it, I suppose.

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.540
Maybe we try it tonight if we get back to studio.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:10.040
I'm telling you, here's a Noah Redbook prediction

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:10.880
for Chris.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.380
Once Chris tries C file, he will never go back.

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.140
Because here's the thing, and I think,

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.620
I feel like I've said this a couple of times

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:21.220
throughout this weekend, but there are projects

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:23.460
that I like because they're open source projects,

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.820
and I just think they're really good open source projects,

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:27.960
and then there's good on the level of,

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.660
this is such an amazing product, the license be damned.

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.060
It's just a good product,

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:34.540
and that's how I feel about C file.

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.980
It's just, it's one of those things I installed.

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.140
I haven't looked at C file in ages.

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.740
I installed it one time on one server,

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.120
installed the sync client to all of my computers,

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.660
and I change a lot of data.

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.740
I've got video files and audio files

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:49.020
and all the source files for this show, or my show.

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.940
It integrates with Collabra online server, too.

01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:53.060
Yeah, syncs all over the place,

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:57.620
and I never once, not one single time,

01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.440
have it bite me, and the closest I ever get

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.460
is let's say I leave a file open on one computer

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:04.460
and I open up on another computer, and I do some really.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.460
You get a conflict copy?

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.900
Yeah, I get a conflict copy, and it timestamps it for me

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:10.260
and says, here, boss, here's all the files you have.

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.300
Which one did you want to actually, amazing.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.540
So their pricing is based on amount of users,

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:15.380
not amount of storage?

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.300
Well, C file is free.

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.940
You can pay for them to host it for you.

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:19.780
Oh, I see, I see.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:21.180
But you can also just run it yourself.

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.380
If we make it back before 10 p.m. tonight,

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.380
we should try to set this up.

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.220
All right.

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.980
Because I gotta try this, because I gotta tell you,

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:30.700
now that I have this plasma, I was going around

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.180
and showing some of the canonical guys, too.

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:34.460
I'm like, let me just show you this, right?

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:35.700
I got a pretty sweet desktop.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.620
Yeah, yeah, and I'm like, and you know what?

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.940
The consensus is, once you get it set up,

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:43.100
these plasma guys really know what they're doing.

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.540
They have built this thing real well,

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.460
and it's perhaps better positioned for our Wayland future

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:53.300
than I think.

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.660
It's kind of in the dark horse, right?

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:57.700
We talk about Martin's excellent blog posts here and now,

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.980
but they've just been churning away in the background,

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.300
making stuff work.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:06.300
Yeah, and it sort of strikes me that

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:11.060
it is actually visible just Noah and I

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.140
were sitting in the studio.

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:16.540
We had AirMaster running Unity 7, which is good.

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.020
You know, it's pretty performant,

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.220
unless it's been running for a week,

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:22.060
but if you reboot and it's been like 48 hours, it's good.

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.300
And we moved.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.060
We just did like a, we just sat there.

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:26.900
We didn't even stand up.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:27.740
We didn't move.

01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:31.460
We just reloaded the machine to KDE Neon with plasma,

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:32.540
and he and I both look at each other and go,

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.780
this is noticeably faster.

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.540
This is just, we can just look at the screen

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:36.780
and you can just tell it's noticeably faster.

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.380
And that was with the open source driver.

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:39.780
Then we loaded the NVIDIA blob,

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.060
and all of a sudden, it's like, snap.

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:45.460
Yeah, and I know it's a fresh install,

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:46.980
but these aren't, we weren't replacing

01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:48.620
super complicated installs.

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:49.460
These are pretty minimal.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:50.620
They're pretty minimal machines, yeah.

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:53.820
Oh my, it's smooth, it's clear, the transparencies.

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.340
You know, to illustrate that point,

01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:57.060
and you'd have to be there to really understand it,

01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.820
but to illustrate that point, the boot time was so fast

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.700
that he thought, he literally thought

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.100
we were waiting for the BIOS to post

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:07.740
and then getting to BIOS, and it was actually,

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.460
we were waiting for the log on screen to actually show up.

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:15.460
Yeah, and part of it, I think, is I switched out LightDM,

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.020
and I think that makes a difference,

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:20.260
because it doesn't flash as much and all that kind of stuff.

01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:21.100
I know I do this.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.260
I know people that have been listening for a while

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.340
know that Chris moves around.

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:24.380
Chris is on that new thing?

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:27.940
Yeah, no, I know, so I'm doing this specifically

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:30.180
to sort of live client-side decorations for a bit,

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:33.220
live the plasma wayland, just get some perspective

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:36.220
on these particular issues that are coming up

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:38.980
and get a feel for it, and so right now,

01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.900
I'm running here on this XPS 13, plasma,

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:45.620
the current version of plasma for the KDE Neon distribution,

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:50.620
or don't call it a distro, high DPI, Wayland driver,

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:53.580
or using Wayland for display,

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:57.400
and getting great battery life, getting great performance,

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.140
getting noticeably better battery life.

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.620
I did all of Koda Radio.

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.060
I never do a show on battery.

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.580
I never do a show on battery.

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:05.420
Well, you're a professional.

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:07.740
Ever, and we got here in the morning.

01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:09.320
Koda Radio's at noon.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.160
I did the whole show.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.100
I did the morning prep.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.980
I did the show all off on battery.

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:13.820
Wow.

01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:14.640
And then plugged it in later,

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.200
just so that way I wouldn't be inconvenienced later on,

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:20.380
not because I had to, and yeah, I'm just relaying

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.420
if this is something that's crossed your mind,

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:25.060
if you've been wondering about where GNOME's going,

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.620
what's gonna happen with GNOME Shell.

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.940
I noticed, too, on our GNOME, on Reddit,

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:32.460
there are weekly posts about what's going on

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:33.420
with GNOME Shell's lag.

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:34.540
Why is GNOME so laggy?

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.140
There's constant discussion about it.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:38.280
People are starting to see it more and more,

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.460
because there's more people using GNOME than ever before,

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.380
and so more and more people are noticing this stuff,

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:46.900
but you can go to Launchpad and look at the bug tracker

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.780
for 17.10, and look at all the stuff on there

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:53.500
for Wayland and GNOME 3, and see that there's,

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.880
I could be wrong on this,

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.940
because I haven't looked for a month,

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.500
but I think they're getting more bugs related to Wayland

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.340
than they've ever gotten on anything.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.340
Wow.

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:06.900
Yeah, it's not even an LTS release.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:07.960
I'd have to recheck the numbers,

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:11.180
because this was when 17.10 was kind of new,

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.360
but that's not a good sign.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.380
So this has all given me pause recently,

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.220
and it's something that I've been talking to you guys

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:19.900
about behind the scenes, like I am really worried

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:23.600
that we are barreling down the GNOME 3 highway,

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.660
Canonical's shipping it, which means Dell is shipping it,

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:29.380
System76 is basing Pop!OS off of it,

01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:32.060
CentOS and Red Hat are selling to corporate customers

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.580
on GNOME 3, and the more and more esoteric edge cases

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.180
that we bring into the fold,

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.780
and the more desktop use cases that we bring into the fold,

01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:41.980
and the more pressure we're putting on Wayland,

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.500
the more cracks we're seeing, not necessarily in Wayland,

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.500
because Wayland is a protocol.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:48.080
It is all of the software that's attempted

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.500
to write their own implementations.

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:50.340
Yes, exactly.

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:53.080
Yeah, and it's fundamentally bringing up

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.580
architectural issues that we've been able to punt for years

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:59.500
because X helped cover it up, or XYZ helped cover it up.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.580
Or no one was really using anything that used Wayland yet.

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:04.620
And so when you see projects like elementary OS

01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:05.580
that have their own desktop,

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:08.620
or Solus that have their own desktop,

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:11.020
you go, oh, that's sort of why they did that.

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:14.140
That's sort of why they, they must've been hip to this.

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:15.540
They didn't wanna say anything.

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:17.580
You know, it's not cool to publicly shit

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.060
on another open source project,

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:21.120
but behind the scenes they go,

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.300
people are gonna get hip to this,

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.920
and we've gotta come up with something else.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.260
And the Plasma project, to their credit,

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:27.980
has been, since the 5 release,

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.900
has been working at this problem,

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.660
and making their architecture sound,

01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:34.940
and cleaning their house for release after release

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.820
after release, they're now getting into the feature,

01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:39.500
you know, they're now getting into piling

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.460
the features back on.

01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:41.300
Yes.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.180
Which, that'll be interesting to see how that goes,

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.500
because it's been a lot about refinement,

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:46.960
and now Plasma feels like, like 5.13,

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.380
man, they're adding some cool stuff.

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.420
Like, you're gonna have full Chrome integration

01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:52.500
with notifications, so like, downloads in Chrome

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.980
will show up in the Plasma notifications.

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:54.980
Oh, just write in the native notifications?

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:55.820
Oh, wow.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:56.640
You're watching a YouTube video,

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.500
you can click the volume icon on the Plasma desktop,

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.380
you can pause the YouTube video.

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.220
Ah, yes.

01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:02.540
Yeah, like, we're talking like,

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:04.480
nice features are coming.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.320
They just recently.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.160
These are like Windows level features.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.140
Yeah, they just recently introduced the vol,

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:10.220
like, things are good, like, it's good stuff,

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.660
and they're doing a good job of it.

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.580
But they have sort of crossed that threshold

01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:16.940
of refinement, refinement, refinement,

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.240
to let's try doing this now, let's add this.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:22.000
So now they're going down Uncharted Territory 2,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.980
but they do seem to have a better foundation.

01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.400
So how long did it take for you

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.340
to get that up and running, customized,

01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:29.740
and to a way that you could use it?

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:30.580
That's a good question.

01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:32.520
Being deep in Gnomeland, which has a pretty easy

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.540
and, like, well-defined normal.

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:34.380
Two days.

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:35.860
If I could interject, if I could interject,

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:38.020
as far as how long did it take him to use it,

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:41.940
zero, he used it fresh, because he, you installed,

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:43.400
I think you installed some programs,

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.340
like, to get Telegram and stuff,

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:47.060
but you had to do, we didn't have time to customize it.

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.460
So he did show prep.

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:50.740
He did the first, the first day he used it, stock.

01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:51.660
Just stock, yeah, okay.

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:52.740
And then you started tweaking it.

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.020
Yeah, and, you know, in all of the installs,

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:59.320
I also timed how long it took, roughly timed,

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.940
not, like, super anal about it,

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:03.280
but roughly timed how long it took

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.140
before I had to install GTK apps

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:05.980
and a bunch of GTK dependencies.

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.060
Yes, right, oh yeah, that's another factor.

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:11.120
It's about, on average, about 15 minutes.

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.720
Oh, oh, because sometimes I just don't know,

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.780
like, I want a gdebi.

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:17.460
If I'm on an Ubuntu system, I want gdebi.

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.300
It's my favorite.

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:21.740
Turns out there's, like, essentially a cute Debi alternative,

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.740
right, but I didn't know that, I didn't remember.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.660
Takes time to find those alternatives, yeah.

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.520
But sure enough, so one of the things I've done, Wes,

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.140
is I've gone, only you can see this,

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.540
so I'm gonna just tell you, is I've just gone with,

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.580
I've got a lot of windows open.

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.460
I've just gone with a really simple one bar at the bottom,

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:40.540
just a couple of applets here, the clock,

01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:42.340
my task launcher, my virtual desktop.

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.460
Pretty simple, pretty traditional desktop setup.

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:46.620
Yeah, so I'm not going with, like, lots of plasmoids.

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:48.780
I'm not doing, you know, I don't have menu meters

01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:50.900
all over the place, and, you know, stats,

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.740
and big slideshows on my desktop like I've done in the past.

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:56.740
It's just minimal plasma setup, keep it nice,

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:57.860
did a dark theme.

01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:58.700
Yeah, it's handsome.

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.220
I actually installed ArcDark.

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:04.540
And then I went and set ArcDark on the GTK stuff,

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:06.000
because they have, in the plasma settings,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.740
you can go in there and set your GTK appearance settings.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.060
They make it really easy, actually, yeah.

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:12.700
Yeah, yeah, it looks better than it did under Unity 7.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.860
So I'll show you right here, you know.

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:17.380
So when you're in the studio and the machines are rebooted,

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:19.460
as you know, oh, this doesn't have, this is Intel.

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:21.340
But as you know, in the studio on AirMaster,

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.980
when we reboot, you have to launch the NVIDIA control panel.

01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.540
Go reset up all your settings.

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.280
Right, so that way the capture cards work

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.200
and get all the refresh rates right.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:32.780
And it is a bright white GTK application

01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.800
that doesn't match the desktop theme at all,

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.260
because it's being run as pseudo or root or whatever.

01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:39.800
Sure enough, with Plasma Desktop,

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.500
when you set GTK appearances and you say prefer dark themes,

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.280
every GTK app, it fits.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.460
So I actually have my GTK apps, because I'm

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:52.460
using ArcDark in Plasma, and I have my GTK app set to ArcDark,

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:54.660
I can open these apps side by side.

01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:56.340
And you just get one consistent.

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.220
If you took out Sherlock's magnifying glass,

01:19:58.220 --> 01:19:59.860
you could find inconsistencies.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:03.820
Like the OK button on a Qt app is a different shape slightly

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.500
than the GTK version.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.580
But it's the same shading, it's the same theme,

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:11.340
it's the same color, it's the same title bar,

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.820
because I'm not using client-side decorations.

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:18.060
And I opened that, I went, look at this, Noah, look at this.

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:20.020
You can't even tell this is a GTK application.

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.580
If I was an average user, I would be completely oblivious

01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.980
that there was two different toolkits on my screen.

01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:27.700
And that was really nice, because it sort of gave me

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.020
permission to use a couple of GTK apps

01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:31.380
and not feel like I'm paying a penalty.

01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:32.900
You don't have to bend the world to jump into this new place.

01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:34.360
You can just use the software you want.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:34.940
Yep.

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:36.260
So that's where I'm at.

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:40.340
Plus, you combine that with Firefox has a breeze theme,

01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:41.860
a breeze dark theme that you can install

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:45.540
that kind of makes it look nice on the Plasma desktop.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:48.100
Oh, while we're talking about it,

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:51.580
the other thing I did this install around is no Chrome.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.500
Just not even installing Chrome at all.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.460
I'm just going all in on Firefox.

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.620
And Firefox already has some of that integration

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.560
with the Plasma desktop I was talking about for Chrome.

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.100
Firefox already got some of that.

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.340
So you get that stuff today with the current version

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:05.580
of Firefox on the current version of the Plasma desktop.

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:06.580
This is a whole new Chris.

01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:07.980
No longer gnome in Chrome.

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:08.660
I know.

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:09.620
I know.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.660
I know it's weird.

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:14.180
I know, meanwhile, Noah's over there installing Windows.

01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:14.900
Not really.

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:15.580
You know what's funny?

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.180
You really have to be careful.

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:19.820
So I still, to this day, dude, I still

01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:21.980
get telegrams and emails going, dude,

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:23.300
how's FreeBSD working out for you?

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:24.860
Oh, yeah, from that April Fool's.

01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:27.100
The whole episode, we talked about how it was a joke.

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:28.620
At the end, we talked about how it was a joke.

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:30.900
And there are still people that are like,

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.620
I talked about it one time for like 15 minutes.

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.340
And people are like, oh, yeah, he's a BSD guy now.

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:38.820
You're going to actually think I'm installing Windows.

01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:41.100
I do have a backup plan, as JJ asked.

01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:42.700
My backup plan, if for some reason

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:46.020
the Firefoxing doesn't work out, is to maybe go with Vivaldi.

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:48.820
I've been hearing a lot of people talk good stuff.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:52.220
So right before I wiped my boxes, one of them

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:54.300
I put out in Vivaldi.

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.100
It is great.

01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.260
Vivaldi, it is slick.

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.740
It feels faster than regular Chrome.

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.380
I love the way it shows loading stuff.

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.300
If you're on Linux and you want a browser that

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:05.060
feels like it's turned up to 11 a little bit,

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:06.820
Vivaldi is pretty good.

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:08.700
And they just implemented sync support.

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.460
They're getting bigger, I think.

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:12.580
A lot of people are telling me Vivaldi.

01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.820
Have you tried Brave?

01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:15.460
No.

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:16.540
Joe likes Brave.

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.060
He's talked to me a little bit about Brave.

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:18.780
I haven't tried it myself.

01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:20.060
It seems like both have gotten some good buzz.

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:20.420
Yeah.

01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:22.140
Now, Brave's on the desktop too, right?

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.640
Because I think it's available as one

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.300
of the universal packages.

01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:26.380
Yeah.

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.940
Bashful makes a good point about Netflix.

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:31.540
Actually, no, I watched Netflix in the new Firefox.

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:32.300
That's happened.

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:33.220
I've done that.

01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:34.220
I've been there.

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:37.500
I specifically watched 35 Seconds of Star Trek Deep Space

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.660
9 in Firefox just to verify that it worked.

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:41.140
And then I was like, OK, good enough.

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.380
I don't have time right now.

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.900
Anyways, I should probably move on.

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:50.860
But I guess this Snap event, having

01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:54.900
seen people here that really know their stuff talking

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.020
about architectural issues that they're not sure how to solve,

01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:01.620
that they're not even sure they have the leverage upstream

01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:03.540
to have upstream work with them to solve.

01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:04.040
Yeah.

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.520
It sort of underscored some stressing

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.720
that I've been doing about the future of Gnome.

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.480
When Canonical announced that they were switching to Gnome,

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.960
I was pretty excited that we were

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.240
going to have as the same, what is it, a lot of wood

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.280
behind a single arrow?

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:16.440
Yeah.

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.480
Because that's not something we commonly have in open source.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.680
I think that's something these corporate people would say.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.360
And I thought, great.

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.480
This is a great opportunity.

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:24.720
Right, once we have some focus.

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:25.480
Right.

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.080
But what really has given me tremendous pause,

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.480
and maybe this is wrong, I hope.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.480
I hope, and somebody can correct me if I'm wrong,

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.080
but what's giving me tremendous pause as I looked into it

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.000
before this show, at least according to the Gnome wikis,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.240
is they haven't even decided if they're

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.800
going to address these architectural issues.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.280
Wow.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:47.640
That to me is, that just gives me a moment of pause.

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.080
When they're like, yeah, I mean, we

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.920
don't want to break extensions, but we also

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.800
don't like desktops crashing.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.240
Seems like too totally, the thing is, too,

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.040
and the things I find slightly unforgivable,

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.680
and I'll leave it at this, is, yeah,

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.680
I'll leave it at this, is it's not

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:08.200
like multiprocessor architecture was a new concept when

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.000
Gnome Shell came around.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.120
Gnome Shell is a relatively new piece of software,

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.960
and the problems that they failed to solve

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:18.840
were well understood at that point.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:22.280
They made a conscious decision to architect Gnome like this,

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.080
maybe to cut corners, I'm just assuming.

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:27.520
I don't know why you would design a modern desktop

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:29.160
environment like this.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.280
But they did, they made that choice.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:35.880
And now, they seem to be almost willing to repeat

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.560
the mistake again.

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.040
And the worst thing about it is, this is my last point,

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.400
and really, we are so screwed either way.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.300
If they don't fix the problem, then we

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:49.120
have a joke of a primary platform for our desktop

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.160
environment, because it's as bad as classic Mac OS

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.360
at this point.

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:57.320
And if they do solve it, they're throwing out

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:00.200
all of this established momentum behind Gnome 3,

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.040
right as all of this wood is behind the arrow,

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:06.360
and it's the perfect time to seize the developer, DevOps,

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.760
SysOps market, except for, once again, we're

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.320
going to reboot our desktop environment.

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.760
I would submit to you that we are far more screwed if they

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.920
decide not to fix the problem.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.880
I really think, because I really think,

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.180
even if everyone comes onto Linux, and I agree,

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:23.760
it's a really terrible time, for like the third time in a row,

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.800
so it's like we have a habit of really terrible timing.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:26.600
Yes, we do.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:29.480
But at least there is light at the end of the tunnel,

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:32.880
because right now, you're going to have a bunch of people

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:35.600
coming over, and Gnome 3 is not great to begin with.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.400
I love it.

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:37.080
No, no, no.

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.720
As far as if you sit down at stock Gnome 3, it's not great.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.880
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.840
I've got to at least put minimize and maximize back on.

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.080
And you know how to do that, a lot of people.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.920
And so we're already starting behind the curve,

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.360
and now we're going to add to the fact that at some point

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.360
in the distant future, either we're

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.560
going to deal with a crappy desktop for a little bit,

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.400
or a desktop with a huge problem,

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.800
or we're going to have to reboot it somewhere down the road

01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.040
after everyone's already switched.

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.960
Those are not good options to me.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.840
I would have Dan chime in, but I know we've got to move on,

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.920
because I didn't want this to be a Gnome bashing thing,

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.240
because I love the Gnome project.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.600
I love the Gnome desktop, but Dan makes a good point

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.120
in the Discord chat room that this is really

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.040
kind of a consequence in a way of designing for Wayland

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.360
and trying to either have this IPC system that

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.320
is secure and safe, versus just not even bothering

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.720
with that particular problem.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.240
And I can completely understand that.

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.480
So either way, and you know what,

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.880
I'm still very appreciative of the hard work they have done,

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.000
even if we're at this point.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.360
I do really appreciate it.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:33.080
And when it's working right, nothing

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:34.320
sings to me like Gnome 3 does.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.080
It's really great.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.440
So I'll leave it at that for now.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.520
But if you've been thinking about that,

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.480
I'd say go give KDE Neon a try.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.720
It's a pretty great way to get your hands on KDE Neon.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.960
And it's one of the strengths, right?

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.920
It's a part of the open source Linux community.

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.880
We do have options, and it's worth our time

01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:49.000
to explore those and take advantage.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.560
Speaking of those options, let's wrap this up

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:53.320
on one of the favorite applications

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.320
I came on when I was using Gnome.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.920
I was looking for client-side decorated apps,

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.640
and I came across Tilex.

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:02.200
Tilex?

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.840
It's a replacement for Gnome Terminal.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.480
OK, I thought this was like a shower cleaning tool.

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:06.200
I know, right?

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:07.480
It's a pod that you can eat.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:08.640
Oh, yeah.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.920
I was like, how is Gnome Terminal not client-side

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:12.440
decorated?

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440
Like, what is going on?

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.400
This is their terminal.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.040
Yeah, so I wanted to find one that was,

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.280
and I came across Tilex.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.320
And as the name kind of implies, it's

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.840
a Tiling Terminal emulator that follows the Gnome head.

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:25.520
It uses client-side decorations.

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.720
And it lets you split it into multiple,

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.880
like vertical, horizontal panels.

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.000
You can synchronize input across all of them.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
It supports persistent layout.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.280
It has very good transparency support,

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.160
unlike the regular Gnome Terminal.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.240
Drag and drop support, notifications

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.560
that can actually go into the Gnome notifications area,

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.920
custom links, which are nice.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.480
You can click on hyperlinks and add custom terminal hyperlinks

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.800
to open things in your terminal.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:53.760
And you can layer the panes, if you will, the west panes.

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.280
You can put them in any arrangement

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.640
that you really like.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.840
And so what I did is I also combined that

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.160
with an extension for Gnome Shell that

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.640
allowed me to always open up applications

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.240
on a certain virtual desktop.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:10.080
So Tilex always opens up on virtual desktop 3,

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:10.880
for example.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.400
That's your terminal desktop.

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:15.680
Slack and Telegram on desktop 2, and they're

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.720
tiled next to each other.

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:17.440
That's awesome.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:20.120
Yeah, and so it was a nice workflow

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:21.760
when you combine that extension.

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.960
So I always knew my terminal was always here.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.040
Everything in its right place.

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.560
Yeah, I always have Guake I can go to for a quick install.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:30.400
But when it's time to sit down and live

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:33.040
in the shell for 20 minutes or something like that,

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.280
or I want to kick off a job and just check in on it

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.760
with a quick virtual desktop dropdown, this was it.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.800
Tilex, you can find a link in the show notes

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.680
because the URL is sort of crazy.

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:45.600
But you can also just Google T-I-L-I-X, the advanced GTK3

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:49.240
tiling terminal emulator that has client-side decorations,

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:51.920
which is really what I was just trying to all in on CSDs

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:52.520
if I could.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.040
It's also kind of nice that it feels sort of modern,

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:58.520
and I feel like a lot of times terminal emulators feel

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.320
like somehow Mac still has one of the best ones,

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.200
yet we are the terminal people.

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.040
So that's nice, too.

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.440
Somebody could tell this project about the good word

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.940
of universal package formats, though,

01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:13.400
because they literally have packages for Antigros, ASIC OS.

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:16.080
I don't even know, Arch Linux, CentOS, 7.3, Debian, Fedora,

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:19.120
OpenSUSE, Ubuntu, and then they just make a targes available

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:23.240
if you just want to pull it down in old school.

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:24.080
I love it, though.

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.520
Of course, it's open source.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.040
They have it up on GitHub.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:30.560
And you can also find it on the hashtag,

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.920
hashtag Termex in the IRC free note.

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.760
Well, you know what?

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.480
I'll be installing later today.

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.720
Yeah, that is pretty cool.

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:41.320
And it kind of makes me miss Nome a little bit,

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.280
kind of makes me does.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.440
Console is pretty solid, too.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.920
Console supports some of the stuff, just out of the box.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.040
I'm just saying.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.040
All right, well, that's going to bring us

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.040
to the end of this program, because we

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:50.880
got to get the heck out of here.

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.480
So that way, the Ask Noah show continues on.

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.960
So if you're joining live, don't go anywhere,

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.280
because the fun, you just got through the first part

01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.200
of the sandwich, really.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.680
And now there is the other half of the sandwich

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.400
and some homemade potato chips.

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.600
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:03.880
There's a nice aioli on there.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:06.200
Oh, yeah, maybe a little chipotle aioli,

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.560
a little brownberry aioli, that's on there, too.

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:09.840
So go get more Wes Payne.

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.440
He's at Wes Payne on the Twitters.

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.000
That's right.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.800
And TechSnap.Systems, for our other program,

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.520
covered all kinds of stuff, including some meltdown

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:18.840
and specter issues.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.840
And like we said earlier, Kubernetes,

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:25.160
you can get some more Noah in your face at asknoahshow.com.

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.480
That's Noah's main landing page.

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:29.000
I think he has a Twitter account.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.400
It's at ChrisLES, I think.

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:30.920
That's right.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:31.560
Yes, it is.

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.800
Stealing my Twitter.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:36.560
At criticalinuxtheshow, at AskNoahShow.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.400
The AskNoah dashboard, asknoahshow.com.

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.120
I said that part.

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:39.640
Oh, did you?

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:40.160
Oh, sorry.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.240
No, I said mine.

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.360
Once you get me started, I'm like, you know, I just.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.040
You're good.

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:48.320
And sure enough, if Noah didn't pull off a live broadcast

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.360
from the car on the drive down here yesterday,

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:53.680
he did a live, he did like a 15, 20 minute live show

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.160
from the car on the drive down here.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:59.160
So yeah, that piece of gear he brought with him is pretty.

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.600
Only because you said I couldn't.

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:01.560
Yeah, exactly.

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:03.680
It seems like we just strapped that right to his back.

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.320
He can walk around, just be on air all the time.

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:06.080
Just give him time.

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.520
It'll probably happen.

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:09.360
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:12.240
You can join us live, jplive.tv, jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.360
slash calendar for the live time.

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.880
And last but not least, linuxunplugged.reddit.com

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:20.400
and jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact for all the ways

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.680
to get a hold of us.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:22.800
We'll be back next week.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:23.720
Thanks for joining us.

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:41.400
I'll see you next Tuesday.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.440
How to contain the code, know his magic box.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.360
Containing the future?

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:49.860
No.

01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:54.420
Oh, that's kind of, I don't know, I wouldn't click that.

01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:57.980
Future is a snap.

01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:00.220
A pod you can eat.

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.340
Crafting of snaps.

01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:05.100
Hey, I'm not at the studio, and I just

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:06.540
want to make sure that this is actually going to work.

01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:08.620
So can you just say hi to me and just make sure

01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:11.620
that this is working, Sarah?

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:12.700
Hi, yeah, I can hear you.

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:13.300
Thank you.

01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:14.340
Yeah, OK, thank you.

01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:16.780
Yep.

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:18.180
Do, do, do, do, do.

01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:19.780
Live from locations.

01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:21.620
This is a pretty crazy setup we have.

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:22.540
You're talking with Sarah.

01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.820
We're talking about Mumble Room.

01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:26.220
Those people in the Mumble Room are literally all over the world,

01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:28.780
and we're sitting here in Seattle in a hotel room right now.

01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:31.940
And there's like, what, at best, a 2, 3, 4, 15 millisecond,

01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.460
30 millisecond delay between us?

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.060
Wild.

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:34.940
Remarkable.

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:35.900
And none of us are using a phone.

01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:37.740
Well, Sarah is probably using a phone.

01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:39.860
Yeah, so one of us is even on a phone.

01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:41.980
That's crazy.

01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:43.100
That is amazing, really.

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.500
Confluence of technology.

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.860
All right, the only thing we can't do

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:46.820
is pick a title, apparently.

01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:48.220
So we've got to do that, because the Ask No Shows

01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:50.260
are the ones we're worst at.

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:51.940
There's also stuff going on in Discord.

01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:54.260
Now that he has his own show, isn't that interesting?

01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:55.420
Now that you've got your own show,

01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:56.860
you turn around on the title thing.

01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:58.020
Let's see how it is.

01:32:58.020 --> 01:32:58.500
I see it.

01:32:58.500 --> 01:32:59.300
You giving me shit?

01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:01.940
45 episodes in, and I still didn't care about titles.

01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:03.900
And it wasn't until you were like, here's what happened,

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:05.940
because he's really good at this.

01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:06.460
Great.

01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:07.500
I know it's going to be bad.

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:08.660
No, he's really good at this.

01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:11.780
So he knows if he just comes out and says, you're an idiot,

01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:14.540
you should do this, I'll be like, I'm not an idiot.

01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:15.300
Let me show you why.

01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.620
I'm never going to do that ever again.

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:18.980
And he uses that in the opposite way, too.

01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:19.980
You can't do a live broadcast.

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:20.780
We do a live broadcast.

01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.300
You won't be able to do that.

01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:26.220
So he tells me, I give him this idea, I'm bouncing it off,

01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:28.860
and he answers all of my questions exactly how he has.

01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:30.620
And doesn't say, don't do that, do this.

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.540
Answers all of them just exactly the way.

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:36.140
Two hours go by, then I get a message.

01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:42.500
Hey, I say this with love, but I just want you to consider,

01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:46.900
you could do all of that work, or you could pay some attention

01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.500
to titles.

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:49.260
And description.

01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:50.220
And description.

01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:52.220
And it would make a really big difference.

01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:53.460
And you could just try it, just see,

01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.260
that's just a thought for you or whatever.

01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:57.660
And what's funny is, see, my mind, he knows how my mind works.

01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:59.020
And this just floats in over Telegram, right?

01:33:59.020 --> 01:33:59.940
So you can see this friendly message.

01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:02.060
And the thing is, I'm sure this is planned in his mind.

01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:03.620
In my mind, I'm just like, oh, that

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:04.580
was a nice little follow-up.

01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:05.940
Yeah, that's a really great idea.

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:08.580
And then when I go back and read it, I'm like, wait a minute.

01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:10.660
Well, I mean, it's your call.

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:11.580
I'm not like, yeah.

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:13.300
No, but so anyway, so then I did.

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.500
And sure enough, you start looking at the download numbers

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.020
when you actually pay attention to the title, turns out

01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:17.780
it really matters.

01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:20.160
The guy that's been podcasting for 15 years

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.500
actually knows something about podcasting.

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:23.500
Pretty darn smart.

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:24.540
Oh, well.

01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:26.020
Damn you, Chris.

01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:29.100
The check is in, or the bill is in the mail, Noah.

01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:30.380
Sprint, snap, and core.

01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:31.580
Here's what I came up with.

01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:34.420
I came up with peeking at canonical

01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:35.940
and behind canonical's curtain.

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.300
I kind of like behind canonical's curtain.

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:38.060
Yeah, that's nice.

01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:39.180
It's got a ring to it.

01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:39.580
OK.

01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:40.740
We should probably just go with that,

01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:42.540
so that way we can get out of here fast, Noah.

01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:43.860
But thank you guys for helping.

01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:44.660
Because I did face-hustle.

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.100
If people aren't interested in canonical,

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:47.860
then they probably aren't interested in this episode.

01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:48.900
That's a good point.

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:49.940
That's a good point.

01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:51.500
Mac OS Terminal is the worst.

01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:52.000
I agree.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.300
I guess it doesn't have Plasma or Gnome in it.

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:54.220
That's the only thing.

01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:57.220
But also, it's not that, like, we talk about that all the time.

01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:59.180
Yeah, we literally do.

01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.060
I almost didn't even want to mention the fact

01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.300
that I'd move back to Plasma because I'm like,

01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:04.300
geez, people have got to be sick and tired of this.

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:05.780
But you're all over the place, Waffler.

01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:06.260
I know.

01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:07.780
Well, I really thought, the only reason,

01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:08.820
I thought I was moved in.

01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:10.380
I thought I'd moved into Unity.

01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:12.700
You know, I set up my lights outside.

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.420
I got my rugs down.

01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:15.740
I got my couches moved in.

01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.180
I put my big screen TV up.

01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:18.660
I thought I was set.

01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:21.380
And then I realized that my neighbors were assholes

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:23.820
and that my foundation was leaking and that my roof sucks.

01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:25.700
So I was like, well, now what am I going to do?

01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:26.460
Move to an RV.

01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:26.980
Yeah.

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:44.740
The RV in Plasma.
