1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
I'm looking over my predictions before we get started,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,880
and I think my Rocky Linux prediction is just too weak.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,240
I predicted they'd ship,

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,960
and I'm just disqualifying that one.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,320
Oh, I've got a good one about that.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,160
Oh, you do?

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,980
Yeah.

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,280
Do you want it now or later?

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,200
No, no, actually, you know what?

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,040
Save it for the show.

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:30,840
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show,

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,560
episode 386, one of my favorite episode numbers.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,640
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru,

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,800
the leader in hands-on learning.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,400
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,240
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs,

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,040
Cloud Linux servers, and much more.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,840
Get your hands cloudy at cloudguru.com.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,860
My name is Chris.

20
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Wes.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,360
Hello, Wes.

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,280
You brought a big crowd with you today.

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,560
So right off the top here,

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,520
let's welcome back to the show Joe, Alex, and Drew.

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,880
Hello, gentlemen.

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,520
Hello, Mike.

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,080
Good to have all of you back.

28
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,120
This has become an annual tradition now

29
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,600
where we make our predictions and review how we've done.

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,760
Sometimes we break it up into multiple episodes.

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,520
This year, we're gonna try to just put it all into one show.

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,080
See, just get it done.

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,240
This is the last production of 2020.

34
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,440
Thank goodness.

35
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,920
And to help us celebrate and throw in a few predictions

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,840
of their own, it is our virtual lug.

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,720
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,120
Good morning, Mumble Room.

39
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,680
Okay, okay.

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,360
That's a big crowd in there and a lot of energy in there.

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,200
You know, it's that pre-show.

42
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,720
We get them all warmed up with the pre-show.

43
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,520
Carl, I see you just snuck in under the radar there.

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,360
Hello, Carl.

45
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,180
Good to have you back.

46
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,020
Howdy, howdy.

47
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,440
And Palby, good to have you back too, sir.

48
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,400
Hello, hello.

49
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,320
Greetings.

50
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Now, I wanna hear all of your predictions here in a bit,

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,240
so get thinking.

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,440
And I think you have the luxury

53
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,600
of not being held accountable for your predictions.

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,400
We do write them down, right, Ben?

55
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,120
You're gonna write these ones down, right?

56
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,440
Yeah, a little bit.

57
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,400
I'm counting on you.

58
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,080
There will be a document with your prediction written down,

59
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,800
but we won't play it back and shame you for it

60
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,040
like we're gonna do ours.

61
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,220
So let's get right to it,

62
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,340
because I wanna just do this in a couple of pieces.

63
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,880
We'll start with the reviews,

64
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,160
and then we'll do the predictions.

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,680
And just like last year, Joe is here to play a judge,

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,120
jury, and coach, I guess, ref.

67
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,400
Joe, are you ready to get started with the reviews?

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,660
Should we start with Alex?

69
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,600
Yeah, let's do it.

70
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,280
Oh, I don't know if I'm ready for that.

71
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,920
I know, but let's just get, it's like a band-aid.

72
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,360
We're just gonna rip it off, okay?

73
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
Okay. All right.

74
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,700
So you made a prediction about hard drive sizes.

75
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,320
There will be a three and a half inch hard drive

76
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,640
available to consumers of at least 20 terabytes in capacity.

77
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,840
Now, I don't know if that's actually happened, Alex.

78
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,760
Ding, ding.

79
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,640
There's 24 terabytes hard drives now.

80
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,720
Oh, no kidding!

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,400
Really? Do you have a link for that?

82
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,000
Can we verify that for the judge really quick?

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
We may have a winner.

84
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,880
He has strict standards, that judge.

85
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,720
That's great, Alex.

86
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,960
I think, oh, we're starting off with a winner.

87
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,000
That's fantastic.

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,840
I love it.

89
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,280
At 100 terabytes,

90
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,380
it's the largest solid state drive right now,

91
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,080
the Nimbus Data ExaDrive, 100 terabytes.

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,600
Wow. Can you actually buy that though?

93
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,920
In September, they said it would be here by Christmas.

94
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,840
Any idea on the price,

95
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,480
or is it like not actually listed yet?

96
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,320
100 terabytes.

97
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,220
I mean, imagine essentially your entire storage capacity,

98
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,160
Alex, in one disk.

99
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,060
Yeah.

100
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,180
That would really be something.

101
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,300
So yeah, I guess you definitely got that one right.

102
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,240
We're giving that one to you.

103
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,520
Imagine the RAID rebuild times on that mother.

104
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
Jeez.

105
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,160
And the trickery they're pulling off,

106
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,360
I'm sure just to get that possible.

107
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,400
Okay, Alex, two more for you.

108
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,720
The next one has a good shot too.

109
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,840
You made a prediction about Jellyfin.

110
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,600
I predict that MB or Jellyfin or Olaris

111
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,000
will become a viable alternative to Plex

112
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,600
by shipping apps on one of the major platforms

113
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,320
such as Roku, Android TV, or Apple TV.

114
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,280
Okay, a Jellyfin app on Roku or Android TV.

115
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,000
I think that exists, but I'm not positive.

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,960
Does anybody?

117
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,480
I mean, you can find Jellyfin

118
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,200
over in the Roku store, it looks like.

119
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,360
There's Jellyfin for Android TV and Google Play.

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,520
Alex.

121
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,320
Two for two, hell yeah.

122
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,040
I mean, see, you thought it was gonna be rough, man,

123
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,860
but I'm saying.

124
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,280
Can I be the referee on that terrible sound

125
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,880
and say, please don't play that, Chris?

126
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,840
Yeah, I don't like that.

127
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,680
I don't like that.

128
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,320
I hate it too.

129
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,160
I just found it.

130
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,800
You missed your sound swap.

131
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
All right, Alex, your last prediction.

132
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,720
Let's see what you said about WireGuard.

133
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,520
So I predict that Ubuntu LTS 2004

134
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,640
will ship with WireGuard, not as a DKMS module,

135
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,120
and also as a second, like half prediction,

136
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,280
that PF Sense will ship with WireGuard.

137
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,760
Okay, I think the Ubuntu part's right,

138
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,920
although we may have known at that point.

139
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760
Do you know, Ref?

140
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,640
Do you know when we found out that that was gonna happen,

141
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,240
or Poppy, maybe you might know when that decision was made?

142
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm pretty sure we knew at that point.

143
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,120
No, we definitely didn't.

144
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,320
I wouldn't have been so callous

145
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,080
and predicted something I already knew.

146
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,840
So what about the PF Sense part?

147
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,520
Also, do we have any, can we check on that?

148
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,200
No, so PF Sense is still just a plugin.

149
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,520
In fact, I don't even know if it,

150
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,120
because I've switched to OpenSense now,

151
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,180
because of WireGuard support, so.

152
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,120
It was right on the line last December, right?

153
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,240
It had been pulled into the NetDev tree,

154
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,920
but not actually into Linus's tree around this time?

155
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,600
But the Ubuntu one was definitely not certain

156
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,400
until 2004 shipped.

157
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,800
Yeah, I think I'm gonna give it to you.

158
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
I'm gonna give it to you, I think.

159
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,600
I mean, Ref, you can talk me out of it.

160
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,640
I don't have to warm the point,

161
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,580
because you get the call.

162
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,920
I don't mean to overstep,

163
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,640
but I actually, I'm thinking about it,

164
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,120
and I don't know that we knew for certain

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,480
it wouldn't be like DKMS,

166
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,240
or it wouldn't be some sort of weird.

167
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,880
If I recall correctly, it was very much targeted

168
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,400
at that point, but it hadn't been 100% decided,

169
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,300
so it was a bit of an easy prediction,

170
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,680
but I think we have to give it to him.

171
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,800
All right, good job, Alex.

172
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
Jeez, that's all three for you, Alex.

173
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,320
You got three, yeah.

174
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,000
Jeez, you really, now the pressure's on.

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,640
You really better not disappoint this year.

176
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,360
Do I get a prize, by the way, for getting all three right?

177
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,600
Yeah, but you gotta come to Washington

178
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,520
to get it, unfortunately.

179
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,000
Or you've got a 3D printed for yourself.

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,640
Yeah, oh yeah.

181
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,480
Thanks, Joe.

182
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,380
All right, I think I'll hold mine.

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,400
I think I'll hold mine.

184
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,220
I'll do mine next, but let's do Wes,

185
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,040
because I've got Wes, you queue it up next here.

186
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,040
I guess we're not doing alphabetical anymore.

187
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,260
Oh boy, Wes, I really wish this one came true.

188
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,880
You made a prediction about BcashFS.

189
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,560
I predict that in 2020, BcashFS makes it

190
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,280
into the Linux kernel mainline.

191
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,940
Ah, man.

192
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,800
No luck for me there, or for any of the rest of us.

193
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,520
Ironically, I just made that my prediction

194
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,440
on Linux Action News.

195
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,440
We have another set of maybe more professional picks

196
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
on Linux Action News, or predictions, I should say,

197
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,520
and that was one of mine, hint, hint.

198
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,160
Yeah, I feel a little bolstered by that.

199
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,280
You know, like it's not unreasonable,

200
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,660
but at the same time, I'm sort of happy to see things

201
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,040
continuing to develop nicely,

202
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,720
but you know, with still a few rough edges

203
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,080
and not getting rushed.

204
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,760
I'd like it to be a file system I trust

205
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,900
once it's ready and in the kernel.

206
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,080
I want to give some latitude to the ref

207
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,520
on this next prediction,

208
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,860
because I think it's kind of like half and half.

209
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,400
It was about me and what distro and desktop environment

210
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,220
I would be using at this point.

211
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,440
I predict that by the next predictions episode,

212
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,600
you, my friend, will be on Manjaro.

213
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,780
Now, I think you also, but in the less shortened version,

214
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,760
said I'd probably be on Plasma too, if I recall.

215
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,640
I did predict you'd be on Plasma.

216
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,720
Yeah, but that wasn't, but what was in the locked version

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,440
is Manjaro, and while I have Manjaro on a device,

218
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,280
I'm actually on a mix, I'm on a mix of Fedora and Arch,

219
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,660
or I guess you could say Endeavor OS.

220
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,500
Does that count?

221
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,820
No, that doesn't count as Manjaro.

222
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,560
What's on your upstairs desktop in your office

223
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,800
and what's on your laptop?

224
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,360
I think it's got to be one of those two.

225
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,480
So the laptop's Fedora, and then the desktop upstairs

226
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,440
is Endeavor OS, or Arch.

227
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,520
That was close though, Wes.

228
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,420
Yeah, I think I was in the right vein of things

229
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,160
in that I didn't think Endeavor OS would be where it is today

230
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,240
and really be an option, so I think Manjaro was like,

231
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,160
that's the Arch that Chris would actually use,

232
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,880
and it turns out there's a slightly closer to Arch

233
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,320
version of that, and okay, that makes sense.

234
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,120
And I think the part that didn't make it in the locked-in

235
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,040
prediction, because just for the rules for those

236
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,340
that haven't listened to the previous one,

237
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,680
we have to lock in the predictions,

238
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,840
so when we get to our predictions,

239
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,520
we're gonna work them out as a group,

240
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,960
and then we decide on a locked-in version,

241
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,040
we make it nice and concise, and then we lock that in.

242
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,400
And in our conversations, Wes, what I recall

243
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,040
was that you were doing the plasma math,

244
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,120
and you were saying, I think you're gonna be on plasma,

245
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,180
and if you're gonna be on plasma,

246
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,400
you're probably gonna be on an Arch,

247
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,300
and at that point in time, it was just,

248
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,800
it was really likely gonna be Manjaro.

249
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,520
The curveball is, is I didn't appreciate the fact

250
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,400
that the fedora spin of plasma has very frequent

251
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,120
KDE neon-style plasma updates.

252
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,500
It's, you know, you're really, you're getting

253
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,660
fresh plasma in there, and that was the part

254
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,040
that was kind of unknown to us back then

255
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,240
that I only discovered, you know, a few weeks ago

256
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,160
when Neil told me.

257
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,800
So there's that, and I think that threw you

258
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,320
a curveball in the whole thing.

259
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,160
Hmm, so you're saying maybe there's a new prediction

260
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,360
for next year buried in here.

261
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,600
You probably ought to give us, you could give a stab at it,

262
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
you never know.

263
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm not gonna reveal, though, which one I think it is.

264
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,240
All right, you got one more, Wes,

265
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,440
and it was about Google Stadia.

266
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,600
It doesn't make me happy to say,

267
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,280
but I predict that by the end of 2020,

268
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,440
Google will have announced the sunsetting of Stadia.

269
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,640
Gladly not.

270
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,360
Yeah, yeah, so I didn't realize they were in year two

271
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,000
of this thing, but I guess we're entering year two of Stadia.

272
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,200
I wonder, too, it seems like it's, you know,

273
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,800
it definitely felt kind of stagnant, not a lot of news,

274
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,000
but it being one of the better places

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,560
to play Cyberpunk, I think has bolstered it a little bit,

276
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
at least in the past, you know, couple weeks.

277
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,480
True.

278
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,960
That and the fact they gave it away for free

279
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,320
whenever you bought a Chromecast

280
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,720
and stuff like that for a while.

281
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,560
Yes.

282
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,280
And during COVID, it was free for like two months.

283
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,400
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,480
I think the whole COVID and the lockdown has boosted a lot.

285
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,280
Yeah, and honestly, there was just no way

286
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,000
I was gonna upgrade my PC to play Cyberpunk.

287
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,240
I just won't get the return

288
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,960
on that kind of investment right now,

289
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,040
and I just was not gonna consider it.

290
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,320
But when I realized it was on Stadia,

291
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,040
and I had like some sort of founder's credit or something,

292
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,720
so I basically got it for a super cheap price,

293
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,760
and I was like, okay, well, that'll do.

294
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,240
And I still wish to this day that if I buy a game on Stadia,

295
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,960
it came with some sort of Steam redemption code

296
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,760
or some other platform,

297
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,400
because if I'm paying full price,

298
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,920
it really makes me tap the brakes before I use Stadia,

299
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,720
because just like Wes, I did in 2020,

300
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,440
I think you could predict this year they spin it down.

301
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,880
It's still not a guaranteed lock for me,

302
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,960
because it's Google,

303
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,560
and I don't feel comfortable spending full retail price

304
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,120
for a game that's in Stadia.

305
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,280
But if I can get discounts here and there from Google,

306
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,360
I've taken action on them,

307
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,080
and as a result, I've got Red Dead Redemption in there,

308
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,040
I've got a couple of freebie games that they gave out,

309
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,640
and I've got Cyberpunk 2077.

310
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,800
And I know people aren't gonna believe it,

311
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,120
but I have to tell you,

312
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,720
I sit here in the studio at this very computer,

313
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,080
which is not a really nice computer anymore,

314
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,880
and I play Cyberpunk on the live stream,

315
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,520
and I live stream playing Cyberpunk

316
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,960
with graphics that I think look great,

317
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,400
and I have zero issues with latency,

318
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,440
with how it plays at all,

319
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,240
and I'm not on a fantastic connection,

320
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,920
I'm on a fast for Comcast connection.

321
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
And it's real,

322
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
and it means I can sit here

323
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,200
and do it with free open source drivers.

324
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,320
You just don't have to worry about it, right?

325
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,200
It's just another service that you have access to.

326
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,640
You can pop on, play some games,

327
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,080
and then go back to editing things in nano,

328
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,000
if that's what you wanna do.

329
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,320
Okay, so I just came across Drew's prediction,

330
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,240
and it threw me for a loop,

331
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,680
because it was a Drew prediction via Brent,

332
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,000
because Drew couldn't make it.

333
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
That's not fair, everyone likes Brent.

334
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,480
I feel like I should get all my predictions read

335
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,960
in Brent's voice, just to have a better shot at winning.

336
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,120
Yeah, hold on here.

337
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,200
That's a great point.

338
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,440
I didn't know having Brent read stuff for us

339
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,400
was even an option.

340
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,720
I would like to take advantage of that too.

341
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,880
Me too, sign me up.

342
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,660
Brent is a service.

343
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,480
All right, brace yourself, Drew.

344
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,640
You made a prediction about home assistants

345
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,560
like the Alexa and Google Assistant,

346
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,560
and it goes a little bit like this.

347
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,800
I believe in 2020,

348
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,680
we will see one of the voice assistant platforms,

349
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,680
one of the Pepsi or Cola,

350
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,680
get a malicious exploit that is active in the wild.

351
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,160
It's a little vague, Ref.

352
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,400
I don't know, but what are you thinking on this one?

353
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,680
I don't think that I've seen one.

354
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,160
I haven't read about one, so.

355
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,800
There was one in August of 2020,

356
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,800
but it wasn't named, it wasn't huge news.

357
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,440
So I don't know, I don't know if I would count it.

358
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Okay, so there's actually been two different ones

359
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,720
because I followed InfoSec fairly closely.

360
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,840
One allowed people to install applications

361
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,040
bypassing your install account stuff.

362
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,840
The other one actually allowed someone

363
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,160
to put a malicious app on the Amazon Alexa

364
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,720
and turn on the microphone remotely.

365
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,040
It actually got a CVE, if I remember correctly.

366
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,760
If you got a CVE, then you get the point.

367
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Right, right.

368
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,640
Yeah, boy, it'd be great to find links for that,

369
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,960
but that actually does sound like you might've got it, Ref.

370
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,400
Yeah, I would say so.

371
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,220
Woo-hoo!

372
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,060
Nice job, Drew.

373
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,320
I mean, I think that was one of the more kind of,

374
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm not gonna say risky picks, but more out there ones

375
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,280
just because it was even kind of debatable right now

376
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,080
what happened, but if it's got a CVE, I say,

377
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,920
there it is right there.

378
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,880
Boom, Popeye has it.

379
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,720
Hey.

380
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,840
Yeah, ha-ha.

381
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,680
Good job, Drew.

382
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,520
You only got the one via Brent,

383
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,440
so unlike the traditional three, you just had that one.

384
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,360
But you can come up with up to three today if you'd like,

385
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,420
but start ruminating now

386
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,800
because it's gonna be timed shortly.

387
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,080
But first, let's get to my three and see how I did.

388
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,680
And I remember feeling like some of these were a long shot.

389
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,060
So we start with my prediction about Home Assistant,

390
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,540
which I actually didn't know made it into the show,

391
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,840
but I guess I locked it in.

392
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,120
In 2020, we will see the introduction

393
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,320
of a Home Assistant box,

394
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
either by the project directly or a third party bundler

395
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,080
that creates a Home Assistant appliance.

396
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,160
And this just recently happened.

397
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,360
The Home Assistant Blue.

398
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,160
I can't believe the timing on that, Chris.

399
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,120
Yeah, in fact, not only did they announce it, Alex,

400
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,920
but a few people have started receiving their units in 2020.

401
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,240
The Home Assistant Blue, yeah, good job.

402
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,720
It's based around the Odroid N2 Plus, I think.

403
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,160
Oh, I'm really, I don't remember making that prediction.

404
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,520
So I was totally surprised when they did it,

405
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,040
which is funny because usually my predictions,

406
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,220
like I hold onto them all year waiting for them to happen,

407
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,840
but this year I just threw it out in the universe

408
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,400
and let it go and look what happened.

409
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,040
All right, right, so Ref, if you agree, that's a winner?

410
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,880
Yep.

411
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,480
Okay, my next, oh, this doesn't look good.

412
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,720
My next prediction was about Plasma and Chrome OS.

413
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,160
I predict in 2020 that by some means,

414
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,120
it will be possible to run Plasma Shell

415
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,140
on top of Chrome OS before the end of the year.

416
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,640
I mean, it seems like it should have happened

417
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,920
with all the Linux stuff they were doing and running apps,

418
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,760
but as far as I know,

419
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,400
you can't actually get all Plasma Shell up

420
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,160
on Chrome OS still.

421
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,360
Damn shame.

422
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,280
That should have happened.

423
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,640
I think that's a loser, Ref.

424
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,520
Yeah, I think so,

425
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,160
because I would have noticed that

426
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,720
if it had happened this year,

427
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,200
but unless it's on some obscure forum somewhere,

428
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,840
no, don't think you get the point.

429
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Maybe it's possible, maybe via container,

430
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,080
but I don't think so.

431
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,000
I know some people run KD Neon in Docker,

432
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,840
but I don't think so.

433
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,200
I'm not gonna try to fight that.

434
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,720
All right, this one also looks like

435
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,920
it's another loser for me.

436
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,720
I made a prediction about Ubuntu deploying Wayland.

437
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,440
I predict in 2020 that Canonical

438
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,520
will switch the Ubuntu release over to Wayland

439
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,880
in their 2010 release.

440
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,160
That also, it definitely did not happen.

441
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,160
Although I have installed Wayland on Ubuntu 2010,

442
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,080
and that works just fine.

443
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,640
Well, look at you.

444
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah, unfortunately,

445
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,880
Poppy, what do you think the chances are

446
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,280
that there'll be another shot at it

447
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,440
before the next LTS, like the release before?

448
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,960
You can't ask something like that

449
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,920
right before the prediction segment.

450
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,680
Oh, ah, okay.

451
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
All right, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough.

452
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,480
Let me just quickly write down a prediction.

453
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,320
Yeah.

454
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,640
I think I clearly got that one wrong, Raph.

455
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,160
I don't think there's any arguing that.

456
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah.

457
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,520
All right, then one last prediction,

458
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,360
and that was from you,

459
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
and I only have one for you here, Joe.

460
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,840
So here we go.

461
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,760
All right, well, I'll give you an absolutely crazy one.

462
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,240
Chrome OS will add ZFS support.

463
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,640
Ah, I'm gonna say a big no on that one there, Joe.

464
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,600
Yeah, no ZFS support on Chrome OS.

465
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,160
They did get ButterFS support, but no ZFS support.

466
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,760
Yeah, that was just me being as ridiculous as possible

467
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,880
at the end of the episode.

468
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,240
Yeah, fair enough.

469
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,560
Well, you don't get that free

470
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,720
or meaningless internet point anyways.

471
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,920
All right, so there we go.

472
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,200
I gotta say, Alex, I think you clearly did the best.

473
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,880
I mean, I guess Drew got all of his right too,

474
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,560
but that's because he only did one.

475
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,120
We both got 100%, Drew, good job.

476
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Now, to be fair, I did submit like four or five,

477
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,400
but only one of them got read, so.

478
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,840
Oh, hmm.

479
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,720
Sounds like there is probably a case for you

480
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,080
to file with the Brent as a service company.

481
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,120
Yeah, I'll submit a ticket on that, yeah.

482
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,040
What we need to do is pay for the pro Slack,

483
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,120
and then we can scroll back and see what they were.

484
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
Right, yeah, that's probably it.

485
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,360
That's how we'll do it.

486
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
I will unlock it.

487
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Good job, Alex.

488
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,160
But yeah, I think my only solace in all of this

489
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,920
is I beat Wes by one.

490
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,920
Ugh.

491
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,720
All right, come on, lucky 2021.

492
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Yeah, right?

493
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,440
I mean, it was a rough year for a lot of reasons,

494
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,640
not just the predictions, Wes, not just the predictions.

495
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,440
But all right, so speaking of those,

496
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,800
we will do that in just a moment.

497
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,480
I wanna thank everybody who's joined us live.

498
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,720
You know, the Unplugged program will be live

499
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,200
for you to come and hang out all in 2021.

500
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,120
It's a whole new fresh year.

501
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,520
Why not do a whole fresh new stream over at jblive.tv.

502
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,120
Linode.com slash Unplugged.

503
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,240
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account

504
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,040
and go there to support the show.

505
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,560
Linode is our cloud server provider.

506
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,640
And because the price is so great, you can try them out

507
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
and you can get a machine starting at $5 a month

508
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,040
or with that $100 credit,

509
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,160
you can try something pretty powerful.

510
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,920
We spin up rigs as just test machines from time to time.

511
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,120
Alex has a brand new fancy website

512
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,600
that he'll be talking about soon on the self-hosted podcast.

513
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,960
I don't wanna spoil it, Alex,

514
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,360
but he's hosting the entire thing on Linode.

515
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,720
Listener Jeff wrote in to tell us about

516
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,880
how he did a test migration using Nextcloud.

517
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,600
That he planned it all out

518
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,440
and he spun up some Tesla nodes.

519
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,400
He did the whole thing,

520
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,280
read through all their documentation

521
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,920
and then he did it in production.

522
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,600
And he actually discovered that their cheapest rig

523
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,440
was more powerful than his local quad core machine.

524
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,200
And that's, it's a great story of like learning

525
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,240
and deploying and just using the resources available

526
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,200
at Linode to do all of that.

527
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,440
And what I love about them

528
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,240
is their passion for Linux and open source.

529
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,680
That's what got them in this business in the first place.

530
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,240
Probably a lot like yourself,

531
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,360
they saw where technology was gonna be really useful.

532
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,840
They saw where something was going

533
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,760
and realized, man, that's gonna change the game.

534
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,360
That's what got them fired up about starting up Linode.

535
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,200
And that's why they started three years before AWS

536
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,240
because they were doing this

537
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,320
from an independent passion standpoint,

538
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,840
not from some bureaucratic,

539
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,440
how can we leverage infrastructure and make money?

540
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,880
And what they ended up doing over time

541
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,200
was building one of the greatest and largest

542
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,800
independent and independently owned cloud companies.

543
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,320
Now with 11 data centers all over the world,

544
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,240
super fast SSDs, 40 gigabit connections to the hypervisors,

545
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,760
machines with multiple GPUs, dedicated CPU cores

546
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,560
and of course then things like object storage

547
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,600
and block storage and load balancing

548
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,920
all of these really fancy back end features

549
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,000
that you can take advantage

550
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
through infrastructure management tools

551
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,120
or just by getting down on the command line yourself.

552
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,040
They're dedicated to offering

553
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,720
the best virtualized cloud computing.

554
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,360
If it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode.

555
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,920
So just get started at linode.com slash unplugged.

556
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,120
Go there, get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account

557
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,880
and go there to support the show, linode.com slash unplugged.

558
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,960
All right, gentlemen, it is time to get into the 2021 predictions.

559
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,400
And I think we will start around,

560
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,720
I think we'll just use the same route again.

561
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,080
Alex, if you're comfortable kicking off with your predictions,

562
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,120
we'll start with you, sir.

563
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,360
Oh, come on.

564
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,200
Can we do reverse alphabetical order or something

565
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,120
so I can steal someone else's?

566
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,960
No, all right.

567
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,000
Here's what, you know what we'll do is I'll start, okay?

568
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,600
So that'll make it, that'll, we'll just sort of set

569
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,960
then we'll just go around, everybody will do one.

570
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,320
And now remember the format is you have to set

571
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,440
this is so hilarious, you have to make your grand prediction.

572
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,240
Then everybody can kind of chime in.

573
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,400
The ref is gonna make sure everything kind of lines up

574
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,720
and is actually accountable.

575
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,840
And then we have you repeat it in a lockable, precise version.

576
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,640
And that is what will be held account.

577
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,880
Not the math that got you there,

578
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
but the actual locked in version.

579
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,280
And I'm gonna start with mine.

580
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,480
I think this is a long shot,

581
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,920
but I feel like having a little bit of fun.

582
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,880
I think it's gonna be a little bit of fun.

583
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,040
I think our friends over at System76

584
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,120
are gonna look very heavily at forking GNOME to some degree.

585
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,280
And I don't know if fork is too heavy of a word here,

586
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,000
but I think when you look at the direction of GNOME Shell 40

587
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,720
and some of the UI fundamental changes there

588
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,600
and how Pop!OS is kind of acting as a layer

589
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,960
between Upstream and System76's customers,

590
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,680
I think they're gonna find this in their best interest

591
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,560
to kind of take the endless OS type approach.

592
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,000
Where they don't stay forked forever,

593
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,240
but they kind of go off in their own direction.

594
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,160
They build there, and then they contribute back Upstream

595
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,080
and what gets accepted makes it in,

596
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,640
and everybody benefits.

597
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,400
But that's going to be some sort of transition

598
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,400
that System76 makes in 2021.

599
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,880
I don't know how you're going to boil that down

600
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,440
into something that you can say concisely.

601
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,280
What counts as a fork? What's different enough?

602
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,760
It can't just be on GitHub, right?

603
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,680
That's what I think if we can come to an agreement on a fork,

604
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,080
then I think the lock-in is that System76 forks GNOME.

605
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,920
But I think the fork here has to be...

606
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,240
And I don't really know how to articulate how endless does it.

607
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,920
But what I roughly understand about endless

608
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,720
is they essentially stabilize on a version of GNOME Shell.

609
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,760
They build on top of that for a while.

610
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,520
So essentially a few releases pass them by

611
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,200
and they pass along what they've done Upstream,

612
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,320
and then they kind of like re-snapshot

613
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,680
off of, say, GNOME Shell 3.3.8.

614
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,800
They'll build off of that for a while,

615
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,560
maybe GNOME 40 and GNOME 41 even ships,

616
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,000
then they kind of rebase again off of that

617
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
and kind of move forward,

618
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,520
and all while sending the work they do Upstream

619
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,000
to the core project.

620
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,200
That's not exactly what they do.

621
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,120
Actually, endless does far less Upstreaming of their changes

622
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,440
to GNOME Shell and other GNOME components than you would expect,

623
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,880
because they retool the UI significantly,

624
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,040
and a lot of the underlying frameworks

625
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,240
for their particular purpose.

626
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,080
And as part of that, it's...

627
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,520
You can think of it closer to the process

628
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,520
that eventually led to the Unity desktop existing

629
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,480
than the process that would lead to improving

630
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,280
the GNOME code base itself.

631
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,160
Wouldn't that actually be kind of almost poetically perfect

632
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,440
in a sense because it was the death of Unity

633
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,360
that compelled System76 to launch BOP!OS?

634
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,720
Okay, Rev, how about this?

635
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,560
System76 forks GNOME Shell in the same spirit

636
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,560
that EndlessOS does.

637
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,720
I think that's probably about as precise

638
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,000
as we can get with this.

639
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,360
We'll just have to have a fun debate and discussion

640
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,680
next year around this time when we decide if it happened.

641
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,760
Well, because the reality is it's probably not going to look

642
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,280
exactly like what's been done before.

643
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,920
So I can't just point to a specific thing

644
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,360
and say it's going to be just like that is what I suspect.

645
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,600
I do think that you're right that there will be a sort of a line

646
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,480
in the sand of like, was this a significant change?

647
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,920
Did it cause some development friction?

648
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,360
Did it represent significant work from System76

649
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,800
to make this change or to make the process different?

650
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,040
And we'll have a sense of that next year.

651
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,800
Well, you could just look at where the GNOME Shell package

652
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,800
comes from in BOP!OS and it comes from Ubuntu.

653
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,320
So if you look in a year's time and the GNOME Shell package

654
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,520
that's on a stock install of System76 comes from their PPA,

655
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,320
then you could argue that that's a light or heavy fork

656
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,640
depending upon how changed it is.

657
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,280
But if they're using GNOME Shell from Ubuntu,

658
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,800
then it isn't really, is it?

659
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,320
I think what the line should be is

660
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,240
if GNOME Shell starts shipping from a System76-owned repo,

661
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,320
that's at least the beginning of some kind of shift there.

662
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,960
And I think that's a line I'd be comfortable with passing

663
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,880
or failing by.

664
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,680
You could say that System76 starts shipping their own

665
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,800
or starts hosting their own GNOME Shell version

666
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,200
or something like that, maybe.

667
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,040
Maintaining is the key word.

668
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,400
Maintaining, OK.

669
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,120
All right, OK.

670
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,000
All right, I'm going to lock that in.

671
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,560
I predict that System76 will begin in 2021

672
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,720
to maintain their own GNOME Shell packages.

673
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,240
Good?

674
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,440
Yeah.

675
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,000
We're good with that one?

676
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,640
Good job.

677
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,720
OK.

678
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,120
All right, Mr. Payne, would you like to go next?

679
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,120
I'm going to say that Linus announces

680
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,760
a change in his day-to-day involvement with the kernel.

681
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,200
Whoa.

682
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,320
What do we think about that?

683
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,960
It makes me sad.

684
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,160
I think he maybe should do it, to be honest with you,

685
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,480
because he himself says he mostly just does email now,

686
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,320
and that's got to get tedious.

687
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,640
I don't know that it necessarily means he's not involved at all

688
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,520
anymore, but a significant change

689
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,840
to how he contributes day-to-day.

690
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,520
How are you going to define significant change?

691
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,680
I feel like that's kind of vague.

692
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,640
Well, we'll be reporting on the show.

693
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,360
It'll be news in the open source community, right?

694
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,000
There'll be articles on the register, ZDNet.

695
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,080
LWN will talk about it, right?

696
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,880
So the prediction could be something like, in 2021,

697
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,240
it'll become public that Linus is stepping down,

698
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,800
or is becoming less involved with day-to-day operation

699
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,440
or something like that.

700
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,360
What do you think, Judge?

701
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,080
Yeah, I think we need to refine it slightly more than that.

702
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,600
We need to be more precise about it.

703
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,440
I mean, what exactly is this job title at the moment?

704
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Like, benevolent dictator or whatever, head maintainer.

705
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,920
Like, you'd have to say, I think,

706
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,400
that he's not going to be the head maintainer anymore.

707
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,120
Yeah, OK, I'm right.

708
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,160
Maybe he's still involved, but he's

709
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,200
no longer doing the actual releases for each version.

710
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,720
I don't know.

711
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,800
I like this idea that, so where you were originally

712
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,240
going with this, Wes, that I liked,

713
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,520
was this idea that Linus is still the boss,

714
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,920
but he pulls back a bit and just lives more of his life.

715
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,400
Right.

716
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,200
You know, he still shows up.

717
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,120
He maybe makes some consequential decisions

718
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,760
or settles arguments on the mailing list,

719
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,040
but he's not the one cutting these releases

720
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,480
each cycle or something.

721
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,400
And I think that's the core of what

722
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,600
you were going at originally.

723
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,480
And that's the scenario that I really hope eventually

724
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,360
does happen for Linus.

725
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,880
I hope it's not the burnout scenario.

726
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,520
But I wonder if maybe what is left for him

727
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,400
is just the parts he does enjoy.

728
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,760
He may actually just genuinely enjoy what he's doing.

729
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,440
Linus, clearly, you just need to come on the show

730
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,360
and talk to us about it.

731
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,120
We know you're listening.

732
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,440
So what do you think, Judge?

733
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,680
Is it something to the extent of like,

734
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,600
because here's the other bar we could go by.

735
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,920
Instead of really deciding how we want to define less involved,

736
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,400
what we could just define is, how much reporting is there

737
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,200
about Linus stepping back in some form?

738
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,880
And if there is reporting, like if he posts a mailing list

739
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,840
saying that I'm going to take every week off or something

740
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,720
in a month, something that gets then picked up on LWN,

741
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,160
I think that could be a qualifier.

742
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,640
That's something we could judge against.

743
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,120
Maybe.

744
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,200
But I think it doesn't really matter who reports on it.

745
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,480
I think the fact that he publicly announces it,

746
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,760
I think that's the key thing.

747
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,360
That works.

748
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,080
So I could say something like he publicly

749
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,000
announces stepping back in his day-to-day roles in the kernel?

750
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,480
Yeah.

751
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,120
Yeah.

752
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,200
I think that's pretty easy to say if it happened or not.

753
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,880
All right, you ready to lock it in, Wes?

754
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,440
I predict that Linus Torvalds will make an announcement

755
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,720
sometime in 2021, and he's stepping back

756
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,240
to some degree from his day-to-day involvement

757
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,080
with the Linux kernel.

758
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,000
All right, very nice.

759
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,160
And then we have a little breaking news kind of related.

760
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,560
JJ, you had something you wanted to pass along.

761
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,200
So I was trying to look and see if there

762
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,440
was any other developments from Linus Torvalds,

763
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,560
and apparently when I was looking at the main page,

764
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,200
his birthday was yesterday.

765
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,960
Hey, happy birthday, Linus.

766
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,120
And it doesn't look a day over 37.

767
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,080
All right.

768
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,560
So Wes, that's a good one.

769
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,680
I hope that it's a positive announcement if it happens.

770
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,600
All right, Drew, are you ready to make your first prediction

771
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,640
here on the show?

772
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,440
So I predict in 2021 that Google will

773
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,560
release an official Chrome OS installer for x86 machines.

774
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,440
Oh, that's good.

775
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,520
And they just recently bought that company that Neverware.

776
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,920
So how does that, what's official,

777
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,600
what is the gray area in that after this acquisition,

778
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,240
I'm wondering?

779
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,440
Well, specifically not something like Neverware branded.

780
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,360
So they purchased Neverware, who makes a product that

781
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,640
allows you to install Chrome OS on any x86 machine.

782
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,360
And so now that Google owns them,

783
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,440
there will be an officially Google-sanctioned product

784
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,480
that you can install on x86 machines.

785
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,720
Well, and so there'll be an ISO that you can download

786
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,160
from a Google domain, maybe?

787
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,640
Yes.

788
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
Wow.

789
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,240
Would something like an official Chromium OS

790
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
from Google count?

791
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,320
I think it'll be Chrome OS, not Chromium OS.

792
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,720
And it's pitched as any PC?

793
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,960
I think this is solid.

794
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,800
Any x86 PC.

795
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,680
Right.

796
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,440
All right.

797
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,040
I predict in 2021 that Google will release an official ISO

798
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:25,280
image for Chrome OS for x86 computers.

799
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,840
What I really like about that one, Drew,

800
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,640
is you've been following the news

801
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,520
and then extrapolating from that, which is what my strategy

802
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,280
tries.

803
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,720
That's generally my strategy is like,

804
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,400
I got to leverage the fact that I follow the news every week.

805
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,520
So let's just take those to their natural conclusion.

806
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,800
And that's exactly what you did there.

807
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,280
Hey, we're going three for three this year.

808
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,200
OK, Alex, let's see how your first one stacks up.

809
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,400
All right, so mine is right up your street.

810
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,480
It's about the Raspberry Pi.

811
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,720
I predict that the Raspberry Pi 5,

812
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,800
if that's what they call it, the next major version

813
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,600
of the Raspberry Pi, so I think 5 is a decent guess,

814
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,680
will ship with support for proper storage.

815
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,800
So it will have either a SATA port, or an mSATA,

816
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,160
or an NVMe slot on it.

817
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,660
Ooh.

818
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,160
Oh, gosh.

819
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,800
I sure hope.

820
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,600
Yeah, right?

821
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,840
Boy, so it's not necessarily a Raspberry Pi 5, you're saying,

822
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,200
but a Raspberry Pi product.

823
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,080
Yeah, yeah.

824
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,960
So I think the next major release that happens in 2021

825
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,320
will have support for an NVMe, or an m.2 SATA,

826
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,640
or some kind of built-in storage.

827
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,960
Hopefully not eMMC, but I'll take it

828
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,400
if that gets me the prediction.

829
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,320
Isn't the Raspberry Pi compute module right now,

830
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,200
doesn't have PCI lanes on there that you can wire up if you?

831
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,080
Yeah, Jeff Geerling's been doing a bunch of work

832
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,240
around that kind of stuff.

833
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,960
That could be step one in what you're talking about, right?

834
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,920
That could be step one.

835
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,240
Hopefully, hopefully.

836
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,800
Clearly, clearly, clearly, we're using the Raspberry Pi 4.

837
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,840
Now, especially with the 8 gig model,

838
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,960
the limitation is the storage options.

839
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,800
It just so obviously is.

840
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,680
And that's made better by USB 3 and being

841
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,000
able to boot from those disks.

842
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,480
And it's also, if you're willing to go with something

843
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,200
like NFS or iSCSI, it has a gigabit NIC on there.

844
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,040
But it's still not as great as just local NVMe storage

845
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,680
or something.

846
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,920
So I think that's pretty good, ref.

847
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,480
You think there's anything he's got to bang out with that

848
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,840
before we lock it in?

849
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,160
I would only suggest that you put

850
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,360
a caveat of there being an option for built-in storage

851
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,160
because I could see them releasing two versions.

852
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,640
Like they've got the 4 gigabyte and 8 gigabyte RAM ones now.

853
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,080
You might have one that just has an SD card and one

854
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,560
that has an SD card and EMMC or whatever.

855
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,280
Yeah, because the Compute Module 4 has EMMC on it now.

856
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,240
So yeah, I think you're probably right with that.

857
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,120
Yeah, so I would say something like there'll

858
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,120
be one available that has an option to boot

859
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,800
from built-in storage that isn't the SD card or something

860
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,440
like that.

861
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,160
All right, so I predict in 2021, the next major release

862
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,040
of the Raspberry Pi, maybe the Pi 5,

863
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,440
will have an option for a proper storage system.

864
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:11,000
So that's NVMe or M.2 SATA or just a genuine SATA port.

865
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,360
Yeah, I hope you're right on that one.

866
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,280
That would be great.

867
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,880
Let's hope your winning streak continues.

868
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,560
Let's hope.

869
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,480
So since Joe is judge, he only gets to,

870
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
well, he only has to actually, I should say,

871
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
make one crazy prediction.

872
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,760
So we loop back around to me again.

873
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,480
And I'm going to go with one that, my goodness, better

874
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,480
happen or else the industry is in a world of hurt.

875
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,600
But I predict that Qualcomm will come out

876
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,080
with an ARM SOC that matches or beats Apple's M1.

877
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,640
And it will be possible to boot Linux or actually maybe just

878
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,400
Android on those systems.

879
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,560
I mean, this is totally quantifiable,

880
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,720
but you're totally wrong about it.

881
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,640
You guys are telling me nobody in mainstream ARM

882
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,240
that ships on consumer devices is

883
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,600
going to be able to match Apple, that Apple is

884
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,360
that incredible at engineering?

885
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,320
It's not that they're incredible at engineering.

886
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,080
It's that Apple doesn't have to care about supply chain

887
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,720
and demand margins.

888
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,120
Everyone else does.

889
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,520
So I mean, I think that makes it a fun pick myself.

890
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,320
Yeah, it's outlandish for sure.

891
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,720
Yeah, the least likely the better.

892
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,800
I support this.

893
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,440
OK, should I remove Qualcomm and say a ARM distributor,

894
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,560
an ARM chip distributor?

895
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,600
Yeah, an ARM manufacturer other than Apple

896
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,200
will come out with a system on a chip

897
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,240
that is as powerful or more than the M1.

898
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,360
That's how I'd phrase it.

899
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,740
How do you measure that, though?

900
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,480
Is it a Geekbench score or some kind of, what's the metric?

901
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,760
I'll go Geekbench.

902
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,600
Geekbench is fine with me.

903
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,680
That's the one that most of the M1 folks are using.

904
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,880
For the people that don't know Project Skybridge,

905
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,960
AMD has a Project Skybridge where they have ARM and x86

906
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,360
as a single platform.

907
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,880
Yeah, I don't think that counts.

908
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,400
I think it's got to be pure ARM.

909
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,560
So we're going down on the record right here saying

910
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,200
that at the end of 2020, we're looking out of all of 2021,

911
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,520
even though the whole industry knew that Apple was, you know,

912
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,360
they've known about what these CPUs can do for a little while.

913
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,920
So they've had years to start ramping up.

914
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,420
But what we are saying at this point

915
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,520
is we have so little faith that just saying an ARM manufacturer

916
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,480
might beat the M1 is a risky prediction, and I love it.

917
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,520
So I'm going to say an ARM manufacturer comes out

918
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,480
with an ARM SoC that matches or beats Apple's M1 on Geekbench.

919
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,200
Yeah.

920
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,140
Yeah, OK, I'll leave it at that.

921
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,440
I was going to add another qualifier,

922
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
but I don't think I need to put myself in a box.

923
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,480
So officially, locking it in with this,

924
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,040
an ARM manufacturer in 2021 will come out

925
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,920
with an ARM SoC that matches or beats Apple's M1 on Geekbench.

926
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,720
All right, Mr. West, you are up, sir.

927
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,560
You got a prediction for us?

928
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,440
I'm going to say GNOME fixes their plug-in architecture.

929
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,240
We get a real plug-in API and a bad plug-in.

930
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,760
While it might still hurt your system,

931
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,640
it won't crash the whole dang shell.

932
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,880
I needed a good laugh before the end of the year, thanks,

933
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,000
Mr. West.

934
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,840
It doesn't seem to be on the horizon for 40,

935
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,160
but maybe it lands in 41 or 42.

936
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,640
Something I'm hoping for, anyway.

937
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,800
I like this, though, because again, like your Linus one,

938
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,720
if it pans out right, it's a good thing for all of us.

939
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,640
Do you think there's anything he has to qualify there, Ref?

940
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,440
It just seems a little bit hard to measure

941
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,560
is the only problem.

942
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,860
Well, it'd be like a new API, right?

943
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,440
They'd be making an announcement about,

944
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,760
here's the way we're building plug-ins going forward,

945
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,560
something like that.

946
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,320
Right.

947
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,760
OK, so not just an improvement, but a whole new API.

948
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,880
Yeah, I think that's quantifiable then, yeah.

949
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,320
They do have a new extensions effort that's essentially,

950
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,160
like, we're going to increase communication

951
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,400
and make sure that people are sharing information.

952
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,240
That they've already announced, but there's no real, like,

953
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,160
an API would truly be the benchmark.

954
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,800
And I think we could probably be loose on what the definition

955
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,280
of an API is, even.

956
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,480
All right, I guess I'll try to lock this in, huh?

957
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Go for it.

958
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,920
I predict that in 2021, GNOME finally

959
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,960
fixes their plug-in problem with a new API they've announced.

960
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,520
That means a misbehaving plug-in can no longer

961
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,320
crash your whole dang shell.

962
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,240
Again, with some of these predictions from your lips

963
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
to the developers' ears.

964
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,200
OK, Mr. Drew, are you feeling like you've

965
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,280
got another one in you?

966
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,160
Oh, I got another one.

967
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,920
It's a good one.

968
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,280
OK, OK.

969
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,080
I predict in 2021 that VMware will go independent.

970
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,160
Ooh.

971
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,880
This is a fascinating little insight

972
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,760
you must have picked up somewhere recently.

973
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,080
What leads you to this conclusion?

974
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,040
They're kind of leaning away from Dell.

975
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,640
That's really the only thing, is just

976
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
kind of reading what they're doing.

977
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,520
I use VMware at work, and I don't

978
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,840
see a lot of Dell influence in them anymore.

979
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,120
So would VMware getting sold to another company

980
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,200
not qualify, then?

981
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,040
No, I think they will go independent.

982
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,640
OK.

983
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,120
Thing is on that one, though, Drew,

984
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,920
is that VMware are basically trying

985
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,280
to steal Red Hat's lunch with Tanzu

986
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,640
and their play against OpenShift.

987
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,080
So lots of people have to pay the VMware tax right now.

988
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,920
And I think the biggest risk that VMware have moving forward

989
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,280
is people want to just run containers on the bare metal

990
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,360
and use something like OpenShift or Rancher

991
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,000
or any other Kubernetes distribution

992
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,760
to kind of get rid of that VMware tax.

993
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,480
So I think maybe some of the stuff you're seeing

994
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,760
is them focusing on that kind of hybrid cloud

995
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,920
enterprise-y type sweet spot, because they

996
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,040
can see a future where VMs just aren't needed anymore.

997
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,880
Oh, I don't think you're wrong there.

998
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,680
But I think that they have a lot of irons in the fire.

999
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,440
And I don't think that Dell plays

1000
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,880
a huge part in their future.

1001
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,360
Yes, fascinating prediction.

1002
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,600
I'll be interested to see how this one plays out.

1003
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,480
It seems pretty straightforward there, Ref.

1004
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,360
Yeah, yeah.

1005
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,400
I predict in 2021 that VMware will go independent.

1006
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,160
That is a spicy one.

1007
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,200
I like it.

1008
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,240
OK, Alex, you're up.

1009
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,400
You got another one for us?

1010
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,480
I do indeed.

1011
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:11,720
So a project I've done recently was running a virtual GPU

1012
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,240
on top of Proxmox.

1013
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,240
And in the research for that, I came across some videos

1014
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,280
by Wendell.

1015
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,680
And he was talking about how the new Nvidia graphics cards

1016
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,800
might have something called SRIOV, which

1017
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,080
would allow you to slice up one GPU

1018
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,000
and pass it through to multiple VMs at the same time.

1019
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,120
Now, this technology already exists in the data center

1020
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,240
if you're willing to pay for something like Nvidia Grid.

1021
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,480
But it doesn't really exist at the consumer level,

1022
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,520
because obviously Nvidia and AMD and all that

1023
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,200
want to sell more graphics cards.

1024
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,520
So my prediction is this.

1025
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,360
The upcoming Intel Xe discrete GPUs

1026
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,880
will support SRIOV out of the box.

1027
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,000
All right.

1028
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,400
That's pretty concise.

1029
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800
That also won't happen.

1030
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,720
Well, then it makes it even more interesting.

1031
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,160
Well, because they already do GPU splitting now

1032
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,360
with a different technology, mediated devices through GVT.

1033
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,680
And so that's effectively a total substitute for SRIOV.

1034
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,840
Yeah, why do you think they would change it, Alex?

1035
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,960
I must admit, I wasn't up to speed

1036
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,720
on the technical nuance there.

1037
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,120
I thought SRIOV was just a different name

1038
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,080
for the same thing.

1039
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,160
So if I could qualify my prediction

1040
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,680
to be that the upcoming Intel discrete GPUs will support

1041
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,760
virtual graphics card slicing.

1042
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,160
OK, let's judge.

1043
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,280
Unless you have anything you want,

1044
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,440
I think we should lock it in.

1045
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,720
Yeah, let's lock it in.

1046
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,560
The upcoming Intel Xe discrete graphics cards

1047
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,480
will support virtual graphics card slicing through SRIOV,

1048
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,120
or mediated devices through the GVT technology.

1049
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,760
I like that.

1050
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,360
That's good.

1051
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,400
I'd love to see that because it just gets more value out

1052
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,920
of those machines.

1053
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,360
I'm going to go again.

1054
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:06,120
And I'm going to say this is my last one.

1055
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,240
So I have a couple more on here.

1056
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,440
I was really tempted to do one about the M1.

1057
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,560
But I'm going to save that for the mumble round.

1058
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,840
I've got one for the M1.

1059
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,520
OK, so I'll save it for you guys.

1060
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,360
And I'm going to say that a distribution announces

1061
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,720
that it has more users on WSL than actual physical metal

1062
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,800
installs.

1063
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,200
I can't see that happening.

1064
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,320
I can't see them announcing, because that

1065
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,080
would mean they'd have to announce numbers.

1066
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,120
And none of the distros want to announce numbers.

1067
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,800
I suppose they could say they have more of a proportion

1068
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,880
and not actually say what the numbers are.

1069
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,440
Right.

1070
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,280
You don't think so, Poppy?

1071
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,400
You don't think it's going to happen?

1072
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,120
I think it's just really hard for what Joe says.

1073
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,520
It's like, so if it's not true, then the Australian question

1074
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,840
wouldn't say it.

1075
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,880
And if it was true.

1076
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,320
Are you implying, Poppy, that it may already be the case,

1077
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,880
but nobody has just said it?

1078
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,840
No.

1079
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,040
If it was the case, or if it wasn't the case, in both ways,

1080
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,560
they're going to harm themselves by saying it.

1081
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,080
I don't know.

1082
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,760
I don't know why.

1083
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,000
Why?

1084
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,080
Why is that harmful to say that we have 3 million WSL users

1085
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,560
and we have, I mean, that's probably too many.

1086
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,200
But if you think about it, and I think

1087
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,960
you know what some of the actual deployment numbers

1088
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,400
are of some of these distributions,

1089
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,400
it's not inconceivable for one of them

1090
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,680
to get more users on Windows.

1091
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,800
It doesn't seem to me.

1092
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,760
It might be more conceivable for a smaller distro,

1093
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,080
because the numbers are so small that it might be actually

1094
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,280
a thing that they wouldn't mind saying.

1095
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,800
Right.

1096
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,280
Yeah, or a purpose-built distro.

1097
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,040
Well, I feel, OK, so that I feel like is not,

1098
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,080
that's where this prediction, I feel like,

1099
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,040
is a little bit too easy.

1100
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,640
I can't say like.

1101
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,920
That's not quite in the spirit of what you're suggesting.

1102
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,200
Yeah, there's a couple of distros

1103
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,560
that are targeted just to WSL.

1104
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,840
And I feel like that's a no-brainer, of course.

1105
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,200
Here's what I think kind of gives me an edge up,

1106
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,760
is it might come from the Microsoft side.

1107
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,600
Maybe not even intentionally, or something like that.

1108
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,320
Maybe it's like an offhanded comment that, oh, yeah, yeah,

1109
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,440
you know, XYZ actually has more users on WSL

1110
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,360
than they have physical installs on the wild.

1111
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,120
And it's just not even something that's released by the distro.

1112
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,080
But they wouldn't know that.

1113
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,000
They can't know that number, because they are not

1114
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,520
in the infrastructure for the distro.

1115
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,320
True, true.

1116
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,240
OK, here's the root of what I'm trying to get out there,

1117
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,520
is I think you have a lot of middle-tier distros

1118
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,240
that maybe have 30, 40, 50,000 installs, maybe as many,

1119
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,160
if they're lucky, as of 100,000.

1120
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,400
And I don't think that's an impossible number

1121
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,080
to get surpassed on WSL.

1122
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,760
And I think it's going to happen within the next year.

1123
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,200
I guess what you guys are saying is, it may happen,

1124
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,480
and we'll never know.

1125
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,520
So how do I make, because to me, it just

1126
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,720
seems like an obvious thing that's going to happen.

1127
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,880
I'd love to get on the record saying it's going to happen.

1128
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,200
But there's no way to measure it.

1129
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,480
I think it's a reasonable thing for you to predict.

1130
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,240
And I think it's not unreasonable to think someone

1131
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,480
might let that slip, or someone in a fit of peak and PR

1132
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,260
might decide to actively promote that as a thing.

1133
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,480
I think it's fair to say.

1134
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,520
Yeah, that's why I should have gone with my Rocky Linux one,

1135
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,400
because I could be an easy winner.

1136
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,080
Damn it, damn it.

1137
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,720
See, I could make one up on the spot, but I don't really know.

1138
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,800
OK.

1139
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,240
So I think, Judge, what it comes down to is,

1140
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,360
I could still go with it, but it's a small shot

1141
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,920
that it actually ever goes public.

1142
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,000
Yeah, as the ref, I can say, that's totally fine to say it.

1143
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,280
But as Joe, I'm going to say, you haven't got a chance, mate.

1144
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,360
Yeah, OK.

1145
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,640
I know it's going to happen if it hasn't happened already.

1146
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,160
It's going to happen any day.

1147
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,760
I think it's a good prediction.

1148
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,680
I'm going to do it.

1149
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,160
I'm going to do it because Popeye's egging me on,

1150
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,600
so I'm going to do it.

1151
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,800
Shoot for the stars, Chris.

1152
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,640
Do it.

1153
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,600
All right, I'm going to say that in 2021,

1154
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,260
it becomes public that a distribution has

1155
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:57,360
more users on WSL than physical installs in the wild.

1156
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,560
OK, Wes, let's round out yours with your third and last

1157
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,320
prediction.

1158
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,800
Oh, OK, my final prediction.

1159
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
I'm going to make it a good one, I suppose.

1160
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,760
Yeah, make up for mine, would you, because that was rough.

1161
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,260
All right, let's say that there's a Rust-based kernel

1162
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,520
module that is widely distributed,

1163
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,200
either included optionally in the main tree

1164
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,800
or shipped by Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch.

1165
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,920
I'm sorry, what did you say there, Wes?

1166
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,480
Did you say?

1167
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
RUST!

1168
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,640
Every time I see this coming up, I know that it's Rust,

1169
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,560
even when I haven't listened to the show.

1170
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,400
I just recognized the waveform at this point.

1171
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:36,900
Yeah.

1172
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,860
I love this idea, and it's a solid one.

1173
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,760
And you know it gets some hype because, you know, Rust.

1174
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,200
So I don't really have any problems with this,

1175
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,640
because I feel like it would go public.

1176
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,000
Most modules, nobody really talks about in the news,

1177
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,360
but a Rust module, I'm talking about it.

1178
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,360
What do you think, Judge?

1179
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,800
Yeah, I think lock it in.

1180
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,000
I predict that in 2021, the first Rust-based kernel module

1181
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,400
will be widely distributed, either optionally

1182
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,520
in the main tree or shipped by Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch.

1183
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,040
Man, you know, you didn't even have to lock it down.

1184
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,560
You could have left it open-ended for if it ships

1185
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,800
in a distro or not.

1186
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,480
OK, well, Drew, are you ready for your?

1187
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,040
What's the matter, you tell me?

1188
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,000
Sorry, there, Wes.

1189
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,200
You know, you always got to play the game.

1190
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,160
You always got to play the game.

1191
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,500
Drew, are you ready for your third and final prediction,

1192
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,000
sir?

1193
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,200
So another enterprising prediction from me,

1194
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,200
Rancher ownership will change hands.

1195
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,120
What?

1196
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,320
No, I don't see that one.

1197
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,080
They just, didn't Sousa just buy them this year?

1198
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,600
They just got a new brand on them.

1199
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,680
Yeah, and it's like, by the way, one

1200
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,760
of my unofficial predictions was that Sousa would up

1201
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,280
their Kubernetes game, and they did.

1202
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,560
They bought Rancher OS, dude.

1203
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,180
And it's like, that's like the big thing

1204
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,600
that they're like proud of when they're peacocking now.

1205
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,880
They're peacocking about Rancher OS.

1206
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,480
Does it include Sousa getting bought out by somebody else?

1207
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,040
It's very possible that somebody could buy Sousa for Rancher.

1208
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,680
Oh, so you're saying it changes ownership

1209
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,800
via Sousa changing ownership.

1210
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,160
Or Google just straight up buys Rancher.

1211
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,680
Who knows?

1212
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,200
I mean, there are lots of options here.

1213
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,080
But at the end of the year, I don't

1214
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,840
think that Rancher will have the same owner,

1215
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,800
be it whether Sousa gets bought or Rancher gets bought.

1216
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,000
One of the two will happen.

1217
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,640
It's about time for Sousa to get bought.

1218
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,120
It really is, yeah.

1219
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,480
I really almost went with Sousa ownership will change hands.

1220
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,120
But I think the Rancher ownership one is a little spicier,

1221
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,320
so I like it better.

1222
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,280
I think that's pretty workable.

1223
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,280
What do you think, Judge?

1224
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,640
Yeah, I think our friend.

1225
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,400
All right.

1226
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:47,680
I predict in 2021 that Rancher ownership will change hands.

1227
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,960
It's nice and tidy, too.

1228
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,040
I like that.

1229
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,720
OK, Alex, are you ready for a third and final prediction?

1230
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,360
I think so.

1231
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,080
I'm going to continue on the theme of hard drives

1232
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,600
like last year, because apparently that one came true,

1233
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,880
even though I didn't think it did.

1234
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,360
So the easy storyline, I'm going to base my prediction

1235
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,440
off the easy storyline that you can buy at Best Buy.

1236
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,240
The prediction is that you'll be able to buy a 20-terabyte drive

1237
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,560
for under $250 at Best Buy within 2021 at some point.

1238
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,680
I think this is too similar to last year's, man.

1239
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,680
But it's price-based, though.

1240
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,840
So instead of saying it's going to be x amount of storage,

1241
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,160
you're saying you're going to get x amount of storage

1242
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,360
for a price, which is kind of a different take on it.

1243
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,200
Yeah, true.

1244
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,280
He also specifically said Best Buy,

1245
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,200
and I kind of partly want Best Buy

1246
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,880
to go out of business this year just to screw with it.

1247
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,840
I don't know.

1248
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,800
Do you think he needs to tweak it to make it work, Ref?

1249
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,600
Or do you think it's?

1250
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,800
No, I think that is totally testable,

1251
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,080
so let's just do it.

1252
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,680
I predict slash hope that a Western Digital Easy Store

1253
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,680
20-terabyte hard drive will cost $250 or less

1254
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,400
at some point in 2021.

1255
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,680
Remove the Best Buy mention.

1256
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,160
Well done.

1257
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:00,960
Yeah.

1258
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,960
Oh, you can edit that in if you want.

1259
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,280
No, it's probably better, because now it's

1260
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,400
like if it's on Newegg.

1261
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,600
The thing is, the Easy Stores are Best Buy exclusives.

1262
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,600
So it's no choice.

1263
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,480
So I guess it's in there anyway.

1264
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,640
Joe, we saved the last and the best right for now,

1265
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,400
and it's you, and it is your crazy prediction of the year.

1266
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,400
Are you ready, sir?

1267
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,920
Fuchsia, I think you'll be able to download an image of that

1268
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,040
and get it working with a free desktop environment,

1269
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,680
such as XFCE or Plasma or Gnome or something,

1270
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,280
and run a browser all on Fuchsia.

1271
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,640
Not officially, necessarily, but someone will hack it together

1272
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,560
so you'll be able to boot a Fuchsia

1273
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,360
system with a browser and a proper desktop environment.

1274
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,600
And I'm not saying what the performance is going to be

1275
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,960
like, but you will be able to use a browser.

1276
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,960
Fascinating.

1277
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,120
And it's probably a Blink-based browser.

1278
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,400
Probably, yes.

1279
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,960
OK, so it's Fuchsia with all the way up to a browser

1280
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,240
is essentially the prediction.

1281
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,240
I think that's pretty straightforward.

1282
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,600
Do you want to lock it in?

1283
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,080
I predict that in 2021, you'll be

1284
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:12,720
able to use everything up to a browser in Fuchsia.

1285
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,600
That is going to make me nervous if that one happens.

1286
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,920
I don't want that one to come true.

1287
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,960
OK, so we're going to now go into the Mumble Room round.

1288
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,960
So good job, gentlemen.

1289
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,520
Mumble Room, tag me with mum in the chat room,

1290
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,080
and I'll call on some of you to get some of those in.

1291
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,160
And gentlemen, congratulations.

1292
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,560
Your 2021 predictions are locked in.

1293
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,720
I want to also thank our Unplugged Core contributors

1294
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,080
at unpluggedcore.com.

1295
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,400
That's a membership program that helps keep this program

1296
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,160
independent and helps reduce the ad load needed

1297
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,840
to make the show profitable.

1298
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,240
And you also, as a core contributor,

1299
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,280
get access to two feeds.

1300
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,560
A limited ad version of the show, same full production,

1301
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,200
just limited ads.

1302
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,440
And a second feed, which this week

1303
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,920
is going to be a massive, massive recording.

1304
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,400
That's the full live stream feed.

1305
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,720
All our screw ups, the stuff that never makes into the show,

1306
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,720
and a huge pre and post show that

1307
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,320
doesn't get recorded because the disk

1308
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,320
space in the main recorder would be crazy.

1309
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,600
It's basically an extra show that never gets released.

1310
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,020
And I suppose the other perk of it

1311
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,680
is it's released as fast as we can.

1312
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,440
So usually within an hour or two of us wrapping up recording,

1313
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,740
it goes out in the feed.

1314
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,760
The downside is if you're driving in the car

1315
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,760
or you want something that's a little less time consuming,

1316
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,760
that's where the main feed's a little nicer.

1317
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,120
Because it's the full production,

1318
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,800
it's been tweaked EQ wise, it sounds better,

1319
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,520
and it's shorter runtime.

1320
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,320
So that's why we make two feeds available, shorter or longer.

1321
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,960
And that just is part of being a core contributor.

1322
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,200
So thank you very much to our Unplugged Core contributors.

1323
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,900
And we now transition to the mumble room.

1324
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,760
And we'll start with Bitton.

1325
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,760
My prediction last year was that Canonical World IPO

1326
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,120
and Microsoft would buy some parts of it.

1327
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,720
That didn't happen.

1328
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,040
And my prediction this year is there

1329
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:01,080
will be a phone with a Linux kernel sold in stores that's

1330
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,040
not Android.

1331
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,600
Will stores exist?

1332
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,400
Yeah.

1333
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,200
Maybe Amazon.

1334
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:06,640
OK.

1335
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,440
Does Amazon count?

1336
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,640
I think Amazon should count.

1337
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,680
I like that.

1338
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,360
OK, Poppy, I know you've got a few.

1339
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,000
So what are yours, sir?

1340
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,760
Do you want the good, the bad, or the ugly?

1341
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,480
Ooh, all of them.

1342
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,440
Just give them all to me.

1343
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,140
Just rapid fire.

1344
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:19,640
All right.

1345
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,980
So in contrary to Bitton, I predict in 2021,

1346
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:28,920
Canonical will neither IPO nor be bought by Microsoft.

1347
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,280
OK.

1348
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,160
In 2021, Hector Martin and collaborators

1349
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:39,440
will get 90% of the hardware in the first generation M1 Max

1350
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,160
booting on Linux.

1351
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,360
Now, does the GPU count as 10% or does that count more?

1352
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,080
I would go by whatever Hector's gauge of what 90% is.

1353
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:49,720
OK.

1354
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,240
OK.

1355
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,600
I'd be great to see that.

1356
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,880
And then is this next one the good or the ugly?

1357
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,800
The ugly.

1358
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,280
OK.

1359
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,960
In 2021, Red Hat will do something

1360
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,640
disliked by the community, which intentionally makes life hard

1361
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,400
for the ROX Linux developers.

1362
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,400
Oh.

1363
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,920
I think it's going to be the opposite,

1364
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,240
but that would be very spicy.

1365
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,120
All right, thank you, sir.

1366
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,200
I like those.

1367
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,600
Bight, I know you've got a few, too.

1368
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,560
Do you want to jump in?

1369
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,680
I don't think Google goes that big with Fusio.

1370
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:24,800
I think Google coming here will take their next big step,

1371
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,680
but only until then.

1372
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,200
All right.

1373
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,360
I hope you're right about that.

1374
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,280
I think that'd be really good.

1375
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,840
Now, did you have a couple other ones?

1376
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:37,080
I think in 2021, there will be a credit card-sized computer

1377
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,080
with a full-fledged RISC-V CPU.

1378
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,040
Oh, I like that one.

1379
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,920
That's a good one.

1380
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,200
All right.

1381
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,640
I'm going to keep moving because we've got more,

1382
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,240
but we will have the post-show as well.

1383
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,760
JJ, get yours in.

1384
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,240
I predict that in 2021, streaming DRM

1385
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,240
will restrict users on Linux from enjoying content.

1386
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,320
I hope not.

1387
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,560
That would be a fail.

1388
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,680
Jeff, you've got a silver-blue prediction.

1389
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:12,240
Yeah, I predict that I will deploy Fedora's silver-blue

1390
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:17,840
on mostly home-built ThinkPads to all my customers who want it,

1391
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,280
and I'll make a profit for the first time.

1392
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,360
I mean, it's impossible.

1393
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,840
You all know I'm not going to make a profit on the hardware.

1394
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,560
That's impossible.

1395
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,360
We all know that.

1396
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,160
But I actually believe I can actually

1397
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,080
support silver-blue all over the world if I need to.

1398
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,920
I can just FedEx from a new box when it breaks,

1399
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,480
just like the enterprise guys do.

1400
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,440
And they can call the helpline.

1401
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,080
So I need to go official, I guess.

1402
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,760
What do you all think?

1403
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,120
Have you all tried silver-blue?

1404
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:42,440
Yes.

1405
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,080
Well, Drew has talked about it too little bit on the show.

1406
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,360
I hope that works out for you.

1407
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,280
I think that's a good prediction.

1408
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,760
And then, Colonel, you have a PinePhone prediction.

1409
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,260
Yep.

1410
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:54,400
So my prediction is that sometime in 2021,

1411
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,920
one of the software distros for the PinePhone

1412
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,680
will become daily driver ready.

1413
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,120
So for daily driver, what do we define that as?

1414
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,200
Has that navigation and what?

1415
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,280
Like, what's daily driver?

1416
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,840
Or could Chris stand to use it for a week?

1417
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,960
Let's not kid ourselves.

1418
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,160
Come on.

1419
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,680
Let's not.

1420
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,880
If the PinePhone is installed and set up,

1421
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,280
somebody who's not a complete and total nerd

1422
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,280
can use it day-to-day for phone calls, text messages,

1423
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,160
and some web browsing.

1424
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,660
All right.

1425
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,520
I like it.

1426
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,240
If you're listening to this and thinking,

1427
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,280
gosh, I'd like to get a prediction

1428
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,000
and I've got a good one, let us know.

1429
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,160
Go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1430
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,520
Over the next few episodes, we'll

1431
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,320
read a few more 2021 predictions.

1432
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,480
Because let's be honest, it's still pretty early in the game.

1433
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,960
So it'll still count if you get it in January via email.

1434
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,020
Wouldn't that be neat?

1435
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,360
Maybe you got a good one in you.

1436
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,000
So that's linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1437
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,400
You can find our sponsor, A Cloud Guru, on social media.

1438
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,200
It's really simple.

1439
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,920
You just go to slash acloudguru at YouTube, Twitter,

1440
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,020
or Facebook.

1441
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,080
All of that is there.

1442
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,960
Links to subscribe or find.

1443
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,360
Usually, we have a bunch of links

1444
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,040
to stuff we talked about, but this is a special episode.

1445
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,420
But generally, you can find our show note links and everything

1446
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,220
like that at that Linux Unplugged website.

1447
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,920
It's really quite simple.

1448
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,400
And then, of course, we'd love to have you join us live.

1449
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,880
We do this show on Tuesdays at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

1450
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,160
See you next week.

1451
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,880
Same bad time, same bad station.

1452
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,300
And there is a lot to it.

1453
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,320
You can join our Mumble Room and hang out in our virtual Lug.

1454
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,760
Of course, we also have the LUP Lug on Sundays.

1455
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,400
So you set up the Mumble Room once.

1456
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,720
You get access to the show and the LUP Lug on Sundays.

1457
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,800
It's pretty great.

1458
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,360
All this stuff that we do live, it's

1459
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,680
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1460
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,720
But last but not least, let me just say,

1461
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,640
here's to a great 2021.

1462
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,760
Thank you for listening.

1463
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,160
We appreciate everyone who downloads or shares

1464
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,840
this show, all of our core contributors, all of you.

1465
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,000
Hope you have a great 2021, and we'll see you right back here.

1466
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Not next Tuesday.

1467
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,120
No, my friends.

1468
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,120
If you can believe it, we'll see you right back here.

1469
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,040
Next frickin' year!

1470
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,240
Come on, everybody, next year!

1471
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,240
Happy new year!

1472
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,240
Happy new year!

1473
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,240
Happy new year!

1474
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,240
Happy new year!

1475
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,240
Happy new year!

1476
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,240
Happy new year!

1477
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:13,240
Happy new year!

1478
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,240
Happy new year!

1479
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,200
Happy new year!

1480
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,200
Happy new year!

1481
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,220
Happy new year!

1482
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,240
Happy New Year!

1483
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,220
Happy new year!

1484
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,220
You
