WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
So something interesting happened today.

00:03.720 --> 00:06.560
A little piece of me dies every time I hear

00:06.560 --> 00:09.680
someone pronounce gif as jif.

00:09.680 --> 00:13.720
And so Jif Peanut Butter has actually teamed up with Giphy

00:13.720 --> 00:16.120
to help settle the debate once and for all

00:16.120 --> 00:21.120
and has created a Jif can or container

00:22.640 --> 00:25.480
for their peanut butter.

00:25.480 --> 00:28.600
And you can actually order that on Amazon now.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.880
This is an attack on me.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.760
This is absolutely an attack on me.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.120
Oh, hey friends, you did it.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.120
You got the right show.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.640
Welcome into the Unplugged program.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.480
My name is Chris.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.400
My name is Wes.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.280
Wes 342, it's gonna blow the doors off.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.320
Might be our best yet.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.560
You know what I love?

00:51.560 --> 00:52.400
SSH.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.240
Me too.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.080
Who doesn't?

00:54.080 --> 00:54.900
Right?

00:54.900 --> 00:58.080
And our guest, Jeremy, will join us in a little bit

00:58.080 --> 01:01.840
to show us some things you never knew SSH could do.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.040
At a scale which blows my mind,

01:04.040 --> 01:06.840
there's things in there that are just gonna maybe change

01:06.840 --> 01:08.040
the way you think about SSH,

01:08.040 --> 01:11.320
but potentially change the way you log into your systems

01:11.320 --> 01:12.400
in the future.

01:12.400 --> 01:16.000
It's a real cool, really, really cool chat we had.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.480
So he'll join us in a little bit,

01:17.480 --> 01:21.480
but we also have our standard affair of community news,

01:21.480 --> 01:24.960
some pics, some followup, and a lot more,

01:24.960 --> 01:26.080
like our virtual lug.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.640
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.480
Hello.

01:28.480 --> 01:29.320
Hello.

01:29.320 --> 01:30.140
Hello.

01:30.140 --> 01:30.980
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:30.980 --> 01:31.820
Woo!

01:31.820 --> 01:32.640
Listen to that.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.840
That is a lot of people.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.720
That is a great turnout.

01:36.720 --> 01:37.960
Wimpy, it's great to see you again.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.440
Welcome back to the Unplugged Show.

01:39.440 --> 01:40.280
Hello again.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.320
Hello to everybody.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.080
Normally, when we have a great turnout like this,

01:43.080 --> 01:45.560
I'd read the names out, but there's so many in there.

01:45.560 --> 01:46.480
It's just not possible.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.920
So great to see so many of you.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.880
I really, today is one of those days

01:50.880 --> 01:52.400
where it's great to have friends,

01:52.400 --> 01:54.320
and there is an aspect of lugs

01:54.320 --> 01:55.480
that we don't talk about a lot,

01:55.480 --> 01:58.080
and sometimes it can be a bit of a support group

01:58.080 --> 02:00.480
where it's where everybody knows your name,

02:00.480 --> 02:02.020
and it's just what you need,

02:02.020 --> 02:04.440
and today is one of those days for me.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.680
We'll get into that in a little bit.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.440
I have something I need to update everybody on,

02:07.440 --> 02:08.780
but in the meantime,

02:08.780 --> 02:10.400
you guys are making all the difference for me today.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.220
I really appreciate that you're here.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.960
So if you'd like to participate in our virtual lug,

02:13.960 --> 02:16.520
please do, because it's just getting better

02:16.520 --> 02:17.360
and better all the time.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.640
We do have the new time,

02:18.640 --> 02:19.960
which will throw some people off,

02:19.960 --> 02:22.220
but I think it's worth it.

02:22.220 --> 02:23.060
What do you say, Wes?

02:23.060 --> 02:24.400
Should we start with some great community news?

02:24.400 --> 02:25.720
Yeah, we've got a lot to get into.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.720
Super excited to get the announcement out

02:28.720 --> 02:30.400
for the old Manjaro project.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.080
Version 19 of Manjaro is out,

02:33.080 --> 02:35.120
and of course, in there is tasty updates

02:35.120 --> 02:37.540
to the different desktop environments,

02:37.540 --> 02:40.040
as well as, I haven't tried this yet.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.120
I was thinking about trying to get the old upgrade in

02:42.120 --> 02:43.440
before we started.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.580
Of course you were.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.120
Still loving it on the ThinkPad,

02:47.120 --> 02:49.720
but I just thought, you know what?

02:49.720 --> 02:51.120
I got a lot going on today.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.520
Today is not that day,

02:52.520 --> 02:54.360
but I believe in there now,

02:54.360 --> 02:56.200
and maybe actually Wim, but you may know,

02:56.200 --> 02:57.080
I believe in there now,

02:57.080 --> 02:59.320
they have really smooth integration

02:59.320 --> 03:00.360
for snaps and flat packs,

03:00.360 --> 03:01.440
like just the old double click,

03:01.440 --> 03:03.720
and it launches right up and gets installed.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.720
Yeah, this is, I can't speak to the flat packs.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.920
I don't know what the extent of the work is there,

03:08.920 --> 03:11.600
but knowing the attention to detail,

03:11.600 --> 03:14.160
Phil and team have shown snaps,

03:14.160 --> 03:18.320
I expect that both enjoy first-class support there now.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.720
I've had a chat with Phil.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.960
He's been showing me some of the development

03:21.960 --> 03:23.120
as it's been going along,

03:23.120 --> 03:27.320
and yeah, they've got all of the packages available

03:27.320 --> 03:29.120
side-by-side, so you can take your pick

03:29.120 --> 03:31.600
where you need to take a pick.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.760
You know what I noticed, Wes?

03:32.760 --> 03:35.400
They're using the LTS kernel.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.240
Hmm.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.060
That's a good idea.

03:37.060 --> 03:37.900
Huh.

03:37.900 --> 03:38.740
Wonder why we didn't think of that.

03:38.740 --> 03:39.920
There's a good reason for that.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.340
I wonder, you know, we actually,

03:41.340 --> 03:44.040
Wes and I don't have the LTS kernel installed

03:44.040 --> 03:45.800
on our Archbox right now,

03:45.800 --> 03:48.360
and we, for the life of us, can't quite remember why,

03:48.360 --> 03:51.000
other than we just felt like being dumb.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.960
Like, I think we had the conversation,

03:52.960 --> 03:54.240
and I think it went something like,

03:54.240 --> 03:56.800
ah, screw it, let's see how far we can push this thing.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.240
And it's been great for the show.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.120
Why do they use the LTS kernel?

04:01.120 --> 04:03.340
It must be for drivers or something, right?

04:03.340 --> 04:05.200
Yeah, well, I know one of the reasons

04:05.200 --> 04:08.320
is the fact that the Nvidia 390 kernel

04:08.320 --> 04:12.640
is not compatible with anything newer than the 54 kernel,

04:12.640 --> 04:14.760
so I think it's there so that people

04:14.760 --> 04:17.920
that have got older generations Nvidia cards

04:17.920 --> 04:22.240
have still got a support root there on an LTS kernel.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.100
I think an LTS kernel is a pretty solid idea

04:24.100 --> 04:25.480
on a rolling distro.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.760
I'm a big fan after last week.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.720
All right, well, there was a story

04:29.720 --> 04:30.880
that I think we've all been,

04:30.880 --> 04:33.880
I'm wondering if you can guess what it is, Wes.

04:33.880 --> 04:37.560
There's a story out there that we have been led to believe

04:37.560 --> 04:40.160
we'd have an update that caused inconvenience

04:40.160 --> 04:42.840
for a bunch of enthusiastic purchasers,

04:42.840 --> 04:45.800
and we now have a resolution and an update.

04:45.800 --> 04:46.720
I'm trying to make it cryptic

04:46.720 --> 04:48.340
because I don't want to give it away,

04:48.340 --> 04:50.840
but Wes Payne, one guess.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.520
The Raspberry Pi 4 finally got its USB-C act together.

04:54.520 --> 04:55.360
That's right.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.180
Woo!

04:56.180 --> 04:57.020
That's right.

04:57.020 --> 04:57.860
That means I can finally buy one.

04:57.860 --> 04:59.600
I've been waiting for them to fix this.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.940
Yeah, yep, you got it.

05:01.920 --> 05:02.960
So I guess, what was it?

05:02.960 --> 05:06.640
There was anything that was marked with a E cable

05:06.640 --> 05:08.560
for USB-Cs, and that was like one of the smarter

05:08.560 --> 05:10.440
USB-C type cables.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.040
It wouldn't work with the Raspberry Pi 4.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.840
Yeah, they had some non-standard wiring,

05:13.840 --> 05:15.960
so it thought it was actually an audio device

05:15.960 --> 05:17.480
and wouldn't give it all the juice.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.400
I mean, USB-C's got lots of fancy things,

05:19.400 --> 05:21.440
but you got to get those negotiations right

05:21.440 --> 05:23.800
if you want all the power that you have.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.040
So it meant that some adapters worked and some didn't.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.800
Obviously, the one they supplied did,

05:27.800 --> 05:30.360
but one of the nice advantages in theory of USB-C

05:30.360 --> 05:33.200
is we've all got all of these things laying around.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.460
With those first generation, they might not work.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.120
Yeah, I want to power my Raspberry Pi

05:37.120 --> 05:38.400
with my laptop adapter.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.240
Come on.

05:41.120 --> 05:45.060
So the register reached out to Eben Upton, right?

05:45.060 --> 05:46.080
Eben, Eben?

05:46.080 --> 05:46.900
Sorry, Eben.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.000
It's not you, it's me.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.400
Mr. Upton?

05:50.400 --> 05:51.240
That's the way to go.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.960
Mr. Upton, and they asked him about this

05:53.960 --> 05:55.480
and like, what the hell, where's this at?

05:55.480 --> 05:58.560
And he said, yes, indeed, they had rolled a fix

05:58.560 --> 06:01.220
into their PCB design for manufacturing,

06:01.220 --> 06:05.080
and he would expect that it has begun to reach end users

06:05.080 --> 06:07.280
by about now.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.240
Ooh.

06:08.240 --> 06:11.160
So if you're buying a Raspberry Pi now

06:11.160 --> 06:15.040
or in the near term future, it will likely have the fix.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.240
So if you would do me a big solid,

06:17.240 --> 06:20.320
if you get one of these and it does seem to be fixed,

06:20.320 --> 06:21.200
please let me know.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.120
I'd love to update folks and say, yes,

06:23.120 --> 06:25.200
they are actually out in the marketplace now.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.920
There was another interesting little tidbit

06:26.920 --> 06:30.080
to this story, though, when they were talking to Upton,

06:30.080 --> 06:31.640
he confirmed that the four gig version

06:31.640 --> 06:33.100
was really the one flying off the shelves,

06:33.100 --> 06:35.460
but I guess before the four launched,

06:35.460 --> 06:37.480
they thought it would be the two gig version.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.520
I think that's probably because of price.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.480
They thought the price was too high on the four gig version.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.960
Meanwhile, I was over here being,

06:44.960 --> 06:46.480
could you make an eight gig version?

06:46.480 --> 06:48.240
All right, I'll take all the RAM I can get.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.360
That's what I want.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.120
Yeah.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.560
And I mean, they were kind of getting the data back

06:53.560 --> 06:56.000
in September showing the four gig was performing better.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.100
So I guess what this really is confirming actually

06:58.100 --> 06:59.600
is that that is still the case.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.160
The four gig is still the top performing seller,

07:03.160 --> 07:06.320
which could mean maybe that eight gig version will show up.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.240
That would be great.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.840
Fingers crossed.

07:08.840 --> 07:12.360
I'm running three.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.800
I wanted to say four, but the fourth one

07:14.800 --> 07:15.840
is just for playing with.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.320
I'm running three in production at my home.

07:19.320 --> 07:23.680
One does all of the things, probably too many things.

07:23.680 --> 07:30.000
And then the other is just doing pie hole and one network

07:30.000 --> 07:31.600
monitoring tool, Smokeping.

07:31.600 --> 07:36.480
And then another is doing all of my security cameras using,

07:36.480 --> 07:38.440
what's that project called that I can't remember?

07:38.440 --> 07:39.400
Shinobi?

07:39.400 --> 07:40.920
Shinobi, thank you.

07:40.920 --> 07:45.560
And I mean, I've been using them for months now.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.600
It really has felt like the first sort of like,

07:47.600 --> 07:49.240
all right, I'll just deploy this, and it'll work,

07:49.240 --> 07:51.760
and it's powerful enough for all of my needs.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.300
You don't have to compromise too much.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.440
I'm pretty happy.

07:54.440 --> 07:58.200
And I'm actually kind of feeling like I

07:58.200 --> 08:00.200
reaffirmed that decision to go.

08:00.200 --> 08:04.080
The Raspberry Pi for me has always been a toy.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.720
And as an old sys admin, the idea

08:06.720 --> 08:09.800
of putting a toy in production for my server

08:09.800 --> 08:11.000
seems like a bad idea.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.920
And I still think I'll regret not

08:12.920 --> 08:16.100
getting more frequent DDs of my SD cards,

08:16.100 --> 08:17.640
because I know one of those suckers

08:17.640 --> 08:18.520
is going to die on me soon.

08:18.520 --> 08:19.760
Hey, that's on you, buddy.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.200
I know, and there are ways you could get around it.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.760
You don't have to use an SD card,

08:23.760 --> 08:26.880
but I actually kind of like the floppy disk-like nature

08:26.880 --> 08:28.120
where I can just copy them.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.600
And anyways, where it has actually been pretty great

08:31.600 --> 08:34.360
is how freaking low power they are.

08:34.360 --> 08:39.800
Even the Raspberry Pi 4 is way less power than an x86,

08:39.800 --> 08:42.040
even a low-end x86.

08:42.040 --> 08:45.560
The whole load for my entire Lady Joops RV

08:45.560 --> 08:49.400
with all of my smart lights on and all of my Raspberry

08:49.400 --> 08:53.360
Pis running, my Wi-Fi, my network switch, my router,

08:53.360 --> 08:55.960
all of that, and all my LED lights, all of it

08:55.960 --> 08:58.300
together is less than 200 watts, everything.

08:58.300 --> 08:58.960
That's fantastic.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.120
Even on a cloudy day, I get that in solar power.

09:01.120 --> 09:06.240
So I run my Raspberry Pis off of solar all day long.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.120
That's pretty cool.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.920
And I don't think I could do it with an x86

09:08.920 --> 09:10.680
PC in the Pacific Northwest.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.960
You can really just optimize.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.240
It's just enough compute, just enough resources,

09:14.240 --> 09:15.640
and you don't have to compromise.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.480
And silent.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.600
That's the other thing.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.520
Maybe they'll die a year or two sooner

09:23.520 --> 09:26.040
than if I was not using them in production.

09:26.040 --> 09:29.320
But at that price point, realistically, I

09:29.320 --> 09:32.080
could replace all of them every year.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.880
And the form factor is so easy.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.200
You kind of grab it, you just slot in your new SD card,

09:36.200 --> 09:38.120
plug in, and you're done.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.560
Well, and realistically, you're going

09:39.560 --> 09:42.800
to replace them when the 8-gig version comes out.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.400
Yeah, especially the one that I have that's running Plex

09:46.400 --> 09:48.880
and it's running a bunch of other containers,

09:48.880 --> 09:52.520
like a document wiki and a bunch of network tools

09:52.520 --> 09:56.920
and all these other services that really push the Pi to.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.000
I was really kind of seeing how far I could push it.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.320
And then I was like, OK, well, now it's invaluable.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.440
I pushed it really far and made it invaluable.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.140
You do have backups, right?

10:05.140 --> 10:06.220
Every night.

10:06.220 --> 10:06.720
Every night.

10:06.720 --> 10:11.880
But it's still not the same thing.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.720
I have all the data backed up, and all the applications

10:14.720 --> 10:16.920
are in containers.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.440
But I'd still have to burn a day getting the OS all reconfigured

10:20.440 --> 10:21.120
and all of that.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.600
So I just don't want that.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.720
I've insulated as much as I can, but I

10:25.720 --> 10:27.280
Sounds like you need to teach Dylan how

10:27.280 --> 10:29.880
to make copies of SD cards.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.520
I like that you and Cheese keep coming up with jobs for my son.

10:32.520 --> 10:32.880
This is good.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.240
I'll get a list from you guys, and then I'll start getting them.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.200
These are great chores.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.800
Sorry, Dylan.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.640
Son, today I'm going to learn you how to DD an SD card, son.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.080
I think I might DD rescue it.

10:43.080 --> 10:43.360
I don't know.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.120
Does anybody in the Mumble Room have tips

10:45.120 --> 10:47.560
for how to duplicate an SD card in Raspberry Pi?

10:47.560 --> 10:50.160
Don't use DD or DD rescue.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.600
What should I reuse?

10:51.600 --> 10:52.280
This is good.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.720
Well, you know, gnome disks can restore disk images,

10:55.720 --> 10:59.160
like SD card images onto SD cards.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.320
That works really nicely.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.120
It's not just using DD in the back end?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.080
No, of course not.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.520
It's for animals.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.000
We've evolved since then, Chris.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.480
That was like 30 years ago.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.400
OK, all right.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.360
I'm totally down for giving that a go.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.440
And it's so low impact to test it, right?

11:14.440 --> 11:16.400
Here's what I was thinking my process would be.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.200
Shut down the Raspberry Pi, pop it out of the Pi,

11:19.200 --> 11:24.600
pop the current production SD card in my ThinkPad,

11:24.600 --> 11:27.240
image it right off the built-in SD card reader,

11:27.240 --> 11:29.880
and then pop a new one in and restore the image to that,

11:29.880 --> 11:31.960
put that in the Raspberry Pi, see if it boots.

11:31.960 --> 11:32.840
Yeah, sounds good.

11:32.840 --> 11:36.280
And gnome disks has create a disk image

11:36.280 --> 11:37.400
and restore a disk image.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.840
So you can do it all with a UI and not

11:39.840 --> 11:43.120
run the risk of DDing over something critical.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.880
Yeah, but what if he's on plasma?

11:45.880 --> 11:47.920
I'll install gnome disk, it sounds like.

11:47.920 --> 11:51.040
Hey, I will say gnome disk is actually really great.

11:51.040 --> 11:54.320
I'm running it on everything, even on plasma.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.280
I've definitely taken a look at gnome disk.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.320
Is there like a certain point where it's like,

11:59.320 --> 12:00.940
you've got to have at least this version?

12:00.940 --> 12:02.980
Or has it just been good enough for a long time now?

12:02.980 --> 12:05.640
It's been there for as long as I can remember.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.000
I mean, I was certainly doing lightning talks about this

12:09.000 --> 12:10.400
four or five years ago.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.720
I thought someone was going to say Clonezilla to me.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.080
That's what I thought I would get suggested was Clonezilla.

12:16.080 --> 12:16.760
But I like this.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.240
This is much simpler.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.680
Chris, would not a good alternative

12:19.680 --> 12:22.320
to avoid the manual intervention here

12:22.320 --> 12:25.960
be to simply run some rsync over the network to your backups?

12:25.960 --> 12:27.760
I mean, it's not as complete a solution,

12:27.760 --> 12:29.520
but it won't take you a day to restore.

12:29.520 --> 12:31.760
Yeah, and just rsync the file systems around.

12:31.760 --> 12:35.760
Yeah, I wonder, taking the whole theory of the Raspberry Pis

12:35.760 --> 12:37.440
are not so expensive that maybe it

12:37.440 --> 12:41.200
wouldn't be impossible to buy another $45 Raspberry Pi

12:41.200 --> 12:43.720
and have it running as sort of a cold backup that's

12:43.720 --> 12:44.760
syncing every day.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.920
And then if one dies, I just pull the plug out,

12:46.920 --> 12:48.060
plug in the other one.

12:48.060 --> 12:51.360
Why do you need to restore data and move data around?

12:51.360 --> 12:53.840
Aren't you running everything in containers?

12:53.840 --> 12:56.400
Have a docker compose file stored somewhere

12:56.400 --> 13:01.680
off site, GitHub maybe, and then spin up your containers,

13:01.680 --> 13:05.120
plug in your persistent storage, and you're good to go,

13:05.120 --> 13:05.880
aren't you?

13:05.880 --> 13:08.280
Yes, mostly the data is solved for.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.280
It's really trying to avoid the hassle of spending

13:11.280 --> 13:13.920
the afternoon installing Raspbian, getting it updated,

13:13.920 --> 13:16.520
getting the Docker repo added, getting Docker installed,

13:16.520 --> 13:20.540
getting that data reinstalled, avoiding all of that stuff that

13:20.540 --> 13:23.960
takes a guy like me an afternoon because I'm

13:23.960 --> 13:26.920
doing three other things and it's a Saturday.

13:26.920 --> 13:30.680
I want something that's nearly like plug a new SD card

13:30.680 --> 13:32.980
in, power it back on, and it's pretty much good to go.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.480
Because in theory, the data would be safe.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.360
Because the data is stored on a separate disk.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.720
Have you heard of my friend Bash Script?

13:40.720 --> 13:44.160
He can do a lot of that for you.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.040
Yeah, well, that's what Brett was saying,

13:46.040 --> 13:48.680
is maybe just automate so that it's always synced up.

13:48.680 --> 13:49.760
Yeah, I kind of like it.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.800
Or Ansible, or there's a lot of ways

13:52.800 --> 13:55.080
to solve this particular turkey.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.080
That is actually part of my problem.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.200
I got so many options.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.400
I can think of a half a dozen ways to do it.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.540
And then the internet could probably think

14:02.540 --> 14:03.960
of 100 ways I could do it.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.920
You should probably pick the one that

14:04.920 --> 14:06.760
will be the best content for the future.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.000
That's what I want to say.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.280
Yeah, so I should say I should wipe all of them

14:10.280 --> 14:12.720
and put Arch on there.

14:12.720 --> 14:17.280
Well, I mean, I think the latest Manjaro release will be fine.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.160
We'll see about that.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.940
I actually think if I were to reload them,

14:21.940 --> 14:25.720
I'd probably still for today.

14:25.720 --> 14:26.680
I'm not sure.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.240
Stick with Raspbian.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.520
With the Raspberry Pi 4, it's been semi-necessary,

14:30.520 --> 14:31.840
although I think that's changing.

14:31.840 --> 14:35.520
So I may just relook at this in a few months

14:35.520 --> 14:37.200
and then redo it then.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.400
You know, probably one of these will just fail on you.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.040
And then you'll have to figure out how to restore it.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.000
And you'll figure it out then.

14:42.000 --> 14:42.640
Undoubtedly.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.160
Undoubtedly.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.560
That's totally how that's going to go.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.160
No problem.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.320
Well then, let's do a little housekeeping.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.560
There's a few things I'd like to tell you about.

14:52.560 --> 14:57.960
Number one, you have to go check out Brent's recent brunch.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.680
He sat down with Heather Ellsworth from Canonical.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.240
She's a software engineer on Canonical's Ubuntu desktop

15:03.240 --> 15:03.920
team.

15:03.920 --> 15:07.160
She's also a Gnome Foundation member.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.360
And she has quite a story, including a background

15:10.360 --> 15:16.440
in physics at CERN and just a great conversation overall.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.680
It gives you kind of an insight, too, at daily life

15:18.680 --> 15:20.300
at Canonical as well.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.480
That's one of my favorite brunches so far.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.920
Yeah, Heather's awesome.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.840
Her chat, we could have chatted for probably two hours.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.760
But maybe that'll come sometime in the future.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.200
But anyway, she's fascinating.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.040
She's super awesome.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.600
I encourage everybody to check it out.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.440
Absolutely.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.120
Also, well, OK.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.760
So I have a little bad news.

15:39.760 --> 15:44.360
We have been trying to get this sorted out for a little while.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.120
I was hoping I wouldn't have to come on air and say this.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.760
But we will not be attending scale this year.

15:49.760 --> 15:50.840
It's a little last minute.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.260
And the reason why that bothers me

15:52.260 --> 15:54.000
is because I know there's already

15:54.000 --> 15:57.200
some folks who have made travel plans to come out and see us.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.160
You guys are awesome.

15:59.160 --> 16:04.280
But the reality is just didn't work out this year.

16:04.280 --> 16:11.040
The merger happened just right around the time of Fest season.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.500
And budgets are getting finalized.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.800
And it just didn't iron out.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.360
So we decided to put our efforts and resources into LinuxFest

16:17.360 --> 16:20.200
Northwest, which is going forward.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.600
It's a shame.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.960
We love coming out and seeing you guys.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.040
You've heard me talk about how important the in-real-life

16:26.040 --> 16:28.640
connection is a million times on this show.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.800
And these are always our chance to actually practice

16:30.800 --> 16:32.880
what we preach.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.080
So it is unfortunate.

16:35.080 --> 16:35.840
Elle will be there.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.960
She'll be doing her talk Confessions of a SysAdmin

16:37.960 --> 16:39.360
in Ballroom H on Saturday.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.640
Definitely don't want to miss that.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.520
So she will be there.

16:41.520 --> 16:42.680
You can go say hi to her.

16:42.680 --> 16:46.280
But your buddies, Chris and Wes, won't be making it this year.

16:46.280 --> 16:51.240
And it kills me, actually, to be honest with you.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.640
But we will try to make a great LinuxFest happen.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.040
And hopefully, next year, we'll make it work.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.840
I apologize that we weren't able to get the news out sooner.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.540
We were just trying to make it all work.

17:00.540 --> 17:03.240
But it just wasn't really in the cards.

17:03.240 --> 17:04.240
Wrong timing this time.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.480
Yeah, yeah.

17:05.480 --> 17:08.000
But it's going to be a great scale.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.080
Oh, yeah, we'll be looking on.

17:09.080 --> 17:11.120
And we'll be jealous and watching conference talks

17:11.120 --> 17:11.880
when they're available.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.280
And I hope everyone has a great time.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.720
Jill, tell people where they can come find you,

17:14.720 --> 17:15.880
because I know you're going to be at scale.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.680
And you've always got so much going on.

17:17.680 --> 17:18.200
Yeah.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.440
So I will be at the Linux Chicks of Los Angeles booth

17:21.440 --> 17:22.800
and running that booth.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.400
And I'll also be doing interviews

17:25.400 --> 17:27.760
on the floor for Linux Gamecast.

17:27.760 --> 17:32.440
And we're also going to go live from Linux Gamecast

17:32.440 --> 17:34.360
and at the Lutris booth.

17:34.360 --> 17:34.860
Dang.

17:34.860 --> 17:35.840
Wow.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.240
I'm going to be everywhere.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.640
Jill, you are working it this year.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.400
That's awesome.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.480
Yes.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.160
Scale is such a great event.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.520
LinuxFest Northwest is our hometown event.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.600
But scale, I think, is one of the best events in the West.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.480
Yeah, and I'm going to miss my Jupiter broadcasting family.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.160
Yeah, well, we'll miss you, too.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.760
Yeah, it's always a good chance to catch up with everybody.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.640
That's one of the things we love about it.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.400
But perhaps next year.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.200
All right.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.040
Well, then, the housekeeping goes on.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.400
One other thing I'll mention, go check out Headlines,

18:03.400 --> 18:04.840
linuxheadlines.show.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.600
We're doing something kind of neat here.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.880
We're trying out a new format, a three-minute podcast.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.640
That sounds crazy.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.680
How could that work?

18:11.680 --> 18:13.000
I like it.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.720
I just put it on as I'm getting down the road,

18:14.720 --> 18:16.760
and then my podcast player just plays the next thing.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.360
It's just sort of the way I start off.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.280
linuxheadlines.show, three minutes or less,

18:20.280 --> 18:21.520
everything going on.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.800
And here's what we try to do here.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.420
We try to do something that's not

18:25.420 --> 18:29.680
hypey, that's not just taking PR releases,

18:29.680 --> 18:31.920
remassaging them, and then putting the headline on it

18:31.920 --> 18:33.400
that makes you want to click it.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.520
We've got a team of people that are dedicated to trying

18:35.520 --> 18:37.320
to get that accurate coverage in there,

18:37.320 --> 18:38.740
trying to get it just right.

18:38.740 --> 18:43.240
And then, sometimes to our dissatisfaction,

18:43.240 --> 18:44.860
we all argue over the details for a while

18:44.860 --> 18:46.560
before we publish it to make sure everything's really

18:46.560 --> 18:47.880
massaged just right.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.960
And it gets reviewed by a team of us

18:49.960 --> 18:51.520
before it's published every day.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.820
You'd be amazed the amount of work

18:52.820 --> 18:54.360
we're putting into a three-minute show.

18:54.360 --> 18:57.320
But I think it's kind of important, especially

18:57.320 --> 18:58.940
if you're in the industry.

18:58.940 --> 19:01.720
You want to keep aware of what's going on.

19:01.720 --> 19:06.400
You want to be current, sort of like due diligence in a sense.

19:06.400 --> 19:10.880
But you don't need to commit to two hours or an hour long.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.740
Just get the headlines every weekday at linuxheadlines.show.

19:14.740 --> 19:16.240
And then the stuff that really needs

19:16.240 --> 19:18.080
a deeper analysis, further discussion,

19:18.080 --> 19:19.800
we'll either do it here or we'll put it

19:19.800 --> 19:21.240
on Linux Action News on Sunday.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.580
And of course, we've got links to everything,

19:22.580 --> 19:23.760
so you can find out more.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.200
Bob is indeed your uncle on that one, I say.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.080
So check that out, linuxheadlines.show.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.840
And last but not least, a plug for the old Telegram group,

19:30.840 --> 19:32.200
just rocking it out.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.080
People are awesome over there, some super good conversations.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.400
I thought for sure it would fall apart as it got huge,

19:37.400 --> 19:40.200
and it's gotten better.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.600
It boggles the mind.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.520
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.600
Go get in a 1,500 and stronger group over there

19:46.600 --> 19:48.440
that are talking about these shows, Linux,

19:48.440 --> 19:50.040
and everything in between.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.400
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.000
Yeah, we actually just crossed 1,600.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.320
That's amazing.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.700
And it's just a nice place to be.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.840
Great conversations basically all the time.

20:00.840 --> 20:01.520
That is so cool.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.120
All the time.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.800
Now we have a little bit of a public service announcement

20:06.800 --> 20:08.620
that I want to get into on the program.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.280
This is something that's going to impact

20:10.280 --> 20:11.760
those that are in the maker space

20:11.760 --> 20:15.200
or love to see technology, cutting edge technology,

20:15.200 --> 20:18.040
and see where it can go and tinker with it.

20:18.040 --> 20:20.840
We cut now live to our reporter on the scene.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.960
Alex, I'm hearing that people are getting very upset

20:22.960 --> 20:26.080
about new drone changes that are coming to the states.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.200
Well, not strictly Linux.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.800
Actually, a lot of these drones do run Linux.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.100
And I was kind of hoping maybe you could update me,

20:32.100 --> 20:34.500
because I have not properly educated myself.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.720
So the thing that I'd like to bring to the audience's

20:36.720 --> 20:40.600
attention is something called remote ID.

20:40.600 --> 20:44.120
And remote ID is effectively an electronic license plate

20:44.120 --> 20:45.720
for all model aircraft.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.040
It's not just drones.

20:47.040 --> 20:50.120
So we're talking about helicopters, planes,

20:50.120 --> 20:52.600
anything that flies, essentially,

20:52.600 --> 20:55.680
that's an unmanned vehicle, UAV.

20:55.680 --> 20:59.640
So on December the 31st of 2019, the FAA

20:59.640 --> 21:03.560
published a proposal for what remote ID is going to look like.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.880
And you have 60 days to comment.

21:05.880 --> 21:09.080
And that period ends on March the 2nd.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.680
Now, what happens after those comments are reviewed

21:11.680 --> 21:14.040
is the FAA will publish a final report.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.680
And the new rules would take effect 60 days after that.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.280
So why is it such a big deal?

21:20.280 --> 21:22.360
Well, for me, there's several things

21:22.360 --> 21:25.680
that are an overreach here.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.660
So let me just break a couple of the key things

21:28.660 --> 21:31.560
down that kind of rubbed me up the wrong way.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.760
Firstly, I build all my own drones,

21:33.760 --> 21:35.600
like racing drones and that kind of stuff.

21:35.600 --> 21:39.640
And as it stands, you will not be able to do that anymore.

21:39.640 --> 21:44.680
Because you will need to buy 100% FAA-approved components,

21:44.680 --> 21:48.800
else you will be restricted to FAA-recognized flying sites,

21:48.800 --> 21:51.000
otherwise known as FRIAs.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.640
Now, most of those are AMA, American Model Association

21:55.640 --> 21:56.640
fields.

21:56.640 --> 22:00.920
So I don't know if you're into FPV or drones,

22:00.920 --> 22:03.800
and you've ever tried to go to a plane field,

22:03.800 --> 22:05.000
you get the stink eye.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.440
And you're not really very welcome there.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.360
So you'll only be able to fly self-built models

22:10.360 --> 22:12.400
three years after these new rules go into effect

22:12.400 --> 22:14.280
at these FRIA sites.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.840
Now, a further kicker is that they're not approving

22:16.840 --> 22:19.120
any new FRIA sites ever.

22:19.120 --> 22:23.280
Because as they assume in their rules,

22:23.280 --> 22:25.720
all craft will be remote ID capable.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.440
So there'll be no need for new FRIAs to be approved.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.820
Well, that's just not true.

22:30.820 --> 22:34.400
So in terms of where you can and cannot fly,

22:34.400 --> 22:37.400
you will not be able to fly in your own backyard

22:37.400 --> 22:39.000
on your own property.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.360
You will not be able to fly in parks, anywhere that

22:42.360 --> 22:43.880
is basically currently legal.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.080
I mean, obviously, national parks and stuff like that

22:46.080 --> 22:48.880
are still out of range.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.660
But I think it's just a huge overreach

22:50.660 --> 22:54.000
to try and regulate the model aircraft's base,

22:54.000 --> 22:57.880
that sort of sub 400 feet altitude space.

22:57.880 --> 23:01.200
So that people like Amazon, and FedEx, and UPS

23:01.200 --> 23:04.960
can start flying commercial delivery drones.

23:04.960 --> 23:08.220
So if your aircraft is not remote ID capable,

23:08.220 --> 23:12.800
you will only be able to fly at a pre-approved FRIA site.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.460
If your aircraft can share a location via the internet,

23:15.460 --> 23:19.240
so this addresses most DJI type products,

23:19.240 --> 23:21.880
you will need to subscribe to a subscription service, which

23:21.880 --> 23:23.640
hasn't yet been decided.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.560
So let's assume a minimum of $5 a month.

23:26.560 --> 23:29.760
And at that point, you can only fly in a 400 foot sphere

23:29.760 --> 23:30.800
around you.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.720
So that includes up, but also sideways.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.520
So 400 feet, that's it.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.860
You have this drone that can go 5 kilometers,

23:37.860 --> 23:40.480
and you can do 400 feet.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.880
So I think it's pretty egregious.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.800
I think it's a horrible overreach.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.560
Now, what can you do about it?

23:46.560 --> 23:48.760
You can leave a comment on the FAA website

23:48.760 --> 23:50.720
before March the 2nd.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.800
Please try not to make it an emotional type, reaction type

23:53.800 --> 23:55.880
comment that FAA sucks.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.480
That kind of thing is not very helpful.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.920
But instead, focus on the specific areas of remote ID

24:01.920 --> 24:04.480
that you think are unworkable or an overreach.

24:04.480 --> 24:08.080
And propose alternate solutions, such as app-based systems.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.840
Lance is something that already exists for part 107

24:11.840 --> 24:15.160
commercial pilots to essentially say, hey,

24:15.160 --> 24:16.720
I'm going to fly here through an app,

24:16.720 --> 24:20.360
get pre-approval to fly in that airspace.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.600
And just remember that as this proposal stands,

24:22.600 --> 24:24.800
it's going to pretty much kill the remote control

24:24.800 --> 24:26.120
hobby as we know it.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.580
Yeah, it's a shame, because it seems like that community's

24:28.580 --> 24:30.560
been really blossoming.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.160
It's a makerspace thing now, like building these little

24:33.160 --> 24:34.480
drones as a maker thing.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.200
It's a huge part of the reason I'm into electronics

24:37.200 --> 24:39.820
and self-hosting and all that kind of stuff.

24:39.820 --> 24:42.580
I mean, I got into building my own quadcopters

24:42.580 --> 24:44.240
and learned electronics through that.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.160
And that's led to a whole bunch of other stuff

24:46.160 --> 24:48.080
that anybody who listens to self-hosted

24:48.080 --> 24:49.760
will be familiar with.

24:49.760 --> 24:53.120
So many prominent YouTubers have released really excellent

24:53.120 --> 24:55.520
content on this topic, including Flight Test,

24:55.520 --> 24:59.840
Joshua Bardwell, Rotor Riot, Mr. Steel, et cetera, et cetera.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.500
So please leave a comment for the FAA.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.040
Even if you don't live in America,

25:05.040 --> 25:07.280
just leave a comment anyway.

25:07.280 --> 25:10.080
Let's try and get the numbers up.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.360
If you want to help make a difference,

25:12.360 --> 25:15.560
you can also join me and thousands of other people,

25:15.560 --> 25:18.140
remote control pilots, who are going to be in Washington DC

25:18.140 --> 25:20.720
this Saturday, the 29th of February,

25:20.720 --> 25:24.520
for a protest outside the FAA headquarters,

25:24.520 --> 25:25.760
just off the National Mall.

25:25.760 --> 25:29.640
So thanks for letting me raise the awareness of this issue,

25:29.640 --> 25:30.200
Chris.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.620
Yeah, we want to talk about it now,

25:31.620 --> 25:33.240
since the timing is critical.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.000
There you have it.

25:34.000 --> 25:34.640
Do-do-do-do-do.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.000
There's Alex with our drone update.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.880
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.160
He didn't mention it, but he's actually being

25:38.160 --> 25:39.320
carried by a drone right now.

25:39.320 --> 25:43.520
Thank you, Alex, for that very important public announcement.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.320
Yeah, go speak on it if you can.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.760
Make some comments, make some noise,

25:46.760 --> 25:49.360
and hopefully there'll be some reconsidering done.

25:49.360 --> 25:52.640
So now I want to talk about Zero Trust SSH.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.800
This is something that is so cool.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.240
Jeremy's going to join us and talk

25:56.240 --> 25:58.600
about things I never knew were possible for SSH

25:58.600 --> 25:59.520
authentication.

25:59.520 --> 26:03.660
It truly is the magical, magical fruit in open source.

26:03.660 --> 26:07.880
And he's got some problems to solve that I'd never

26:07.880 --> 26:10.120
really contemplated before.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.080
All right, well, we all use SSH.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.600
And I mean, I daresay love it, right?

26:13.600 --> 26:14.120
Love it.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.000
From port forwarding to proxying to just

26:16.000 --> 26:19.800
getting to a server securely, it's super handy.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.080
But we don't all use it in the best way.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.880
I mean, I'm looking at you, Chris.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.140
You're one who uses password-based authentication.

26:26.140 --> 26:28.520
A lot of times, unless it's like just a few

26:28.520 --> 26:30.880
of the regular machines, I just stick to passwords.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.680
But you at least know you have other options,

26:32.680 --> 26:34.800
things like public-private key pairs

26:34.800 --> 26:36.560
that you can use to get onto servers.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.960
Well, there's another way to do it, and it has some advantages.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.520
And Jeremy had a great presentation

26:42.520 --> 26:44.400
all about how you might actually use it.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.960
SSH has certificates, and Jeremy, thanks

26:46.960 --> 26:48.520
for joining us to tell us more.

26:48.520 --> 26:49.480
Oh, thank you very much.

26:49.480 --> 26:53.520
Yes, password-based auth, it is sort of maybe

26:53.520 --> 26:56.000
the first introduction you get to SSH.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.560
You know, you sort of start it up,

26:57.560 --> 26:59.240
and then try an SSH straightaway,

26:59.240 --> 27:00.740
and you're prompted for your password.

27:00.740 --> 27:03.240
And you think, oh, well, this is pretty familiar,

27:03.240 --> 27:06.160
and it works no problem.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.840
But then as you pointed out, there's

27:07.840 --> 27:10.680
that public-private key authentication.

27:10.680 --> 27:14.340
And maybe if you're like me, you sort of try to try it out,

27:14.340 --> 27:18.560
because it was a bit of a more exciting way to connect.

27:18.560 --> 27:21.440
Or you've just gotten tired of typing in your password

27:21.440 --> 27:22.560
all the time.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.440
Or maybe even if you're at a company,

27:24.440 --> 27:27.120
you might be required to use private-public-key

27:27.120 --> 27:28.320
authentication.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.820
So there's some distinct advantages

27:29.820 --> 27:32.640
with private-public-key versus password-based.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.880
You're kind of authenticating your laptop to the server

27:35.880 --> 27:38.720
instead of your password.

27:38.720 --> 27:42.280
So there's some advantages that you can't accidentally

27:42.280 --> 27:46.760
mistype your password into the wrong prompt, for example.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.000
There's some other neat advantages of public-private-key.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.480
But like you said, the third way that I discovered

27:52.480 --> 27:57.240
is already in Open SSH since 7 point something,

27:57.240 --> 28:01.200
I can't remember, is certificate-based authentication.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.080
It's not an X.509 certificate.

28:04.080 --> 28:08.480
It's kind of a lightweight certificate.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.600
Really, all it is is your public key

28:11.600 --> 28:15.560
that's been signed by another private key,

28:15.560 --> 28:20.280
a little bit of metadata like expiry and username,

28:20.280 --> 28:21.960
things like that.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.080
But that's all it is, really.

28:24.080 --> 28:27.360
So instead of having your public key and private key,

28:27.360 --> 28:31.000
you have your public key plus that signature

28:31.000 --> 28:32.760
and your private key.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.680
And you can't have a chain of trust

28:34.680 --> 28:38.080
like in a normal X.509 certificate,

28:38.080 --> 28:39.360
like a TLS certificate.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.240
So you can't have a root authority

28:41.240 --> 28:44.240
and then an intermediate and then things like that.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.400
It's just one.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.760
You just have one level of delegated trust.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.320
That's right.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.400
That's right.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.720
But when you go in SSH to a server,

28:51.720 --> 28:53.800
so with public-private-key, what you need to do

28:53.800 --> 28:55.600
is put your public key on the server.

28:55.600 --> 28:55.800
Right.

28:55.800 --> 28:56.760
I think we've all been through that,

28:56.760 --> 28:58.360
having to share your private key with someone

28:58.360 --> 29:00.400
or copy the public key over so that it's there.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.840
And maybe you've got a little script to help you with it.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.720
Exactly.

29:04.720 --> 29:07.160
And maybe you're giving that to your IT team.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.880
It's like, oh, here's my public key.

29:10.880 --> 29:16.520
Except with the SSH certificate, the host

29:16.520 --> 29:18.360
has never seen you before.

29:18.360 --> 29:21.360
So you try an SSH to it.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.840
And as long as your public key has

29:23.840 --> 29:27.960
that signature of the trusted certificate authority,

29:27.960 --> 29:29.920
then the host will go, oh, great, this is you.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.040
This is Jeremy.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.240
I'm going to let you connect.

29:32.240 --> 29:33.780
So it kind of switches things up here.

29:33.780 --> 29:36.520
If I'm getting this right, you can tell that host

29:36.520 --> 29:39.400
to trust anything signed by your certificate authority.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.880
And then it doesn't have to have any specific keys added.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.040
Anything that's been signed, it'll automatically

29:44.040 --> 29:45.160
grant access to.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.200
Absolutely.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.760
So for an individual, I mean, unless you

29:48.760 --> 29:50.960
have hundreds of servers, it might not

29:50.960 --> 29:56.880
be so much of an advantage over public private key itself.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.680
Because I mean, it's not necessarily

29:58.680 --> 30:00.960
any more secure cryptographically.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.280
Right, it's using the same keys and the same infrastructure.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.680
Exactly.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.880
But when you start having more than one person

30:07.880 --> 30:10.800
or a team to manage keys for, I don't

30:10.800 --> 30:12.840
know if you've been through the pain of managing

30:12.840 --> 30:14.160
a team of public keys.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.600
I've definitely managed a Chef repository to push those.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.720
Yeah, it's not a lot of fun.

30:19.720 --> 30:22.880
Well, I mean, even just adding another one,

30:22.880 --> 30:25.600
I mean, my previous company was Puppet.

30:25.600 --> 30:28.920
And the flow for adding a new user

30:28.920 --> 30:34.500
was quite literally get pull, get commit, add the public key,

30:34.500 --> 30:39.000
make a pull request, get someone to review the pull request,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.640
then merge the pull request, and then

30:41.640 --> 30:45.640
watch the CI server deploy Puppet and wait for an hour.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.960
It was a bit involved for just adding a user to the system.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.800
It's some time that I just shouldn't

30:50.800 --> 30:52.640
have been spending doing anything like that.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.120
I should do something else.

30:55.120 --> 30:59.160
So I really wanted to automate team management of SSH

30:59.160 --> 30:59.980
on hosts.

30:59.980 --> 31:01.680
And it doesn't matter where your hosts are.

31:01.680 --> 31:05.280
They could be in Amazon, Google Cloud, or Azure kind of thing.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.360
Or it could just be your own servers in your closet

31:07.360 --> 31:08.040
somewhere.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.160
But yeah, SSH certificates will really help

31:11.160 --> 31:14.040
a team manage their access.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.960
Because if you imagine your hosts suddenly

31:15.960 --> 31:18.640
don't need to know in advance that your user is

31:18.640 --> 31:22.080
going to connect to it, then you can bring up

31:22.080 --> 31:24.280
new hosts all the time.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.480
But as long as the users can go to that certificate authority,

31:27.480 --> 31:29.360
get their SSH certificate signed,

31:29.360 --> 31:32.000
and then connect to your host, it'll be smooth sailing.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.160
That sounds really nice, honestly.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.200
But how do you go about making sure all those certificates get

31:37.200 --> 31:37.700
signed?

31:37.700 --> 31:39.280
Is that another manual process?

31:39.280 --> 31:40.560
Or can you automate?

31:40.560 --> 31:42.000
Yeah, so that's a good point.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.720
And so if I just swapped my problem

31:44.720 --> 31:46.240
for now public key infrastructure

31:46.240 --> 31:49.320
and managing public keys and certificates,

31:49.320 --> 31:52.080
and you're kind of right, because it's maybe

31:52.080 --> 31:56.360
a more difficult problem even than just public keys.

31:56.360 --> 31:59.200
But one of the ways I was going about it

31:59.200 --> 32:03.360
was to create the certificate authority in as light

32:03.360 --> 32:05.360
as possible way.

32:05.360 --> 32:08.960
And we happened to use Amazon, so AWS,

32:08.960 --> 32:10.880
for most of our other things.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.440
So I built a certificate authority

32:13.440 --> 32:14.840
in the Lambda function.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.480
So it's not a new concept, actually.

32:16.480 --> 32:19.400
Netflix, I found it first with Netflix.

32:19.400 --> 32:22.520
They have a project called BLESS, Bastian's Lambda

32:22.520 --> 32:24.240
Ephemeral SSH Service.

32:24.240 --> 32:28.120
Bit of a mouthful, but they were still

32:28.120 --> 32:30.760
using this jump host idea.

32:30.760 --> 32:34.720
And it was connecting users SSH to that first jump

32:34.720 --> 32:36.040
host in the infrastructure.

32:36.040 --> 32:38.480
And then it would go off to the Lambda function, which

32:38.480 --> 32:42.560
is really just a bit of code running somewhere in Amazon.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.560
Who knows where?

32:43.560 --> 32:48.360
Could be on their vacuum cleaner, I don't know.

32:48.360 --> 32:53.720
So you run your Lambda function, and then it

32:53.720 --> 32:56.720
will sign your certificate for you, sign your public key.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.600
Sure, so you send a public key, it'll sign it and send you back

32:59.600 --> 33:00.320
the sign key.

33:00.320 --> 33:01.960
That's correct.

33:01.960 --> 33:05.120
So what Lyft did, which was quite interesting,

33:05.120 --> 33:08.480
is they decided, well, we don't really want this Bastian host,

33:08.480 --> 33:10.440
because it's just complicating things.

33:10.440 --> 33:12.440
And now infrastructure's maybe not set up for it.

33:12.440 --> 33:15.440
So they decided to make a Python client that

33:15.440 --> 33:18.040
worked on developers' laptops.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.640
So every developer's laptop itself

33:19.640 --> 33:22.800
could go and sign its public key.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.720
And it would invoke that Lambda function itself.

33:24.720 --> 33:30.080
And they had a really clever KMS auth thing

33:30.080 --> 33:32.320
to prove your identity to the Lambda,

33:32.320 --> 33:34.880
to say, yes, I need my certificate signed.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.680
And remember, all the Lambda's doing is just

33:36.680 --> 33:39.640
takes your public key, it's got a private key pair,

33:39.640 --> 33:41.240
private key, public key pair, and it just

33:41.240 --> 33:42.960
signs your public key.

33:42.960 --> 33:46.560
It needs to know what username to put into that certificate.

33:46.560 --> 33:49.440
So it needs to know your identity,

33:49.440 --> 33:50.640
a good sense of your identity.

33:50.640 --> 33:53.160
Because if I could get my certificate signed

33:53.160 --> 33:54.760
with someone else's username, then I'd

33:54.760 --> 33:56.400
be able to connect as them.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.080
Right, you've still got this trust layer

33:58.080 --> 33:59.200
you need to take care of.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.240
Exactly.

34:00.240 --> 34:03.000
And actually, it's funny, in a zero trust model,

34:03.000 --> 34:06.920
the idea being that you don't trust anything inside your

34:06.920 --> 34:09.000
network or outside your network.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.880
So each piece should be on its own.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.800
You don't have this firewall, and everything

34:15.800 --> 34:19.400
beyond this firewall is this wonderful garden.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.600
The funny thing is zero trust is almost like more trust,

34:22.600 --> 34:25.960
because you're adding all these extra layers of.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.120
Right, now you're authenticating everywhere.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.040
Exactly.

34:29.040 --> 34:34.360
So one thing I tried to do with the Lambda that I wrote

34:34.360 --> 34:38.040
was to use OpenID Connect to authenticate to the Lambda.

34:38.040 --> 34:42.840
So you sign in with Google to get yourself that certificate.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.640
It just creates that identity token,

34:45.640 --> 34:50.760
which is this bit of signed JSON JWT by Google.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.440
And you can pass it over to your Lambda

34:52.440 --> 34:55.760
and it can verify, yes, your email address is correct.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.160
And it can put your email as your username, for example.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.320
So then in this mode, onboarding, I'm thinking,

35:01.320 --> 35:03.080
I mean, here at Jupiter Broadcasting,

35:03.080 --> 35:04.640
we've got some G Suite going on.

35:04.640 --> 35:07.920
So I could configure a new user there, which I probably

35:07.920 --> 35:09.400
have to do anyway.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.680
And then if it was all set up correctly,

35:11.680 --> 35:13.520
they could just have access to servers.

35:13.520 --> 35:17.440
That's the dream, that a new engineer starts

35:17.440 --> 35:20.360
and they have their laptop, and they already

35:20.360 --> 35:22.520
have the access that they need without you having

35:22.520 --> 35:24.120
to do anything, other than put them

35:24.120 --> 35:26.440
in the correct groups in your directory, right?

35:26.440 --> 35:27.120
Right.

35:27.120 --> 35:28.880
I mean, this is kind of a solved problem

35:28.880 --> 35:32.880
if you think Active Directory, LDAP.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.880
There's all these, that's all existing.

35:35.880 --> 35:39.360
But what I'm seeing is a lot of companies moving away

35:39.360 --> 35:42.520
from having those traditional directories

35:42.520 --> 35:46.680
and going just cloud native services.

35:46.680 --> 35:50.040
So you might just have G Suite, for example.

35:50.040 --> 35:54.320
And if you don't have Active Directory,

35:54.320 --> 35:56.880
how do you now leverage some of those tools

35:56.880 --> 35:58.120
that are all set up for it?

35:58.120 --> 36:02.200
If you're not running LDAP, what's

36:02.200 --> 36:03.680
the alternative kind of thing?

36:03.680 --> 36:05.400
And I think this is a good alternative.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.440
When you say that there's companies out there that

36:07.440 --> 36:09.040
don't have directory services, too, I

36:09.040 --> 36:13.760
think to our audience that is using Active Directory or LDAP,

36:13.760 --> 36:14.720
that sounds ridiculous.

36:14.720 --> 36:18.000
But Wes and I have, and may currently

36:18.000 --> 36:21.880
have worked for companies that have no LDAP, no Active

36:21.880 --> 36:23.240
Directory.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.040
It's a G Suite authentication system.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.120
Maybe you're running Slack.

36:26.120 --> 36:28.240
None of these things necessarily need that back end

36:28.240 --> 36:29.040
infrastructure.

36:29.040 --> 36:29.560
Right.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.560
Absolutely.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.840
So for the company I was at, it seemed

36:32.840 --> 36:37.800
a bit silly to provision LDAP just for managing this.

36:37.800 --> 36:38.320
Right.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.720
And you can also need people to manage LDAP, right?

36:40.720 --> 36:43.160
That's its own arcane art.

36:43.160 --> 36:46.400
So help me understand how shrimp plays into this.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.440
Because I loved that you got a name

36:48.440 --> 36:51.120
for a component of shrimp during the talk, too.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.160
That was a great moment of your talk.

36:53.160 --> 36:53.920
Oh, yes.

36:53.920 --> 36:58.280
Well, I was going through why I named it Shrimp.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.560
And so shrimp has shells, right?

37:00.560 --> 37:01.720
Shrimp have shells.

37:01.720 --> 37:05.960
Got a bit of a groan from the audience for that one.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.400
Lightweight, right?

37:07.400 --> 37:10.480
So I guess you could have a really massive shrimp.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.560
I don't know.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.320
All the shrimp's pretty lightweight.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.240
And then someone yelled out, shrimp's on the barbie.

37:17.240 --> 37:17.920
Right.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.560
Like a classic Australian expression.

37:19.560 --> 37:23.760
It comes from an advertisement ages ago, I think.

37:23.760 --> 37:24.400
Yeah.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.480
So I had to integrate that somehow.

37:26.480 --> 37:29.120
I was looking for a name for the back end components.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.440
So maybe that was the barbecue.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.240
So like shrimp's on the barbie kind of thing.

37:32.240 --> 37:32.720
Yeah.

37:32.720 --> 37:33.680
I don't know.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.840
So shrimp is the name that ties all of this together.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.320
It's the different components that

37:38.320 --> 37:40.360
enable you to use Lambda for this aspect.

37:40.360 --> 37:40.840
Right.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.360
Yeah.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.920
So shrimp is the two parts.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.480
There's the Lambda, and then there's

37:44.480 --> 37:47.360
the client on your laptop.

37:47.360 --> 37:50.080
So you need something to go and automate

37:50.080 --> 37:53.480
the process of giving your public key to the Lambda

37:53.480 --> 37:56.840
and then receiving back the signed certificate

37:56.840 --> 37:59.160
and using it in your connection.

37:59.160 --> 38:02.080
I mean, you can use just SSH key gen.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.760
There's nothing special about what these tools are using.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.760
It's just sort of automating it in a way that really makes

38:08.760 --> 38:13.600
it easy for developers to get going.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.280
I think the idea is, well, my idea was,

38:16.280 --> 38:19.400
if you make it easier but also a little bit more secure,

38:19.400 --> 38:23.480
people will jump on it really, really quickly

38:23.480 --> 38:24.960
and really want to use it.

38:24.960 --> 38:27.440
But if it's just slightly more inconvenient,

38:27.440 --> 38:29.240
even though it's more secure, people

38:29.240 --> 38:30.720
will try and find a way around it.

38:30.720 --> 38:31.600
So true, right?

38:31.600 --> 38:33.640
If you can give them an easy and secure option that's

38:33.640 --> 38:35.160
right at their fingertips, there's

38:35.160 --> 38:36.880
no reason to choose the wrong path.

38:36.880 --> 38:37.400
Exactly.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.160
So I want a method that they don't even

38:39.160 --> 38:41.360
need to put your public key anywhere.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.320
You don't need to copy and paste anything.

38:43.320 --> 38:46.160
You're just up and running already.

38:46.160 --> 38:52.040
So part of that was the client actually runs an SSH agent.

38:52.040 --> 38:55.200
So normally, your SSH agent manages your private keys

38:55.200 --> 38:56.440
for you.

38:56.440 --> 38:58.160
So it's a program running on your laptop.

38:58.160 --> 39:02.640
Maybe it's even partially on a smart card or a YubiKey.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.800
Your SSH agent kind of manages that.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.440
Where is your private key?

39:06.440 --> 39:09.120
So I wrote an SSH agent.

39:09.120 --> 39:13.640
Well, actually, the Golang crypto SSH module's

39:13.640 --> 39:14.600
really great.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.800
They have an agent implementation there.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.400
So it's almost like just a plug into it.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.320
Exactly.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.560
So I used the SSH agent to provide

39:23.560 --> 39:28.640
this Lambda-based certificate signing feature.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.680
So when your SSH client says, hey,

39:31.680 --> 39:33.920
I need the list of public keys, I'm

39:33.920 --> 39:37.200
trying to connect to your server,

39:37.200 --> 39:40.680
it will ask the agent to say, what have you got for me?

39:40.680 --> 39:42.680
And at that point, the agent can say,

39:42.680 --> 39:43.960
oh, just hang on one second.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.440
I've just got to go and just check

39:45.440 --> 39:47.600
what's in my Lambda closet over here.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.160
Just give me a few minutes.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.600
And it goes off and signs your.

39:50.600 --> 39:53.760
So it actually generates a new private public key

39:53.760 --> 39:56.200
and then goes and signs the public key.

39:56.200 --> 39:59.280
And then it returns to the SSH client and says, oh, yes.

39:59.280 --> 40:00.080
Everything's normal.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.040
Don't worry about it.

40:01.040 --> 40:03.640
Here's the public key and private key.

40:03.640 --> 40:07.080
So for the SSH client itself, none of that matters.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.760
It just gets back the key that it needs

40:08.760 --> 40:10.280
and it ships it off to the server.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.120
Exactly.

40:11.120 --> 40:14.200
The advantage of that is other tools that use SSH

40:14.200 --> 40:23.360
work just great, like rsync or scopy or maybe even Ansible

40:23.360 --> 40:24.240
or something like that.

40:24.240 --> 40:27.000
Those kind of tools, they just will be none the wiser.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.480
Some other ways of doing this rely

40:29.480 --> 40:31.480
on wrapping the SSH command.

40:31.480 --> 40:33.200
So if you wrap it in another command,

40:33.200 --> 40:35.400
but that almost breaks that flow.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.200
So you can't really use those other downstream tools that

40:38.200 --> 40:40.560
are using SSH underneath.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.800
Well, Jeremy, thank you for joining us.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.520
What time is it where you're at right now?

40:44.520 --> 40:47.520
I've just hit 730 in the morning.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.800
Thank you for getting up early to chat with us.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.080
We really appreciate it.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.720
And we will link to the talk.

40:52.720 --> 40:53.880
Anything else you think we ought to link to?

40:53.880 --> 40:55.440
Obviously, we'll link to shrimp.

40:55.440 --> 40:56.640
Any other suggestions?

40:56.640 --> 40:58.920
So that's shrimp repository.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.160
I've got the Git repo for that.

41:01.160 --> 41:04.000
One thing I didn't mention, which I found in the last week,

41:04.000 --> 41:08.200
and it's not actually in that talk, is Keybase.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.120
Have you guys heard of Keybase?

41:10.120 --> 41:11.280
Oh, yeah.

41:11.280 --> 41:12.160
Yeah, absolutely.

41:12.160 --> 41:14.360
Keybase.io slash Chris Lass.

41:14.360 --> 41:14.860
OK.

41:14.860 --> 41:17.840
Well, you're going to have a new follower very soon.

41:17.840 --> 41:21.120
Well, Keybase is a blog post where

41:21.120 --> 41:24.560
they've implemented their own SSH certificate

41:24.560 --> 41:26.680
authority on top of Keybase.

41:26.680 --> 41:27.720
Oh, neat.

41:27.720 --> 41:32.600
And it's the most bizarre chat ops use case I've seen,

41:32.600 --> 41:34.920
where essentially, because there's

41:34.920 --> 41:38.520
no secrets being exchanged when you sign these certificates.

41:38.520 --> 41:42.480
You just give your public key.

41:42.480 --> 41:45.800
And then the server, your certificate authority's

41:45.800 --> 41:47.040
signing it.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.760
That bit's done in private.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.600
But then it gives you back your certificate,

41:50.600 --> 41:52.120
which is also a public thing.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.500
Right, there's no secret exchange between the machines.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.240
Exactly.

41:55.240 --> 41:58.520
And it can do it over the Keybase chat.

41:58.520 --> 42:01.000
And it uses the Keybase API to do it for you.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.200
So it runs on your computer.

42:02.200 --> 42:05.000
It uses your Keybase if you're signed in the Keybase.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.560
And then you have a chat bot on the other end,

42:07.560 --> 42:09.620
also listening on that same channel.

42:09.620 --> 42:12.120
And when it says, hey, I want to sign my public key, it goes,

42:12.120 --> 42:13.560
OK, what's your username?

42:13.560 --> 42:17.120
And because Keybase has such a strong sense of identity,

42:17.120 --> 42:19.180
it knows, oh, yes, it's the right Chris.

42:19.180 --> 42:20.880
I mean, I haven't reviewed their source code.

42:20.880 --> 42:23.400
But if it's true that they claim end-to-end encrypted

42:23.400 --> 42:25.840
and the way they've implemented it,

42:25.840 --> 42:28.560
it will be very, very difficult to impersonate your chat

42:28.560 --> 42:29.280
message.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.560
So it really is coming from your laptop

42:32.560 --> 42:35.380
that it should be your request for a public key.

42:35.380 --> 42:37.760
And then the chat bot just signs it, and then here you go.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.680
Here's your public key, which is kind of cool

42:39.680 --> 42:42.720
because the SSH certificate authority doesn't

42:42.720 --> 42:44.760
need to be publicly listening on the internet.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.680
It doesn't have to be a Lambda function that

42:46.680 --> 42:50.080
can be invoked somehow or a server running on EC2 that

42:50.080 --> 42:52.140
is listening on some port.

42:52.140 --> 42:53.840
You just need to be able to connect to Keybase.

42:53.840 --> 42:54.360
Exactly.

42:54.360 --> 42:55.780
It's kind of like an outbound connection.

42:55.780 --> 42:59.400
It could be a Raspberry Pi in your office, for example,

42:59.400 --> 43:02.360
or wherever you're, you know.

43:02.360 --> 43:03.320
I've tried it out.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.440
It's actually really neat.

43:04.440 --> 43:06.280
That does sound really neat.

43:06.280 --> 43:07.760
It's worth including.

43:07.760 --> 43:15.240
I gave this talk at Auckland OWASP Day, our security

43:15.240 --> 43:16.400
conference here in Auckland.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.600
And I included that part as well.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.840
It's just awesome.

43:20.840 --> 43:26.040
You know, I love all of the ways you can use SSH.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.440
It's just been proven such a flexible tool to build on,

43:28.440 --> 43:28.680
I guess.

43:28.680 --> 43:29.280
No kidding.

43:29.280 --> 43:30.560
Couldn't set it better myself.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.560
Jeremy, thank you so much for joining us

43:32.560 --> 43:33.880
and going through some of this.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.000
I really enjoyed it.

43:35.000 --> 43:35.480
My pleasure.

43:35.480 --> 43:35.760
Thanks.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.040
Thanks for having me.

43:37.040 --> 43:39.280
It was great that Jeremy was able to join us and talk

43:39.280 --> 43:39.880
about that.

43:39.880 --> 43:42.800
But it's really still worth watching his whole talk

43:42.800 --> 43:45.100
because we've only scratched the surface.

43:45.100 --> 43:47.520
One thing we didn't get into but is really neat

43:47.520 --> 43:49.520
about these certificate-based solutions

43:49.520 --> 43:51.920
is you can set the expiry time really low.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.560
So for Netflix, as an example, they just

43:54.560 --> 43:56.280
sign their certs for two minutes,

43:56.280 --> 43:58.480
just long enough to let you SSH to whatever box

43:58.480 --> 44:00.000
you're actually trying to get to.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.400
But then you can never use it again.

44:01.400 --> 44:01.920
Whoa.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.080
A two-minute SSH cert.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.240
That's it.

44:05.240 --> 44:06.880
So when they issue the certificate,

44:06.880 --> 44:09.200
they just can set a tiny expiration window?

44:09.200 --> 44:09.400
Yeah.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.440
And you can do other things like limit

44:10.440 --> 44:13.120
where that's coming from to a particular host or IP ranges,

44:13.120 --> 44:14.200
say.

44:14.200 --> 44:16.760
All of these just go so much in the other, more secure

44:16.760 --> 44:19.120
direction from adding a key to a server.

44:19.120 --> 44:21.440
And then never touching it again.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.080
But you'll want to check out other stuff.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.280
There's lots of neat ways to actually make this work.

44:25.280 --> 44:25.820
It's scale.

44:25.820 --> 44:28.120
We'll have links to all the tools, including Jeremy's

44:28.120 --> 44:30.240
excellent shrimp tool.

44:30.240 --> 44:31.800
Such a great name.

44:31.800 --> 44:34.040
It was nice for Jeremy to join us because he was in New

44:34.040 --> 44:34.720
Zealand, right?

44:34.720 --> 44:35.360
Yeah.

44:35.360 --> 44:37.640
You know, one other thing I loved about his talk

44:37.640 --> 44:41.120
is it was actually contained inside of an SSH certificate.

44:41.120 --> 44:43.840
He wrote up Python script to display the talk.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.960
And then you can actually, with the certificates,

44:45.960 --> 44:48.360
you can use the force command option

44:48.360 --> 44:52.120
to basically when you SSH to the server, it runs that command.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.960
And then the command ran his Python script,

44:53.960 --> 44:56.080
which then started up and displayed his presentation

44:56.080 --> 44:56.880
in the terminal.

44:56.880 --> 44:57.880
It's fantastic.

44:57.880 --> 45:02.360
I am both intrigued and a little perplexed

45:02.360 --> 45:05.440
by the idea of using Keybase chat.

45:05.440 --> 45:07.680
But I could see some advantages, especially

45:07.680 --> 45:10.800
in certain networking conditions.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.760
Keybase is something we should probably talk more about.

45:12.760 --> 45:15.200
Remember how SSH can do all these crazy things?

45:15.200 --> 45:18.080
I mean, I just kind of use it the most basic way possible.

45:18.080 --> 45:22.200
I feel fancy when I do x11 forwarding or copy a file.

45:22.200 --> 45:23.080
Oh, look at me.

45:23.080 --> 45:26.040
I'm fancy.

45:26.040 --> 45:27.520
That's pretty great.

45:27.520 --> 45:29.520
We will have links to all of that, as always.

45:29.520 --> 45:31.360
But before we go into the picks, I

45:31.360 --> 45:33.880
thought maybe we could do a little follow up

45:33.880 --> 45:36.600
on the old Arch upgrade we did last week, which did not

45:36.600 --> 45:38.320
go so well during the show.

45:38.320 --> 45:41.040
No, it did not.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.440
We got a new kernel, which wasn't yet

45:43.440 --> 45:46.200
supported by the ZFS on Linux project.

45:46.200 --> 45:47.640
So that didn't work.

45:47.640 --> 45:48.800
Pause there.

45:48.800 --> 45:54.280
Here's a great example of when you are kind of rolling

45:54.280 --> 45:57.080
the dice with Arch on a server, because there

45:57.080 --> 45:59.840
is no central control making sure

45:59.840 --> 46:01.600
that you don't release a kernel that

46:01.600 --> 46:05.160
is incompatible with the version of ZFS you're shipping.

46:05.160 --> 46:08.520
In a traditional distribution targeted specifically

46:08.520 --> 46:11.640
at the enterprise, those are the very kinds of things

46:11.640 --> 46:14.640
that they work out and prevent hitting you in an update.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.680
Now, we know that going in.

46:16.680 --> 46:18.600
We were just kind of playing fast and loose.

46:18.600 --> 46:22.000
And there is a side repo, like the Arch CFS repository,

46:22.000 --> 46:25.240
which has kernels and those things a little more in sync.

46:25.240 --> 46:26.120
We're not using that.

46:26.120 --> 46:28.280
This is just the stock kernel at the moment.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.400
At the moment?

46:29.400 --> 46:32.240
You did try the LTS kernel for a bit, but it had issues as well.

46:32.240 --> 46:33.960
Yeah, there was some bug going on.

46:33.960 --> 46:36.300
It looked like that was going to be resolved more quickly

46:36.300 --> 46:38.680
than the GPL symbol issues that seemed

46:38.680 --> 46:40.800
to be lurking for kernel 5.5.

46:40.800 --> 46:45.540
So the old snapshot and rollback system worked mostly smoothly,

46:45.540 --> 46:48.200
except for you had to go remove a particular folder or file

46:48.200 --> 46:49.080
somewhere, right?

46:49.080 --> 46:49.600
Yes.

46:49.600 --> 46:52.780
So when we didn't have support for ZFS, that didn't get mounted.

46:52.780 --> 46:55.560
We are integrating Docker on that host with ZFS.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.540
So it wants to go talk to ZFS.

46:57.540 --> 47:00.200
Doesn't find it, but does end up making a folder

47:00.200 --> 47:03.560
under VARlib Docker that when you restore ZFS support,

47:03.560 --> 47:05.400
means ZFS won't mount cleanly.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.320
Right, because now all of a sudden,

47:06.320 --> 47:07.200
something exists there.

47:07.200 --> 47:09.840
Just had to go clear that out, reboot, everything came back.

47:09.840 --> 47:12.440
So to be clear, we were using essentially

47:12.440 --> 47:15.560
butterfs snapshots to restore the system back.

47:15.560 --> 47:16.360
Yep.

47:16.360 --> 47:19.000
And then we have ZFS snapshots for the data.

47:19.000 --> 47:19.600
Exactly.

47:19.600 --> 47:23.120
But our particular issue was that the ZFS array would not

47:23.120 --> 47:25.120
mount after the kernel upgrade.

47:25.120 --> 47:27.160
And then even after we rolled back,

47:27.160 --> 47:31.200
it still failed to mount because it had created that directory.

47:31.200 --> 47:31.880
But nice fixing.

47:31.880 --> 47:33.680
I mean, you had it all fixed within a few minutes.

47:33.680 --> 47:34.960
Yeah, it wasn't a big deal.

47:34.960 --> 47:38.040
And you know, there's a lot of options that we could do.

47:38.040 --> 47:40.480
I'm sure that the latest kernel will get support before too

47:40.480 --> 47:42.800
long, so you can also do upgrades where you just leave

47:42.800 --> 47:44.200
the kernel out of upgrading, right?

47:44.200 --> 47:45.280
I mean, that's a fine kernel.

47:45.280 --> 47:46.680
Or install it with the LTS kernel.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.000
Or get an LTS kernel.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.840
That is probably the better idea.

47:49.840 --> 47:52.040
Yeah, this is legitimately why we're doing this,

47:52.040 --> 47:53.040
is so you don't have to.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.580
If you ever wondered what it's like,

47:54.580 --> 47:58.200
our philosophy here is arch with belts and suspenders

47:58.200 --> 48:01.320
and everything backed up, containerized or VM'd.

48:01.320 --> 48:03.480
Nothing actually running, for the most part,

48:03.480 --> 48:05.600
on the arch host box.

48:05.600 --> 48:06.680
That's the theory.

48:06.680 --> 48:10.720
And I think we kind of proved it out with these rollbacks.

48:10.720 --> 48:15.360
This issue here, with that directory getting created,

48:15.360 --> 48:17.640
only happened because we tried to bring the system all

48:17.640 --> 48:21.840
the way back up without the right CFS module.

48:21.840 --> 48:24.600
If we had not done that, that issue would not have happened.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.900
The rollbacks work, for the most part,

48:26.900 --> 48:28.200
with that one exception.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.240
And if I just remembered to delete that file

48:30.240 --> 48:31.600
before rebooting, it would have been.

48:31.600 --> 48:33.640
So potentially, if this ever were to happen again,

48:33.640 --> 48:35.160
that rollback process you went through

48:35.160 --> 48:36.840
would be 100% effective.

48:36.840 --> 48:38.480
So how long, in total, would you say,

48:38.480 --> 48:39.900
now that you've done it, if you ever had to do it again,

48:39.900 --> 48:40.680
would it take you?

48:40.680 --> 48:41.520
Five minutes.

48:41.520 --> 48:42.240
That's not bad.

48:42.240 --> 48:44.640
And a reboot in there as well, right?

48:44.640 --> 48:45.680
And a reboot, yeah.

48:45.680 --> 48:49.600
That varies depending on your slow server, like ours.

48:49.600 --> 48:51.760
We could have also just downgraded the kernel

48:51.760 --> 48:53.760
from the package cache as well.

48:53.760 --> 48:57.040
But it was more fun to use Snapper.

48:57.040 --> 49:00.320
Cubicle Nate wants me to just switch it over to SUSE.

49:00.320 --> 49:01.840
Yeah, one day we might try that.

49:01.840 --> 49:02.480
You never know.

49:02.480 --> 49:04.920
Yeah, that might be next in the old server reboot queue.

49:04.920 --> 49:07.280
See, what I'm concerned about is we'll be all like, hey,

49:07.280 --> 49:09.960
let's try out 2004 Ubuntu LTS.

49:09.960 --> 49:11.320
We'll put it on there.

49:11.320 --> 49:13.480
And then we'll have no reason to remove it.

49:13.480 --> 49:15.160
So we'll never try anything else again.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.440
Well, I was just thinking that with Arch.

49:16.440 --> 49:18.280
And OK, yeah, so we did have to futz around a little bit.

49:18.280 --> 49:20.160
That did take a little time to go investigate.

49:20.160 --> 49:24.120
And here I am on the ZFS on Linux GitHub looking at issues.

49:24.120 --> 49:26.760
But it also means I don't have to reinstall.

49:26.760 --> 49:29.080
There's no next Fedora that's coming out, or even

49:29.080 --> 49:30.080
a next LTS release.

49:30.080 --> 49:32.440
Like, that's just work I'm never going to do.

49:32.440 --> 49:33.320
Right, right.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.520
Probably not because, you know.

49:34.520 --> 49:37.960
Maybe you diffuse that work throughout the lifetime

49:37.960 --> 49:40.960
of the box instead of sort of bundling it all up at once.

49:40.960 --> 49:41.760
That's the theory.

49:41.760 --> 49:45.040
Although, you still have updates on all systems.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.040
They're not all just as crazy and wild.

49:47.040 --> 49:47.600
That's right.

49:47.600 --> 49:50.320
We've got not one, but two app picks this week.

49:50.320 --> 49:53.800
And one is a collaborative ASCII canvas.

49:53.800 --> 49:55.040
What?

49:55.040 --> 49:56.700
Yeah, I mean, haven't you ever just wanted

49:56.700 --> 49:59.640
to hang out with your buddies and do some collaborative ASCII?

49:59.640 --> 50:01.040
Because that's what it's all about.

50:01.040 --> 50:01.760
Yes, most days.

50:01.760 --> 50:02.880
Yeah, I mean, that's what?

50:02.880 --> 50:04.000
Like, every Thursday?

50:04.000 --> 50:05.800
Yeah, I mean, it's not collaborative antsy.

50:05.800 --> 50:08.560
But you know, ASCII will work for a time being.

50:08.560 --> 50:11.640
Or say you're SSH-ing around with your two-minute Netflix

50:11.640 --> 50:14.180
keys, and you want to get with your buds at Netflix for two

50:14.180 --> 50:18.000
minutes and jump onto the server and collaborate on some ASCII.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.760
SSH-ing around is one do.

50:19.760 --> 50:21.040
Yeah, SSH-ing around.

50:21.040 --> 50:21.840
That's what we do.

50:21.840 --> 50:23.560
I think we could do show notes in here.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.080
We'll just have to change our format a little bit.

50:25.080 --> 50:26.200
Go to two columns.

50:26.200 --> 50:31.560
So Kolaski, I guess that's how you pronounce it,

50:31.560 --> 50:33.000
is a pretty neat little app that'll

50:33.000 --> 50:37.960
allow you to collaboratively draw on an ASCII canvas

50:37.960 --> 50:38.880
together.

50:38.880 --> 50:40.360
Because why not?

50:40.360 --> 50:41.080
It's great.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.080
It's great fun.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.600
That's pretty good.

50:43.600 --> 50:47.040
But I'm trying to live the end curses lifestyle, Cheez.

50:47.040 --> 50:49.440
So what do you got for me if I just want

50:49.440 --> 50:51.520
to go end curses all the time?

50:51.520 --> 50:54.760
So yeah, I mean, if you want to end curse your way

50:54.760 --> 50:57.480
into a display manager, you can check out

50:57.480 --> 51:04.120
Lye, which is a terminal display manager, which essentially

51:04.120 --> 51:07.240
will allow you to log into all of your favorite desktop

51:07.240 --> 51:11.320
environments, Budgie, Cinnamon, Deepin, Enlightenment, Gnome.

51:11.320 --> 51:11.920
Wow.

51:11.920 --> 51:15.320
OK, I never knew I needed this, but I'm kind of in love.

51:15.320 --> 51:16.200
Finally.

51:16.200 --> 51:18.240
I mean, how long have we all been waiting?

51:18.240 --> 51:20.520
Well, doesn't it feel silly to have this whole display manager

51:20.520 --> 51:21.080
thing anyway?

51:21.080 --> 51:22.200
It just gets in the way.

51:22.200 --> 51:22.920
No kidding.

51:22.920 --> 51:26.560
And good news works on Dev1 too, so no system D required.

51:26.560 --> 51:29.240
And there's also a feature so that you

51:29.240 --> 51:33.400
can enable the PlayStation Doom fire effect.

51:33.400 --> 51:33.960
Oh, good.

51:33.960 --> 51:35.640
If you don't know what that is, I'll

51:35.640 --> 51:37.040
drop a link there into the channel.

51:37.040 --> 51:42.520
But it's just a beautiful ASCII fire effect.

51:42.520 --> 51:44.400
See how these things kind of tie together?

51:44.400 --> 51:47.880
You see, and people say Linux is just for geeks.

51:47.880 --> 51:49.480
Look at this, right?

51:49.480 --> 51:50.280
Come on.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.120
Super nerd fun.

51:51.120 --> 51:51.920
Big point made.

51:51.920 --> 51:52.960
Yeah, those are great.

51:52.960 --> 51:53.740
Thank you, Cheezzy.

51:53.740 --> 51:55.720
Those are really great.

51:55.720 --> 51:57.760
Even if you're not going to install these,

51:57.760 --> 51:59.880
I encourage you to check out the links because they

51:59.880 --> 52:01.280
have screenshots and videos.

52:01.280 --> 52:03.480
And they're just fun.

52:03.480 --> 52:04.240
Super fun.

52:04.240 --> 52:08.600
Speaking of fun, I hear they're about to have some fun over

52:08.600 --> 52:09.880
there at the Ubuntu podcast.

52:09.880 --> 52:13.160
Things are in the works again, Wimpy, for a brand new season.

52:13.160 --> 52:14.240
They most certainly are.

52:14.240 --> 52:16.200
Yes, season 13 confirmed.

52:16.200 --> 52:19.960
And we're in pre-season preparation stages

52:19.960 --> 52:21.280
at the moment.

52:21.280 --> 52:23.200
Should start recording in March.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.720
Was there any discussion to go right to 14,

52:25.720 --> 52:27.920
just for avoiding bad luck?

52:27.920 --> 52:30.200
No, we've decided to fully embrace the 13.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.880
Oh, I like it.

52:31.880 --> 52:34.800
Good for you, UbuntuPodcast.org.

52:34.800 --> 52:38.080
I'm going to give a mention for my website, ChrisLass.com.

52:38.080 --> 52:40.360
Not only do I have my Chris Lass cast there,

52:40.360 --> 52:43.080
but that's where I'll be keeping links to what I'm up to

52:43.080 --> 52:46.120
and some of my social profiles, like my Keybase,

52:46.120 --> 52:48.920
I think is on there, as well as future things.

52:48.920 --> 52:52.160
So check out ChrisLass.com for that.

52:52.160 --> 52:54.520
I think you have some awesome pictures of your RV up there,

52:54.520 --> 52:55.120
too, don't you?

52:55.120 --> 52:57.000
The new solar setup?

52:57.000 --> 53:01.240
That's on worklifeandrv.com, Cheesy.

53:01.240 --> 53:03.000
Which you can get to from Chris Lass.

53:03.000 --> 53:03.480
That's true.

53:03.480 --> 53:05.080
It is linked on chrislass.com.

53:05.080 --> 53:07.360
Hey-o, ba-dump-bump, shh.

53:07.360 --> 53:09.120
You know, we should mention, we haven't

53:09.120 --> 53:09.680
plugged for a little while.

53:09.680 --> 53:11.520
Speaking of pictures, there's the gallery.

53:11.520 --> 53:12.440
Oh, yeah.

53:12.440 --> 53:13.880
Jupiter.gallery.

53:13.880 --> 53:15.600
Go check out some of Cheesy's work there.

53:15.600 --> 53:18.920
That's going to be updated here at LinuxFest Northwest.

53:18.920 --> 53:21.160
And so if you are there and you do take pictures

53:21.160 --> 53:24.040
and you want to share them, just email me,

53:24.040 --> 53:26.600
and we'll get those up on the gallery.

53:26.600 --> 53:27.240
LinuxFest.

53:27.240 --> 53:28.920
Now, that's what I'm putting everything into now,

53:28.920 --> 53:30.520
putting everything into LinuxFest now.

53:30.520 --> 53:31.520
That's all I got.

53:31.520 --> 53:33.040
That's all I got.

53:33.040 --> 53:35.520
Go get more Wes Payne over at TechSnap.Systems.

53:35.520 --> 53:36.360
And he's on the Twitter.

53:36.360 --> 53:37.360
Where are you over there?

53:37.360 --> 53:38.160
At Wes Payne.

53:38.160 --> 53:38.680
How?

53:38.680 --> 53:38.960
Guess what?

53:38.960 --> 53:39.960
I'm at Chris Lass.

53:39.960 --> 53:40.480
Aw.

53:40.480 --> 53:41.480
Did you know?

53:41.480 --> 53:42.120
You did know.

53:42.120 --> 53:42.840
You can admit it.

53:42.840 --> 53:43.560
Yeah, I knew.

53:43.560 --> 53:45.200
At this point, if you didn't know,

53:45.200 --> 53:47.320
there'd be something seriously wrong, dude.

53:47.320 --> 53:49.320
I think even the network has one.

53:49.320 --> 53:50.040
I think it might.

53:50.040 --> 53:51.080
At Jupiter Signal.

53:51.080 --> 53:52.000
What?

53:52.000 --> 53:54.400
But does the podcast have one?

53:54.400 --> 53:55.720
At Linux Unplugged.

53:55.720 --> 53:57.120
Oh my gosh.

53:57.120 --> 53:58.040
We're all over Twitter.

53:58.040 --> 53:59.640
They're like tribbles.

53:59.640 --> 54:00.600
They're like tribbles.

54:00.600 --> 54:01.640
Of course, we're live.

54:01.640 --> 54:02.760
We'd love to have you here.

54:02.760 --> 54:03.880
It makes all the difference.

54:03.880 --> 54:04.560
Please join.

54:04.560 --> 54:08.280
jblive.tv on a Tuesday starts at noon Pacific.

54:08.280 --> 54:10.480
We usually actually get rolling a little earlier, 1130.

54:10.480 --> 54:12.240
Yeah, come in early for the excellent pre-show.

54:12.240 --> 54:12.520
Yeah.

54:12.520 --> 54:13.900
And of course, there's post-show.

54:13.900 --> 54:16.400
You hear a little tiny bit of it in the release version,

54:16.400 --> 54:19.640
but there's a lot more every Tuesday, jblive.tv.

54:19.640 --> 54:20.560
We'll see you then.

54:20.560 --> 54:50.240
We'll see you then.

54:50.560 --> 54:57.960
Tuesday Unplugged Program Oh!

54:57.960 --> 55:02.520
I think J-Bot had a little too much to drink at lunch, I think.

55:02.520 --> 55:04.700
You know, we shouldn't have given him access to the tab.

55:04.700 --> 55:07.840
I don't understand why J-Bot gets lunch on Tuesdays and we don't.

55:07.840 --> 55:09.480
How did that work out?

55:09.480 --> 55:10.580
How did he get that arrangement?

55:10.580 --> 55:11.960
We don't get lunch and J-Bot does?

55:11.960 --> 55:12.960
Come on.

55:12.960 --> 55:13.960
I don't like any of this.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.080
This is not a fair arrangement.

55:15.080 --> 55:18.320
So we will have to rerun the title votes here in a moment after Wes...

55:18.320 --> 55:19.320
Sometimes it saves it.

55:19.320 --> 55:20.320
Sometimes.

55:20.320 --> 55:25.880
I guess we'll go and try to rescue our other Arch server in production, which has been

55:25.880 --> 55:27.560
in production for a bajillion years, actually.

55:27.560 --> 55:32.200
Yeah, I'd like to point out this one was not my idea.

55:32.200 --> 55:33.960
It has been running forever, though.

55:33.960 --> 55:35.320
So when we get that going...

55:35.320 --> 55:36.320
Forever ever?

55:36.320 --> 55:38.080
Forever ever.

55:38.080 --> 55:39.640
In a very special way.

55:39.640 --> 55:44.680
So not one that we would recommend.

55:44.680 --> 55:46.240
So Brian, I thought you weren't going to be here.

55:46.240 --> 55:48.280
Did you just get all your work done super quick?

55:48.280 --> 55:49.960
Were you a super efficient photographer?

55:49.960 --> 55:53.600
Yeah, you know, the great thing about being a professional is you can get things done

55:53.600 --> 55:54.600
faster.

55:54.600 --> 55:55.600
So everybody's happy.

55:55.600 --> 55:56.600
Client's happy.

55:56.600 --> 55:57.600
Photographer's happy.

55:57.600 --> 55:59.120
I got lunch right in before heading here.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.120
It's all great.

56:00.120 --> 56:02.480
Brian, I don't believe for a moment you did something quickly.

56:02.480 --> 56:03.480
Nuh-uh.

56:03.480 --> 56:04.480
No way.

56:04.480 --> 56:05.480
No.

56:05.480 --> 56:08.280
Actually, though, when you see him bust out that camera, man, he'll just boom.

56:08.280 --> 56:09.760
The next thing you know, he's taking pictures.

56:09.760 --> 56:11.640
Like it just goes from zero to taking pictures.

56:11.640 --> 56:14.720
The camera, yes, but editing or anything.

56:14.720 --> 56:15.720
Oh, well, yeah.

56:15.720 --> 56:16.720
No.

56:16.720 --> 56:17.720
I just don't believe it.

56:17.720 --> 56:18.720
He's not done with the editing.

56:18.720 --> 56:19.720
He's not done with the camera.

56:19.720 --> 56:22.000
He just took the pictures today.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.600
How's the life on the farm been, Brent?

56:23.600 --> 56:24.600
Aren't you farm sitting?

56:24.600 --> 56:25.600
Oh, man, yeah.

56:25.600 --> 56:29.260
I got to farm sit the last few days for good, good friends of mine who have a farm about

56:29.260 --> 56:32.240
maybe like 45 minutes from here, and I've worked on their farm a few times.

56:32.240 --> 56:33.240
What?

56:33.240 --> 56:34.240
What?

56:34.240 --> 56:35.240
Well, hold on.

56:35.240 --> 56:36.240
We got a Chris Lastcast about this.

56:36.240 --> 56:38.120
This sounds castable, my friend.

56:38.120 --> 56:39.360
Did you take care of the animals?

56:39.360 --> 56:40.360
Yeah.

56:40.360 --> 56:42.400
So it's still the deep of winter here.

56:42.400 --> 56:48.160
So they only have like laying hens and their two dogs.

56:48.160 --> 56:49.160
How big's the farm?

56:49.160 --> 56:51.760
Oh, so they do mostly vegetables.

56:51.760 --> 56:57.800
So I think they're farming like two acres of like basically a huge collection of vegetables.

56:57.800 --> 56:58.800
Oh, I'd love to.

56:58.800 --> 56:59.800
Okay.

56:59.800 --> 57:00.800
All right.

57:00.800 --> 57:01.800
Don't tell me too much.

57:01.800 --> 57:02.800
Don't tell me too much.

57:02.800 --> 57:03.800
Keep it for the Chris Lastcast.

57:03.800 --> 57:04.800
I think this is castable.

57:04.800 --> 57:08.920
You know, I have a family farm on my mom's side up in Canada.

57:08.920 --> 57:09.920
What?

57:09.920 --> 57:12.920
How do I not know this?

57:12.920 --> 57:14.400
We got something to cast about, my friend.

57:14.400 --> 57:15.400
I mean, secret farms.

57:15.400 --> 57:19.360
I get like a mental image that Brent's just like out in the field picking carrots and

57:19.360 --> 57:22.460
stuff like just having a snack.

57:22.460 --> 57:23.960
That's what I did last time I was there.

57:23.960 --> 57:28.240
There's a version of me that just nopes out of the internet and I'm just like, I'm out

57:28.240 --> 57:31.720
and I just go to the farm and I spend the rest of my life on the farm.

57:31.720 --> 57:33.080
And I think it sounds wonderful.

57:33.080 --> 57:36.440
You know, Chris, I was actually, while I was there, I was trying to disconnect a little

57:36.440 --> 57:43.120
bit to use it as a means of just having a bit of a quieter, you know, 24 hours.

57:43.120 --> 57:46.600
And I was thinking back to the Linux unplugged episodes where we were talking about some

57:46.600 --> 57:50.760
strategies to kind of deal with burnout and stuff like that.

57:50.760 --> 57:57.240
I was thinking, hmm, something I try to do often is have these little like 24 48 hour

57:57.240 --> 57:59.640
little retreats and you don't have to go very far.

57:59.640 --> 58:00.640
You just have to go.

58:00.640 --> 58:01.640
All right, hold on.

58:01.640 --> 58:02.640
I got, I got a response.

58:02.640 --> 58:03.640
We can't talk about this.

58:03.640 --> 58:04.640
We can't, we gotta save it.

58:04.640 --> 58:05.640
Write that down.

58:05.640 --> 58:06.640
You're getting too deep, boys.

58:06.640 --> 58:07.640
I got it.

58:07.640 --> 58:08.640
I have the notebook.

58:08.640 --> 58:09.640
You write it.

58:09.640 --> 58:10.640
I didn't bring it in here with me today.

58:10.640 --> 58:11.640
That's something we should.

58:11.640 --> 58:12.640
I know.

58:12.640 --> 58:16.000
I do have a whole podcast about keeping notes in the book.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
I got a backup notebook.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.320
It's just not my notebook, so I'm not as inclined to want to write in it.

58:20.320 --> 58:21.320
You know what I mean?

58:21.320 --> 58:22.320
Like I've got an attachment to my notebook.

58:22.320 --> 58:26.040
I'll also point out the six computers that are around.

58:26.040 --> 58:29.080
I'm no longer writing on computers anymore, Wes.

58:29.080 --> 58:32.080
So actually I have specific note insights I'd like to share too.

58:32.080 --> 58:34.520
Are you also hanging your clothes up on the clothesline?

58:34.520 --> 58:35.960
Just sort of becoming Brent?

58:35.960 --> 58:36.960
I wish.

58:36.960 --> 58:37.960
I wish.

58:37.960 --> 58:41.440
I tell you what, I'd consider it if I could make this mate jacket last another few years,

58:41.440 --> 58:42.440
I think I'd do it.

58:42.440 --> 58:43.440
I'm still wimpy.

58:43.440 --> 58:47.240
Oh my God, what are the chances the day you show up I'm wearing the mate jacket?

58:47.240 --> 58:48.240
I think you might have summoned it.

58:48.240 --> 58:49.240
I think I did.

58:49.240 --> 58:50.240
Well, there you go.

58:50.240 --> 58:52.120
Yeah, I think that's how it works.

58:52.120 --> 58:53.120
That is so funny.

58:53.120 --> 58:54.120
Yeah.

58:54.120 --> 58:56.880
I just started wearing it and oh wow, that's a weird way.

58:56.880 --> 58:59.160
You're going to have to start wearing it every Tuesday.

58:59.160 --> 59:04.120
I got mine the same time I sent yours over and it's still in regular use.

59:04.120 --> 59:05.120
Yep.

59:05.120 --> 59:07.640
It's just the perfect temperature this time of year right now for it.

59:07.640 --> 59:08.640
It's not too much.

59:08.640 --> 59:09.640
It's not too little.

59:09.640 --> 59:15.000
And it accommodates my ever expanding sizes because they cut my... I seem to just fluctuate

59:15.000 --> 59:17.760
in size all the time now and it sticks with me.

59:17.760 --> 59:40.760
I appreciate that too.
