WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.640
A happy Easter, gentlemen.

00:01.640 --> 00:03.160
Did you get yourselves anything for Easter?

00:03.160 --> 00:06.280
Yeah, I found a few eggs just outside the studio door.

00:06.280 --> 00:08.560
I assume you put those there for me, right?

00:08.560 --> 00:10.200
Well, they were for raccoons,

00:10.200 --> 00:12.300
but I'm just hoping that Alex set out

00:12.300 --> 00:15.080
a little treasure hunt for Brent.

00:15.080 --> 00:18.680
How often is Brent down in the States for Easter?

00:18.680 --> 00:21.160
I hope like maybe an egg hunt happened.

00:21.160 --> 00:21.980
What happened this morning?

00:21.980 --> 00:23.440
Tell us, guys, how'd you celebrate?

00:23.440 --> 00:24.620
Missed opportunity.

00:24.620 --> 00:26.360
Yeah, we didn't do anything.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.560
We didn't even think about it.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.480
But what did happen two days ago

00:29.480 --> 00:34.240
was a massive, I mean, massive box of chocolates

00:34.240 --> 00:36.440
showed up at Alex's place here,

00:36.440 --> 00:40.120
and he's been trying not to get into it ever since.

00:40.120 --> 00:40.960
Oh, man.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.200
Yeah, care package from England, proper chocolate.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.240
Did anybody warn them that you just spent a week

00:45.240 --> 00:46.640
eating the croissants from the meetup?

00:46.640 --> 00:48.160
Like, this is not what you need right now.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.880
I literally did, yeah.

00:49.880 --> 00:54.560
Yeah, I bet Brent's been cooking good, though,

00:54.560 --> 00:56.200
so you're probably making it up on the other end

00:56.200 --> 01:01.080
because he's a pretty lean cook in terms of caloric intake.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.880
Yeah, I lost 20 pounds in the month before the meetup,

01:03.880 --> 01:08.520
and I've gained about half of that back since the meetup.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.160
That's how you know it's a good meetup.

01:10.160 --> 01:21.160
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk

01:21.160 --> 01:21.640
show.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.360
My name is Chris.

01:22.360 --> 01:23.320
My name is Wes.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.240
My name is Brent.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.320
And my name is Alex.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.480
Hello, gentlemen.

01:26.480 --> 01:30.480
Glad to have you all here today because it is indeed a big show.

01:30.480 --> 01:35.760
Ubuntu 2204 LTS and Fedora 36 are both landing soon,

01:35.760 --> 01:39.400
perhaps the day you're listening to this or near.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.440
They both feature GNOME 42 and lots of great new ideas

01:43.440 --> 01:45.520
baked in, so we're going to take a look at both of them

01:45.520 --> 01:47.200
and share our thoughts, and then we're

01:47.200 --> 01:49.280
going to round out the show with some great boosts, our picks,

01:49.280 --> 01:51.120
and all the stuff that we love to do.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.640
But before we go any further, let's check the board.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.680
Let's bring in the Mumble Room.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.480
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

01:56.480 --> 01:56.960
Good evening.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.560
Hey, Brent, hey, Wes, hey, Chris.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.240
Nice to have you.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.360
Hello, hello.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.160
Hello, guys.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.200
Hello, hello.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.680
You know, I want to say right here towards the top of the show

02:05.680 --> 02:08.000
that you are always welcome to join our Mumble Room,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.680
even if you don't want to participate necessarily.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.880
I know that sounds weird, but I mention it

02:12.880 --> 02:15.160
because Mumble's free software, so it has

02:15.160 --> 02:16.760
kind of a nice advantage there.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.360
And I want to encourage that adoption

02:18.360 --> 02:20.920
because I think it's nice to have decentralized free software

02:20.920 --> 02:22.440
voice communication tools.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.920
It uses high quality Opus audio.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.040
Also free software.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.080
And you're getting a mix directly from our mixer

02:29.080 --> 02:31.680
here in the studio, and Mumble has super low latency.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.040
So it's just a great way to get a high quality audio feed

02:34.040 --> 02:37.360
using free software, and you can load it on your phone.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.800
We usually get the stream started

02:38.800 --> 02:41.960
around noon Pacific time, which is, what,

02:41.960 --> 02:43.600
3 PM on the New York side?

02:43.600 --> 02:44.160
Indeed.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.000
And around the world, you can do the math there,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.600
but we'd love to have you join us live over at jblive.tv

02:48.600 --> 02:49.600
if you want to watch it.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.640
Or you can use Mumble.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.120
Like, we've got a handful of folks in the quiet listening

02:53.120 --> 02:56.080
right now just getting the lowest latency audio stream.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.520
In fact, it is possible they are getting the lower latency

02:59.520 --> 03:03.520
audio feed of my voice right now than Alex and Brent are.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.440
I mean, Mumble's really impressive,

03:05.440 --> 03:07.160
and it's great because we can just run it

03:07.160 --> 03:08.560
on our own infrastructure.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.640
Or Noah's.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.680
It actually might be on Noah's server still.

03:11.680 --> 03:14.560
Either way, we'd love to have you there or join us live

03:14.560 --> 03:15.720
on a Sunday.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.440
So let's get into the show.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.960
Let's talk about Fedora 36 first,

03:20.960 --> 03:23.400
because I think a lot of what we're going to touch on

03:23.400 --> 03:27.240
is probably in its more upstream form in Fedora.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.740
So I think it kind of makes sense

03:28.740 --> 03:30.600
from a conversational standpoint.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.680
We've all kind of been taking a look at it for a little while.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.120
So there's a lot to unpack in both of these releases.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.660
So we're going to try to break it up

03:37.660 --> 03:39.360
to what's relevant to each one.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.080
And Fedora 36, while outwardly I'd

03:42.080 --> 03:46.120
say the headline feature for desktop users is GNOME 42,

03:46.120 --> 03:48.540
it seems like when you look at some of the other things,

03:48.540 --> 03:51.160
like Wayland support with NVIDIA.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.000
About time.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.440
Podman 4.0 under the hood, it kind of

03:55.440 --> 03:59.880
feels like 36 is going to have some really kind of changes

03:59.880 --> 04:02.740
that will improve the Fedora workstation and server

04:02.740 --> 04:04.440
experience for a long time.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.920
Fedora is making a shift here with Podman

04:06.920 --> 04:08.600
and with NVIDIA and Wayland support.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.360
I think this is laying the groundwork for something,

04:11.360 --> 04:13.480
but we'll get into that in a little bit.

04:13.480 --> 04:17.460
Because I'm curious, Wes, I asked you not to tell me.

04:17.460 --> 04:21.440
You've been running them both, Ubuntu 22.04 and Fedora 36.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.640
And I'm curious which one you've chosen

04:23.640 --> 04:25.320
to run here on the show today.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.880
I know I said pick the one you like the most

04:27.880 --> 04:30.000
and wait till the show starts.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.360
So which one did you choose?

04:31.360 --> 04:35.040
Well, let's just say that SE Linux would like you to know

04:35.040 --> 04:37.840
that GNOME Shell is trying to access its icon cache.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.840
I am taking that to mean Fedora 36.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.160
Yes, that's right.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.640
So you like the 36 desktop?

04:43.640 --> 04:44.600
I do.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.920
It's very snappy.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.800
And especially, I've been mostly using it here

04:48.800 --> 04:49.640
on this ThinkPad.

04:49.640 --> 04:54.780
So for the laptop use case, I like the stock GNOME

04:54.780 --> 04:58.360
experience, especially with that new dark mode support.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.080
It doesn't take much to get this into a state

05:00.080 --> 05:01.720
that I'm happy with using it.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.560
It all works.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.040
And then I've been really impressed with just

05:05.040 --> 05:07.640
with how good the pipeline setup on Fedora is getting.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.280
Ubuntu has made some advances there, too,

05:09.280 --> 05:10.400
which is also good to see.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.600
I was able to download Reaper, start it up.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.480
It figured out that it could talk Jack back to pipeline

05:15.480 --> 05:16.880
without me having to do anything.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.840
And then the whole system worked great with the new headphones

05:18.840 --> 05:21.200
I bought without having to futz with it as well.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.880
So it's kind of I'm living the pro audio when I want it,

05:23.880 --> 05:25.800
and it just works on the other hand,

05:25.800 --> 05:27.240
which that's hard to turn down.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.920
Wow, yeah, you're getting both.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.600
And have you done like audio playback with the headphones

05:31.600 --> 05:33.800
and they've stayed connected when you stop the music

05:33.800 --> 05:35.320
and then restart the music and stuff like that?

05:35.320 --> 05:36.400
No problem there.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.200
It's nice to see it getting to that point.

05:38.200 --> 05:38.800
That is nice.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.920
It's nice to know you can go out and get yourself

05:40.920 --> 05:42.440
a pair of modern Bluetooth headphones

05:42.440 --> 05:45.400
and you got a good shot of them working with your Linux desktop.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.680
I'll save my thoughts, but I'm curious if Alex or Brent,

05:48.680 --> 05:51.040
if either of you got any much time with the desktop side

05:51.040 --> 05:52.120
of Fedora 36?

05:52.120 --> 05:54.640
Well, we actually decided to kind of do it jointly

05:54.640 --> 05:57.600
because as it turns out, Alex had a laptop here buried

05:57.600 --> 06:00.600
in his little closet over there.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.440
That's fairly modern, a T480, I think it was, Alex.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.920
Yeah, Red Hat provided me a ThinkPad for work.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.400
And I've been running Fedora 30, I think 3 was the first one

06:09.400 --> 06:10.040
I put on there.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.880
I've upgraded it now from 33 to 34.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.600
It was on 35 when we started last night.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.680
So we thought we'd upgrade to some beta software

06:17.680 --> 06:19.920
and what's the worst that could happen?

06:19.920 --> 06:24.400
And actually, the upgrade to 36 was completely uneventful.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.000
I think boring in this case is probably a good thing.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.580
What was interesting was we were actually

06:28.580 --> 06:30.500
connected to my Thunderbolt dock as we did it,

06:30.500 --> 06:33.240
which was a CalDigit one, which is typically

06:33.240 --> 06:36.200
only a Mac compatible dock.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.640
But my Thunderbolt monitor was picked up straight away,

06:38.640 --> 06:39.600
no problems whatsoever.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.040
Ethernet just worked.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.600
All the USB devices worked perfectly.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.240
And throughout the entire upgrade,

06:45.240 --> 06:48.080
both displays, and I'm talking about the internal laptop

06:48.080 --> 06:50.560
display and the Thunderbolt display,

06:50.560 --> 06:52.360
were completely flicker free.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.440
Remember that being added a while ago?

06:54.440 --> 06:56.040
All the way through the upgrade process,

06:56.040 --> 06:57.880
everything was just completely smooth

06:57.880 --> 06:59.920
as far as the visual aspect was concerned.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.920
There was a nice progress bar.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.640
And I've got nothing really bad to say about the process.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.000
It just worked.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I mean, it upgraded what, 1,700 packages or so?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.240
1,756, I think, if I remember.

07:11.240 --> 07:12.960
Yeah, a couple of gigs worth of updates.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.480
And yeah, just worked.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.620
You know, you did, Alex, mention the monitors.

07:17.620 --> 07:20.020
We ran into a strange situation.

07:20.020 --> 07:21.600
I'm not sure if it's the monitor itself

07:21.600 --> 07:23.420
or if it's this hub you're using.

07:23.420 --> 07:25.760
But one of your monitors, which I'm

07:25.760 --> 07:29.280
sure you'll fill in the details, ended up with a refresh rate

07:29.280 --> 07:30.400
that was really odd.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.000
Oh, yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.960
Yeah, so I've got a 4K USB-C monitor,

07:33.960 --> 07:36.920
which I directly connected to the ThinkPad

07:36.920 --> 07:39.160
using the single USB-C cable provided

07:39.160 --> 07:43.840
with the monitor, which is a Dell 2723QE, I think.

07:43.840 --> 07:47.680
And for some reason, when we had 100% scaling turned on,

07:47.680 --> 07:49.680
we got 60 hertz, no problem.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.600
If we went to 200% scaling, which

07:51.600 --> 07:54.520
is about where I like my 4K monitor,

07:54.520 --> 07:56.200
it dropped to only 30 hertz.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.280
And that's painful.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.160
Actually, 29.98, I believe it was.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.760
Yeah, I've seen that.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.240
It's nice that it can do it.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.560
It is even better now than ever.

08:05.560 --> 08:08.400
And I really feel like there's pretty much zero

08:08.400 --> 08:11.760
Wayland penalty that I've run into so far, especially

08:11.760 --> 08:13.560
with the 36 release.

08:13.560 --> 08:21.400
And 42 is the best release of GNOME from the project ever,

08:21.400 --> 08:25.120
including even the very later versions of GNOME 2.

08:25.120 --> 08:29.120
In my opinion, obviously, this is the most refined,

08:29.120 --> 08:35.080
most expressed version of what the GNOME vision is

08:35.080 --> 08:36.480
that we have ever seen.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.280
And if you don't like GNOME 42, you're

08:39.280 --> 08:41.760
just never going to like GNOME, which is OK.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.680
And if there's elements of GNOME you've liked in the past

08:44.680 --> 08:46.640
and you haven't checked in in a bit,

08:46.640 --> 08:50.160
I think it's going to blow your freaking socks off.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.400
They have really nailed the light mode, dark mode stuff.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.760
It is significantly better than just a hacked theme

08:55.760 --> 08:56.360
to do dark mode.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.240
It really is, yeah.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.720
It feels like you get on some of those other platforms.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.000
And they've made improvements to the default theme

09:04.000 --> 09:05.800
that just look great anyways, that just

09:05.800 --> 09:09.280
make it look like a polished, professional operating system.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.960
And I even like it in the light mode now.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.480
It's just great.

09:13.480 --> 09:16.280
So this is a strong version of GNOME

09:16.280 --> 09:19.240
that really realizes the whole 4D transition,

09:19.240 --> 09:22.320
because this is where you really see the Libidwaita

09:22.320 --> 09:25.360
and the GTK4 stuff really land.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.800
You've got the new GNOME terminal called Console,

09:28.800 --> 09:30.480
I think, and the new text editor that's

09:30.480 --> 09:32.760
replacing GEDIT just called Text or Text Editor,

09:32.760 --> 09:33.840
something like that.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.040
But they're both pretty good apps out of the gate.

09:36.040 --> 09:39.320
We used to have this problem on the GNOME side

09:39.320 --> 09:42.360
where they would reboot an app, and you would then

09:42.360 --> 09:43.920
wait for three releases before it

09:43.920 --> 09:46.920
had the functionality that the previous application had.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.200
That has not been my experience with the recent reboots

09:50.200 --> 09:51.200
of these applications.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.420
And they look like really nice modern applications

09:53.420 --> 09:56.320
that are at home on the GNOME desktop.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.120
The other thing that's really, I think,

09:58.120 --> 10:00.580
palatable for those of us that pay attention to just

10:00.580 --> 10:02.880
the way your screen draws and stuff like that,

10:02.880 --> 10:07.640
with GTK4 in here, with the Vulkan back end for GTK4 stuff,

10:07.640 --> 10:09.480
with a number of performance-focused tweaks

10:09.480 --> 10:11.960
that they have laid into all of GNOME 42,

10:11.960 --> 10:14.760
some of the improved tooling, some of the leaner-meaner apps

10:14.760 --> 10:16.720
that are in this thing, like the new screenshot app,

10:16.720 --> 10:18.960
like the new terminal app, like the new text editor app,

10:18.960 --> 10:20.760
like the improvements to files, like the list

10:20.760 --> 10:22.120
goes on and on, you guys.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.200
It really all comes together for the smoothest desktop

10:25.200 --> 10:27.940
experience on GNOME ever.

10:27.940 --> 10:30.760
And those are even realized on the Raspberry Pi.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.080
I can even tell an improvement on the Raspberry Pi.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.560
Oh, you put this thing on the Pi?

10:34.560 --> 10:35.420
Yeah, yeah.

10:35.420 --> 10:36.840
And it's great.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.320
It's really something special.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.940
And to be fair, Tumbleweed got it first.

10:40.940 --> 10:44.040
I already had Tumbleweed on the Pi, so I was good to go.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.240
It was great.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.440
We thought Fedora 36 and Ubuntu would get there first,

10:47.440 --> 10:48.320
but Tumbleweed did.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.560
The wizards.

10:49.560 --> 10:50.280
I know.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.680
They're always hacking away at that kind of stuff.

10:52.680 --> 10:56.480
I think this is such a great release of GNOME

10:56.480 --> 11:00.520
that I think it's going to be really hard for the team

11:00.520 --> 11:04.480
to now kind of eclipse what this all accumulates to.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.240
And one of the things I love about Fedora 36

11:07.240 --> 11:09.760
is you get the real stock upstream experience.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.360
Now, we'll talk about Ubuntu's take on that in a minute,

11:12.360 --> 11:15.520
but that's one of the nice things about Fedora 36

11:15.520 --> 11:18.280
is you get to see sort of the project's vision there.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.320
The new Snapshot app is really nice.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.200
I like to take little screenshots and send them

11:22.200 --> 11:24.160
to Wes all the time, so it makes that real quick.

11:24.160 --> 11:24.820
Yeah, it's true.

11:24.820 --> 11:27.600
It feels really just native to the system, you know?

11:27.600 --> 11:28.080
Yeah.

11:28.080 --> 11:28.880
That's nice.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.440
The other thing that was different for this release

11:31.440 --> 11:35.160
cycle than like the last two or three Fedora release cycles

11:35.160 --> 11:37.000
was how we should probably clarify too,

11:37.000 --> 11:38.540
it hasn't quite actually been released.

11:38.540 --> 11:40.700
We're getting here a little early because, you know,

11:40.700 --> 11:41.440
schedules.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.900
That's what we like, because it's

11:42.900 --> 11:45.960
scheduled to land towards the end of April.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.880
As soon as the week this comes out,

11:48.880 --> 11:50.520
maybe as late as the end of April,

11:50.520 --> 11:52.560
2204 is likely going to hit its target, which

11:52.560 --> 11:53.520
will be this week.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.980
But this is kind of where I was going.

11:54.980 --> 12:01.640
This beta of Fedora 36 has been the most solid beta experience

12:01.640 --> 12:03.160
I've ever had in Fedora.

12:03.160 --> 12:06.520
Like, I have just about had every beta experience blow up

12:06.520 --> 12:09.080
in my face once, which that's the name of the game.

12:09.080 --> 12:09.920
Yeah, it's not a bad thing.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.260
It's just part of the trying this out

12:11.260 --> 12:12.480
while it all gets assembled.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.480
And I'm just riding that horse, and I don't really

12:15.480 --> 12:17.960
count that against, again, them in the review,

12:17.960 --> 12:20.440
because that's the beta process that's what it's for.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.940
It did not happen in this 36 release cycle.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.680
It did not blow up on me once.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.360
It just, I did my daily updates.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.280
I like to do it daily.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.200
You know, when I had new stuff, I installed it.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.320
Every time I rebooted the system or whatever,

12:33.320 --> 12:35.120
it always came back up.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.520
And I think what's happened here is on Fedora,

12:38.520 --> 12:40.920
especially, I've migrated to installing

12:40.920 --> 12:44.760
most of my user applications via Flathub and Flatpak.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.680
Yeah, me too.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.680
So everything's kind of isolated from the system.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.960
All of my work communication apps, I use,

12:51.840 --> 12:54.380
I think my browsers are installed from the repo.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.480
Of course, I'm using the desktop environment from the repo.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.320
I mean, some of that stuff, right?

12:58.320 --> 13:00.760
But all my chat apps, all the tools I use for work.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.240
All the weird proprietary stuff.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.520
Yeah, that's all Flatpak now.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.400
And so you take that and you combine it

13:07.400 --> 13:09.800
with just a smooth beta that isn't doing anything

13:09.800 --> 13:12.360
too crazy outside the desktop space.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.320
And it made for a really nice beta experience.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.280
And I really think out of the gate,

13:17.280 --> 13:18.920
it's gonna be a solid release.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.160
I'm just gonna go right to it.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.840
Like I was thinking with the last release,

13:21.840 --> 13:24.380
it was so rough, I was gonna wait like six months.

13:24.380 --> 13:27.280
But yeah, no, I've been using this as my primary OS

13:27.280 --> 13:29.380
on the ThinkPad since we talked about GNOME 42

13:29.380 --> 13:31.900
a couple episodes ago, and I've had the same experience.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.040
Just rock solid, I think I'll keep using it.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.680
The one thing I might want to adjust

13:35.680 --> 13:38.120
is I'm still not used to these offline updates.

13:38.120 --> 13:41.280
You know, like they can apply it almost Windows style.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.960
Here I was playing with 2204, rebooting a bunch,

13:43.960 --> 13:45.020
accidentally choose Fedora,

13:45.020 --> 13:47.880
and then I'm waiting for updates.

13:47.880 --> 13:52.180
You mentioned how bumpiness is a fairly standard thing

13:52.180 --> 13:54.720
about running beta software.

13:54.720 --> 13:58.800
My experience has largely echoed yours this time with 36.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.480
It's been very smooth sailing.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.920
No driver issues, no messing about with God,

14:03.920 --> 14:05.360
do you remember Xorg stuff?

14:05.360 --> 14:09.480
Like I had two external displays just working out the box

14:09.480 --> 14:12.360
straight away, you know, no real issues.

14:12.360 --> 14:16.960
The one thing I did have was in the mirrors for some reason,

14:16.960 --> 14:18.780
they seem to be a little bit behind.

14:18.780 --> 14:22.960
And my updates with DNF were looking for packages

14:22.960 --> 14:26.280
that didn't exist in quite a lot of the mirrors,

14:26.280 --> 14:29.720
like the 404s that came through, they were quite extensive.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.080
And so that led me to dig into the mirror process

14:32.080 --> 14:34.020
for Fedora a little bit.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.840
And it turns out that you can sync as often

14:36.840 --> 14:40.520
as every 10 minutes if you're a Fedora repo manager,

14:40.520 --> 14:42.080
or, you know, like a mirror.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.720
But there's no, or seemingly anyway,

14:43.720 --> 14:45.680
there's no documented thing that says

14:45.680 --> 14:49.200
you must sync at least once a day or something like that.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.400
And it's all done through sort of our sync,

14:51.400 --> 14:52.880
which I thought was interesting.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.160
I suppose not too surprising,

14:54.160 --> 14:56.320
but I've never really thought about that.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.320
And of course that's gonna be distro to distro as well.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.240
The individual admin who's configuring

15:00.240 --> 15:01.760
those system detimers perhaps.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.800
Yeah, and with, you know, depending on the mirror you pick,

15:04.800 --> 15:06.760
you just, I guess it's sort of random

15:06.760 --> 15:08.340
what they decided to do.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.980
I think it's worth noting that it looks like 37 plus,

15:11.980 --> 15:15.820
Fedora 37 plus, that's gonna be interesting.

15:15.820 --> 15:18.320
First of all, they're switching to a newer version of RPM

15:18.320 --> 15:20.060
just for better security.

15:20.060 --> 15:22.160
We'll cover this as it comes up.

15:22.160 --> 15:25.000
They're also planning to drop support

15:25.000 --> 15:26.840
for legacy bio systems.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.320
So long.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.360
This is the most probably,

15:30.360 --> 15:32.720
if you could label something controversial about this,

15:32.720 --> 15:34.300
this is probably it.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.840
There's a lot of mixed opinions here

15:35.840 --> 15:38.400
about deprecating old hardware.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.760
And of course there's valid arguments on both sides.

15:40.760 --> 15:42.400
If you're interested, send us a boost

15:42.400 --> 15:45.960
if you want us to cover that and we'll get to it.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.640
And then also speaking of Xorg,

15:48.640 --> 15:53.200
37 is considering the removal of legacy Xorg drivers as well.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.000
So it's a big transition in terms of

15:55.000 --> 15:56.400
the underlying hardware support

15:56.400 --> 15:58.680
they're essentially gonna, I guess, support.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.400
And it's gonna change.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.960
It's gonna change the nature of the user base for Fedora.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.520
And it's going to mean there's some users

16:05.520 --> 16:07.440
that can no longer move forward.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.520
But it also means that the team will be able

16:09.520 --> 16:12.680
to focus their time, talent, and energy

16:12.680 --> 16:16.600
on the broader user base, better security practices,

16:16.600 --> 16:19.760
all of the optimizations you get when you reduce complexity.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.280
And it seems like, especially these last couple of releases,

16:22.280 --> 16:24.580
Fedora's really been shining on the leaning edge

16:24.580 --> 16:26.080
kind of idea that they're going for.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.880
And so I think these kind of things are in that spirit

16:28.880 --> 16:30.360
and I'm all about it.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.520
Linode.com slash unplugged.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.920
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit

16:36.920 --> 16:38.600
and you go there to support the show.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.520
Linode's how we host everything.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.220
And Linode could also be part of your multi-cloud strategy.

16:43.220 --> 16:44.940
You know, one of the things that we're really proud of

16:44.940 --> 16:46.380
is that we've used Linode in a way

16:46.380 --> 16:48.360
that feels strategically smart.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.220
We've got a lot of our user-facing stuff,

16:50.220 --> 16:53.040
well, all of our user-facing stuff up in the cloud

16:53.040 --> 16:55.600
where we can take advantage of Linode's scaling tools,

16:55.600 --> 16:57.240
their incredible customer support,

16:57.240 --> 16:59.400
their 11 data centers around the world,

16:59.400 --> 17:01.400
their super nice UI with an API

17:01.400 --> 17:03.400
that makes it easy to integrate with our tools.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.720
Like, it's great for that.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.740
But we mix it with kind of a multi-cloud strategy

17:06.740 --> 17:09.520
where we have our own little tiny cloud here on the land.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.160
And they work really well together.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.160
In fact, Gardner estimates that two-thirds

17:14.160 --> 17:15.720
of all cloud industry customers

17:15.720 --> 17:17.820
will adopt a multi-cloud setup

17:17.820 --> 17:21.680
as a means for avoiding vendor lock-in by the end of 2024.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.000
And the reality is the largest hyperscaler cloud vendors

17:24.000 --> 17:26.840
that try to present themselves as a one-stop shop,

17:26.840 --> 17:29.480
inviting you to become wholly dependent on them

17:29.480 --> 17:32.200
and centralize all of your resources.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.920
And they'll offer everything you might ever need.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.160
But you know the problem of relying

17:36.160 --> 17:38.280
on a single cloud provider like that.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.600
It's the same problem as relying

17:39.600 --> 17:41.740
on a single commercial software vendor.

17:41.740 --> 17:43.480
You get deeply entwined.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.040
You get locked in.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.440
And you get locked in to your infrastructure.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.480
That can be dangerous.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.800
And so with pricing 30 to 50% cheaper

17:50.800 --> 17:52.480
than other major cloud providers,

17:52.480 --> 17:54.440
Linode is great for the individuals,

17:54.440 --> 17:58.440
but it's also great for businesses looking for a multi-cloud strategy.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.920
Plus, they combine it with great things like object storage,

18:00.920 --> 18:04.080
Kubernetes support, DDoS protection, VLAN,

18:04.080 --> 18:06.240
a powerful DNS manager,

18:06.240 --> 18:07.520
and, of course, that cloud dashboard

18:07.520 --> 18:10.360
that's easy for beginners, total noobs,

18:10.360 --> 18:11.960
and, of course, industry pros.

18:11.960 --> 18:15.560
So go use our $100 offer to performance test your network,

18:15.560 --> 18:18.120
troubleshoot something, build something, learn something,

18:18.120 --> 18:19.400
maybe create a backup.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.520
There's so many great options,

18:20.520 --> 18:22.240
and they have tutorials to help you get started

18:22.240 --> 18:25.640
on anything you might need and one-click application deployments.

18:25.640 --> 18:28.400
Linode.com slash unplugged.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.720
That's Linode.com slash unplugged.

18:31.720 --> 18:36.520
Well, if Fedora is the leading edge,

18:36.520 --> 18:40.440
I think it's safe to call Ubuntu the mainstream,

18:40.440 --> 18:44.920
and Ubuntu 22.04, which will release later this month.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.080
This is going to be a big release because, you know,

18:47.080 --> 18:49.280
all your boring friends running the LTS,

18:49.280 --> 18:50.600
they're going to finally upgrade.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.080
This thing's going to be supported till April 2027.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.600
So whatever we're getting right now,

18:55.600 --> 18:56.720
it's going to be here to stay.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.200
We are so spoiled with these LTS releases,

18:59.200 --> 19:01.320
and the community just eats these ones up.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.720
These canonical stresses this all the time.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.120
Anytime we've talked to them,

19:05.120 --> 19:08.080
the magnitude of difference is substantial.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.720
And so we thought, let's take a look at this thing

19:10.720 --> 19:13.680
because this is the one people are going to be considering

19:13.680 --> 19:16.240
deploying on their VPSs, on their Raspberry Pis,

19:16.240 --> 19:20.040
on their servers, on their workstations, and it matters.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.160
And we also know that the interim releases

19:22.160 --> 19:24.960
are often just building towards the climax,

19:24.960 --> 19:26.720
which is the LTS release.

19:26.720 --> 19:29.280
And so once again, we all kind of took a look at it

19:29.280 --> 19:31.640
around the horn, and I'll start with mine

19:31.640 --> 19:33.760
because mine are pretty straightforward so far.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.800
I started by, you know, it's a funny thing for me.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.920
My LTS systems are no joke, right?

19:38.920 --> 19:40.960
The ones that I'm running Ubuntu LTS on,

19:40.960 --> 19:43.440
I have something of value on them.

19:43.440 --> 19:47.360
And so it's a serious calculation for me when I'm like,

19:47.360 --> 19:48.680
which one am I going to upgrade

19:48.680 --> 19:50.120
before it's even officially released

19:50.120 --> 19:51.440
to test it for the show?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.360
But I love you guys, so I did it.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.720
And so I picked one of,

19:55.720 --> 19:57.880
I don't know if I'll acknowledge this before on the show,

19:57.880 --> 20:01.040
but I have what I call support nodes

20:01.040 --> 20:03.000
that are in orbit of LadyJoobs.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.920
And these run on different servers on Linode's cloud,

20:05.920 --> 20:09.240
and they provide support services for LadyJoobs,

20:09.240 --> 20:12.760
like synchronizing data, moving things around for me,

20:12.760 --> 20:15.000
copying certain backups, stuff like that.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.680
And these both run Ubuntu 20.04, well, they did.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.560
But I decided to give these ones an upgrade

20:22.560 --> 20:24.640
because it would be a major pain in my ass

20:24.640 --> 20:25.760
if anything happened to them,

20:25.760 --> 20:27.440
but I'm not planning a road trip right now

20:27.440 --> 20:30.720
or anything like that, so I would have time to recover them.

20:30.720 --> 20:34.680
And I have to say, I think one of the experiences

20:34.680 --> 20:35.640
that I have over and over again

20:35.640 --> 20:37.920
when I try out an Ubuntu distro

20:37.920 --> 20:41.360
is when you use the server side of Ubuntu,

20:41.360 --> 20:43.440
when you use that like in a headless environment

20:43.440 --> 20:45.320
where maybe you're SSHing in,

20:45.320 --> 20:47.280
it's elegant in certain ways,

20:47.280 --> 20:49.120
where they've built tooling

20:49.120 --> 20:51.000
where you can tell the team

20:51.000 --> 20:53.200
really spent time developing something,

20:53.200 --> 20:54.680
and they really built it well,

20:54.680 --> 20:57.120
and they can just kind of iterate on it after that.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.440
And that's how I felt about

20:58.440 --> 21:00.080
their do release upgrade program.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.760
It's a really handy tool that lets you upgrade

21:02.760 --> 21:03.920
before it releases out,

21:03.920 --> 21:06.240
or it lets you upgrade after it releases out.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.520
And it just does a lot of sanity checking

21:08.520 --> 21:10.880
on your distribution to try to make sure

21:10.880 --> 21:13.240
you get the best outcome possible.

21:13.240 --> 21:16.480
And where the polish is, is you can tell that the team,

21:16.480 --> 21:18.520
they put a lot of effort into collecting

21:18.520 --> 21:20.520
a bunch of information about your system,

21:20.520 --> 21:21.800
and then relaying it to you

21:21.800 --> 21:24.680
in a very relatable, readable way.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.080
I put a link to an upgrade warning screenshot

21:27.080 --> 21:29.960
that I got in the process of one of these,

21:29.960 --> 21:31.280
and we'll put a link to this in the show notes

21:31.280 --> 21:32.680
so you guys can check this out.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.360
And it just walks you through here

21:34.360 --> 21:36.560
where it says, you're gonna have to download

21:36.560 --> 21:39.160
a total of 741 megabytes of files.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.120
This download will take about two minutes

21:41.120 --> 21:42.520
with a 40 megabit connection,

21:42.520 --> 21:44.200
so it's benchmarked my connection.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.520
And about 19 minutes with a five megabit connection,

21:46.520 --> 21:48.560
or maybe it's just giving you examples, I guess.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.640
Fetch and installing the upgrade can take several hours.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.880
It just kind of walks you through everything

21:52.880 --> 21:55.400
in very plain, understandable language.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.600
And the other thing it does is it makes sure

21:57.600 --> 22:00.160
you're not gonna shoot yourself in the foot.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.720
Like maybe you're at a disk space

22:01.720 --> 22:04.960
because you didn't realize that your overlay FS2 folder

22:04.960 --> 22:06.840
had grown to 50 gigabytes.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.600
And so your root partition is totally full.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.200
And it checks that kind of stuff before you upgrade,

22:12.200 --> 22:15.480
or maybe, maybe you were doing this upgrade

22:15.480 --> 22:16.880
even though you know better.

22:17.840 --> 22:18.680
Even though you know better,

22:18.680 --> 22:21.600
you were doing this upgrade over an SSH connection

22:21.600 --> 22:24.480
that wasn't in any kind of session manager

22:24.480 --> 22:28.280
or using any kind of reliable connection like a MOSH,

22:28.280 --> 22:30.600
but just raw dog SSH.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.440
Maybe you did that even though you know better.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.680
I'm not sure you've even ever used Tmux.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.640
It will warn you and say, hey man,

22:37.640 --> 22:40.200
maybe you don't wanna do this in an SSH connection.

22:40.200 --> 22:43.640
And don't ask me how I know, but maybe that's you.

22:43.640 --> 22:46.600
And it just kind of prevents those kinds of mistakes.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.400
And then it works the system through the upgrade.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.480
It does the reboot.

22:49.480 --> 22:52.040
And the other thing it does that's really clever

22:52.040 --> 22:56.360
is it notices that you are using a third party mirror,

22:56.360 --> 22:57.800
which Linode does this.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.520
Linode replaces the canonical mirrors

23:00.520 --> 23:02.280
with local Linode caches.

23:02.280 --> 23:06.880
And the package install times are bananas as a result.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.200
Like they just stream down faster

23:09.200 --> 23:10.160
than your new app could move,

23:10.160 --> 23:11.800
probably at the maximum speed of apt.

23:11.800 --> 23:12.640
Let's be honest.

23:12.640 --> 23:13.480
Probably.

23:13.480 --> 23:14.520
And so it says, hey, I noticed you're using

23:14.520 --> 23:17.760
a third party sources.list file.

23:17.760 --> 23:21.560
I can't guarantee that they're gonna have the packages.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.160
I can swap the names for you, man,

23:23.160 --> 23:25.720
but I can't guarantee they're gonna have the packages.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.040
So I said, yeah, go for it.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.920
Let's see if Linode is pre-caching the release.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.520
Let's find out.

23:31.520 --> 23:35.760
So I said, yes, it modifies my sources.list from Linode

23:35.760 --> 23:37.240
to keep the Linode mirrors,

23:37.240 --> 23:38.840
but puts the jammy name in there

23:38.840 --> 23:40.280
instead of the focal fossil

23:40.280 --> 23:42.120
or whatever the old release was, I can't remember.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.760
And sure enough, Linode had the packages already mirrored.

23:44.760 --> 23:48.080
And so my upgrade on both of these nodes

23:48.080 --> 23:49.240
was bananas fast,

23:49.240 --> 23:51.920
just because I was using the local mirrors to upgrade.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.000
And Linode had what you needed.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.640
And I only had to solve the storage issue on one box.

23:55.640 --> 23:58.360
I mean, somebody did, not me, but maybe somebody.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.200
And it went great.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.560
And both systems came right back up.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.280
They're running just fine.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.280
And I really have no complaints.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.560
I think it's gonna, you know, I didn't need to,

24:06.560 --> 24:08.040
but I think it's gonna just be great.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.760
I'll run these for a little bit.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.280
And then my thought is,

24:11.280 --> 24:13.800
when the actual shipping version is out,

24:13.800 --> 24:18.360
I'll probably start upgrading my pies in LadyJuice.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.520
And then I'll report back on the self-hosted podcast

24:20.520 --> 24:21.360
on how that goes.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.920
Oh, nice.

24:22.920 --> 24:23.760
What about you, Brent?

24:23.760 --> 24:25.120
Did you get a chance to kick the tires?

24:25.120 --> 24:27.480
I did, and I was extra interested

24:27.480 --> 24:30.080
because I actually got the chance maybe,

24:30.080 --> 24:31.520
I don't know, three weeks ago.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.160
They were doing the alpha testing week,

24:34.160 --> 24:37.120
and I got my hands dirty in there and found a bunch of bugs.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.320
And it was neat to see the progression.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.080
Most of those, the ones that I filed,

24:41.080 --> 24:42.800
which was about eight of them,

24:42.800 --> 24:45.960
all had lots of action and got kind of all fixed.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.000
And I was interested in seeing that.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.560
So I would say from that perspective,

24:49.560 --> 24:50.760
it actually went great.

24:50.760 --> 24:52.520
Upon installing, I really was curious

24:52.520 --> 24:54.120
about the new Flutter installer.

24:54.120 --> 24:57.240
And I ran into a few probably edge case bugs

24:57.240 --> 25:00.760
as I seem to have a knack for finding.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.600
But overall, it worked quite well.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.440
And I loved the look of Ubuntu as well,

25:06.440 --> 25:09.880
the desktop edition, and no complaints really.

25:09.880 --> 25:13.000
I thought as an LTS, it seemed stable to me

25:13.000 --> 25:15.960
and really quite nice to look at.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.360
I'm not a GNOME expert, I would say,

25:18.360 --> 25:19.720
but it feels like, Chris,

25:19.720 --> 25:21.600
that I'm getting in just at the right time

25:21.600 --> 25:23.840
because everybody seems to have a really nice take on it.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.240
I think 42 is a great release

25:25.240 --> 25:26.680
if you haven't checked it out for a while.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.320
That's my main takeaway from the show.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.200
So if you haven't tried GNOME, it's time to try it again.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.600
Alex, did you get a chance to try out the Ubuntu side?

25:33.600 --> 25:38.600
No, I'm more in the production deployment camp

25:39.240 --> 25:40.680
with Ubuntu these days.

25:40.680 --> 25:44.680
So my file server is on Ubuntu.

25:44.680 --> 25:47.120
So I think that's running 2004 right now,

25:47.120 --> 25:50.720
and it will stay there until 2204.1 comes out.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.600
Ah, yeah, that's a good strategy.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.400
I'm debating something like that

25:54.400 --> 25:57.640
other than just, I wanna talk about it on Self-Hosted,

25:57.640 --> 25:59.400
how the upgrade experience goes.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.720
Yeah, I know, I know.

26:00.720 --> 26:03.040
The life of a content creator, huh?

26:03.040 --> 26:04.720
I gotta make content, you know?

26:04.720 --> 26:05.720
That's the job.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.200
But also, it's like, sometimes I feel like

26:08.200 --> 26:10.000
a little bit of like, well, I could do it,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.080
and then I'll do it so they don't have to,

26:12.080 --> 26:13.720
and if it blows up, I'll tell them about it,

26:13.720 --> 26:15.520
and if it doesn't blow up, they'll know it's okay.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.080
I really think Canonical has nailed

26:18.080 --> 26:20.360
the Raspberry Pi support now for a while.

26:20.360 --> 26:21.880
It's so nice.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.920
It is such a first, it feels like such a first class

26:24.920 --> 26:26.720
server OS on the Raspberry Pi,

26:26.720 --> 26:29.200
which is such a silly thing to actually say,

26:29.200 --> 26:30.760
but hey, it's where we're at right now.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.840
I mean, when it's just now that Raspberry Pi OS

26:32.840 --> 26:34.520
is kind of catching up, you need,

26:34.520 --> 26:35.840
this has been kind of a haven for you

26:35.840 --> 26:37.960
for saying OS for your boxes.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.040
It's been great.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.520
I like it, I mean, personally,

26:40.520 --> 26:42.960
I like it a lot more than Raspberry Pi OS.

26:42.960 --> 26:46.800
So Fedora 36, I believe, was Rockin' Linux 5.17.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.160
Ubuntu 22.04 is Rockin' 5.15.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.600
It's both pretty modern.

26:51.600 --> 26:55.880
This one came with that, 5.15 is when they introduced

26:55.880 --> 26:57.760
the Samba server in the Linux kernel.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.040
Yeah, KSMBD.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.040
You know how much I love having a Samba server

27:01.040 --> 27:02.080
built into the Linux kernel.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.640
What else could you want?

27:03.640 --> 27:05.840
Now you can finally flip it on those pies, man.

27:05.840 --> 27:08.240
Come on, replace your Samba setup at Chubb's.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.920
You know, I mean, everybody says that Samsung

27:10.920 --> 27:12.600
doesn't contribute much to open source,

27:12.600 --> 27:15.280
but that speaks differently.

27:15.280 --> 27:18.440
So what was your experience, Wes Payne, with 22.04?

27:18.440 --> 27:19.440
You know, I'm liking it.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.120
I think we've lamented a little bit about

27:21.120 --> 27:23.480
how much has Canonical been investing

27:23.480 --> 27:26.000
into the Ubuntu desktop experience.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.320
And although I think I do kind of prefer

27:27.320 --> 27:29.680
the more stock GNOME feel going on

27:29.680 --> 27:33.160
on the Fedora side of things, GNOME 42 is great on Ubuntu.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.680
It's a really nice experience.

27:34.680 --> 27:37.400
And I'm almost not used, I know this will change

27:37.400 --> 27:39.480
over the lifetime of the LTS, but for right now,

27:39.480 --> 27:42.000
I'm almost not used to how close these two releases are.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.280
You know, in the past, Ubuntu had kind of been

27:44.280 --> 27:45.600
a little lagging on GNOME.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.440
And then even just across some of the packages,

27:47.440 --> 27:50.000
like, you know, you get Ruby 3.0, you get Python 3.10,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.240
which is a pretty big release in the Python community.

27:52.240 --> 27:57.240
A bunch of stuff like that, LexD, you get QEMU 6.2,

27:57.240 --> 28:00.360
which also includes jack support for low latency audio.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.480
There's a really nice PipeWire support on Ubuntu now.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.760
It's not quite as shiny or like automated.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.480
You know, they've still got the old media session thing

28:07.480 --> 28:08.440
instead of wire plumber.

28:08.440 --> 28:09.720
So there's a few trade-offs, but.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.680
But I feel like for an LTS,

28:11.680 --> 28:13.600
that's probably what I would have expected them to do

28:13.600 --> 28:14.960
with the audio subsystem.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.400
Yes, I think that's nice mix too,

28:16.400 --> 28:17.880
because you still got Pulse going.

28:17.880 --> 28:19.440
So, you know, that's all gonna work

28:19.440 --> 28:20.360
just as you might expect,

28:20.360 --> 28:22.200
but there's still PipeWire things you can plug into

28:22.200 --> 28:23.680
if you do need to go above and beyond.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.840
This release switches to NF tables as well, right?

28:25.840 --> 28:27.760
It does, yeah, isn't that nice to think?

28:27.760 --> 28:30.800
And another thing where Ubuntu's really kind of catching up.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.280
And we get LexD 5 finally,

28:32.280 --> 28:34.040
which we talked about on LAN recently.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.240
Indeed, I was a little disappointed to see,

28:36.240 --> 28:38.720
I mean, so there is a new little bumped release of ZSYS,

28:38.720 --> 28:40.200
which is sort of the, you know,

28:40.200 --> 28:42.520
their ZFS integration in the file system

28:42.520 --> 28:45.400
into more of like the system level of the operating system,

28:45.400 --> 28:47.560
but it was mostly just a compatibility bump

28:47.560 --> 28:49.320
for the, you know, the newer version of ZFS

28:49.320 --> 28:50.160
that they're shipping.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.520
So not a ton of work there.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.280
A lot of initial upfront work,

28:53.280 --> 28:55.240
and then it seems very minimal iterative,

28:55.240 --> 28:57.520
but maybe I have the wrong impression.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.880
Also there, I gave the Flutter installer a go as well.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.760
Seemed, you know, it's still early days.

29:02.760 --> 29:03.920
It's quite minimal.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.520
Towards the end, it looks a lot like what you're used to.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.720
The time zone support seemed very early.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.000
It did auto detect what I wanted,

29:10.000 --> 29:11.080
but I didn't see a great way

29:11.080 --> 29:14.440
besides manually type it in to change it.

29:14.440 --> 29:17.640
And although you can have it do LVM for you,

29:17.640 --> 29:19.760
there's no ZFS support.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.200
Yeah, that was interesting.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.000
I gave it a go early myself.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
I see where they're going with it.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.360
I think it looks fine.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.640
I'll be interested as more people get experience

29:27.640 --> 29:30.480
and exposure to that, what their take is.

29:30.480 --> 29:31.440
You can Google search.

29:31.440 --> 29:34.880
There's a build of the ISO that has the Flutter installer,

29:34.880 --> 29:36.560
if you'd like to grab that.

29:36.560 --> 29:39.200
I think it's also notable that one of the features

29:39.200 --> 29:41.040
we talked about has been pulled,

29:41.040 --> 29:43.120
and that is the switch of rebranding

29:43.120 --> 29:45.640
the live patch stuff to Ubuntu Pro.

29:45.640 --> 29:47.600
That actually didn't end up in 2204.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.680
They ended up reverting back

29:48.680 --> 29:51.000
to the live patch branding and whatnot.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.760
Maybe they just felt, I think they actually did,

29:52.760 --> 29:54.000
I think maybe Joey had an article,

29:54.000 --> 29:55.200
somebody had an article that,

29:55.200 --> 29:57.000
yeah, Joey has an article over at OMG Ubuntu

29:57.000 --> 29:58.560
that talks a little bit about their motivation

29:58.560 --> 29:59.400
and pulling it out.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.120
Just seems like it wasn't quite ready yet.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.080
Doesn't really change any actual functionality.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.880
Live patch stuff is still all in there.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.640
Right, yeah, you can still get the service if you need it,

30:06.640 --> 30:08.720
but just a little more consistent for now.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.240
Yeah, so the upgrade process

30:10.240 --> 30:11.640
on the systems I tried went smooth.

30:11.640 --> 30:15.160
I also ran this beta nearly the entire time

30:15.160 --> 30:16.960
that it was in beta on and off in a VM,

30:16.960 --> 30:19.240
just kind of checking in on it, not serious usage,

30:19.240 --> 30:20.800
but checking in and doing the upgrades

30:20.800 --> 30:22.680
to see if anything breaks.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.520
Also very smooth upgrade.

30:24.520 --> 30:26.680
And I think as time has gone on,

30:26.680 --> 30:30.440
I have my take on canonical or Ubuntu spin

30:30.440 --> 30:32.920
on the GNOME 42 desktop has softened.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.680
When we saw Fedora's take,

30:34.680 --> 30:36.600
which was basically upstream in the new Adwaita,

30:36.600 --> 30:39.280
and then we saw the canonical Ubuntu version,

30:39.280 --> 30:41.560
I thought this branding that they're doing

30:41.560 --> 30:43.480
is starting to feel old.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.600
It's starting to feel like the way we used to do Linux.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.720
And when I see what the GNOME platform is doing

30:48.720 --> 30:50.560
and the way they're iterating that design,

30:50.560 --> 30:53.240
and my fundamental argument always was,

30:53.240 --> 30:55.160
and I don't think I articulated it very well

30:55.160 --> 30:56.640
until just recently,

30:56.640 --> 30:59.000
if GNOME didn't want downstream projects

30:59.000 --> 31:00.320
re-theming the desktop,

31:00.320 --> 31:02.400
then the upstream theme

31:02.400 --> 31:04.480
just simply needed to be better quality.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.600
It needed to be a better theme

31:05.600 --> 31:07.680
if they wanted people to use it.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.280
And they've done it.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.240
That's what they've done now.

31:10.240 --> 31:13.400
And so there's a bit of a mind shift that happens

31:13.400 --> 31:15.480
when you compare these two distros side by side.

31:15.480 --> 31:18.680
And if you got some free VM space or something,

31:18.680 --> 31:20.280
maybe give this a go at home.

31:20.280 --> 31:23.760
Load up Fedora 36, load up 2204.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.800
And I think you can objectively say it's nice.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.080
They're both really nice,

31:27.080 --> 31:30.800
but I'm starting to feel like the custom brand theming

31:30.800 --> 31:35.760
is a bit akin to like OEMs loading up new laptops

31:35.760 --> 31:38.600
with their like dashboards to help your PC health

31:38.600 --> 31:39.920
and stuff like that.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.320
It's not quite that bad.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.040
That's not like they're putting software on there

31:43.040 --> 31:45.520
that's stealing processor cycles and stuff.

31:45.520 --> 31:46.640
So I don't want people thinking

31:46.640 --> 31:48.160
like it's a bad thing necessarily,

31:48.160 --> 31:50.480
but it doesn't quite sit with me right anymore.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.600
Alex, what are your thoughts?

31:51.600 --> 31:54.400
Why do both of the major desktop distros

31:54.400 --> 31:57.160
both have to pick GNOME as their default?

31:57.160 --> 31:59.400
Why can't we have some differentiation in the space?

31:59.400 --> 32:01.360
Why can't one be plasma, for example,

32:01.360 --> 32:04.640
and one be GNOME and that be the differentiator

32:04.640 --> 32:07.200
rather than putting lipstick on a pig, you know?

32:07.200 --> 32:09.560
I think you don't want me to answer why.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.320
Oh no, I do, please.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.120
What it comes down to is as someone who works

32:14.120 --> 32:16.920
on both Fedora Workstation and Fedora KDE,

32:16.920 --> 32:19.240
the most frustrating aspect of working

32:19.240 --> 32:23.120
with the KDE plasma stack is how huge it is

32:23.120 --> 32:25.320
and how discordant the life cycles

32:25.320 --> 32:26.680
of each layer of plasma is.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.640
So for example, the frameworks

32:28.640 --> 32:30.600
has a completely independent life cycle.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.200
It's released monthly.

32:32.200 --> 32:36.080
Then the KDE applications were to release quarterly.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.480
And then the plasma desktop itself

32:37.480 --> 32:38.760
is released every four months,

32:38.760 --> 32:42.520
and it's out of sync of every distribution release cadence.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.360
And that makes it difficult for testing,

32:44.360 --> 32:45.800
for integration and all that stuff.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.840
Plus, because it's so big,

32:47.840 --> 32:50.800
there's a large surface area of things to manage.

32:50.800 --> 32:54.760
And differentiating on the plasma desktop,

32:54.760 --> 32:56.840
in theory, would be great,

32:56.840 --> 32:59.400
except for it is extremely difficult

32:59.400 --> 33:02.120
to keep up with the plasma desktop

33:02.120 --> 33:06.360
and differentiate on it in the first place.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.760
Think about how Ubuntu was originally using Unity,

33:08.760 --> 33:10.200
and it was a lot of engineering work

33:10.200 --> 33:12.880
for them to maintain that in the first place.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.920
And when they decided to let that go

33:14.920 --> 33:16.520
and they switched to GNOME,

33:16.520 --> 33:18.160
the primary reason for doing that

33:18.160 --> 33:21.520
was because the other enterprise Linux distributions,

33:21.520 --> 33:23.480
the main enterprise Linux distributions,

33:23.480 --> 33:26.160
Red Hat and SUSE, both use GNOME,

33:26.160 --> 33:27.800
and so they could benefit from the work

33:27.800 --> 33:29.040
that was being done already

33:29.040 --> 33:30.960
with the focus of those platforms.

33:30.960 --> 33:31.800
Yeah.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.120
Tiny, that's a bit of it, isn't it?

33:33.120 --> 33:34.480
It's about retaining the developers

33:34.480 --> 33:35.600
that already have the skills.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.120
That's correct, especially because a lot of these distros

33:38.120 --> 33:40.480
have long-term support tied to them,

33:40.480 --> 33:44.440
whether it's Fedora eventually getting rolled into Red Hat

33:44.440 --> 33:47.200
or Canonical, they would have to maintain

33:47.200 --> 33:51.040
both a QT stack and a GTK stack for the lifecycle

33:51.040 --> 33:52.640
while both of them are still around.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.600
Yeah, and we've asked Karl and the team at System76

33:55.600 --> 33:58.800
when they launched POP, why GNOME Shell,

33:58.800 --> 34:00.920
and now building POP Shell on top of that,

34:00.920 --> 34:02.840
why not Plasma and you could kind of just get

34:02.840 --> 34:05.640
to what you wanted using the Plasma tooling built in.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.440
And they were very honest about the answer is,

34:07.440 --> 34:09.800
well, the team knows GTK tooling.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.640
We know GNOME Shell, we know this environment,

34:12.640 --> 34:14.000
and that's where our developer skills are.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.240
So it's potentially just one of those things

34:16.240 --> 34:18.640
where it's a network effect of,

34:18.640 --> 34:21.520
and it just means because it's been around for so long,

34:21.520 --> 34:22.600
it's been the default for so long,

34:22.600 --> 34:23.960
there's inherently just more people

34:23.960 --> 34:26.680
that the market can hire that have skills in there.

34:26.680 --> 34:28.960
I don't know for sure, but that could definitely seem

34:28.960 --> 34:30.680
like a pretty reasonable component of it.

34:30.680 --> 34:31.960
Don't get me wrong, Chris.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.680
It's not that Plasma isn't possible

34:33.680 --> 34:36.800
to like build out and roll out and have a good experience.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.240
Fedora KD is a great example of this where we have it

34:39.240 --> 34:41.320
and Component 2 is another one.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.600
And you can see this in OpenSUSE

34:43.600 --> 34:46.560
where despite some people's protests,

34:46.560 --> 34:47.920
it's very clear that the KD

34:47.920 --> 34:51.400
is the most loved experience of the offerings.

34:51.400 --> 34:54.840
But when you're trying to build a Linux desktop

34:54.840 --> 34:57.320
that you're going to commercialize and sell,

34:57.320 --> 34:59.040
having multiple desktops

34:59.040 --> 35:01.720
and not having multiple groups of people

35:01.720 --> 35:03.600
to maintain those desktops

35:03.600 --> 35:05.640
means you're splintering your effort

35:05.640 --> 35:08.920
and it's much, much harder to get everything going.

35:08.920 --> 35:10.720
And if you think about all the work

35:10.720 --> 35:13.120
that Red Hat's doing right now to push forward,

35:13.120 --> 35:15.200
the Linux desktop's feature set

35:15.200 --> 35:17.040
to be competitive with Windows and Mac,

35:17.040 --> 35:20.520
think about HDR, think about the Wayland stuff,

35:20.520 --> 35:23.680
the hardware acceleration things,

35:23.680 --> 35:26.800
input stuff, touch gestures.

35:26.800 --> 35:29.160
Think about how much extra work it would be

35:29.160 --> 35:32.400
to pull that across a multitude of desktop stacks

35:32.400 --> 35:35.400
and multitude of implementations across the board.

35:35.400 --> 35:40.240
It's a lot easier for them to go wide on all these issues

35:40.240 --> 35:43.520
if they're focusing on one stack as a reference point

35:43.520 --> 35:46.320
and then leveraging that experience and expertise

35:46.320 --> 35:48.960
to build it out and then everyone else

35:48.960 --> 35:51.400
can essentially catch up afterwards.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.320
Would I like Red Hat, to example,

35:53.320 --> 35:55.520
have people working on both KD and GNOME?

35:55.520 --> 35:57.920
Of course, but realistically,

35:57.920 --> 35:59.440
with the kind of stuff that they're working on

35:59.440 --> 36:00.960
and how far they're putting into it

36:00.960 --> 36:03.520
and how much investment that they're doing

36:03.520 --> 36:05.400
and how much that they're working

36:05.400 --> 36:08.960
on all many different touch points in the experience,

36:08.960 --> 36:11.720
I can't blame them for focusing on only just GNOME.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.000
I think that's well said.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.680
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

36:17.680 --> 36:21.120
Get started with a free trial of a team or enterprise plan

36:21.120 --> 36:23.320
at bitwarden.com slash Linux

36:23.320 --> 36:25.400
or try it for free as an individual user

36:25.400 --> 36:27.040
and you can support the show.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.360
Bitwarden is the easiest way for businesses

36:29.360 --> 36:32.760
and individuals to store share or sync sensitive data.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.880
I use it for all kinds of things like passwords,

36:34.880 --> 36:38.720
recovery keys, notes, it's fully customizable too

36:38.720 --> 36:40.400
and in the enterprise context,

36:40.400 --> 36:43.200
you can turn certain features on or off

36:43.200 --> 36:44.720
just using enterprise policies

36:44.720 --> 36:46.480
to adapt it to your business needs.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.880
That's pretty nice.

36:47.880 --> 36:49.800
And of course, I love the fact and I think you will too,

36:49.800 --> 36:51.560
that Bitwarden is open source

36:51.560 --> 36:54.440
and it's trusted by millions of individuals, teams

36:54.440 --> 36:56.960
and organizations worldwide for securing their passwords

36:56.960 --> 36:58.600
and other information.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.560
It's what Wes and I have used for a couple of years,

37:00.560 --> 37:02.440
at least I think Wes longer than I.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.240
I use it for my two factor codes as well,

37:04.240 --> 37:05.560
having it in one place.

37:05.560 --> 37:07.640
It works so well for that kind of thing,

37:07.640 --> 37:10.320
especially on mobile.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.720
It makes having secure complicated passwords on mobile

37:13.720 --> 37:15.120
a doable thing.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.200
And Bitwarden has introduced account switching

37:17.200 --> 37:19.440
so it's super easy to switch between your personal

37:19.440 --> 37:22.000
and business accounts or maybe you have a personal account

37:22.000 --> 37:23.240
and you have like an open source project

37:23.240 --> 37:25.040
you're participating in.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.640
And I think one of the things that gives me

37:26.640 --> 37:28.720
and a lot of our community confidence

37:28.720 --> 37:32.080
is that Bitwarden offers a really good self hosted option.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.440
You can get that up and running pretty easily

37:34.440 --> 37:36.400
or even faster using the Bitwarden cloud,

37:36.400 --> 37:38.160
which is what I decided to do.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.040
And if I ever wanted to move to the self hosted option,

37:40.040 --> 37:42.040
I could and the nice thing is they have a large,

37:42.040 --> 37:45.240
active community on their forums and on Reddit.

37:45.240 --> 37:47.200
So I have to say a couple of years into using Bitwarden,

37:47.200 --> 37:50.040
obviously I get the idea of good password hygiene,

37:50.040 --> 37:51.720
but what I've really started to appreciate about it

37:51.720 --> 37:53.920
is how fast and straightforward it is

37:53.920 --> 37:57.040
to share passwords with somebody on a certain project

37:57.040 --> 37:58.520
and it's really simple to say,

37:58.520 --> 38:00.520
okay, just these passwords, I'm setting these aside

38:00.520 --> 38:01.840
and I'm sharing these with you.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.200
I think using a good password manager

38:03.200 --> 38:04.320
and I bet you would agree with me

38:04.320 --> 38:06.480
is one of the best things you could do online

38:06.480 --> 38:08.080
to keep your account safe.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.560
You might already know that really,

38:09.560 --> 38:10.680
but maybe someone in your life,

38:10.680 --> 38:11.960
a friend, a colleague, a family member,

38:11.960 --> 38:12.800
maybe they need to hear that

38:12.800 --> 38:14.320
and they need to know about Bitwarden.

38:14.320 --> 38:15.720
So go yourself, support the show

38:15.720 --> 38:18.320
or send people to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.600
It's easy to get started.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.400
You just go to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.960
Try it for yourself, maybe try it in your business

38:24.960 --> 38:26.320
and you'll support the show.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.280
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.000
As always, we got some great feedback this week,

38:34.000 --> 38:37.440
but I figured since many of us have been flying recently,

38:37.440 --> 38:39.240
I thought I would give a little insights

38:39.240 --> 38:40.880
that we received in our mailbox.

38:40.880 --> 38:41.800
Chris, you might like this one.

38:41.800 --> 38:45.040
It was directed at something you said last week.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.360
A listener wrote in and said,

38:46.360 --> 38:47.720
since you were flying with Delta,

38:47.720 --> 38:49.440
you had probably a very old

38:49.440 --> 38:51.280
in-flight entertainment equipment.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.680
Yes, the old monitors used to run Linux.

38:53.680 --> 38:56.360
The new monitor hardware runs Android.

38:56.360 --> 38:58.400
They have native GUI with X11

38:58.400 --> 39:01.040
and like GTK, QT based GUIs,

39:01.040 --> 39:04.400
the movies are just RTSP server connections

39:04.400 --> 39:06.600
and games are launched locally.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.800
The control units like your servers

39:08.800 --> 39:11.480
and network modules are all Linux boxes.

39:11.480 --> 39:15.160
The flight tracker or map can be two different things,

39:15.160 --> 39:17.720
either a single stream channel where each monitor

39:17.720 --> 39:21.560
and overhead monitors tune in and grabs images

39:21.560 --> 39:23.120
or more advanced new hardware

39:23.120 --> 39:25.040
where it launches native Android app

39:25.040 --> 39:28.200
and gets information using more modern protocols.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.480
So Chris, you were mentioning

39:29.480 --> 39:30.960
how you saw some Linux scroll by,

39:30.960 --> 39:32.640
so I guess you were in the old camp.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.280
Yeah, and mine were old and crappy.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.320
I think local apps would have been way better

39:36.320 --> 39:40.040
because this thing, like you touch a button

39:40.040 --> 39:42.360
and it wouldn't even register the tap for a second.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.760
So you'd always do that thing where you're like,

39:43.760 --> 39:44.800
did it register?

39:44.800 --> 39:45.640
And then you have to do it again,

39:45.640 --> 39:47.640
but that time it's like halfway through changing.

39:47.640 --> 39:48.560
Every single time.

39:48.560 --> 39:49.960
And even though you know it,

39:49.960 --> 39:50.800
you still like it.

39:50.800 --> 39:51.640
You still do it.

39:51.640 --> 39:52.480
And the delay varies.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.400
So it was not a great experience.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.520
So I could imagine something locally work,

39:56.520 --> 39:57.840
using some sort of network protocol

39:57.840 --> 39:59.160
would be a lot better.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.520
You know, I was on JetBlue for part of my flight

40:01.520 --> 40:03.640
and it was an Android tablet right there.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.760
And I saw it totally freeze up on the guy next to me

40:05.760 --> 40:07.640
who unfortunately was actually using it to watch a movie.

40:07.640 --> 40:08.720
It was just like tapping the screen,

40:08.720 --> 40:10.480
like, well, what do I do?

40:10.480 --> 40:11.800
So they just basically put a tablet

40:11.800 --> 40:12.640
in the back of the seat?

40:12.640 --> 40:13.480
Seemingly.

40:13.480 --> 40:14.560
Yeah, okay.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.560
I guess that would be the way

40:15.560 --> 40:17.320
people would solve this problem, right?

40:17.320 --> 40:19.560
But then like, are they all on wifi?

40:19.560 --> 40:22.320
Are they hardwired over like the USB connection?

40:22.320 --> 40:24.080
Because that's a lot of network traffic.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.880
And if you get even half the passenger streaming video,

40:26.880 --> 40:28.680
wifi is not gonna handle that well.

40:28.680 --> 40:29.920
No wonder why it locks up.

40:29.920 --> 40:33.960
I've seen some videos previously of the like computer rooms

40:33.960 --> 40:35.120
that are included on planes.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.160
Have any of you had insights into that?

40:37.160 --> 40:38.600
Have you seen videos of those before?

40:38.600 --> 40:40.480
Yeah, they're like full on aerial data centers.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.280
It's insane.

40:42.280 --> 40:45.840
Like how do they fit all of that power in a plane?

40:45.840 --> 40:48.880
It seems like that's why we have such small seats, isn't it?

40:48.880 --> 40:50.240
How much fuel are they burning,

40:50.240 --> 40:52.400
hauling that gear around, right?

40:52.400 --> 40:54.560
And how many of us just show up with our own devices

40:54.560 --> 40:57.360
with our content already loaded on it anyways?

40:57.360 --> 40:58.720
Yeah, we should probably have a protocol.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.840
You wanna talk about saving fuel costs

41:00.840 --> 41:03.600
and lowering prices and saving the environment.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.600
How about you just take the like 700 pounds

41:05.600 --> 41:07.280
of server hardware off the thing

41:07.280 --> 41:09.480
and we just like have a mount for my tablet

41:09.480 --> 41:11.080
because that would make me happy.

41:11.080 --> 41:12.280
That's all I need.

41:12.280 --> 41:14.360
It's not, I'm not asking for a lot, right?

41:14.360 --> 41:19.360
And now as the French say, it is time for Le Boost.

41:23.320 --> 41:25.320
Oh, we received a boost yesterday.

41:25.320 --> 41:29.680
20,000 sats, thank you Silas, he writes in.

41:29.680 --> 41:32.080
Folks, any suggestions for a backend file sync method

41:32.080 --> 41:34.680
that handles a lot of small files well?

41:34.680 --> 41:37.480
Hmm, I mean, I could just go the R sync route,

41:37.480 --> 41:39.680
but I'm wondering if we could make the case

41:39.680 --> 41:41.800
for like a ButterFS or ZFS send.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.900
Sure, yeah, if you're, you know,

41:43.900 --> 41:45.360
have those capabilities on both sides

41:45.360 --> 41:46.560
that are willing to use those toolings.

41:46.560 --> 41:47.920
You know, if there's bi-directional stuff,

41:47.920 --> 41:49.920
then that might not work so well.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.520
But if you're just trying to back things up, yeah.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.440
Alex is moving files around the world all the time.

41:54.440 --> 41:55.400
I'm wondering what you're thinking.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.320
Yeah, ZFS send is a great shout

41:57.320 --> 41:59.120
because that works at the block level.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.360
So, you know, if you're talking about

42:01.360 --> 42:03.960
lots of small files with R sync,

42:03.960 --> 42:06.520
it would have to compute every time it loads up

42:06.520 --> 42:09.900
a checksum of the source and the destination file,

42:09.900 --> 42:12.960
compare them and make sure that they're not different

42:12.960 --> 42:15.300
and then sync the Delta if required.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.840
If you're talking about lots and lots of small files,

42:17.840 --> 42:20.360
that can get quite expensive quite quickly

42:20.360 --> 42:23.200
in terms of time and computing power.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.360
Whereas something like ZFS,

42:24.360 --> 42:27.160
because it's working at the block level of the disk,

42:27.160 --> 42:30.040
it doesn't care that there's 10,000 files in those blocks.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.380
It cares that there's, I don't know,

42:31.380 --> 42:34.920
let's say five blocks worth of disk that have changed

42:34.920 --> 42:37.020
and it will sync those five blocks only.

42:37.020 --> 42:38.820
So you've got five transactions, let's say,

42:38.820 --> 42:40.380
instead of 10,000.

42:40.380 --> 42:43.260
So it can be a lot more efficient for that kind of thing.

42:43.260 --> 42:44.800
So that's probably the route I'd go.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.000
Alex, in one of our technical escapades here

42:47.000 --> 42:49.080
where you show me all of the infrastructure

42:49.080 --> 42:49.920
that you have set up,

42:49.920 --> 42:53.080
which I don't even think I have a 10% grasp on yet,

42:53.080 --> 42:55.360
you were showing me that you also use RESTIC

42:55.360 --> 42:57.620
to do a little bit of file-based syncing.

42:57.620 --> 42:59.760
And I wondered what is happening on the back end there.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.600
I'm not sure.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.040
I have even 10% of a clue

43:02.040 --> 43:05.000
of what's going on in my infrastructure some days.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.760
So yeah, RESTIC is an interesting one.

43:06.760 --> 43:08.700
That works at the file level as well.

43:08.700 --> 43:10.760
It monitors things like inode time

43:10.760 --> 43:15.000
and M time for modified time on the file level.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.280
So that's a file level based one,

43:16.280 --> 43:17.400
which wouldn't be very efficient

43:17.400 --> 43:19.460
for this particular use case.

43:19.460 --> 43:21.360
But the reason I like RESTIC in particular

43:21.360 --> 43:23.120
is because I send all my stuff

43:23.120 --> 43:24.720
to an S3 compatible back end.

43:24.720 --> 43:27.780
So on my Synology box that is in England,

43:27.780 --> 43:30.160
that's running Minio in a Docker container.

43:30.160 --> 43:33.740
And I sync all the files from here to England

43:33.740 --> 43:38.360
using auto RESTIC, which is a wrapper around RESTIC itself.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.200
And so I actually have two servers in England.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.600
I've got the Synology at my mom's house and at my dad's,

43:42.600 --> 43:46.320
I have a normal Linux box running ZFS.

43:46.320 --> 43:48.440
And so I like it for the separation of concern.

43:48.440 --> 43:50.820
So if something goes wrong with my ZFS backup,

43:50.820 --> 43:53.200
I'm fat fingered in my Ansible configuration

43:53.200 --> 43:54.840
and I screw something up,

43:54.840 --> 43:57.760
there are two separate channels of backup

43:57.760 --> 44:01.240
and my automation isn't gonna fail on both of them,

44:01.240 --> 44:03.040
I hope at the same time.

44:03.040 --> 44:05.080
Sounds like in some cases,

44:05.080 --> 44:08.000
the cost of moving a lot of small files might be worth it.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.240
Almost never, I would say computationally.

44:10.240 --> 44:15.240
Computationally, it's very expensive.

44:16.880 --> 44:19.080
In terms of disk IO, it's very expensive.

44:19.080 --> 44:21.800
So I would try and steer clear from it.

44:21.800 --> 44:24.520
Maybe you could compress those into a single archive

44:24.520 --> 44:26.420
and sync just that one archive,

44:26.420 --> 44:28.520
lots of different ways to approach that.

44:29.400 --> 44:32.440
Gene Bean boosts in with 2000 sats.

44:32.440 --> 44:34.040
I really appreciate y'all putting the effort

44:34.040 --> 44:37.240
into running Synapse and promoting Matrix in general.

44:37.240 --> 44:38.680
I think it's got a lot of potential

44:38.680 --> 44:41.680
but needs the visibility and battle testing

44:41.680 --> 44:44.480
that us home users just can't provide.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.120
After you get the colony stable,

44:46.120 --> 44:48.280
I'd love to see a dig into bridges,

44:48.280 --> 44:50.480
especially double puppeting ones.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.460
A double puppeting bridge?

44:52.460 --> 44:53.300
Do you know what that is?

44:53.300 --> 44:54.360
I don't know what that is.

44:54.360 --> 44:55.720
Well, there's different classes of bridge

44:55.720 --> 44:57.080
based on how much control you can get

44:57.080 --> 44:58.240
on the different platforms, right?

44:58.240 --> 45:00.880
Because some platforms say let you like add input

45:00.880 --> 45:03.680
as if you're another user, but some platforms don't.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.380
Yeah, I think that is the kind of the game plan

45:06.380 --> 45:09.060
is get it stable and then once we get it stable,

45:09.060 --> 45:11.440
we wanna embed it on the live page,

45:11.440 --> 45:12.560
like in a read only mode maybe,

45:12.560 --> 45:13.580
so you don't even have to have an account,

45:13.580 --> 45:15.240
you can just see the chat on the live stream page

45:15.240 --> 45:17.040
on the jblab.tv page.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.440
And then once we got that figured out,

45:18.440 --> 45:19.640
I think it's bridging time.

45:19.640 --> 45:22.720
And I don't know how much bridging we're gonna do

45:22.720 --> 45:25.280
because the place where we run our IRC room

45:25.280 --> 45:27.580
kind of anti-bridge and like the Discord bridges

45:27.580 --> 45:29.800
are getting shut down and the Telegram bridges

45:29.800 --> 45:32.200
always kind of look like crap to me when I see them,

45:32.200 --> 45:33.400
for the most part, not always,

45:33.400 --> 45:36.020
but we'll experiment, you know what I'm saying?

45:36.020 --> 45:39.360
We'll take a look at it and we'll see where it goes.

45:39.360 --> 45:41.720
Gerald's mud, nope, that's not it,

45:41.720 --> 45:45.200
boosted in with 10,000 sats two days ago.

45:45.200 --> 45:47.040
He says, the saved podcasting message

45:47.040 --> 45:50.840
should have its own URL, an easy one to share,

45:50.840 --> 45:52.960
and maybe a different message depending on the audience.

45:52.960 --> 45:54.520
I'm not tired of hearing about it.

45:54.520 --> 45:55.680
And I really appreciated that

45:55.680 --> 45:57.720
because I did kind of, I got smack down a lot

45:57.720 --> 45:59.360
and I kind of stopped talking about it.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.480
I just sort of thought, well, I'll shut up for a bit,

46:01.480 --> 46:03.520
but I appreciate that.

46:03.520 --> 46:07.940
I have decided, you know, a bit of what needs to happen

46:07.940 --> 46:10.680
is there's sometimes content that we wanna share with you,

46:10.680 --> 46:13.260
me, wanna tell you,

46:13.260 --> 46:15.980
and I really don't have a lot of outlets for that,

46:15.980 --> 46:18.400
other than this show or another show.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.540
And so we end up stuffing stuff into the show

46:20.540 --> 46:23.120
that maybe we should talk about somewhere else, right?

46:23.120 --> 46:26.160
And so I'm gonna try creating essentially

46:26.160 --> 46:29.400
an audio version of a Jupiter newsletter.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.080
And I'm basically just gonna do

46:31.080 --> 46:34.240
a really low quality crappy podcast

46:34.240 --> 46:37.220
that nobody should listen to called office hours.hair.

46:37.220 --> 46:39.320
You go to office hours.hair to subscribe.

46:39.320 --> 46:41.440
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna read some boosts

46:41.440 --> 46:42.280
that don't make it on the air.

46:42.280 --> 46:44.680
I'm gonna read emails and cover questions and feedback

46:44.680 --> 46:45.700
that come in about the network.

46:45.700 --> 46:47.920
I'm gonna cover things that the network is working on.

46:47.920 --> 46:49.200
I'm gonna talk a little bit about my thoughts

46:49.200 --> 46:50.880
on the podcast industry.

46:50.880 --> 46:53.360
And right now I'm kind of thinking fortnightly,

46:53.360 --> 46:55.760
but I don't know.

46:55.760 --> 46:57.720
We'll see if you like it, office hours.hair,

46:57.720 --> 46:58.560
if you wanna check it out.

46:58.560 --> 47:01.920
And so some of the stuff that has ended up in the show,

47:01.920 --> 47:03.600
we'll have a new home there

47:03.600 --> 47:05.600
so we can keep the focus here on the show.

47:05.600 --> 47:07.280
And if this sounds like a crazy idea

47:07.280 --> 47:08.760
that's not gonna go anywhere,

47:08.760 --> 47:11.300
that is literally the premise I launched this show with,

47:11.300 --> 47:12.320
that we're doing right now.

47:12.320 --> 47:15.320
So it could go nowhere, it could turn into a thing.

47:15.320 --> 47:18.800
So go subscribe at officehours.hair slash subscribe.

47:18.800 --> 47:22.000
And I got an old episode that I just put in the feed

47:22.000 --> 47:23.240
because you gotta have something in the feed

47:23.240 --> 47:26.360
and I did an office hours like 200 years ago.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.380
And so that's in there, maybe a little bit less than that.

47:28.380 --> 47:31.080
And then I'm gonna do another one.

47:31.080 --> 47:32.960
And I think I'm gonna do them live.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.360
And when I do them, I think I'm gonna do them

47:34.360 --> 47:36.420
on Tuesdays at noon where we used to do LUP.

47:36.420 --> 47:37.760
So if you wanna come in the mumble room

47:37.760 --> 47:39.960
and give me feedback or ask me something,

47:39.960 --> 47:41.600
you know how you like to ask questions,

47:41.600 --> 47:43.640
you can come in there and ask your questions

47:43.640 --> 47:45.960
and I'll answer them.

47:45.960 --> 47:48.840
And I don't know, that's it.

47:48.840 --> 47:51.120
So that's gonna be a thing I do.

47:51.120 --> 47:53.960
Thanks for the encouragement, Gerald with your boosts.

47:53.960 --> 47:56.960
Officehours.hair soon.

47:56.960 --> 47:58.000
There's already one in the feed

47:58.000 --> 47:59.560
but you may have heard it before.

47:59.560 --> 48:02.200
I don't know, I don't know.

48:02.200 --> 48:05.440
The computer guy writes in with a thousand sats, thank you.

48:05.440 --> 48:07.220
I just got accepted into college

48:07.220 --> 48:09.520
and their email runs on Outlook.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.160
The IT department said on their website

48:11.160 --> 48:14.200
that Thunderbird, which is my favorite email client,

48:14.200 --> 48:15.400
was not supported.

48:15.400 --> 48:17.160
Furthermore, they said that Linux

48:17.160 --> 48:19.600
is also not officially supported.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.560
I managed to get Thunderbird working anyway

48:21.560 --> 48:23.720
and it looks like I'm gonna be at constant war

48:23.720 --> 48:27.560
with the IT department as one of the few Linux users.

48:27.560 --> 48:28.600
Any tips?

48:28.600 --> 48:31.940
Mm, I have been here.

48:31.940 --> 48:33.680
I have been here and a part of me wants to say don't do it,

48:33.680 --> 48:34.920
just don't even bother.

48:34.920 --> 48:36.360
But I'll tell you what you really gotta do.

48:36.360 --> 48:37.480
Here's what you gotta do.

48:37.480 --> 48:39.400
Stay the F off their radar.

48:39.400 --> 48:42.080
Don't ever let, you may have already tipped your hand

48:42.080 --> 48:45.480
too much, just stay off their radar as much as possible.

48:45.480 --> 48:46.960
Do everything low key.

48:46.960 --> 48:50.040
Find the holes in the system, use them to your advantage

48:50.040 --> 48:51.800
and just be patient because you're gonna be using

48:51.800 --> 48:53.680
the infrastructure in a way that they don't expect

48:53.680 --> 48:55.640
and so that could go sideways.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.720
And maybe consider just not doing it.

48:57.720 --> 49:01.480
But if that's already been considered and rejected,

49:01.480 --> 49:02.600
then stay off their radar.

49:02.600 --> 49:04.720
Yeah, you can do things like have a backup system

49:04.720 --> 49:06.920
if you need to, if you need to do it the official way

49:06.920 --> 49:08.280
and then yeah, as Chris said,

49:08.280 --> 49:10.520
be prepared to be your own support on this.

49:10.520 --> 49:12.000
It can be fun to figure out and make work

49:12.000 --> 49:13.640
and very satisfying when you do make it work.

49:13.640 --> 49:16.560
But you know, when grades are at hand

49:16.560 --> 49:18.920
and you don't need one more complication at 3 a.m.,

49:18.920 --> 49:20.480
sometimes it's nice to have a backup.

49:20.480 --> 49:24.520
And I will say web apps, web apps might be an allocator.

49:24.520 --> 49:25.340
Yeah, I agree.

49:25.340 --> 49:27.280
I think web apps are a lot better now.

49:27.280 --> 49:28.960
I do think a backup's not a bad idea.

49:28.960 --> 49:30.320
It could even be a VM, possibly.

49:30.320 --> 49:31.160
Yeah, indeed.

49:32.200 --> 49:33.640
This is how I started my dang career,

49:33.640 --> 49:36.940
like back in, I'm not even kidding, in the year 2000.

49:36.940 --> 49:40.780
And it was legitimately like me trying to figure out

49:40.780 --> 49:42.300
how to get email off an exchange server

49:42.300 --> 49:43.620
when the entire company used Outlook

49:43.620 --> 49:45.300
and I didn't want to run Windows.

49:45.300 --> 49:46.940
And I did all kinds of crazy things,

49:46.940 --> 49:49.180
including buying multiple editions of Xandros

49:49.180 --> 49:51.280
because it came with Crossover Office pre-licensed

49:51.280 --> 49:53.940
and you could put an Office install CD

49:53.940 --> 49:56.360
and it would auto run the installer and install Outlook.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.020
And that's what they made money on, right?

49:58.020 --> 49:59.820
This has been a problem that has been

49:59.820 --> 50:02.140
in the side of Linux users for a long time.

50:02.140 --> 50:03.420
It's way better now though,

50:03.420 --> 50:05.740
so I think you could probably pull it off, computer guy.

50:05.740 --> 50:09.180
You just gotta stay true and like Wes said,

50:09.180 --> 50:10.140
have that backup.

50:10.140 --> 50:11.900
I also feel for the IT department here

50:11.900 --> 50:15.140
and I don't think it's really their fault.

50:15.140 --> 50:16.540
I was in the same situation in college

50:16.540 --> 50:18.980
where being slightly contrarian,

50:18.980 --> 50:20.700
I may have tested some things.

50:20.700 --> 50:23.620
But for the IT department, you're one person

50:23.620 --> 50:27.900
compared to how many people that are running Windows and Mac.

50:27.900 --> 50:30.540
So they just don't want to, they don't have the time.

50:30.540 --> 50:32.220
Maybe they would love to have the time

50:32.220 --> 50:34.460
to help you and explore this, but they just don't have it.

50:34.460 --> 50:37.340
So I don't think it's really their fault.

50:37.340 --> 50:40.060
And so saying, you might be constantly at war

50:40.060 --> 50:41.860
with the IT department is maybe a little strong.

50:41.860 --> 50:44.420
I think maybe it's just that they just,

50:44.420 --> 50:46.420
they're encouraging you to take it into your own hands,

50:46.420 --> 50:47.260
really.

50:47.260 --> 50:49.860
It's only a problem if you make it a problem, really.

50:49.860 --> 50:51.380
True, true.

50:51.380 --> 50:52.500
Tiny also has a tip,

50:52.500 --> 50:54.220
something he could try besides Thunderbird.

50:54.220 --> 50:58.860
My work has very strict policies around the M365 products

50:58.860 --> 51:02.700
and the Evolution EWS plugin works really well.

51:02.700 --> 51:04.260
It even works with OAuth.

51:04.260 --> 51:06.900
So if they use Duo or some other form of MFA,

51:06.900 --> 51:08.180
it still works with that.

51:08.180 --> 51:09.020
That's a great tip.

51:09.020 --> 51:11.700
It's definitely worth giving Evolution a try.

51:11.700 --> 51:13.220
That was one of my go-to solutions

51:13.220 --> 51:14.980
and it still gets maintained.

51:14.980 --> 51:17.220
So that's a rarity.

51:17.220 --> 51:19.140
If you're out there with the new podcasting app

51:19.140 --> 51:21.620
and newpodcastapps.com that support Boost,

51:21.620 --> 51:23.260
send me a Boost and give us an update

51:23.260 --> 51:25.740
on your NixOS challenge, how that is going,

51:25.740 --> 51:27.900
and on any tricks or tips you have

51:27.900 --> 51:32.340
for working in an Outlook-heavy environment.

51:32.340 --> 51:33.620
We'll just put it that way.

51:33.620 --> 51:36.020
A newpodcastapps.com, get one that supports Boost

51:36.020 --> 51:36.940
and send it in.

51:39.020 --> 51:41.900
I found a cool tool I want to share with you guys.

51:41.900 --> 51:43.300
I brought this one to class today.

51:43.300 --> 51:45.740
It's called RSS Hub.

51:45.740 --> 51:47.220
I guess one way to wrap your head around this tool

51:47.220 --> 51:50.460
is think of YouTube DL, but for RSS feeds from websites.

51:50.460 --> 51:53.700
And what I mean is it's an open source, simple,

51:53.700 --> 51:56.660
easily extensible RSS generator

51:56.660 --> 52:00.060
that you can pretty much throw any kind of weird content at

52:00.060 --> 52:02.140
and it will build you an RSS feed for.

52:02.140 --> 52:04.540
Now with the caveat that it kind of has to know

52:04.540 --> 52:06.020
how to work with the data.

52:06.020 --> 52:10.300
So it has a huge wealth of websites,

52:10.300 --> 52:12.420
you know, probably more sites than something like a tool

52:12.420 --> 52:13.620
like YouTube DL even supports.

52:13.620 --> 52:15.500
I mean, hundreds and hundreds of websites,

52:15.500 --> 52:19.420
but also the tooling to create your own is just JavaScript

52:19.420 --> 52:21.100
and it's easily extensible.

52:21.100 --> 52:23.460
And you can also, the project is also willing

52:23.460 --> 52:24.740
to just build it for you

52:24.740 --> 52:27.820
if you give them a polite pull request.

52:27.820 --> 52:29.100
They've been known to do this.

52:29.100 --> 52:30.660
It's really simple to get running,

52:30.660 --> 52:32.260
especially if you do it inside Docker

52:32.260 --> 52:34.460
and the way you work with it, RSS hub,

52:34.460 --> 52:36.060
once you get it up and running,

52:36.060 --> 52:37.980
is you just throw it a URL

52:37.980 --> 52:39.580
of the thing you want an RSS feed for

52:39.580 --> 52:41.260
and it spits out the feed for you.

52:41.260 --> 52:43.500
And then you throw it in your feed reader of choice.

52:43.500 --> 52:46.060
They also work specifically with a mobile app

52:46.060 --> 52:48.100
that works together with RSS hub.

52:48.100 --> 52:50.540
It's slick if you're like me.

52:50.540 --> 52:53.220
And one of the ways I can,

52:53.220 --> 52:55.060
I'll sort of responsibly consume content.

52:55.060 --> 52:57.100
Maybe I'm not in like a head space

52:57.100 --> 52:59.500
where I wanna be on Reddit or social media,

52:59.500 --> 53:02.700
or I wanna sit down and really analyze the news.

53:02.700 --> 53:04.860
RSS feeds are just unbeatable.

53:04.860 --> 53:07.780
And the only limitation is some content out there

53:07.780 --> 53:09.380
isn't in an RSS feed.

53:09.380 --> 53:11.500
That's what RSS hub fixes.

53:11.500 --> 53:13.340
And of course it's open source.

53:13.340 --> 53:15.300
The only challenge you might run into

53:15.300 --> 53:17.060
is there is a bit of a language barrier.

53:17.060 --> 53:20.780
So, you know, some things you kind of have to do

53:20.780 --> 53:22.420
the translation in your head a little bit,

53:22.420 --> 53:25.380
but it's super simple to get up and running,

53:25.380 --> 53:27.500
uses Redis for the database backend

53:27.500 --> 53:29.140
and takes very little resources.

53:29.140 --> 53:30.260
Even when you run it.

53:30.260 --> 53:31.100
So it's great.

53:31.100 --> 53:33.580
RSS hub, go check it out.

53:33.580 --> 53:35.900
We'll have a link in the show notes.

53:35.900 --> 53:36.740
What do you think?

53:36.740 --> 53:37.580
Do you like it?

53:37.580 --> 53:38.420
Yeah, I can.

53:38.420 --> 53:39.260
Trying to impress you here.

53:39.260 --> 53:40.900
I'm already can think of like a million uses

53:40.900 --> 53:41.740
for this thing, so.

53:41.740 --> 53:42.580
I know.

53:42.580 --> 53:43.420
We gotta start playing.

53:43.420 --> 53:45.940
I'm wondering if we couldn't use it too, right?

53:45.940 --> 53:48.220
To like make mixed feeds and stuff like that.

53:48.220 --> 53:50.220
I mean, you gotta wonder.

53:50.220 --> 53:52.140
There could be some potential with this tooling.

53:52.140 --> 53:54.060
So I had to sneak it in today.

53:54.060 --> 53:55.340
It doesn't really fit, I suppose, with the theme.

53:55.340 --> 53:56.500
Now that I think about it,

53:56.500 --> 53:57.980
I've been trying to get these on theme.

53:57.980 --> 53:59.460
That doesn't really fit.

53:59.460 --> 54:01.060
It's good enough.

54:01.060 --> 54:04.180
Alex, Brent, thank you guys both for joining us from Raleigh.

54:04.180 --> 54:05.860
I'm sure it's beautiful and wonderful there.

54:05.860 --> 54:06.940
And you've got lots of projects

54:06.940 --> 54:08.100
you'll be working on this week.

54:08.100 --> 54:09.260
Yeah, it's always a pleasure.

54:09.260 --> 54:10.980
I gotta say, maybe part of the recording

54:10.980 --> 54:13.540
might be difficult because of all the birds singing

54:13.540 --> 54:15.060
and the sunshine over here.

54:15.060 --> 54:18.180
It's really, really, really, really, really nice.

54:18.180 --> 54:20.300
Well, you know, when the deer walk through, they shut up.

54:20.300 --> 54:21.940
It's hard to be angry about anything

54:21.940 --> 54:23.460
when it's 75 and sunny.

54:23.460 --> 54:24.620
Oh, you guys.

54:24.620 --> 54:26.540
But as far as projects go,

54:26.540 --> 54:30.340
we have an ever-extending list of temptations.

54:30.340 --> 54:32.580
So I don't think we'll run out of projects while I'm here.

54:32.580 --> 54:34.980
I love that you call them temptations.

54:34.980 --> 54:35.820
Yeah.

54:35.820 --> 54:37.380
I see them as ways to spend money.

54:37.380 --> 54:39.220
I've been showing off your server rack

54:39.220 --> 54:40.580
to people when they visit the studio.

54:40.580 --> 54:43.540
It's one of the requested items.

54:43.540 --> 54:45.500
I've gotten some feedback, too.

54:47.180 --> 54:49.940
Some people suggest maybe we should have used metal,

54:49.940 --> 54:52.460
but they thought maybe you should have

54:52.460 --> 54:54.060
welded something from scratch,

54:54.060 --> 54:56.140
but everybody has their own opinion.

54:56.140 --> 54:57.700
Should we get into welding this week, Brent?

54:57.700 --> 54:58.540
Should we do that?

54:58.540 --> 55:00.500
Yeah, Alex and I were just talking this week about

55:00.500 --> 55:02.060
maybe getting into welding.

55:02.060 --> 55:02.900
Come back.

55:02.900 --> 55:04.140
We'll weld a rack, you know,

55:04.140 --> 55:06.260
because we're gonna have the heat problem in the studio

55:06.260 --> 55:07.100
before we know it, too.

55:07.100 --> 55:08.900
So we're gonna have to weld some kind of solution,

55:08.900 --> 55:10.100
obviously.

55:10.100 --> 55:11.500
It's gonna have to be welded.

55:12.460 --> 55:14.300
All right, well, until then,

55:14.300 --> 55:16.020
why don't you join us live for a show, huh?

55:16.020 --> 55:16.900
Why don't you?

55:16.900 --> 55:18.940
We do this show every single Sunday

55:18.940 --> 55:22.460
at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern over at jblive.tv.

55:22.460 --> 55:24.060
If you are into the tech headlines,

55:24.060 --> 55:25.140
you're maybe in the industry,

55:25.140 --> 55:27.100
you wanna keep apprised of what's going on

55:27.100 --> 55:28.780
in Linux and free software,

55:28.780 --> 55:30.580
make sure you grab every single episode

55:30.580 --> 55:33.780
of Linux Action News at linuxactionnews.com.

55:33.780 --> 55:36.380
Lean, mean, news, just what you need to know.

55:36.380 --> 55:37.500
None of the fluff.

55:37.500 --> 55:38.660
We're not trying to waste your time.

55:38.660 --> 55:39.900
We know you're busy,

55:39.900 --> 55:41.260
but there's probably a few things going on

55:41.260 --> 55:43.060
you should probably know about.

55:43.060 --> 55:44.620
So that's Linux Action News in a nutshell.

55:44.620 --> 55:47.380
That's my pitch for it right there, linuxactionnews.com.

55:47.380 --> 55:48.660
See you next week.

55:48.660 --> 55:51.260
Same bad time, same bad station.

55:51.260 --> 55:52.100
All right.

55:52.100 --> 55:53.580
Links to what we talked about today,

55:53.580 --> 55:56.020
including the work on Fedora 37

55:56.020 --> 55:57.380
and future versions of Ubuntu

55:57.380 --> 55:59.260
and details about all of that,

55:59.260 --> 56:01.820
including extra deets about all of the releases,

56:01.820 --> 56:06.820
all that stuff at linuxunplugged.com slash four, five, four.

56:07.140 --> 56:08.420
We have it all there for you.

56:08.420 --> 56:11.420
You'll also find links to our feedback page,

56:11.420 --> 56:14.260
our subscribe page, all that stuff.

56:14.260 --> 56:15.260
Whole catalog there.

56:15.260 --> 56:16.660
It's like a website.

56:16.660 --> 56:17.500
It's great.

56:17.500 --> 56:19.060
You can use it anytime you want.

56:19.060 --> 56:20.980
Anyways, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

56:20.980 --> 56:22.420
of the Unplugged program.

56:22.420 --> 56:23.900
If you can't join us live,

56:23.900 --> 56:25.460
we're just grateful you listen.

56:25.460 --> 56:26.540
We appreciate that.

56:26.540 --> 56:28.540
And we'll see you whenever you want.

56:28.540 --> 56:53.540
We'll see you next week.

56:58.540 --> 57:06.100
All right.

57:06.100 --> 57:08.500
Go pick our title at jbtitles.com.

57:08.500 --> 57:10.860
What you can't see from here is how Brent spent

57:10.860 --> 57:13.060
the entire outro air drumming.

57:13.060 --> 57:14.900
Perfect time.

57:14.900 --> 57:15.900
It's in his blood now.

57:15.900 --> 57:18.020
Even the syncopations that Alex,

57:18.020 --> 57:19.540
you taught me that word last time I was here.

57:19.540 --> 57:20.860
Syncopations.

57:20.860 --> 57:21.700
I know.

57:21.700 --> 57:22.540
Look it up.

57:22.540 --> 57:23.900
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

57:23.900 --> 57:25.060
We got a title crisis here.

57:25.060 --> 57:27.860
This is a title crisis.

57:27.860 --> 57:29.900
I saw some pretty funny ones go by.

57:29.900 --> 57:30.740
Did you?

57:30.740 --> 57:32.980
Cause none of them say anything about distro being reviewed

57:32.980 --> 57:34.340
or a bun to or fedora.

57:34.340 --> 57:35.780
I said they were funny.

57:35.780 --> 57:37.500
I did not say they were on topic.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.420
We've got some good alliterative ones right here

57:39.420 --> 57:42.340
with double distro debate and double distro detail.

57:42.340 --> 57:43.180
I do like those.

57:43.180 --> 57:44.020
You're right.

57:44.020 --> 57:44.860
You're right.

57:44.860 --> 57:45.700
I do like those.

57:45.700 --> 57:46.860
Hey, I thought it might be kind of interesting

57:46.860 --> 57:51.260
to maybe itemize the tasks.

57:51.260 --> 57:52.380
What did I call them?

57:52.380 --> 57:54.740
Temptations that Alex and I might get into.

57:54.740 --> 57:55.620
Alex has an entire,

57:55.620 --> 57:56.940
Chris, did you see this when you were here?

57:56.940 --> 58:00.580
Alex has an entire drawer of electronic to do.

58:00.580 --> 58:01.780
It's a drawer, not a list.

58:01.780 --> 58:03.540
It's a drawer full of like.

58:03.540 --> 58:04.380
Oh sure.

58:04.380 --> 58:05.220
Yeah, I love that.

58:05.220 --> 58:07.700
Yeah, I've got a little crate that I store in the RV

58:07.700 --> 58:09.620
of like, oh, this is something I got to get to.

58:09.620 --> 58:10.740
All the crap that you bought

58:10.740 --> 58:12.220
and then it takes too long to get there

58:12.220 --> 58:14.220
and you think, why did I buy this again?

58:14.220 --> 58:16.660
Or you bought it and then like something comes up

58:16.660 --> 58:18.220
and like that's whatever came up,

58:18.220 --> 58:20.700
took my like my Saturday afternoon

58:20.700 --> 58:21.980
that I was going to work on that thing

58:21.980 --> 58:24.540
and then like no other windows ever opened up again.

58:24.540 --> 58:25.700
There's always something else to do.

58:25.700 --> 58:27.420
Speaking of windows that open up again,

58:27.420 --> 58:29.820
the skylight that we had in the bonus room last night,

58:29.820 --> 58:31.700
that was a pretty good segue, wasn't it?

58:31.700 --> 58:32.740
That was a great segue.

58:32.740 --> 58:34.660
We took a, I had in this drawer,

58:34.660 --> 58:38.020
I had an Acara Zigbee window sensor,

58:38.020 --> 58:39.740
like a little magnetic one.

58:39.740 --> 58:42.180
And so Brent and I put that on the skylight last night.

58:42.180 --> 58:44.020
What did you think of the pairing process

58:44.020 --> 58:44.900
with Home Assistant?

58:44.900 --> 58:47.620
I was like getting ready to sit down

58:47.620 --> 58:49.980
and absorb what the Home Assistant process

58:49.980 --> 58:50.820
was going to be for this

58:50.820 --> 58:52.900
and you were done before I even like got set up.

58:52.900 --> 58:55.340
So it was kind of amazing and really slick.

58:55.340 --> 58:58.300
From box to wall in what, eight minutes?

58:58.300 --> 59:00.020
I would say it was literally a five minute job,

59:00.020 --> 59:02.860
but it just reiterated to me like the progress we've made.

59:02.860 --> 59:03.940
If you think about Home Assistant

59:03.940 --> 59:06.220
and where it started way back when

59:06.220 --> 59:07.420
and where you are now Alex,

59:07.420 --> 59:09.460
I would imagine things are pretty slick.

59:09.460 --> 59:10.300
We've come a long way,

59:10.300 --> 59:12.380
but Chris is still going to be running Python 2

59:12.380 --> 59:13.220
in 10 years time.

59:13.220 --> 59:15.660
So, you know, we can do all the progress we want.

59:15.660 --> 59:18.020
It's too soon, it's too soon, it's raw stuff.

59:18.020 --> 59:33.780
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
