WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.560
I'm washing my I'm washing my Dell right now before I talk about I'm gonna talk about my XPS a little bit

00:05.560 --> 00:08.780
So I figured out washing your XPS. Yeah, cuz you know, it's touch. Yeah

00:08.840 --> 00:13.080
Well, you know what I mean? Like I've got I've got one of these. Yeah, you got to get the v8 off the screen

00:13.080 --> 00:18.320
First of all, so come out tonight. I'm watching my Dell. Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Sorry. I'll be busy watching my Dell tonight

00:19.240 --> 00:23.040
So but it's because it's got the touchscreen. I wanted to get my fingerprints off of it, right?

00:23.040 --> 00:30.080
Yeah, this that's the thing about touch screens that I don't quite get because I'd be reticent about actually touching the screen for putting

00:30.560 --> 00:33.360
Greasy fingerprints all over it. I I've sort of given it

00:36.520 --> 00:42.400
You know and the thing is is what I've been finding because this this XPS 13 is it's so light it is it is it is

00:42.400 --> 00:46.620
It is two pounds. I mean they talked about the new MacBook Air being crazy light the new MacBook with USB C

00:46.680 --> 00:49.980
Well, this has got a little more weight on it for a way more computer

00:49.980 --> 00:54.600
I mean, it's just ridiculous how light this thing is I literally thought Dell shipped this to me without a battery in it when I got

00:54.600 --> 00:57.800
It. Oh, seriously, it's that like usually batteries were all your weight is so I

00:58.680 --> 01:02.040
I usually end up sitting when I'm sitting on the couch. It's on my belly

01:03.520 --> 01:08.360
And I have my thumbs on the screen and I actually have been finding that I really like navigating

01:08.360 --> 01:13.020
I turns out turns out I don't mind using touchscreen to navigate the web

01:13.020 --> 01:16.500
I just also really like having a full desktop with like an i7 processor

01:16.500 --> 01:20.340
and like 512 gigabytes of storage so

01:20.680 --> 01:25.740
It's not that it's not that I don't but I also like having I also like browsing the web sort of with a tablet

01:25.740 --> 01:31.080
So from time to time, I'm just sort of on my and I and you know what like cuz I'm not a huge trackpad fan

01:31.340 --> 01:34.920
I'll talk more about the trackpad in the show, but I'm not a huge trackpad fan

01:35.500 --> 01:40.120
So nipples like me, maybe maybe I maybe I should try nipples more, you know

01:40.120 --> 01:43.820
I every now and I experiment with things like that and I find I like it a lot, but I

01:43.820 --> 01:45.820
Hey

01:46.380 --> 01:51.920
And you never go you're never going you're never like you never bring your hand down and touch that pad you never go

01:54.140 --> 01:57.640
My hands on the nipples all the time. Okay, so I

02:00.900 --> 02:03.420
Yeah, I know I know you guys are very hardcore about that

02:03.420 --> 02:06.500
So what I've been finding is when I want to avoid the trackpad

02:06.500 --> 02:10.900
I just been using the touchscreen and then track pads actually gotten pretty good. I'll talk about it more but I

02:10.900 --> 02:14.380
I didn't expect to actually find myself. I

02:15.260 --> 02:18.900
Thought I don't know. I I've been using I don't use touch a lot here in the studio

02:18.900 --> 02:23.460
I use it sometimes actually I use it just about every day and I thought that I don't know the more I have touched the

02:23.460 --> 02:25.160
more I end up finding myself

02:25.160 --> 02:28.460
Actually when I was doing a lot of couch surfing with a touchscreen Chromebook

02:28.460 --> 02:33.020
I really got used to it and it was actually more comfortable than reaching down for the trackpad

02:33.020 --> 02:38.460
Yeah to reach up from the keyboard and it made my hand my wrist feel a little bit better. Yeah interesting

02:38.460 --> 02:41.420
So I found that I found I found that to be interesting in the fact that

02:41.780 --> 02:45.340
It's one more thing that keeps me in Chrome because the touch support is a little bit better

02:50.580 --> 02:57.160
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's prepared for the first laptop of my son Dylan. That's right

02:57.540 --> 03:02.420
Happy birthday Dylan. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. It's all staged Matt

03:02.420 --> 03:04.500
I've got a I'll tell you more about it here just a second

03:04.500 --> 03:09.940
We've got a laptop ready for him to go with the Minecraft launcher in his dock all cued up

03:09.980 --> 03:15.540
He's gonna open up the laptop lid Minecraft be right there on the screen ready to go. It'll be his first experience to Linux

03:15.540 --> 03:17.980
It's gonna be glorious. Yeah, it'll be glorious. It'll be glorious and

03:18.940 --> 03:19.820
It's kind of cool

03:19.820 --> 03:20.420
You know

03:20.420 --> 03:22.420
I was I was trying to figure out if maybe I could

03:22.740 --> 03:28.040
Grab like a system 76 laptop and right it up for him or if I had like a machine here at the studio I could

03:28.040 --> 03:29.340
convert

03:29.340 --> 03:33.740
But with Linux fest coming up like all of our that's where all of our finances are sort of invest right now

03:33.740 --> 03:36.580
It's getting ready for Linux fest. I don't way I could afford a new laptop and

03:37.420 --> 03:40.860
Noah from the Linux action show said well, why don't you hang on to the wall?

03:40.860 --> 03:42.340
I actually asked him first he said yes, it's fine

03:42.340 --> 03:46.500
Why don't you hang on to that Sputnik XPS laptop that he'd send up for last year's Linux fest

03:46.500 --> 03:50.080
I'd have been hanging on to that I replaced with my XPS 13

03:50.420 --> 03:54.460
Recently and was you know when he came back up was gonna have him take that laptop back

03:54.460 --> 03:59.580
He said no, hold on to it. So I reloaded that Sputnik laptop with elementary OS and

03:59.580 --> 04:04.640
And I got minecraft ready to go load it up for him and we'll be giving that to him tonight

04:04.640 --> 04:07.120
It'll be his first Linux computer, which is crazy

04:07.480 --> 04:12.760
What is crazy about that is not only is this Dylan's first computer and it runs Linux, but then this weekend

04:13.040 --> 04:17.700
We're switching my wife Angela to Linux as well. So it's a big Linux week in the Fisher house

04:17.700 --> 04:18.680
Oh now one on it

04:18.680 --> 04:22.040
I've been working on Angela for nine years to get her to switch and she's she was like

04:22.040 --> 04:25.320
I think she was more committed to iPhoto than she was to me

04:25.320 --> 04:30.960
Oh, let's see for my wife. It's Photoshop. She's like, but can I but can I do this one thing?

04:30.960 --> 04:33.760
Can I do that one thing doesn't have that one support and it's like it's all about the photos

04:33.760 --> 04:39.120
Yeah, yeah for angers all about the photo management totally understandable to write. We have three kids, you know

04:39.120 --> 04:40.760
We've we have our wedding in there

04:40.760 --> 04:42.640
We have our construction of our house in there

04:42.640 --> 04:48.240
The construction of the studio is in there like she has a lot of really important events that we have in her iPhoto library

04:48.240 --> 04:49.840
It's about 500 gigs worth

04:49.840 --> 04:52.800
And so it there's not a lot of programs that handle that super well

04:52.800 --> 04:57.720
And she's got all the metadata and all the tags and all this stuff, but Apple has been

04:58.080 --> 05:01.640
Discontinued has discontinued iPhoto. So we're using it as an opportunity to move her to Linux

05:01.640 --> 05:04.520
So it's a really exciting week for me. We have a lot going on plus we have

05:04.920 --> 05:09.480
Folks from the JB team fly beginning to fly in this week. So that's really cool

05:09.480 --> 05:11.800
So there's a ton of stuff going on Matt, but nonetheless

05:11.800 --> 05:21.920
We are gathered here today with a pretty big Linux unplugged. So why don't we bring in our mumble room time-appropriate greetings mumble room

05:23.800 --> 05:26.360
Yo, hey, there's you know

05:26.360 --> 05:31.440
I've been I've been picking up some of the gaps of stuff that has developed between when Linux action show aired and when unplugged airs

05:31.440 --> 05:36.240
Which is unbelievable. There's like actual stories of developing what is feels like eight hours amount of time

05:36.240 --> 05:38.240
I know it's more than that. But to me it feels like it's eight hours

05:38.600 --> 05:40.520
And this was a big one

05:40.520 --> 05:43.200
Linux 4.0 has been sort of

05:43.760 --> 05:48.360
Released I guess. Yeah, Linus Torvalds whole approach on this whole thing. It's just so funny

05:48.360 --> 05:51.320
This would never fly with a commercial operating system

05:51.320 --> 05:55.760
It would have to be a big release have to be so much buzz and bang and and 4.0 comes out

05:55.760 --> 05:58.160
It's like that's kind of a release. So Linus starts

05:59.000 --> 06:01.840
So I decided to release 4.0 as per the normal schedule

06:01.920 --> 06:07.280
He has there really weren't any known issues and while I'll be traveling during the end of the upcoming week due to a college visit

06:07.280 --> 06:09.120
I'm hoping that won't affect the merge window very much

06:09.120 --> 06:15.080
Well, we'll see Linux 4.0 was pretty a small pretty much a small release in both Linux next and in the final size

06:15.760 --> 06:20.160
Although small is all relative. I suppose I then he goes on to give some stats

06:20.160 --> 06:22.640
He said that said there's a few interesting things about it

06:22.640 --> 06:26.000
He goes on to talk about a couple of them feature wise though. He says and I love this one

06:26.720 --> 06:28.960
4.0 doesn't have all that much special

06:29.920 --> 06:34.160
Much of the mate much has been made of the new kernel patching infrastructure, but realistically

06:34.760 --> 06:37.680
That not only wasn't the reason for the version number change

06:37.680 --> 06:44.160
We've had much bigger changes in other versions. This is very much a solid code progress release. So go out and enjoy it

06:44.680 --> 06:46.680
Linux 4.0 everybody

06:50.480 --> 06:52.560
Linus we're all sheep Torvalds it's signed

06:54.280 --> 06:58.040
All that hype minus the turtleneck, you know, it's a definitely pretty well done

06:58.040 --> 07:03.400
Yeah, very low-key very low-key very and now of course now I'm like, oh I'm gonna get it

07:03.400 --> 07:05.400
When do I get when am I gonna get it?

07:05.400 --> 07:09.160
Uh, yeah, I like I like that. He's like that that big patching thing

07:09.160 --> 07:12.600
Yeah, that's that's not even a big deal and everybody was kind of like, oh, you know

07:12.600 --> 07:15.560
They ought to take that patching feature is and spin it as the new version

07:15.560 --> 07:19.680
Like I've actually heard people say that they spin that for 4.0

07:19.680 --> 07:24.880
We should spin the kernel live patching thing is it and there have been some articles that actually ran over the weekend that did do

07:24.880 --> 07:35.860
Just that new Linux. In fact, in fact, I saw an article with the headline new Linux kernel 4.0 is the beginning of Skynet

07:35.860 --> 07:40.920
I'm gonna go see if I can find it right now kernel 4.0 Skynet. That was that should probably bring it up, right?

07:41.600 --> 07:46.640
Yeah, here we go. PC world. Yeah, here we go. Yeah, Skynet closer to existence

07:46.640 --> 07:51.520
Thanks to Linux kernel 4.0 and it has a big ominous tux with glowing blue eyes, right?

07:51.520 --> 07:55.800
So some of the press is having a pretty good time with the 4.0 release

07:55.800 --> 08:00.800
However, Linus himself not so excited about it just seems to be pretty meh

08:01.240 --> 08:04.140
Well, I like you know what I like about him is he has this priority straight

08:04.140 --> 08:07.320
It's like, you know really in the grand scheme of things. This is really a big thing for him

08:07.320 --> 08:11.720
It's like it's just another day at the office. He enjoys what he does. He provides value to people now

08:11.720 --> 08:16.520
He's moving on with his life. He's good. Yeah, I love it. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Shout out to our friends at

08:17.080 --> 08:19.080
hmm, let's see and

08:19.080 --> 08:21.080
tear girl and to grow

08:21.400 --> 08:22.840
Sina are

08:22.840 --> 08:25.320
Antiguerra and tear girls. Yeah and tear go so go with that

08:25.480 --> 08:30.280
They just released a new ISO and I've heard from a few folks in the community who've tried it out as you might expect

08:30.280 --> 08:34.080
It's based on arch. So it's got all the latest stuff including gnome 3.16

08:34.080 --> 08:39.960
If you want it really pretty straightforward way to get a semi close day vanilla arch install loaded

08:40.200 --> 08:45.480
Yeah, it's pretty good distro to go with I I've installed it on my recent rig that I had to reload and

08:45.480 --> 08:50.720
And it's been working great. And I also tried it on that XPS for a little bit. Yeah, go ahead

08:50.720 --> 08:54.120
I think that you know for anyone it's looking to try arch out first

08:54.120 --> 08:57.080
I think it's it's a great way to get up and run up and running quickly

08:57.080 --> 09:00.640
If you're if you're basically all about the pac-man and not so much about the configuration

09:00.640 --> 09:04.520
It's a it's really a smart way to go about that pac-man. Yeah, all about pac-man

09:04.520 --> 09:10.120
Hey, and then something else that didn't necessarily develop between now and last but we have wimpy here to talk about it with us

09:10.120 --> 09:12.720
Is this really great deal between at least I assume it's great

09:12.720 --> 09:19.400
I will ask wimpy between the Ubuntu Mate project and I think it's is it intro where wimpy the hardware manufacturer, right?

09:19.680 --> 09:26.640
That's correct. Yeah, so this looks like this if I'm understanding looks like a deal where essentially when I go to order an intro

09:26.640 --> 09:32.040
Where machine I it's not like at first I thought it was like one machine this has gonna have Ubuntu Mate on it

09:32.040 --> 09:34.440
But it's all of their machines will have it as an option. Is that correct?

09:34.960 --> 09:41.840
Yeah, all the laptops and desktop machines will have been tomato 1504 as an option

09:41.840 --> 09:47.680
When final release drops when so when when so this this will go live when 1504 is live

09:48.360 --> 09:52.660
That's right. Yeah, are you super excited or what? I mean this seems like a big deal to me

09:53.160 --> 09:58.320
Yeah, I am when when I got to sort of the end of 1410

09:58.320 --> 10:02.120
I thought it'd be really cool if you could find somebody to put you know

10:02.120 --> 10:09.760
Ubuntu Mate on computers because my family have got a lot of old computers and they need replacing and it's like, you know

10:09.760 --> 10:13.760
What would you get and now, you know intro where are based in the UK and you might have

10:14.440 --> 10:19.040
Been able to tell from my accent. I'm in the UK. That's that's handy. Yeah, I know

10:19.480 --> 10:26.640
So so yeah, this is a local computer manufacturer supporting Linux putting an operating system that I've had a hand in

10:27.200 --> 10:32.840
Developing. So yeah when my when my family are up for new computers, I know where I'll be going

10:32.840 --> 10:38.520
Yeah, so wait this whole deal is just so that your mom can get a new computer. Is that right?

10:39.080 --> 10:41.680
My wife and my dad and my father-in-law

10:43.240 --> 10:45.240
All about the family, yeah

10:45.760 --> 10:51.480
That was the origins of the project. So, you know, it's just stands to reason that is really neat with the family

10:51.480 --> 10:54.440
That is really neat. I didn't know I think this is probably the first

10:55.280 --> 11:01.840
Ubuntu flavor where there's been hardware available on the very first release that it's become an official flavor

11:01.840 --> 11:06.840
Surely interesting. Very cool. Yeah, I see they have a steam machine. So I

11:07.680 --> 11:12.160
Didn't realize that Matei wasn't yet actually an official flavor yet. They knew the current releases weren't official. I

11:12.640 --> 11:18.200
Will be by next Thursday. Okay. Yeah, so 1504 was the first official official version

11:18.200 --> 11:22.920
Yeah, now this now this is not available in the US or will be available in the US

11:23.440 --> 11:26.040
They're not shipping to the US at the moment

11:26.040 --> 11:33.640
So at the moment, this is only available in the UK and I've spoken to the guys from intro where and they're currently putting things

11:33.640 --> 11:39.200
In place to offer their products throughout Europe with the appropriate

11:39.960 --> 11:46.160
European keyboard options so I don't think you're gonna have intro where shipping in the US

11:46.680 --> 11:48.920
Anytime soon, but if you're in Europe

11:49.600 --> 11:56.000
You certainly will do and keep an eye on intro wares Twitter and Google plus feeds to find out more about that

11:56.000 --> 12:01.900
There'll be there'll be updates soon, but you know, you're spoilt for choice in the US, you know, you've got plenty of options

12:01.900 --> 12:03.900
Yeah, there were systems

12:03.960 --> 12:07.880
More than fair. I think penguin. Yep. Yeah more than fair and and this is great

12:07.880 --> 12:11.000
I mean this is this is great to have another vendor to recommend to the audience and

12:11.480 --> 12:13.160
I

12:13.160 --> 12:15.160
I just

12:15.920 --> 12:21.440
To give somebody a machine pre-loaded with Ubuntu Matei is gonna be so nice

12:21.440 --> 12:28.000
It's such a great option for people that want to come from Windows. They're not comfortable with a totally different environment

12:28.000 --> 12:32.920
They really like that paradigm that you know Matei lets them have I I think this is a great

12:32.920 --> 12:35.520
I think this is gonna be a lot more common and surprisingly

12:36.320 --> 12:40.640
Popey we didn't see that from elementary OS after their countdown ended did

12:41.800 --> 12:45.600
Yeah, I got that completely wrong. Didn't I? Well, I was all in with you. I thought it was great

12:45.600 --> 12:51.880
Yeah, Cassidy tagged us and said well nice try guys. It was good. It was fun to listen. Mm-hmm

12:51.880 --> 12:57.320
Hey, it's fine. You know what? It was it was actually a pretty good announcement on their part tip of the hat for them

12:57.320 --> 12:59.320
Putting out a good message. I thought they did a pretty good job

13:00.280 --> 13:07.440
Well, congratulations Wimpy on and you guys can find out more at intro ware.com entro ware.com and

13:08.240 --> 13:10.240
expect to see with Ubuntu Matei

13:10.560 --> 13:11.980
150 no four shifts

13:11.980 --> 13:18.120
Yeah, a couple of weeks that should be available and keep an eye on them because they've got they've got a couple of really interesting

13:18.880 --> 13:22.040
Announcement. I wish I could tell you what one of them is because it's so up your alley Chris

13:22.040 --> 13:25.520
It's untrue, but they've got a real interesting thing in the pipeline that um

13:26.200 --> 13:30.960
Is is yeah, that'll be the next time I think I have a feeling I'm gonna be begging you to

13:31.520 --> 13:33.520
To send me one. I'll be like

13:36.040 --> 13:38.320
Alright well cool keep us posted when that happens

13:38.320 --> 13:43.000
Do they have a newsletter where people that can want to like get the latest updates on what's going on?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I think they can subscribe to you. Yeah

13:46.360 --> 13:51.120
They've got the various social media outlets and they do have a traditional newsletter via email

13:51.120 --> 13:55.280
Which is low volume and they'll give you all the details there. Oh fantastic. Okay, cool

13:57.280 --> 13:58.840
Alright guys, well

13:58.840 --> 14:03.300
So I'm running that right here on this machine that I'm doing the visuals on this is my bonobo

14:03.300 --> 14:10.040
I've got a gnome 3.16 on this. I've got a machine upstairs. That is my reloaded anti-gross box

14:10.140 --> 14:12.140
that's running gnome 3.16 and

14:13.500 --> 14:16.940
Here in studio with me today. I've also brought in my new XPS 13

14:17.420 --> 14:23.620
Which is also running gnome 3.16 these are all machines that I use heavily every single day. These are my three main machines

14:24.140 --> 14:27.340
That's where I spend universally 100% of my computer time is

14:28.180 --> 14:30.340
Unless I'm editing video which is very very rare these days

14:30.340 --> 14:34.980
Is on gnome 3.16 and I've talked a lot about gnome 3.16 on the show

14:34.980 --> 14:37.940
I've just said it a hundred times and I haven't talked about some of the problems

14:37.940 --> 14:40.640
It's had and we got in a note on the subreddit

14:41.140 --> 14:47.420
From speed ghost about some of the issues. He's ran into with gnome 3.16 and the list is a bit extensive

14:48.300 --> 14:53.300
So since that's gonna take a couple of minutes to break down and say it seems like a pretty decent topic change

14:53.300 --> 14:56.480
I'll take a minute here and I'm gonna tell you a little about something that makes me feel

14:56.480 --> 15:00.920
Like a wild man like I'm on the frontier of a new technology, and that's my friends at ting

15:01.120 --> 15:09.360
Go to linux.ting.com linux.ting.com not only does that support the show and keeps us going which is you know a great idea

15:09.720 --> 15:14.240
But it actually gets a $25 discount off your first ting device and if you have a ting compatible device

15:14.240 --> 15:17.740
Which you probably do because they now support a wide range of GSM devices

15:17.740 --> 15:22.680
They'll give you $25 service credit, or if you get something like you know one of those my fi devices

15:22.680 --> 15:27.640
Then you get $25 a day to credit which will last you quite a while ting is mobile that makes sense

15:27.920 --> 15:32.200
No contract you only pay for what you use. It's a flat six dollars for the line

15:32.200 --> 15:33.960
That is ting right there in a nutshell

15:33.960 --> 15:38.320
they have a wide GSM network and CDMA network right here in the US of a a

15:38.560 --> 15:43.360
Brilliant dashboard to allow you to manage multiple devices. I pay six dollars. I got three phones

15:44.160 --> 15:45.920
Three phones I pay six dollars

15:45.920 --> 15:51.680
I feel like I'm some sort of crazy leolaport baller with all these phones, and I'm only paying six dollars for a line

15:51.680 --> 15:55.240
It's genius, and if you really are savvy you can save so much money

15:55.240 --> 16:00.120
You really can like my average bill for these three phones is below forty dollars

16:00.120 --> 16:07.040
And then like this month is probably this month and maybe a little in the next month are my busy times with Linux fest Northwest

16:07.040 --> 16:09.920
Where I'm making phone calls, and I'm downloading stuff on the road

16:09.920 --> 16:13.800
I'm driving with maps going and all this kind of stuff that is like my hyper

16:13.800 --> 16:18.520
Maybe I'm gonna hit 60 bucks. Maybe I don't know and actually it's kind of cool because the ting dashboard is really smart

16:18.520 --> 16:22.600
It'll say hey based on your previous usage and your current usage as your trends you can set alerts

16:22.600 --> 16:26.000
You can turn devices on and off so if you don't need to use them for a little while you don't got to pay

16:26.000 --> 16:30.540
That's great for like those my five devices, and they have no whole customer service at 1855 ting

16:31.120 --> 16:35.080
Ft dubs go check them out try out their savings calculator

16:35.560 --> 16:38.400
You know what I really find nice about ting too is

16:38.760 --> 16:43.760
The fact that they do have that customer service and as the GSM rollout is going there a little busy

16:43.760 --> 16:49.560
So I've never in more than two years that I've been using ting needed to call

16:50.880 --> 16:52.640
Seems like such a shame

16:52.640 --> 16:59.720
But the reality is their dashboard is so great their help system is so well done, and they have established communities on reddit

16:59.720 --> 17:03.000
There's a ting subreddit on YouTube on Twitter

17:03.000 --> 17:10.240
They have very active forums where there's people getting Firefox OS and Ubuntu touch running on the ting network like I've never needed to call

17:10.240 --> 17:11.000
in

17:11.000 --> 17:16.440
It's really nice so go to linux.ting.com get that discount that way you can start saving early

17:16.440 --> 17:21.720
And if you have a contract right now ting has an early termination relief program where they'll pay up to about I think

17:22.280 --> 17:28.080
25% of your termination fee that's pretty nice and then now you don't have to worry about you get to own your device from ting

17:28.080 --> 17:34.200
I've got the Nexus 5 on the ting network. They have a great range of devices. I think the Nexus 5 is really sweet

17:34.200 --> 17:38.700
I know it's getting harder and harder to find it now unfortunately, but it's just such a great phone

17:38.700 --> 17:42.860
And it works perfectly on the ting network on CDMA or GSM. I've ran it on both

17:42.860 --> 17:44.820
It's nine dollars to get a GSM card

17:44.820 --> 17:49.780
So if you've got something you could put GSM in it's nine dollars, and then you just pay for what you use get the Motorola

17:49.780 --> 17:51.980
G this is a great Android phone

17:53.420 --> 17:56.720
$91 no contract unlocked you own it

17:57.780 --> 18:01.220
$91 then you're on ting right and you're getting that $25 discount

18:01.220 --> 18:05.180
It's just crazy the Novotel MiFi 5580 hundred twenty one dollars

18:05.180 --> 18:09.860
Then it's a six dollar hotspot after that hundred one hundred twenty one dollars you own that and then it's a six dollar hotspot

18:09.860 --> 18:13.840
All right, you get the point. This is just great. Yes. They're a vibe hundred fifty nine dollars. They got the iPhone

18:14.580 --> 18:15.900
Go check it out

18:15.900 --> 18:20.700
Linux dot ting calm. This is a way better way to do mobile you have better things for your money

18:20.700 --> 18:24.940
I've saved over two thousand dollars. Oh, they're selling the Nexus 6 directly now. Oh,

18:27.020 --> 18:30.380
No Chris you know Chris has been wanting a new phone for Linux fest oh

18:30.380 --> 18:35.020
Oh, no Linux dot ting calm go get yourself something nice

18:35.020 --> 18:39.180
And then you know if you're like me you'll save about two thousand dollars in about two years

18:39.180 --> 18:44.120
And then when you're buying a laptop from that money, you're like. Oh, yeah, why did I why did I support that duopoly Linux?

18:44.620 --> 18:47.860
Ting calm thanks ting for sponsoring Linux unplug

18:48.580 --> 18:52.180
Stuff I wonder if anybody in the mumble room has had any problems with gnome 3.6

18:52.180 --> 18:56.640
Anybody in here had any issues other than like some of the obvious like you know maybe an extension doesn't work

18:56.640 --> 18:59.040
Nope just an extension. Yeah, it's okay

18:59.040 --> 19:04.160
So it's been really smooth for me on the three primary machines that I use it really smooth like the smoothest gnome upgrade

19:04.160 --> 19:05.120
I've ever done

19:05.120 --> 19:10.520
I do have one minor complaint, but it's extension related, and it's you know it'll it'll get worked out over time

19:10.520 --> 19:12.520
But it's unfortunately it's really annoying, but

19:13.520 --> 19:18.800
Speed ghosts is I have to say I'm surprised at all the gnome 3.16. Love when I've had nothing but problems

19:18.800 --> 19:20.600
I love gnome 3.14

19:20.600 --> 19:24.200
And I waited until all my extensions were up-to-date before I upgraded my arch laptop

19:24.200 --> 19:31.680
When I did here's what I found my home dot config folder was empty and all previous settings for gnome and a few other apps

19:31.680 --> 19:36.120
Were gone each time. I closed my laptop to hibernate or sleep it crashes

19:36.120 --> 19:41.800
It opens all programs and starts the sessions new when it resumes as if I just restarted the whole computer

19:42.800 --> 19:47.440
The temp directory which is four gigabytes for some reason is now usually half full on every startup

19:47.440 --> 19:51.840
I admit I'm on the bleeding edge with arch which is what my background is

19:51.840 --> 19:57.320
On the bleeding edge with arch which is what my backups are for as well as the stable dev machine that runs fedora

19:57.320 --> 19:59.320
Oh hold on a second

20:00.160 --> 20:05.000
That's rich, okay, stay did I hear you correctly and he said okay, that's cool

20:07.080 --> 20:10.820
I like that I like the idea that something lasts for nine months is stable or whatever it is

20:11.640 --> 20:16.600
All right, okay, so my dev machine that whatever it's fine. No floor is great. It's fedora super stable

20:16.680 --> 20:18.080
So my dad I love the door

20:18.080 --> 20:23.080
I really do the door my fedora machine my stable dev machine that runs for door. I'm just getting caught up on that

20:23.080 --> 20:27.320
I'm sorry my stable dev machine that runs for door where I get most of my real work done

20:27.320 --> 20:28.440
Okay, I just had to get past that

20:28.440 --> 20:32.800
I didn't have any of these issues with gnome 3.14 and consider this release a step back for me

20:32.880 --> 20:38.760
Things can look pretty all they want and they do look pretty but they break my workflow for prettiness then I'm unhappy

20:38.760 --> 20:43.520
I love gnome 3.14, but I've had nothing problem, but problems with gnome 3.16

20:44.080 --> 20:45.960
boom

20:45.960 --> 20:49.720
Hmm. I'm still getting over the floor thing. Um boy

20:51.600 --> 20:56.040
It's interesting because you know, obviously I've moved on to matei, you know, as far as my desktop experience

20:56.040 --> 20:58.880
But this is what's getting me Matt. This is what's getting me worked up

20:58.880 --> 21:01.520
This is this is getting into the butter of fest thing

21:01.520 --> 21:05.440
I don't want to jump the gun too much but what I really hate and I'm telling you I'm starting I'm dancing right now

21:05.440 --> 21:13.040
I'm so upset about this. I just I really I really really really really hate it when we just default to well, it's arch

21:13.040 --> 21:17.400
That's the problem, you know, if you weren't rolling now, here's the thing

21:17.400 --> 21:22.560
I think what that is is I think that is a bias that makes us jump to that conclusion

21:22.560 --> 21:28.040
Is it possible that it's because it's arch absolutely always possible because you're rolling software

21:28.400 --> 21:31.240
Absolutely every single time that is app certainly possible

21:31.240 --> 21:36.880
but I believe it is irresponsible and a disservice to jump to the conclusion that it is arch because

21:37.320 --> 21:42.380
Here's why I think we need to get past the bias that software is scary the developers

21:42.380 --> 21:48.060
Develop software that is scary and that all upgrades are bad because really that is not true

21:48.060 --> 21:54.100
Yes upgrades it always and inevitably eventually invite some regression, but on the whole

21:54.820 --> 21:59.760
Upgrades on open source are generally improvements stability improvements feature improvements

22:00.300 --> 22:06.820
Improvements and and most the time it doesn't break and this is from somebody who does have arch machines that are multiple years old

22:06.820 --> 22:12.500
Now right to well wait two more two years old. I don't know very old. I mean, I just I hate jumping to arch

22:12.500 --> 22:17.380
And the reason why this is I'm a little a little sensitive to it is not only did this post do it

22:17.380 --> 22:20.580
But I got like a bunch of emails that do it

22:20.580 --> 22:23.720
We have several threads that did it about the butter of s stuff last week

22:23.720 --> 22:29.820
And it's just the immediate jump reaction to let's blame arch. Well, okay, that's fine

22:29.820 --> 22:32.220
I suppose but it seems

22:32.220 --> 22:37.300
Lazy, it seems it seems intellectually dishonest to just always assume. That's the cause

22:38.060 --> 22:41.300
Well, it's so I think we take a step back and look at it from a practical point

22:41.300 --> 22:46.340
I've had this problem upgrading release to release so it's not that it's arch at all

22:46.860 --> 22:53.680
Any time you change off it is I mean you are choosing to enter an environment to where you're saying, okay

22:53.680 --> 22:58.900
I clearly am tracking the packages that I have and if I need to roll back I will if you're not able to do that

22:58.900 --> 23:00.980
Don't use it. I mean, yeah, that's I like

23:00.980 --> 23:05.940
Like zero lock here Matt zero lock sounds like he's my kind of masochist. You you love the updates zero lock

23:05.940 --> 23:10.340
You love them. I wake up first thing in the morning and I run an aphidist upgrade

23:10.340 --> 23:13.140
I'm on Debbie and Sid so I get my my nice rolling updates as well

23:13.140 --> 23:15.980
I used arch for nine months and updates for my crack

23:16.560 --> 23:18.140
They're great

23:18.140 --> 23:23.740
In the nine months that I was using arch. I only ever had one problem and it was because of a proprietary Nvidia driver

23:24.140 --> 23:26.140
yeah, yeah, I

23:26.140 --> 23:32.460
I also I I get a little bit of an endorphin squirt when I see a big list of updates

23:32.460 --> 23:35.380
And I also get a little like oh when it's only like three updates

23:35.380 --> 23:39.820
I'm like, but then I'm like, well, at least I got three updates because I really never want to run that

23:41.660 --> 23:46.060
That's how bad I am see it on the opposite now, it's like I I you know again

23:46.060 --> 23:49.660
I'm big on taking responsibility for your desktop if you broke it you bought it deal with it

23:49.660 --> 23:54.740
It's your fault. But at the same time it's like I don't necessarily want a lot of updates unless it's actually offering me

23:54.740 --> 23:58.260
Security or a feature, you know if it offers those two things cool blaster

23:58.260 --> 24:02.460
You agree with Matt like if I decide to run arts that I'm taking my life into my own hands, right?

24:02.860 --> 24:09.220
Yeah, I feel like if you're gonna be running arch or really any bleeding of this road that offers a bleeding edge

24:09.820 --> 24:13.660
Option then you're kind of taking your love into your own hands there when you run updates

24:14.380 --> 24:16.900
You're accepting the responsibility that something might break

24:16.900 --> 24:23.460
I mean I grant you that but I what I argue is the the level of risk that it actually genuinely is see

24:23.460 --> 24:28.380
My point is not that what you say is inaccurate. I grant you it is wholly accurate

24:28.380 --> 24:35.100
What I would like to argue is how much of a risk it it truly represents and wimpy you've had a workstation for how long?

24:36.020 --> 24:43.560
Three years now. My main workstation is installed three years ago. And so what is your what is your thought is rolling inherently?

24:44.140 --> 24:47.580
More dangerous and unstable but just yet manageable. How is it?

24:48.540 --> 24:51.780
No, I don't think rolling is inherently more dangerous

24:51.780 --> 24:57.320
I mean you've got someone there zero has got a sit installation and he's rolling with that

24:57.780 --> 25:04.740
You know software developers don't just throw out releases and hope it works, you know, they have been tested

25:04.740 --> 25:10.260
So it's not because it's a new package. It's untested software. It's already being tested, right?

25:10.260 --> 25:15.800
All that's happened is it's being packaged so you can install it conveniently, right? And it just happens a package faster in arch

25:16.460 --> 25:18.460
Yeah, yeah that that's

25:18.460 --> 25:23.100
Sort of one of the or other days he yeah. Yeah

25:23.100 --> 25:27.340
Well, you know if you look at me you just reckon but you know fedora rawhide for example

25:27.340 --> 25:30.360
They're they're pretty much on the same on the same curve as arch

25:30.420 --> 25:35.660
But I would actually I wouldn't compare arch and fedora in terms of rawhide in terms of stability though

25:36.200 --> 25:42.580
Because rawhide doesn't prom I mean there is some intention in fedora for the for the system to be stable, right?

25:42.580 --> 25:49.000
Where was with rawhide they will they will they sometimes have a work in progress that gets introduced into rawhide? Yeah

25:49.000 --> 25:52.240
Yeah, but the thing with arch is that

25:53.420 --> 25:58.060
Managing your updates in arch Linux is not simply a case of running pacman or pac a you are

25:59.140 --> 26:07.200
You're responsible for actually tracking what the new configuration changes were that were introduced by packages and then merging those and

26:07.200 --> 26:13.560
If you don't read the documentation that explains how to do that and you ignore it

26:14.180 --> 26:21.060
Eventually bad things will happen, but that's a contract that arch Linux makes with you at the outset

26:21.060 --> 26:21.440
You know

26:21.440 --> 26:27.960
They explain that you have to be a competent Linux user and you have to be prepared to learn how the system is put together

26:27.960 --> 26:30.060
And learned how to maintain it. I

26:30.060 --> 26:36.620
Agree and like Ryan says Ryan you you think that means arch right there if you accept that means it's not for everybody, right? I

26:37.900 --> 26:41.300
Agree. Yeah, I I don't think that arch is for everybody

26:42.020 --> 26:43.700
Yeah, absolutely

26:43.700 --> 26:50.500
Just because you can run arch and just because you can run the updates doesn't mean that I mean like wimpy said you have to

26:50.500 --> 26:51.820
Be tracking, you know

26:51.820 --> 26:58.540
what's changing and also be aware of what's already in your environment and if there's gonna be any breakage and that's why you know

26:58.540 --> 27:04.040
Distributions that are out there that aren't rolling release are good for some people because the peak

27:04.220 --> 27:08.420
That falls on someone else to test all these things and make sure that there's compatibility

27:08.420 --> 27:15.700
Yeah, I would argue though that we put too much faith in that and we put too little faith in the rolling system

27:15.700 --> 27:19.940
Like like neither one are as good as we pretend or as bad as we pretend them to be

27:22.500 --> 27:24.500
Yeah, yeah

27:24.500 --> 27:30.940
That stuff breaks under Ubuntu all the time and other distros as well sure

27:31.580 --> 27:38.660
nobody can anybody who's been using Linux for longer than a year knows that this stuff happens and and things break even when it

27:38.660 --> 27:41.740
Is curated by a distro, but yeah at the same time

27:42.820 --> 27:49.260
As we've talked about before as you talked about before there's there's a certain level of competency

27:49.620 --> 27:53.260
That you want someone to have before they start, you know curating their own

27:53.260 --> 27:58.580
you know arch Linux installation and that's you want then that person to be

27:58.740 --> 28:03.620
you know able to look at the changes that are coming through make sure that's going to work in their environment because I

28:03.860 --> 28:10.060
Have used 3.16 and on a rolling release distro and it worked just fine. So yeah, I you know

28:10.060 --> 28:10.500
Yes

28:10.500 --> 28:13.980
I think that it that person has to be ready to

28:14.460 --> 28:19.180
Troubleshoot problems that they have like he he described now. I like tech dragon tech dragons like no

28:19.180 --> 28:23.400
No roll all of the things so rolling for everything tech dragon all of the things

28:23.700 --> 28:26.300
No, if it's not my desktop, it's rolling. Oh

28:26.900 --> 28:32.780
So not all of them. I trust nine get nine terabytes of files to a rolling distro

28:33.780 --> 28:37.080
Yeah, I would be completely devastated if that went out of the way

28:38.660 --> 28:43.740
So you have pretty you you feel pretty confident I actually I don't blame you really too much

28:43.740 --> 28:49.580
It's a little risky for my file storage. I've been pretty happy with free now is right now just because I like ZFS quite a bit

28:49.580 --> 28:56.440
Oh, I'm on ZFS. Oh, okay. Well, there you go, but it's ZFS on Linux and rolling with current. Yeah. Yeah, which distro

28:57.220 --> 29:01.680
It's on a bunch of but I'm actually running it on the current upstream unstable packages

29:03.260 --> 29:05.780
Of course you are

29:05.780 --> 29:08.860
Because every morning brilliant yes

29:10.700 --> 29:12.020
Another way to look at it, too

29:12.020 --> 29:17.900
Is that when you're working with an operating system at the end of the day if your user data is at some level safe

29:17.900 --> 29:23.180
Whether it be backed up or off-site or you just feel comfortable in your home directory setup, you know

29:23.540 --> 29:27.580
Fixing anything is just a matter of time. Yeah, you know and it's really not the end of the world

29:28.020 --> 29:33.300
when we get to the to the follow-up on my file system loss, I will I

29:33.300 --> 29:40.140
Will follow up on some some interesting ideas the community has for some really nice efficient backups that are really like low-key not bit

29:40.140 --> 29:44.140
High-impact kind of stuff, right? So we'll cover those in a few minutes in the show

29:44.140 --> 29:46.660
I just had a couple more follow-up items before we get to that

29:46.860 --> 29:50.700
Because I do want to because that that that got up that generate a lot of feedback last week

29:50.740 --> 29:57.460
but we have I have seen a steady trickle of interest in the Dell XPS 13 continue now that the developer edition is out and

29:57.460 --> 30:04.740
I wanted to give thanks to slack warrior in the subreddit who mentioned that the BIOS update for the Dell XPS 13

30:04.740 --> 30:06.620
Which I have right here

30:06.620 --> 30:14.100
Does fix quite a few problems. I was having so now the current version as of this recording is the a03 or a 03

30:15.220 --> 30:20.340
BIOS and so for the Dell XPS 13 the one that came with Windows or the one that runs Linux

30:20.580 --> 30:26.100
Once you install that BIOS update one of the things that immediately starts working is sound

30:26.100 --> 30:30.300
So that's really nice. The sound card just started working instantly also issues

30:30.300 --> 30:33.740
I was having with the trackpad earlier are now pretty much all cleared up

30:33.740 --> 30:39.020
The trackpad seems to be one of the better trackpads. I've used under Linux two finger scrolling is working quite well

30:40.820 --> 30:45.980
The the touch-to-click works really well the laptop itself is now with these issues resolved

30:45.980 --> 30:52.260
I still have some problems with the DisplayPort but with these primary issues resolved the laptop itself is becoming one of my favorite computers

30:52.260 --> 30:56.060
It's now it's my I bring it with me all the time because it's super portable

30:56.300 --> 31:01.480
It's it's I think it's about as light as the MacBook the new MacBook with only the USB C connector

31:01.900 --> 31:05.620
But it's yeah, it's a lot better of a machine

31:06.420 --> 31:08.300
So now this is because it's so light

31:08.300 --> 31:13.260
I just toss it in my bag and I bring it with me all the time and I've been finding myself really enjoying it and

31:14.940 --> 31:17.740
There's just a few a few nagging issues with high DPI

31:17.740 --> 31:24.060
I wouldn't buy the laptop based on the screen, but the screen is quite nice and with the new BIOS update

31:24.060 --> 31:29.460
I would actually give the XPS 13 a pretty solid recommendation developer edition or the Windows edition

31:29.620 --> 31:32.860
I would go with the developer edition so that we don't have to mess with the Wi-Fi

31:33.180 --> 31:37.100
The webcams working the sound is working Wi-Fi is working

31:37.640 --> 31:40.500
It all seems to be working quite quick and the other nice thing

31:41.220 --> 31:42.580
Oh also keyboard

31:42.580 --> 31:46.660
I had some keyboard repeating issues that are now solved because the BIOS update and the other nice thing is

31:46.660 --> 31:50.200
You don't have to have Windows or DOS to update the BIOS

31:50.700 --> 31:57.480
You download an exe file a quote-unquote exe file from Dell's website. It's 2.4 pounds. Thank you micro 98

31:57.480 --> 32:01.060
So it is it's more heavy than the Macbook, but it's so great

32:01.820 --> 32:04.700
You download this quote-unquote exe file from the Dell website

32:04.700 --> 32:09.540
You put it on like a USB flash drive and then you boot and on the boot menu options

32:09.540 --> 32:15.300
There's an update BIOS option and it reads the flash drive and it just flashes the BIOS right there and no Windows or free DOS

32:15.300 --> 32:18.340
Or nothing needed to update the Dell BIOS. So that's really nice

32:20.260 --> 32:20.900
Let's see

32:20.900 --> 32:23.900
I guess I'll just give a quick Linux fest update just since we've been doing those

32:24.180 --> 32:29.780
And I'm gonna do it to lead to Linux fest here, which is almost almost here. So don't worry. Let's see

32:29.940 --> 32:33.540
One thing that's kind of cool. I'm not directly related to Linux fest

32:33.540 --> 32:39.140
But as the host arrive over the next week beginning on Friday and then trickling in after that

32:39.140 --> 32:44.020
I'm gonna try to snag some of them for tech talk today and maybe grab one or two of them to join us on Linux

32:44.020 --> 32:47.780
Unplugged next week if the timing works, I don't know. It might just be Noah who's in town

32:47.780 --> 32:53.460
Then I think Alan arrives on Wednesday, so I'll try to maybe get Alan on a tech talk today in the future

32:53.460 --> 32:56.220
Maybe we'll try to get Noah here in studio on unplugged to join us

32:56.220 --> 33:00.060
So as as hosts are arriving, I'll try to grab some of them and and bring them here

33:00.060 --> 33:02.140
We've got all kinds of stuff planning. Everybody's gonna

33:02.940 --> 33:07.020
Have some some time in studio to record something for their shows, which will be great

33:07.500 --> 33:11.860
We'll do Kota radio in studio. We'll do BSD now in studio all of that stuff, dude

33:11.860 --> 33:15.220
So we'll do two we're gonna shoot two tech snaps in studio

33:15.700 --> 33:19.540
So a lot of great content coming up with with everybody here in person

33:20.100 --> 33:24.300
Some for the first time ever and then it'll be ending at Linux fest Northwest

33:24.300 --> 33:27.580
So it's gonna be a pretty cool week lead up to Linux fest Northwest as well

33:28.060 --> 33:33.460
April 25th and 26 and we'll be live streaming that over JB live TV Saturday and Sunday

33:33.460 --> 33:39.120
We'll be recording the Linux action show there at Linux fest. So you're welcome to join us Sunday

33:39.120 --> 33:42.600
We'll have hopefully some seats for you to sit at last year

33:42.600 --> 33:44.880
We just kind of made do with what we had. So hopefully we can do that again

33:44.880 --> 33:51.080
Um, and and if you're gonna be there also, I encourage you to join our meetup. We now have let's see 130 it looks like

33:51.960 --> 33:56.240
Yes, 130 participants over at meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting

33:56.240 --> 33:59.360
The first event we have listed is a local and it is the local Linux fest

33:59.440 --> 34:04.760
The next event you might see on there will be another local event. That'll be Linux unplugged 100

34:04.760 --> 34:08.920
We're at episode 88 right now, and I think I want to do 100 on location

34:08.920 --> 34:13.400
So that'll be a local meetup event and I'm also opening this up to the individual hosts

34:13.400 --> 34:16.760
so I've offered it to Alan and Noah and

34:17.600 --> 34:22.440
Michael Dominic as they travel to go to their different meetups and different fests and different events and

34:22.640 --> 34:26.180
Mike's doing like a developer thing and he's gonna be traveling to New York

34:26.600 --> 34:30.480
I've invited them to use the meetup page as well to meet up with you in different locations and

34:30.480 --> 34:35.720
Alan goes all over the world. So that could be a pretty cool tool meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting

34:35.720 --> 34:37.960
If we have an event in your area be a great well great spot

34:37.960 --> 34:41.080
We'll be organizing it you'll see a lot of local stuff because I want to do more

34:41.080 --> 34:42.680
I want to do more out of the studio stuff

34:42.680 --> 34:47.840
but from time to time you'll definitely see stuff all over the world meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting if you want to get in

34:47.840 --> 34:49.840
on that and then

34:50.080 --> 34:52.960
We might eventually turn that into kind of like a lug thing

34:53.200 --> 34:57.280
where we take if we get it and what I would really like to do is if we got enough people joining us

34:57.280 --> 35:02.160
And we could take the really hardcore Linux user group and we could like do stuff for unplugged

35:02.800 --> 35:07.560
Record stuff for unplugged go when okay now here. Okay, let's just get crazy

35:07.800 --> 35:12.080
like what if we use this meetup group to like organize like a big like

35:12.560 --> 35:17.320
Install fest or something like we go to a lot like we like I would I would pre work out

35:17.480 --> 35:21.440
Like an arrangement like at a library like hey, can we come in and do all the maintenance on your computers?

35:21.440 --> 35:25.560
We'll blow them out. We'll clean them up. Well, you know fix the keyboards up. Well

35:25.560 --> 35:31.240
Maybe we could even set aside a little budget to replace some of the components and by the way, we'll install Linux and

35:32.160 --> 35:34.840
Then we just use this and we record the whole thing

35:34.840 --> 35:40.160
Hey, we go total reality show style where we're like we'll do like we'll have a room for confessionals with the camera

35:40.160 --> 35:43.280
Well people like they'll like they'll sit down in front of the camera be like yeah

35:43.280 --> 35:46.720
I wasn't sure how that install was gonna go when that drive started clicking it got really tense

35:46.760 --> 35:50.240
We weren't sure how that was gonna develop even though it was like already totally pre-done

35:50.240 --> 35:53.000
And we just have them go back and like record those confessional so we could cut to them

35:53.000 --> 35:57.760
I'm telling it sounds like I'm joking. I would totally do this if this meetup thing works out week

35:57.800 --> 35:59.480
Let's go use our powers for good

35:59.480 --> 36:06.240
Let's go install some Linux some places and record make sure if we could if we could seriously we could big brother this Linux installations

36:06.240 --> 36:12.320
We could go deploy Linux convert people to Linux and make show content out of it meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

36:12.320 --> 36:17.080
You think I'm kidding test me go sign up. Let's do some meetups and let's see if I do it cuz I'm serious

36:17.600 --> 36:19.000
Could be cool

36:19.000 --> 36:21.520
And even if you're not in the area, you can still sign up for when we are in your location

36:21.520 --> 36:28.200
Yeah, all right. This is well. Somebody's trigger-happy in the mumble room. Whoa there you knock you

36:30.120 --> 36:34.680
If I have to come in there I will do not make me turn this show around

36:40.320 --> 36:42.320
I'm glad you guys got the dad reference

36:43.400 --> 36:45.400
mumble room

36:45.400 --> 36:52.140
Mumble room. I will turn this show around. Hey Matt. All right. We're gonna talk about my

36:52.840 --> 36:55.320
MyRig blowing up. Oh boy. I

36:55.840 --> 37:01.120
Do this sometimes and I seem to do it the most on this show and I think it's just sort of the fleet free-flowing nature

37:01.120 --> 37:04.560
Of the show or and I just get on I just get going and last week

37:05.840 --> 37:11.040
You know, I was raw Matt. It was rough because my my main rig my my boo

37:11.040 --> 37:14.800
My bae, it's just such a stupid word it died

37:16.800 --> 37:23.360
Anyways, so I I mean what really happened is there was you know, when I kernel update in a butter fest thing

37:23.360 --> 37:28.240
There's a hard lock and what I I applied the NOAA philosophy was like, let's see

37:29.040 --> 37:35.640
Take me about five ten minutes to fix this and I've got this USB thumb drive with the latest anti-gross image on there

37:35.960 --> 37:40.080
I've been thinking about reloading anyways pop and I you know, I reload because I have all my data backed up

37:40.080 --> 37:41.440
It's not a big deal make sense

37:41.440 --> 37:46.560
It does suck some time up and it always sucks up more time than I think like every time I go to reload a machine

37:46.560 --> 37:48.560
I'm like, oh what this

37:51.040 --> 37:52.840
No, man, it always takes a whole day

37:52.840 --> 37:56.280
It always does every damn time and every time somebody tells you I can get it installed in 25 minutes

37:56.280 --> 37:59.760
That's lying because even once you get the software installed you got to change all the settings

37:59.760 --> 38:04.240
You got to change the themes. You got to change the everything. You just shut up. It takes more than 25 minutes

38:04.240 --> 38:07.500
So I I guess a little raw I came on the show

38:07.500 --> 38:10.520
I talked about how I kind of regretted using butter fs

38:10.520 --> 38:15.120
I wish I hadn't used butter fs and I kind of got up on a soapbox and I kind of said what I think

38:15.420 --> 38:20.040
Well, I still think this I kind of think that butter fs is an amateur show and I kind of think that butter fs

38:20.040 --> 38:24.720
Weakens Linux and I kind of think the butter fs is a shame and I kind of wish the butter fs was in a lot

38:24.720 --> 38:29.360
Better place so that way Linux had a much serious and much more competitive answer to ZFS

38:29.360 --> 38:31.840
I didn't mean to say it was the end of the world for Linux

38:31.840 --> 38:33.840
I didn't mean to say the butter fs was trash

38:33.840 --> 38:40.040
but of course of course I kind of did and of course I even said I'd rather use NTFS which

38:40.760 --> 38:47.040
Was straight up that was kind of a I thought about I should go clip myself because that really was straight-up trolling and that deserved

38:47.760 --> 38:51.320
Clip, but I just I'll admit to that. So I have some follow-up

38:51.320 --> 38:57.240
I have some thoughts on file systems and we hopefully heavens that will join us here in a moment

38:57.240 --> 39:00.280
And well, he is here. Hopefully he'll get into a good discussion with me on XFS

39:00.280 --> 39:06.560
I got ridiculed to no end no end for my choice of using XFS people assumed that I was a bozo

39:06.560 --> 39:10.080
I didn't know what the hell I was doing that I I picked up

39:10.080 --> 39:13.680
I picked some esoteric ancient file system and while

39:13.840 --> 39:19.920
Spitting on butter fs and condemning it for a future adoption by the open-source community because my words are going out over the air

39:20.320 --> 39:22.920
seriously, so we're gonna get into all of that and

39:23.560 --> 39:30.000
The lessons I learned from that but first I want to thank Linux Academy. Why because they're perfect for you, baby

39:30.000 --> 39:34.700
I know you Linux Academy knows you why because they're Linux users. They're open-source enthusiasts

39:34.700 --> 39:41.120
They're developers and they're educators and they came together and they created a truly unique thing Linux Academy and I get them

39:41.120 --> 39:47.780
I get their passion and I get coming together and making something better than anything. Anybody else has I get that because they're

39:48.040 --> 39:52.320
Enthusiastic about Linux and open-source. That means they produce content about Linux and open source

39:52.320 --> 39:58.560
It's far beyond anything anybody else produces and you can find out for yourself to go to Linux Academy comm slash unplug

39:58.560 --> 40:00.040
I could tell you what courses they have

40:00.040 --> 40:05.800
But I don't need to because anything that's relevant anything that makes you a better professional anything in the Linux space

40:05.800 --> 40:07.680
That's important. They have courseware on it

40:07.680 --> 40:13.400
They have seven plus Linux distributions you can choose from and I'm saying if you want to go learn how to use Docker on Red Hat

40:13.400 --> 40:17.240
Enterprise server go do it. You need to know how to use it on Ubuntu go do that

40:17.240 --> 40:21.000
They can do that those spin up servers for you on demand when the courseware requires it

40:21.000 --> 40:23.740
They'll give you a public access you get to SSH into that bad boy

40:23.740 --> 40:26.040
And if you take advantage of some of their AWS courseware

40:26.040 --> 40:29.800
which a few folks in our chat room have been I've been hearing from a few folks recently seems like the

40:29.800 --> 40:33.200
AWS stuff just keeps growing and growing and growing and so people need to learn it

40:33.200 --> 40:37.760
It's very relevant. And so their courseware on this stuff is top-notch and the other thing

40:38.360 --> 40:43.800
That I love as somebody who had to jump into AWS when it was fairly new. I got bit big time

40:43.800 --> 40:48.360
I had a $200 bill just because I left my rig my AWS rig that I was using for training

40:48.640 --> 40:54.520
It was 230 something 280 something. I got a big bill because I just left it on I left it on

40:54.520 --> 41:00.680
Well, they include the AWS or instances as part as your part of your Linux Academy's training

41:00.680 --> 41:05.720
You just go over to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged get our super awesome 33% discount 33%

41:06.280 --> 41:09.980
It's a powerful number and you should go over then get more powerful by making yourself more valuable

41:10.920 --> 41:18.200
Seriously, it's very rewarding and it's sort of mind-blowing when something you've known like a technology that you've wanted to wrap your head around

41:18.280 --> 41:23.240
But it has seemed so nebulous where to start when you go to Linux Academy and they have it broken out for you

41:23.240 --> 41:26.400
You will learn this part about this technology in this many minutes

41:27.160 --> 41:30.460
for me that is a game-changer because that is a

41:31.000 --> 41:37.680
Quantifiable boom that I get that it's no longer nebulous. Boom. I what five and a half hours for Ruby. No problem

41:37.680 --> 41:42.840
I get that I can spend five and a half hours to learn Ruby that seems worth it to me and with their scenario based labs

41:42.840 --> 41:49.600
You'll actually get how to use these technologies in a production environment. And that's the final gap right there. They close it Linux Academy

41:49.600 --> 41:55.240
Comm slash unplugged. They got a huge announcement coming up in just a couple of days April 16th 9 p.m

41:55.240 --> 41:59.600
Central I've been telling you about this for a while because it's a big deal and I'm really excited and these guys are super passionate

41:59.600 --> 42:01.560
About it too. So that's that's gonna be great

42:01.560 --> 42:06.440
They're gonna stream it live over at Linux Academy comm go sign up now and you just get all of the new stuff and you always

42:06.440 --> 42:13.160
Will as part of your Linux Academy subscription Linux Academy comm slash unplugged keep this show on the air train yourself up and

42:13.160 --> 42:21.320
Go support one of our local Linux friends Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

42:21.840 --> 42:23.840
You guys are crushing it

42:23.880 --> 42:31.280
So for those of you who didn't catch last week's episode super super quick version is my number one rig died my baby

42:31.680 --> 42:36.400
It gave up the ghost couldn't mount my main partition couldn't boot and there were several options

42:36.400 --> 42:38.600
I could have had including, you know use a live CD

42:38.600 --> 42:44.640
Try the fallback kernel have file system snapshots. I mean, there's like a lot of different tracks

42:44.640 --> 42:50.520
I could have taken I opted for the nuke and pave and I and part of the reason was is I was done with butter

42:50.520 --> 42:57.880
FS is this directly caused by butter FS? Mm-hmm. It wouldn't have happened if I wasn't using butter FS ergo for an end-user

42:59.040 --> 43:03.400
Yes, right. It doesn't really matter. Technically. Was it a kernel bug working with butter?

43:03.400 --> 43:09.360
FS was it a problem with butter FS at the end of the day if I wasn't using butter FS, I wouldn't have a problem

43:09.360 --> 43:12.080
Right and for users, that's all that matters. So in my opinion

43:12.840 --> 43:15.760
Probably means it's time to stop using butter FS on computers

43:15.760 --> 43:20.000
They're important to me and what I found to be interesting is the number one piece of feedback

43:20.000 --> 43:24.420
I got wasn't that I was using butter fs as well. God damn it Chris. You're using arch you idiot

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
You're using arch

43:27.320 --> 43:29.320
Well, that's your problem

43:29.320 --> 43:34.960
Well, see I kind of disagree see I kind of think that this is yet another example of how butter fs

43:34.960 --> 43:40.480
just isn't really fully baked into Linux, but people came to butter fs as defense and

43:41.960 --> 43:43.960
We had a we had a whopper of one

43:44.080 --> 43:48.140
Sent in to the subreddit and I liked the title quite a bit the title grabbed me

43:48.140 --> 43:50.140
I wasn't so hot on the content of the post

43:50.280 --> 43:53.180
But he has a good point here and there so I want to address it

43:53.280 --> 43:59.000
Why I think butter fs remains the future for those who want it and this is you know

43:59.000 --> 44:05.520
And this is why I wanted to use butter fs2 because I felt like Linux really it needs a solid solution here

44:05.520 --> 44:09.320
It needs a pretty advanced file system that can stay competitive

44:09.320 --> 44:13.360
It needs something that also allows us to do things

44:13.360 --> 44:19.400
We just don't do today like we have heard some discussions about actually using butter fs to distribute software

44:20.200 --> 44:24.760
Like there's a lot of really cool possibilities when your file system is modern and awesome

44:24.760 --> 44:29.280
And I'm going to talk about how PCB SD leverages some of those in a minute

44:29.840 --> 44:31.640
But back to butter fs

44:31.640 --> 44:37.240
These kinds of features are kind of fundamentally required like a lot of people came back and said you don't need these things

44:38.760 --> 44:44.880
That's not your choice to make I think the market says we do need these things and I want these things as well

44:44.880 --> 44:50.000
And so Corky writes here Chris on the latest episode of Linux unplug took the time to vent his latest frustrations

44:50.000 --> 44:56.200
the issue in question is a bug that causes arch not to boot on kernel 3 dot 19 dot 1 dash 3 and

44:57.120 --> 45:03.200
18 dot 9 and 3 dot 14 dot 35 so a decent range and at quite a few others have experiences on arch and butter fs

45:03.680 --> 45:07.120
Setups my frustration is not that he blamed it on butter fs

45:07.120 --> 45:10.960
This is a standard bug you expect in some kernel ver my frustration is not that he had it

45:10.960 --> 45:14.360
But that he did blame it on butter fs and this was a common thread and again

45:14.360 --> 45:16.200
I feel like this is a bit of a nuance here

45:16.200 --> 45:21.840
He says this was a standard bug you would expect in some kernel versions and it's quite common for kernel upgrade to cause a set

45:21.840 --> 45:24.080
Of users to have unbootable set of systems

45:24.080 --> 45:27.920
That is the nature of Linux development and it is true the nature of arch

45:28.120 --> 45:34.600
These Linux kernel versions will not be released on Ubuntu open source of Fedora and will never reach Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Debian

45:34.720 --> 45:40.140
Linux LTS releases are chosen because every other kernel version seems to destroy a particular set of users experiences

45:40.140 --> 45:44.720
I'm actually gonna stop there. That's a pretty common argument and it's really not true

45:44.720 --> 45:52.520
Big big gotchas. There's a pretty good chance. They won't make it into some of those kernels, but kernel 3.13 is a shit show and

45:53.880 --> 45:58.840
There is a pretty major distribution that a couple of them that ship the ship with kernel 3.13

45:59.320 --> 46:04.640
So it is not necessarily true that vendors won't ship a bad kernel

46:04.720 --> 46:08.760
Because they do and then what ends up happening is you get anchored to that piece of crap

46:08.840 --> 46:13.720
For the length of that distro or you go outside the box and end up replacing which a lot of people do and that's not

46:13.720 --> 46:17.680
Much better of a situation and then you run up exactly in the same situation. I ran into

46:19.840 --> 46:24.360
So he goes on to say arch Linux is an insane distribution because it lacks sanity checks other

46:24.520 --> 46:32.360
Distributions are same because they have a team of people who are fixing these breakages in stable packages not development experimental technologies

46:32.360 --> 46:34.360
I get I kind of disagree there as well

46:35.080 --> 46:38.200
Some do some don't it's kind of a wide range, right?

46:38.200 --> 46:44.160
Well, and I think part of the problem too is a lot of times when people see breakage 99.9% of the time

46:44.160 --> 46:49.040
it's because you went outside of the box and if you're in a boon to person that'd be a PPA and if you are an

46:49.040 --> 46:54.120
Arch person that's because you actually went with the arch user repository. That is not official arch

46:54.120 --> 46:58.800
That is you decided to try something creative and that's cool, but you're kind of on your own there

46:58.800 --> 47:03.160
And so a lot of times I think that people when people experience breakage on arch that's usually where it happens

47:03.160 --> 47:08.840
And that's user error. Here's what I'm kind of coming to though. It's good because I think fundamentally Corky and others

47:08.840 --> 47:11.160
Do have a bit of a point and that point is

47:11.800 --> 47:15.640
Maybe it is true that if you are going to use a rolling release

47:16.360 --> 47:22.440
You have to kind of settle on a subset of technologies to utilize that are like sort of tried-and-true

47:23.160 --> 47:24.520
technologies

47:24.520 --> 47:27.240
That maybe don't have as much fluctuation

47:27.880 --> 47:31.560
And this is something I've been this is something I haven't fully fully formed yet

47:31.560 --> 47:34.440
But it seems to me like I something I've kind of been I

47:35.080 --> 47:39.560
Kind of have been falling into like for example when it comes to servers

47:39.560 --> 47:41.960
And if I want so if I want something to be server

47:41.960 --> 47:43.640
But I want to be a rolling distro

47:43.640 --> 47:48.120
I'll sort of keep it really lean like it only do a couple of things and I just spin up another VM and then it

47:48.120 --> 47:52.520
Only does a couple of things and then I spin up another VM that way I don't have a bunch of bunch of packages on a

47:52.520 --> 47:54.280
Rolling server right and that's one way

47:54.280 --> 47:59.880
I sort of mitigate the risk on servers and I can individually snapshot those before I upgrade this and this is great for digital

47:59.880 --> 48:01.880
And this is great for digital ocean. This is that's

48:02.440 --> 48:03.640
This is how I do it now

48:03.640 --> 48:09.640
um, and and the same and and and the same is not really necessarily true, uh, uh for for your desktop, but

48:10.680 --> 48:13.320
I I essentially have found that if I kind of do

48:14.200 --> 48:20.200
More common file systems if I do more common things like uh, maybe instead of using kde on a rolling release

48:20.600 --> 48:23.400
I go with gnome or go with xfce or mate

48:23.880 --> 48:28.920
Uh, and maybe if you know these kinds of like maybe if instead of using butterfs I use extended 4 or xfs

48:28.920 --> 48:33.240
then I sort of reduce my amount of risk and so I find myself sort of

48:33.640 --> 48:39.160
Narrowing my choices in what I will fully take advantage of if there might be some additional risk

48:39.320 --> 48:43.800
But at the same time the choices I find myself landing on are pretty solid

48:44.040 --> 48:49.080
So I want to take a moment here and and and and bring heaven's revenge in because he's my xfs buddy

48:49.160 --> 48:53.560
And I really wanted him here last week when I was talking about xfs because heaven you were the one that really sold me on

48:53.560 --> 48:59.400
Xfs originally and so I could you do you want to just take a moment and sort of break down in your mind?

48:59.640 --> 49:03.320
Butterfs versus xfs and why maybe one might be a better choice over the other

49:05.240 --> 49:07.400
If you have that sure, but it will also

49:08.200 --> 49:10.680
oh, yeah, I generally do but the

49:11.320 --> 49:15.560
point that you brought up a little bit earlier about arch and being a rolling distribution and having

49:15.560 --> 49:22.440
The whole problem be arch and having it just the nature of being rolling that is

49:23.160 --> 49:27.740
Approaching this problem from the wrong perspective because butterfs

49:28.440 --> 49:36.840
Is an experimental file system. It's blaming arch for a problem that butterfs has specifically tried to

49:37.480 --> 49:43.240
Over advertise itself. It says it's a stable file system. They tried to market like that

49:43.240 --> 49:45.240
I think a year ago

49:45.320 --> 49:48.120
Stable or a stability of a file system is simple

49:48.520 --> 49:54.760
No on disk or no incompatible on disk format changes if a file system is

49:55.240 --> 49:58.920
On like if it's stable or the on disk format is stable

49:59.560 --> 50:03.720
That is a stable file system. Otherwise, it is not the butterfs

50:04.200 --> 50:11.560
Developers have claimed it to be stable while it is not it is still in flux. So your problem is from butterfs not

50:11.560 --> 50:16.680
By virtue of it being a rolling distribution. Yeah, this is an interesting point. In fact, what they say is yeah

50:16.680 --> 50:22.280
We may very well have format changes, but we'll try to make sure that newer kernels can still mount the old stuff

50:24.440 --> 50:26.760
Yeah, they try but there's always

50:27.560 --> 50:33.640
Corner cases that kick everybody in the ass all the time the most I noticed even open suzes

50:34.360 --> 50:39.400
They try to say that it's stable and let's say for the most cases for the most

50:39.400 --> 50:42.200
most cases for the most common and

50:43.160 --> 50:46.360
No are not complex situations if it's just pretty much

50:47.560 --> 50:54.360
Putting files on the disk. You should be okay if you're trying to do anything relatively new with the distribution or with the

50:55.540 --> 50:58.120
Capabilities of butterfs you will run into something

50:59.240 --> 51:03.720
So would you uh have anything there or shall I go into the xfs and butterfs? Yeah

51:03.800 --> 51:08.440
Yeah, continue on because I think that's a that's a that's a that's a good a good point

51:08.440 --> 51:13.160
Uh, well, actually i'll let the person finish up vacuuming behind you and i'll let quirky respond to his uh,

51:13.240 --> 51:18.440
His subreddit post and then we'll transition into the discussion of xfs and butterfs and I hope this isn't too dry

51:18.600 --> 51:21.000
But the reason why I want to really hash this stuff out with you guys

51:21.240 --> 51:24.360
Is because I get this question a lot like which file system should I use?

51:24.520 --> 51:26.520
And then when I say which file system i'm using

51:26.760 --> 51:31.320
I find out that a lot of people out there go and deploy that and I didn't know like sometimes when I announce what i'm

51:31.400 --> 51:33.960
Using I didn't really realize that then people will also use that same one

51:34.120 --> 51:36.120
So I just really kind of want to make sure we discuss this

51:36.120 --> 51:40.040
Um and and really talk about the advantages disadvantages because I think it's pretty important

51:40.360 --> 51:44.360
And and and I do admit that sometimes my sysadmin bias sort of gets in the way

51:44.360 --> 51:48.600
But quirky, uh, you want to touch on anything I mentioned from your your subreddit post?

51:49.640 --> 51:51.640
Yeah, my subreddit post was

51:52.040 --> 51:53.000
well

51:53.000 --> 51:57.560
Um in development, it's not a professional view because i'm not a developer

51:57.960 --> 52:02.120
But i'm i'd agree with some of heaven's revenge's points. Um

52:03.080 --> 52:04.680
I have to say

52:04.680 --> 52:11.160
But fs definitely has been getting better as someone who's been subscribed to mailing lists

52:11.560 --> 52:16.920
Has been following their gotchas wiki. One of the great things about wikis is you can look through the history

52:17.320 --> 52:19.320
And if you look through the history

52:19.480 --> 52:24.280
It's gone from nearly two pages long in recent years to

52:24.840 --> 52:29.800
Well less than a paragraph now it yeah, it's not done and i'm not

52:29.800 --> 52:35.420
Not particularly happy that they use that word stable to try and get media attention

52:36.220 --> 52:38.220
But it's definitely a lot better

52:39.180 --> 52:40.860
so, um

52:40.860 --> 52:41.820
uh

52:41.820 --> 52:46.700
Alan has a great quote and I don't i'm gonna butcher it and I I don't know exactly how it goes

52:47.260 --> 52:49.260
but uh, alan says that uh

52:50.220 --> 52:51.180
that uh

52:51.180 --> 52:55.980
That trusting the butter of fs is going to get better one day is like trusting the serial murder is going to stop killing

52:55.980 --> 53:01.260
people one day and the reason why he says that is when they shipped a zfs it was

53:02.220 --> 53:08.620
That was done. It the format was stable when they shipped it. It was it was baked and and it has it has always

53:09.500 --> 53:14.220
Yes, exactly. It has always been considered stable since then and then they build on top of it with feature flags

53:14.620 --> 53:19.820
It was from day one. They considered it production grade and the and and that is

53:20.460 --> 53:23.020
And honestly when they said that I was like, yeah screw you guys

53:23.020 --> 53:27.580
No file system is production grade until it's been out for a while and it has it has had some growing pains

53:27.740 --> 53:31.500
But it is now, you know widely considered just sort of like, you know

53:32.140 --> 53:34.940
the master race file system and so, uh, uh

53:36.220 --> 53:39.740
That is a fundamental approach to zfs

53:40.380 --> 53:43.900
That I guess it just seems like butter fs is like a top-down approach like

53:44.460 --> 53:48.940
All this great stuff and then make it stable. Whereas zfs is like make it stable first then add all the great stuff

53:48.940 --> 53:52.940
And I think that's that's a big difference but heavens now I wanted it's probably good

53:52.940 --> 53:56.060
Then this is probably a good time to start talking about xfs and butter fs. So heavens. Why don't you take it back?

53:58.700 --> 54:00.700
Okay, well ever since

54:01.400 --> 54:07.420
Approximately 2008. I've been using xfs on everything that I can use it for it is all

54:07.880 --> 54:12.540
Desktop or external drive usages. It is not let's say corporate

54:13.340 --> 54:15.260
business usage, but

54:15.260 --> 54:20.380
Don't let that turn you down because nasa and pretty much every large government agency

54:20.700 --> 54:25.340
Probably uses xfs for their mass storage systems as it does. Yeah, it is awesome

54:26.300 --> 54:28.720
Oh, yeah, because sgi the sgi

54:29.660 --> 54:33.260
master blades like super big iron servers

54:33.980 --> 54:40.940
That's xfs. So it has a long history back from irix or irix way back in the freaking 1980s days

54:41.980 --> 54:43.980
and

54:43.980 --> 54:45.980
I've never found a problem with it

54:46.300 --> 54:52.140
They used to say that it used to lose data, but I have never seen that personally and it is

54:53.100 --> 54:54.380
let's say

54:54.380 --> 54:56.380
an incorrect assumption to

54:57.100 --> 55:00.940
assume that it is based on its past problems that's basically

55:02.620 --> 55:07.180
There's not really a file system that doesn't have some growing pains all file systems is essentially have

55:07.180 --> 55:13.420
Some issues like little problems zfs has as well. I have been using I have used xfs since it was

55:14.620 --> 55:16.620
Almost since it was originally ported to linux

55:16.860 --> 55:20.780
And the reason why and I did this under opal susa or actually at the time it was susa enterprise

55:21.020 --> 55:21.260
uh

55:21.260 --> 55:27.900
The reason why is xfs originally was one of the few file systems under linux that extended attribute support and so

55:28.300 --> 55:31.100
Because I was integrating it into a windows domain

55:31.100 --> 55:36.860
And the windows administrators needed to be able to right click on files and change the permissions in the windows explorer dialogue

55:37.100 --> 55:42.620
You needed to be able to support those ntfs style attributes under linux. They don't have something that's sophisticated

55:42.700 --> 55:44.460
so you have to have something called

55:44.460 --> 55:47.420
Extended attributes and your file system has to be able to support this

55:47.740 --> 55:52.300
And xfs is now a lot of file systems do but xfs at the time was one of the few under linux that did

55:52.460 --> 55:58.780
I think maybe riser fs was close to this. And so, uh, I I went xfs across a a

55:58.780 --> 56:06.540
A a set of six file servers for this bank that were under massive heavy load and xfs never once lost a file for us

56:08.940 --> 56:12.460
True it's x it's extended attributes and external based

56:12.940 --> 56:15.820
And basically that I could change the amount of log buffers

56:16.220 --> 56:20.460
That the file system had I used to tweak the hell out of every file system

56:20.460 --> 56:22.060
I could possibly try

56:22.060 --> 56:25.900
Just because I started on gen 2 and was having so much fun, especially the tail

56:25.900 --> 56:31.020
I was packing on riser as well. Yep. I did that. Gosh. Wow, it's bringing back memories and wimpy

56:31.260 --> 56:33.740
Uh, you had a comment on the old xfs bug, right?

56:35.100 --> 56:35.900
Yeah

56:35.900 --> 56:40.620
It still gets brought up as though it's current and um, there was a bug in xfs

56:40.700 --> 56:44.060
It was over 10 years ago and it would truncate files to zero bytes

56:45.020 --> 56:47.820
10 years ago. And so yeah, it was a long long time ago

56:48.300 --> 56:55.260
So you still see people referring to that as oh it'll eat your data and it's just it's just rubbish tech dragon has

56:55.260 --> 56:57.260
a lot of them

56:57.260 --> 57:01.660
Oh a tech dragon go ahead and slip in the inconvenient truth about butter fest and i'll bounce it back to heaven

57:02.780 --> 57:07.420
The same company that put so much effort into the start of zfs

57:08.060 --> 57:14.220
Is the one currently employing at least one if not two or three of the people contributing to butter fs

57:15.100 --> 57:19.260
So it's not like they don't know there is yeah, there is oracle people working on butter fs

57:20.620 --> 57:24.940
Chris left oracle. He now works at facebook. Oh, that's right. That is true

57:24.940 --> 57:29.260
That's ages ago. Yeah, that is right. That is right. He wasn't the only one no, but he was the main guy

57:29.340 --> 57:31.820
That's true. Uh, and he works at facebook and facebook

57:32.060 --> 57:35.980
I also got a little bit of scoop on how facebook uses butter fs which totally makes sense

57:36.060 --> 57:42.860
They use it in a totally different way than than I was using it. Um, so that yeah, they they literally like they use it. Um,

57:43.740 --> 57:48.220
In like a like a ram environment where it's not even like it's not even a persistent file system

57:48.300 --> 57:49.820
Like they wipe it all the time

57:49.820 --> 57:53.020
So I bet it has very few issues because it's constantly getting wiped out

57:53.020 --> 57:55.820
Uh, so heaven if heavens did you want to pick up from there?

57:58.060 --> 58:02.300
Sure, i'll just finish with xfs is not a legacy file system

58:02.380 --> 58:08.060
They do constant refinements code quality and like improvements dead code removal

58:08.540 --> 58:15.980
Everything that you would think in modern and well-kept up-to-date stable file system should be and have within a modern linux kernel

58:16.540 --> 58:18.780
is I used to watch its mailing list and

58:18.780 --> 58:23.660
And watch its git log as they done their commits and watch the evolution of it

58:23.900 --> 58:28.300
It also now has on disk checksum so it can detect on disk errors when they happen

58:28.380 --> 58:34.300
It just can't fix them within the file system because I they consider that other systems

58:34.700 --> 58:40.540
Or at least other subsystems of the storage system should handle things, you know

58:41.260 --> 58:42.300
well

58:42.300 --> 58:48.940
Unix philosophy do one thing and do it. Well, right xfs store files. Well, that's what it rocks at better

58:50.620 --> 58:52.620
If I should go on to that

58:53.580 --> 58:57.100
Its concepts are beautiful. I love it

58:57.660 --> 59:04.300
But b trees are one of my most favorite data structures that i've ever used red black trees

59:05.260 --> 59:07.020
The thing is is it?

59:07.020 --> 59:12.220
It is a little bit too early for it to be as stable as I need it to be or would want it to be

59:12.700 --> 59:15.980
I consider it far more advanced than zfs could ever be

59:16.540 --> 59:21.580
As zfs complain about oh, they can't defragment. Oh, they can't reseal or oh, they can't

59:22.120 --> 59:25.340
Reallocate files on the disk. You can't remove they can't deduplicate

59:25.340 --> 59:27.260
You can't remove a disk you can't well, of course

59:27.260 --> 59:30.700
They've just added the ability to remove a disk directly from a pool. I believe that was just added

59:31.900 --> 59:34.940
After all this time maybe I think I don't know if it's actually in production

59:34.940 --> 59:41.980
Yeah, enterprise usage right, right. It is very very enterprise usage. It's almost it is almost it is exclusive care at all

59:43.500 --> 59:48.780
Yes, they don't care pretty much at all about desktop or laptop usage you must have money

59:49.020 --> 59:53.100
You have to throw disks at the problem. That's what zfs is built around

59:54.140 --> 59:57.180
But butterfs they are a lot more

59:57.720 --> 01:00:03.660
Desktop focused it's more practical. It has the duplication it can do encrypted or encryption

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:09.420
And well zfs says oh no, we can't do that. We have to do I can't remember that darn feature that

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:13.820
as I try to I love zfs too, but

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:20.300
It just let me down so much like ubuntu has in the past. I don't like touching it anymore

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.860
I just hope I've never had that

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:29.260
It's been totally rock solid. I've never had any issues, but I the problems I have with zfs are

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:33.500
Like exactly what you're saying is anytime. I need a storage anytime

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.340
I have a solution for zfs the answer is throw more disks at it

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:43.180
Even when it's like I have a disk that died and I need to remove it. Okay, cool add four more drives

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:48.940
Set up another pool move stuff around and then you can extract that one drive once you destroy that pool

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.380
What no no, no, I just want to put another terabyte drive in yeah

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:56.140
No, probably the better thing to do is buy four more drives and it's like what?

01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:00.300
And it is seriously like oh, I see you expect me to have a blank check for storage all the time

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.340
That is their assumption which is unfortunate

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:11.660
so I just hope that they'll come around one day and see the reality that there's more than just the server that there's

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.060
probably millions

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:18.860
Or hundreds of millions of more users of desktop usages than server usages

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.220
Even though there sure is a lot of or a large number of server

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.180
Installations, so I would say

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:30.700
NFS I love the snapshots. That's awesome. But they they had this weird bug that they

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.580
Had this table or they didn't

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:39.600
There are entries within the table in order to do the sub volumes. They limited themselves

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.020
Artificially and they had this ridiculous bug which also

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:47.180
Was an on disk format change in order to fix that problem

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:51.500
It was so weird how they just said. Oh, yeah

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:55.260
We'll never have to worry about that and all of a sudden. No, it blew up their file system

01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:01.500
They have to completely wipe and re you know copy everything back into the file system to make it usable again

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.860
Of course all the varonix articles or feronix articles

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:09.340
you can look at so many different problems that butterfests has had in the past, but

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.820
I think it's got

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:18.060
Promise it just needs some time. Yeah, I think it's still too early. Maybe I I agree

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:21.900
I think it's probably it's probably going to be a down the road thing. My current is awesome

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:26.380
Yeah, my current solution right now is xfs for like my main rig

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:30.220
So my boot partition is extended for I was hard on extended for last week

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:35.340
But in reality i'm using it in a few places. My boot is ext4 xfs for is so awesome

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.340
Xf. Okay. Well, hold on a second

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:43.660
Hold that thought and then my my root partition of my home partitions are xfs and then my editing and gaming mirror that I still

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:46.780
Haven't set up yet, uh are going to be I think extended for again

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:52.700
I might do butterfs there, but i'm thinking where i'm going to use butterfs now is in sort of low load

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:57.900
Where the the file set isn't changing a lot the size of what's in there isn't changing where with editing

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:03.180
I'm constantly adding huge files and then deleting them and downloading steam games and then deleting them

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.940
And I don't know if that's a proper use for butterfs and but but at the same time

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:11.500
There are a couple of games like uh bioshock 2 or yeah bioshock infinite

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.460
I guess that's not bioshock 2 that doesn't work under xfs

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:21.340
Um because it uses that uh eos wrapper and so it doesn't make me all that inclined to want to use xfs on that

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:25.180
For that for that use for that for that editing gaming mirror

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:32.540
Well, that's an unusual gotcha that you have found yeah, yeah it is isn't it but tell me about xfs 4

01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:42.460
Oh xfs 4 is my second favorite file system or at least most second most trusted file system if people are a little bit too

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:49.740
Too hesitant in order to try xfs just because it seems a little bit too different x4 is beautiful. It is

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:57.100
Based upon x3 which is thus based upon x2 not xfs for years and years of stable

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:05.100
Oh, yes for ext4 ext4 is based on ext3 ext2 talking about extended for it's they've built upon it

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:12.220
Yeah, yes extended for they didn't have a log or no journal x2 added the journal x3 added extents

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:14.540
metadata to the file system ext4

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:19.740
That has so much man years behind it and stability behind it is

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.700
It is trustworthy in my mind. It's

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.500
a lot of clustering file systems

01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:31.740
All have to be or almost require either x4 or xfs

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.620
better fs is just more of a

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.780
buzz word that a lot of people say oh, yeah

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.700
I agree go for it ext4. All right

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:44.380
So I will i'm gonna i'm gonna probably end it here because it's probably dying about file systems

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:49.900
But extended for is a great file system. I'm using it for my boot file system. However, it's not selling any hardware

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.680
xfs maybe

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:59.360
No, probably not. But zfs definitely sells hardware. Just ask our friends at ix systems zfs sells machines

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.980
And people are switching out and I know this because i'm being told by people that are doing the work

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:11.500
People are switching out their linux file servers for free bsd machines using zfs and they're not opting to run zfs on linux

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:20.700
And that's why that's why I actually refuse to run free bsd because it doesn't have a correct or a good xfs progress

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:26.220
But port in the port street if I if they did have a correct xfs port

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:32.220
That I could use my xfs file system from in free bsd. I would probably run free bsd. Yeah, it's just

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.340
people

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:37.900
but for for businesses that want zfs they're going free bsd and uh, I just

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:41.500
That's that's the only reason but for for my laptop and my desktop

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:43.980
I'm going to extend it for xfs extend it for an xfs

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:49.580
And I want to tell you about things I could have done differently now and a couple of really kind of quick and easy

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.340
Sort of really no

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:56.940
duh kind of backup solutions or recovery solutions that you could do if you ever run into a problem like this and things that maybe

01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:03.020
I could have done if I wasn't sort of already primed to reload which I sort of was primed to reload. Um, but before we do that

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.380
As you know

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:12.220
This show is sponsored by our great friends at digital ocean and it wasn't I just mentioning digital ocean digital ocean is really a great

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:14.220
It's it's like my secret

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:16.540
Because well not really because I tell you guys about it all the time

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:20.300
So if I keep though that i'm not very good at secrets as you might be able to tell

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.940
but like if if I was a contractor would

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:27.020
But it kind of because it makes me feel like i'm a boss it makes me feel like I got a data center like I

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.860
Got multiple data centers

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:32.220
Because i'm just like, you know what? I could use a linux rig today and just go spin one up

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:34.860
And that makes me feel like okay

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:38.540
I just got I got infrastructure on demand like a mouse and that's that's why I say it's my secret

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:39.820
But really you guys all know about it

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.820
In fact, some of you might have known about it before I did

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:42.940
But if you don't know about it

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:48.540
Let me tell you because digital ocean is a game changer and they're really taking linux and they're taking kvm and they're utilizing open source

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.460
And they're really making a super compelling product

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:55.820
They're a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.820
You're going to get root access to this bad mama jama. They got an html5 console for this business

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.740
So that way you can get up in there with your web standards

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:06.860
You're not going to have to complain about flash or java and you can get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:11.820
Only five dollars a month that's less than your crappy burger or your pretentious coffee

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:16.860
For the entire month to get yourself your own cloud server and you can start in less than 55 seconds

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:21.500
You got that to spare. What are you a boss? Of course you got I I could do that right now

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:25.100
While i'm doing a show it so fast 55 seconds for five dollars a month

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:28.940
55 seconds you can and honestly some people do it less than that and that's one of the things I love because I know

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:32.940
I'm going to get in there. I'm going to done fast. You're going to get 512 megabytes of ram 20 gigabyte ssd

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.180
One cpu and a terabyte of transfer

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:42.540
Digital ocean is data center locations in new york san francisco singapore amsterdam and london and that major center there the internet center in germany

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:47.020
Well, a little birdie tells me they're gonna have a data center there very soon as well. I think you know what?

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:48.700
Why not put some files up in there? It's great

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.820
It's a great way to distribute files like with sync thing or bit torrent sync all over the world

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:57.820
And one of the great things you'll really enjoy when you're over at digital ocean is the interface to manage your droplets

01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.100
It's top notch

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.900
I've been in it for like a million years you guys

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:07.420
And I was like one of the first fools messing around with vmware's proprietary horrible gooey's and man

01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:12.860
Nothing burned me more than administering all of these linux based

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:20.860
Vms from a windows box because the vmware crapware only worked from a windows rig to manage all of these esx boxes

01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:22.860
And gosh that drive me crazy

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.200
That's where that was sort of my introduction to like large-scale virtualization

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.500
So when I saw this digital ocean interface

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:38.140
I I wanted to have its baby. I wanted to go get a uterus surgically implanted into my body

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:43.100
And I wanted to be impregnated by digital ocean. I was so impressed by this interface. I'm not even joking

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:48.700
It's incredible. You can do snapshots dns management one-click deployments. You can do you can move between data centers

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:53.900
You can transfer between customers. You can destroy machines. I mean like it's the best interface

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:58.860
I have ever seen to do any of this and all of that functionality can be replicated with their straightforward api

01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:02.380
And they just released their brand new api version 2.0

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:06.940
So go over to digital ocean try it like the one-click install go play with like some freaking core os

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:11.260
It's like the new hotness or if you want to be a masochist and cut yourself go install free bsd

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.420
I'm, not going to judge does it sound like i'm judging because i'm not

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:18.860
But here's the best part use our promo code do unplugged

01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:25.260
Don't be a jerk. You'll save yourself some money. You're gonna get ten dollar credit and you support this show do unplug

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:28.940
They apply that to your account too. There's no credit card required. Now. What excuse do you got?

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.400
You're going to get your own linux rig powered by linux kvm ssd infrastructures

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:35.740
Tier one bandwidth any data center you want because they got lots of them

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:40.620
You can do one-click deployments to some of the most badass open source software available in the world

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:45.980
And you get a ten dollar credit when you use the promo code do unplugged and you're supporting the show

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:53.980
That's a no-brainer digital ocean.com. Go check it out. Use the promo code do unplugged and a really big. Thank you digital ocean

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:55.820
damn

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.820
for sponsoring the unplugged program

01:09:58.700 --> 01:09:59.580
Okay

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:04.220
So maybe what I should have could have would have done instead of uh rage quitting my machine

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.620
And then going on the internet and telling everybody about it

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:14.060
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, so uh, I got the bell here

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:16.060
I should get rid of this bell because i'm just dinging it all the time get

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:21.020
Get out of here bell orders ready for us. I threw it out of here. I got out of here. All right, so uh, kora

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:24.620
Uh korora kiora writes in oh, yeah kiora. That sounds right

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:30.940
Uh, he writes in with a great tip for easy fall backs and roll backs after an update that goes bad using butter fs

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:34.940
And grub, uh, it could all it could work pretty much on any distro that has that combo

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:40.460
This one is written specifically for arch and he's got it in here and what he's done mad check this bad mama jam out

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.660
He has an alias

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:49.180
So he just runs the command sys upgrade and what that does is that executes a butter fs sub volume snapshot it snapshots his stuff

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:57.100
Date and timestamps that snapshot then it actually executes the software update and then after the software update

01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:02.940
It depends grub with the uh with the snapshot so that way you could boot into the snapshot if you want to and so with one

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.080
Command he runs this

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.180
This is the linux kind of stuff

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.460
I love where you get one line and you do all this cool stuff in one line

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:15.420
And so he's aliased all that to just the command sys upgrade. He types this upgrade and it does all of that

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:20.780
Well, and the fact that he aliased it that's now now you're speaking my language because you're taking easy

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.460
He's got he's done the hard work for you. He's got it all laid out here

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:28.220
He's got all his logic here and how you can change it for yourself. This is just a super great

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.780
This is one of the greatest contributions of the week

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.060
I think to the subreddit because i'm going to do this on my rig because you know

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:39.420
Essentially and i'm going to tweak it a little bit because if uh, this is just me don't do this

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:42.220
This is something chris does that you should not do audience

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:46.460
But see since i'm doing a snapshot, of course, i've only got butterfs left on one more rig

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.540
But I might as well do it on the rig. I've got it left on uh

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:51.420
I'm also gonna see where i'm gonna do packer

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:57.500
instead of pacman and i'm gonna do the uh dash dash no edit no confirm because I just feel like

01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.660
when I just hit when I when I

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:03.660
so going back to loving to see the updates when I do a packer and an

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.220
Syu and then a no edit and a no confirm what i'm telling what i'm saying is

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:13.580
Update all the things. I don't care. Yes to everything. I don't want to change a thing

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.260
Take it and I don't know if it's going to be one package or a hundred packages

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:21.420
And it's so glorious when it's a hundred packages. Oh, let's do it right now. Let's do it

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.540
I think it's a box of cracker jacks experience for you. I think you like the

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:31.340
I'll do it. So i'm gonna do a packer. That's why you see it. No dash dash. No edit. No confirm

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.940
We'll do it right now because it just feels oh, I gotta put my password in there. Don't look guys

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:40.620
All right. So let's see i'm synchronizing right now. This is on the bonobo. We're doing it. Oh, there's some good packages

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:45.580
Yeah, look at all those look at all those package 60. We're gonna update. You'll see we're getting new drop box up in here

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:46.700
Oh

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:54.220
Gnome 3.16.1. So i'm getting an update to gnome 3.16. I'm getting a new light dm new youtube dl new xorg

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:59.260
Oh, this is a pretty solid update for me matt. See this is great and i'm saying no edit. I'm just taking it

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.140
I'm just taking it

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:05.820
And so now what I could do in the future is I could alias that to also do a snapshot see instead of doing that

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:10.140
I could do like a let's just take it all i'll make the command take it all and that'll do a snapshot

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:13.260
And i'll do a packer with the no edit the no confirm

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:16.460
Because why not do it while i'm doing a show live on the air, right?

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:19.500
Why why not seems like a perfect time to update my rolling desktop light dm

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:24.860
If I you know, I will say that one out of every seven times that I update that it breaks

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.180
I'm not worried at all. I'm not worried. No, okay

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:30.860
Not one little bit everything else i'm okay with but yeah, that's one area to work

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.500
It's like I can consistently point to example after example

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.380
I've had issues. Okay, it's done. Okay

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:43.420
Kind of anti-connected everything's fine. Everything's fine. Uh, so that was one thing I could have done differently is I could have had a sweet

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:44.540
um

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.300
Really no brainer snapshot totally should have been doing that since I had butter fs anyways

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:52.140
And you can see you can all do it in one command line and we'll have a link to that in the show notes

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:55.420
If you would like to try that on your rig kind of fun just to play with it anyways

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.420
And maybe not bad for your servers, too

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:04.540
All right, and you know, we are our arch servers here at the studio are running butter fs. And yes, I said arch servers. Yes

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:09.180
We run those jason wrote in with another suggestion and this one's a no-brainer too

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.740
He says, uh, you know if alan jud was in the mumba room

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:16.380
I'm sure he would have pointed out that pcbsd has a great backup solution

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:18.220
now

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.420
I thought this was great

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:24.000
I got this mentioned a few times and I think what this fundamentally demonstrates as pcbsd

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:31.200
Is taking technologies that are just built into the file system that they're using and they're wrapping it into a really user presentable package

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.400
Here you go

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.400
He says it has a great backup solution

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.200
It's called life preserver and we've actually talked about it before on this show and on bsd now

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.880
Uh, but it uses zfs to create snapshots that can be replicated off to a free naz server

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.440
So you see what they're doing here, right? This is beautiful

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:54.720
So ix systems is the umbrella in which pcbsd and free naz and honestly a shit ton of zfs development are done underneath

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.840
Right, so they are they are just now just connecting the dots

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.600
So if you have a pcbsd workstation and a free naz file server

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:07.120
You can use life preserver to take zfs snapshots and they just replicate in the background off to your free naz server

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.120
Now here's the final punch

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:15.920
When your machine dies you pop back in a pcbsd install cd and you choose the option to rescue and restore

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.520
Using life preserver backups and then it just goes and fetches them from the free naz box and writes it back down to the rig

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:29.760
Wow, there's no I like that there's no reason open susa couldn't do that or ubuntu couldn't do that with butter fs, right?

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.560
True, and it's it's just interesting. Like it's just that small like remember last week

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.800
I think it was last week

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:42.160
I think I was going on about how the reason why docker has had so much success is because they closed that 10% gap

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.800
They made some existing technology usable by more people by developers

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:52.880
But by uh by you know companies and by organizations like they close that 10% gap. That's what pcbsd is doing here, too

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:57.680
They're closing that gap. They're connecting those final dots. It's all stuff. You could roll your own solution

01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:01.200
I could do butter fs snapshots that may be right to a mounted nfs

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.040
Partition on my free naz server. I could do that

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:09.840
But this does it for me and they can integrate that with the with the with the update system

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:15.200
It's integrated with the file manager so you can be in the directory and you can reverse in that directory right there

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:22.000
Which is way more palatable to end users. It's way more sensical and it's it's an example of just a gap in linux

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
We just don't sometimes close

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.240
Interesting. So i'm pretty sure

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.840
In a you say ubuntu could do this we did

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:36.400
Uh, i'm pretty sure if you learn your system partition on butter fs and you do an app get dist upgrade

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:41.120
There's a snapshot option that will snapshot your system before I like that and there's

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.600
It's just yum does it too yum does it too?

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.600
But I i'm what i'm talking about is like this full connecting of like here's the gooey

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:52.000
It's integrated with the file manager and it writes to the file server. That's a pretty sweet combo, right?

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:58.640
Yeah, um, yeah, that's one of the things that impressed me about fedora is they also jumped on that and it works really well

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.600
you can have yum do snapshots and all that and and um

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.120
Um, I really should have been doing that. I just for me

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.920
I just a reload isn't the end of the day other than just the productivity

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:11.040
I think maybe because it's so straightforward to snapshot. It's probably worth it

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:18.400
I think so. Yeah, but it is interesting to see how the other side does it over over on pcbsd makes me a little jelly

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.440
I would love some like ula user-friendly distro to kind of just solve that

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.840
Or or maybe like even kind of rip off apple a little bit and use butter fest snapshots

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:33.600
But say hey i've detected you've detached or you have you have plugged in a 20 gigabyte or larger external storage

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:38.240
Would you like to start saving snapshots to this sort of like time machine does or detect it on the network?

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.000
I mean that would be nice too. Like there's a file share. I prefer that actually

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:46.160
Yeah, I really would too prefer to back up over the network just because I mean the whole buy usb thing

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.880
It's like that's adorable how last year of you and and end users are always going to mess that up. Yeah

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.960
uh, so I guess I lesson learned a little bit, but I thought

01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:00.640
I still think i'm gonna i'm gonna for now i'm gonna hold the position that um

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:08.080
Moderate I I I think I think unless you're unless you're really comfortable with you know quick recovery solutions

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:10.480
I I just don't know if I can recommend butter fest to people

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.400
And I I think i'm gonna hold that line

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:17.040
A lot of people wanted me to retract that and I think not that I just not that I want to argue

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:22.560
But I I think for right now, maybe it's best to to stick with extended for

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:29.120
Or xfs and leave butter fest to those of you who maybe have secondary machines, you know and things like that

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:34.400
Well, here's why I can actually agree with that sentiment and and point it out in a very just point it out to where this

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:39.200
Really takes away the debate when you break a file system chances are your data is probably okay

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:44.800
However, when you know when you break your installation and your data is okay now with a file system that's containing say

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.800
Oh, I don't know your data. Um

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.160
And that breaks, you know because of a kernel update or whatever the issue may be

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.680
That's not really something you just take some time out of your day to recover from because potentially that could also be your backup

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.680
I mean, you know, how far does it go?

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:02.400
You know, how far do you actually put into trusting that particular file system, you know?

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.480
And again, i'm just speaking to someone looking through the peephole here that my impression of it

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.600
And why i've never bothered with this because I never really had clear answers on how much trust do I want to put in a file

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.280
System that I really don't have a lot of faith in really

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.920
I'll give you the final word. Um, and I'm surprised to see you agree. I picked on your post quite a bit

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.880
You seem to be a pretty big butter fs advocate. You said it is the future

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:31.920
I still believe it is the future but I would agree that I wouldn't recommend it to other users i've been done quite

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.520
i'm

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:38.560
Not that big a linux switcher, but i've done quite a few linux installs for other people

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.880
I haven't been using butter fs

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.360
But to play with it

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.360
anyone who enjoys linux

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:51.840
I would definitely recommend having a play with it whether you trust your data to it. That's up to you

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.160
Right. Yeah, well said I think that summarizes it perfectly and i'm going to end on this

01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:02.400
Uh for for people what i'm going to continue to recommend is ext4 and a good backup. Uh, just get ext4

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:09.440
I don't think ext4 isn't going to blow my skirt up. That's fine. Ext4 isn't going to sell file servers off racks

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.760
Ext4 isn't going to stop the bleed

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:15.120
Ext4 isn't going to stop the bleed to free bsd. That's all fine

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:18.080
Maybe butter fs can take another five years and lose less files

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:21.680
And then we'll finally by then have a have an answer to a file system

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.680
That's been in production in the market for five years

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:27.200
And if that's the loss we have to take because we didn't have the right solution at the right time

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.080
Not the end of the world for linux. It's not going to kill linux

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.960
I think you need your bell back

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.680
Because that needed I don't know I kind of needed a name

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:40.640
I that was I did kind of try to wrap it up positively and then managed to put a little little bit of dagger in there

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:46.080
Again, there were some claws. I didn't really need to scratch. I felt some scratch. Yeah, i'm a little damaged. I just

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.920
Take it so seriously for some reason. I don't know why you know, matt

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.040
Or I I just I used to be responsible for file servers

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:56.480
And so this is an important thing to me because I was sort of the guardian of data

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:00.880
And so I take it very seriously. It's it's it's a call that I must answer

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.040
in the meantime

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.160
I'm gonna be so obsessed with linux fest northwest that i'm not really gonna care that much

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:10.160
matt, uh, where should people find you throughout the

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.240

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.080
Hold on now. Hold on

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.760
Now what about uh that what if you happen to make some sort of random appearance on say linux gamecast?

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:36.880
Would I find that in matthartley.com you would um any type of appearance i'm gonna have you're gonna actually know about it

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.320
Because you're matthartley.com you're subscribed, you know what's going on. That's smooth

So

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.540
I uh, I got I got randomly accused by wimpy

01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:30.980
For being drunk and I I don't I get this accusation from time to time and unfortunately

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:34.260
I wish it was true. The studio has been dry for I think more than three months

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:39.540
There has not been any liquor in here and wow, really? It's true plant a uterus in me and

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:45.060
I know we're definitely going to fix the state of liquor

01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:50.420
I will be drunk for probably a few weeks of shows after linux fest northwest as I I mean

01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:55.380
I refuse to throw booze out so I have to consume it all but yeah, I was on fire a little bit

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:59.140
You know what? It's true though. I would have digital ocean's manchild. So i'll admit it

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:02.260
I'm just uh, i'm just letting you know i'm being honest with who I am

01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:07.540
I would I would have their their love child. I would go have dirty dirty love and I probably shouldn't say this

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:11.380
But I would do it. Did you know coconut oil is a good hangover cure?

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:17.780
JBteles.com and uh, so when I was shopping today

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:26.260
I I noticed that now costco in in very large bulk is uh selling uh coconut oil in huge things of coconut oil

01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:30.500
Now let me tell you if you're looking for a good solid healthy thing to fry your foods in

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:35.300
Coconut oil my friends coconut oil also works as a lubricant

01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:38.100
This is true. It's uh, uh, yeah

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:42.580
It's totally natural healthy to use as a lubricant so you can cook with it and you can

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:48.100
You can you know, I wonder if it would work on my truck door, which is kind of squeaky you could yeah

01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:54.260
It could be like a poor man's uh, wd-40. Have you seen that video about coconut oil how it does it solves everything?

01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:56.260
No, is there a video out there?

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.860
Yeah, it's uh, it's just it's like a parody video about it's a long

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:02.980
I wouldn't mind seeing that no, it's like because I have to tweet two or three minutes

01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:06.020
All right. Well, I could play that while I tweet out that we're live and stuff. Do you remember what it's called?

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:11.380
Uh, no, but I can look at my history. Oh, jeez. Okay. Okay. Yeah, sure

01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:16.580
Uh, not that oh gosh, not that oh, you wouldn't want to see my history. Oh, not that. Oh boy

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:22.580
Uh, all right. So here it is all that your skin is looking great. I'm gonna play this while I uh, tweet out and stuff

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:24.260
so i'll be

01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:27.860
Brb. Well, then i'll be bathing in oil gross gross

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:36.420
You know what your skin is looking great, oh my god, thank you

01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:41.300
I'm using coconut oil. That stuff is amazing. Oh, I know I love it

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:46.420
I take my makeup off with it. I wash my face with it and moisturize with it. I cook with it

01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:50.660
All the time. Did you know you can brush your teeth with that? Yeah. No, no, no, I knew that

01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:54.020
You can also use it on your hair. And did you know that it's a natural deodorant?

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:56.660
Yeah, it's great for your metabolism

01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.740
It's great for your circulation

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:02.740
Also really good for wounds any kind of wound, you know, you can run your car on it

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:05.460
I mean the government doesn't want you to know that but you can run your car on it

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.540
Did you know that one time I found a dead bird in my garden?

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:11.620
And I brought it inside and I dipped it in coconut oil and then it came back to life

01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:15.060
For real

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.460
Yeah, I mean it is amazing stuff

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:22.180
Um, hey, you know that deep pit of anxiety that you carry with you every day

01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:27.140
But you don't really notice it until it's all consuming and completely ruining your life

01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:30.260
totally

01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:34.740
Wouldn't it be great if you could put coconut oil on that totally. Yes. Totally. Yes

01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.580
God fix me already

01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.020
All right, that was great

01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:52.580
Awesome, that's actually quite good. Yeah, uh god, of course I didn't I was super watching I didn't really tweet but that's okay

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.300
um

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:58.820
Yeah, yeah, although uh coconut is awesome so eat it

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:02.980
Oh, it truly is and you know, I put it on my wounds and whatnot

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:09.220
Well, I just I bring things back to life and also I wouldn't say that but uh, I do put in my coffee sometime

01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.900
I do put it in coffee sometimes

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:17.460
And it's great to cook with it really is one of the best oils to uh to fry with because it has such a high

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.940
Burning point so uh, it's a great cooking oil

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:22.500
uh, and uh, it makes uh

01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:26.580
Yeah, yeah, it's just it's really good for you. In fact, uh, it is good

01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:30.260
Like if you just eat even it sounds weird, but even even eat a spoonful of it. It's actually good for you

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.500
Oh, man, i'm doing my linux unplugged stretches

01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:37.460
Oh i've been doing a lot of i've been doing a lot of driving around today because uh, today's dylan's birthday my son dylan

01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:41.380
And uh, so, you know, I had to go get him a cake and then this is how it goes

01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:44.900
So I have to go get my son dylan a cake and costco make some pretty good cakes

01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:49.460
And so I decided I had to go get him a costco cake because they have a chocolate cake with chocolate filling that he likes

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:54.500
And chocolate frosting so I go over there and I get this costco cake. This is happy birthday. It's it's great. It's perfect

01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:58.820
In fact, I think I even have a picture of it. Hold on i'll pull up a picture and you know

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:06.340
I I gotta I should probably I should probably give you a little background here. I'm not big on doing sort of um, vaguely defined errands

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:08.660
Uh before I go on air

01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:13.240
Uh, because it's just you know, I I just so many times i've had a situation

01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:17.940
Where I just didn't expect something to come up and so then i'm like i'm rushed to get on there

01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:21.060
So I I decided but you know what? It's his birthday. Today's a special day

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.300
I'm gonna go to costco and i'm gonna get him this birthday cake

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:27.300
So I go pick up a birthday cake and it looks good. These birthday cakes are freaking huge

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:32.340
It says like it's two pounds or whatever. No, it's like it's like 25 pounds. Seriously, you can barely carry it with one hand

01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:35.140
I'm, not even kidding. And so then I can barely fit it in my truck

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:40.580
My truck like like it does too big to fit in a seat and it's too big to fit on the floor

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:47.780
So like it's precarious to transport and so I get it home. I mean I get it to the studio and surprise surprise

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:52.660
It doesn't fit in the studio fridge. Well, okay now we got a little bit of time crunch because I have a lunch meeting

01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.460
And i've got to get this cake delivered

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:59.940
Back to my house and in the fridge, which means I got to clear out space in the fridge because this thing's a monster

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:04.660
This is like literally trying to fit godzilla in your fridge. It's the godzilla cake. And so i'm like, okay

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:06.660
I got to make sure

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.940
I get home

01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:10.420
I get a spot cleared out. I get this in the fridge

01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:11.700
I get back in the truck

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:16.180
I get to my lunch meeting and then I get back in time to do linux unplugged like this is all running through my head

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.500
Major pressure to get this cake

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:20.420
I get to the studio

01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:26.340
First i'm like if I can just bypass getting to the house I can save myself about 20 to 40 minutes

01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:31.380
So I say self. Here's what you're gonna do. Let's take this back to the studio skip running home

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:36.420
That's just a waste of gas anyways, and you can just remember you can remember to bring this home at the end of the day

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:40.980
You can do this and I think to myself, you know what for dylan's birthday. I won't ever forget this cake

01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:45.060
I will remember so I so I say compromise. All right self. We'll take it to the studio

01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:48.660
So I get in the truck somehow I precariously drive this thing back to the studio

01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:51.140
Which is only about 10 minutes away from costco. So it's a nice quick run

01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:55.620
I get back to the studio. I clear out a whole shelf which to be honest

01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:58.020
It's not easy in the studio mostly my fault

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:02.180
I got a lot of meat parts up in this business and so I clear all the meat parts out of the way

01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:06.260
Throw away some of the nasty meat parts. In fact, I threw away about a shelf's worth of stuff

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:09.140
And I try to fit the cake in the fridge. Well, guess what?

01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.340
Cake doesn't fit in the fridge too big, of course

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:14.340
And you know what?

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:19.860
Nothing makes you feel more like a middle-class pedestrian than when you've just bought a cake that's too big for your own fridge

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:22.180
Like I was just like god. Am I that cheap?

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.900
Like what did I like cheap out when I bought this fridge?

01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:29.220
Like I I seem to remember this being an expensive fridge and yet I can't even fit a birthday cake in it

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:32.260
Like and then I start thinking like this is a problem rich people never have I don't know

01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:33.300
I don't know why my mind goes there

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.580
But I started hating my entire life because I cannot fit this cake in the fridge

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:43.540
Like this obviously is a judgment on my failure to properly provide myself a fridge large enough to fit this cake

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:48.260
And now I gotta drive this cake back to my house and it's time to start the show and I was getting very upset

01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.460
I'm sorry. So anyways

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:55.780
I rushed the cake home. I made it to my meeting cakes in the fridge. Everything's fine

01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:00.260
But but I then had an overflowing garbage back at the studio

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:07.220
Disgustingly full of meat bits and like a big bottle of spicy v8 which nobody likes spicy v8 if you like spicy v8

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.540
I'm sorry, but come on doesn't that give you farts?

01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:12.340
right, so

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:15.060
So you get so you go with the regular v8, right?

01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:17.060
So I go with the regular v8 normally

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:20.580
So there's this half drinking thing of spicy v8 because I hate to throw it away

01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:24.180
Even though I don't want to get farts, but so I drink I halfway drink this thing

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:27.060
But you know what? It gives me fart side to side, you know, I'm not gonna finish drinking this v8

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.020
So I put it in the fridge

01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:33.220
It sits there for like three weeks because I'm trying to bring myself to the point to throw away half a thing of a gallon

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:34.580
of v8

01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:37.700
Finally today. I'm at that point because I was trying to make room for the cake

01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:42.100
You know what cake takes priority that justifies throwing away the v8 boom decision made

01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:45.460
So I get back to the studio garbage is full of crap v8 sitting on top of it

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.860
I'm like, you know what? I got to take this garbage up before I do a show

01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:51.860
It's gonna stink this place up so I go to lift the garbage up out of the garbage can and of course all the

01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:57.620
Handles just rip off because it's like stuff full of food and it's been in there for like probably two days longer than it should

01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:00.260
So like oh god, so I try to pull the bag out

01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:04.420
And of course I go to pull the bag out. Of course the bag just rips. So I'm like, all right fine

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:08.900
You know what? Just go this the hard way and I just pick up the entire garbage can because you know what? Why not?

01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:11.780
So I pick up the whole garbage can I I

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:16.980
Gracefully thanks to years of it of carrying computers and monitors and still having to carefully open up doors

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:20.900
I gracefully managed to carry the garbage can and open the door. No problem there at all

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:23.540
I walk around the bush. I walk around my truck

01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:28.820
I sidestep around a cat that happens to walk by and I go to open up the garbage can and as I open up the

01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:33.860
garbage can of course the thing of v8 falls off the top of the garbage can and when it hits the ground it

01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:35.360
just

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.660
explodes

01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:44.500
Everywhere v8 all over my freaking legs v8 all over the garage v8 all over the truck. I am covered in v8 right now

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.500
And i'm ready to do a show

01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.860
That's been my morning. There you go

01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:54.580
Wow, that seems like quite a journey and that's why

01:31:55.460 --> 01:32:00.500
Doing something as simple as getting a cake is never that simple for me. And you know what?

01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:03.860
I just don't need that. I just don't need that kind of thing

01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:06.820
And you know what? My son will never know he'll never know

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:11.140
Unless he comes back and listens to old uh pre-shows

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.100
Yeah, yeah

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:18.260
Um anther and send the irc said that you should just eat some of until it fits

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:27.620
The logical solution, yeah, I just should have thought of that if it was pie I might have been tempted a chocolate cake

01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:29.940
You know, this is the other thing

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:34.820
I'm, just not like i'm not excited about this cake at all. It's all chocolate

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:43.460
And and i'm all chocolate chocolate, you know what chocolate is delicious. I just it's mono. It's like one note. Yeah

01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:47.140
All right. How about we hit a few notes? Let's combine a few ingredients

01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:52.020
That's like, you know, then then it's like those ingredients are making love in my mouth and it really tastes good

01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:56.580
But if you just go all chocolate, eh, okay. All right. So, uh chris, you know how you make that better

01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:01.220
No vanilla ice cream. Yeah, that's that is the truth

01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:05.300
Yeah, a raspberry later would be awesome as well. Yes, exactly

01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:09.700
See, that's all i'm saying is just put a little spice in there put a little berry put a little white cream in there

01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:13.380
You know go a little white if you're going all chocolate if you're going chocolate frosting chocolate cake

01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:18.180
Go a little white buttercream in the middle. That's amazing. Right? That's amazing. You just go chocolate in the middle

01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:23.860
I'm like, okay more chocolate. Well good thing. I like chocolate but i've already had a lot of chocolate and then it's like I have

01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:27.300
This huge plate of chocolate which is fine

01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:32.740
But I get the idea after about three solid bites fourth bite. I'm feeling like yeah, I love chocolate fifth bite

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:36.020
I'm like, okay. I got it. It's chocolate six bites. I'm totes done, right?

01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:37.540
But you add up some variety to that

01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.540
I'm like, oh it tastes a little bit different each bite

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:44.020
Sometimes I get a little more of this and I get a little bit less of this and I like that like every single freaking

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:46.020
Bite can be its own custom experience

01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:51.700
And all you have to do to have a custom experience with every single bite of cake is just have a little variation

01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:56.820
Add a tiny bit of variation. It's not that big of a deal, but yet everybody's like, oh, I love chocolate cake

01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:01.620
Chocolate cake's great. Yeah, it's great, but it can be way better. It can be like it's like

01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:05.940
Never mind I just so yeah, it's chocolate cake

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:10.020
I did all this work for a chocolate cake that i'm not even really gonna enjoy eating i'm gonna have like three bites of it

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:26.020
Happy birthday
