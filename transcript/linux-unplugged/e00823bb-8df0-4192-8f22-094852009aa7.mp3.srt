1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Geez, did you see Ubuntu touch on the Pinebook?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,840
This came across my Twitter feed today.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,960
I did, in fact.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,240
It's on the OG Pinebook, even.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,680
It's not the Pinebook Pro.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,240
But I'm sure they'll have it working for that as well.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,720
I mean, it's touch on a laptop, so I

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,320
don't know how I feel about that.

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,160
I kind of like it.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,340
I mean, you get one shot.

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,360
So I can't make a big judgment out of this.

12
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,400
But it feels kind of perfect, because it always

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,120
was meant to be convergent, to be usable on a desktop.

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,680
Truth.

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,520
And I don't know.

16
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,120
I think it's sort of the perfect side project

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,080
to try for something.

18
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,680
It's like, why I love the Pinebook.

19
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,400
It's why I love this so much.

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,120
And I feel like the guy that put it together, that

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,440
built that experimental release, is just like one of us.

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,040
He's just, can we get it working?

23
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Can I get it on here?

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,600
Can I make it functional?

25
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,520
And they have.

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,800
They said it's a little sluggish, as you would expect.

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,000
It's an experimental version.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,920
But you can actually go and pick it up out of their GitHub,

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,760
I believe.

30
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,600
If we ended up with a Pinebook and could

31
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
have put Ubuntu Touch on there, Westpane,

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
would you accept a challenge to use it for an entire workday?

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,880
Oh, yeah, I would.

34
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,120
Two workdays?

35
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,480
No, you're pushing it.

36
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,040
Yeah?

37
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,760
Two workdays?

38
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,440
How about this?

39
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll use it while we do one of these shows live.

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,960
All right.

41
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:28,200
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux Unplugged

42
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,700
program.

43
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,200
My name is Chris.

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,960
My name is Wes.

45
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,480
Hello, Wes.

46
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,040
How are you?

47
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,120
Hello, I'm doing great.

48
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,560
We've got a lot of things to cover.

49
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,480
It turns out it really is Linux Tuesday today.

50
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,880
Yeah, it's a big laptop you got there in front of you.

51
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,000
Very big and with a beautiful screen.

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
I'm really enjoying using it.

53
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,960
We'll review the System76 at our workstation

54
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,640
here in just a little bit.

55
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,200
And the community news, so much big news.

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,240
We got to say hi to you over there, Mr. Bacon.

57
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,960
Hey, Cheesy.

58
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
Hello, everyone.

59
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,040
How are you today?

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,120
Quite well, quite well.

61
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,960
Very, very excited about the arrangement of topics we have.

62
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,460
There's a couple of news stories today

63
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,160
that if it was the only news story,

64
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,760
I would be absolutely elated.

65
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,920
That would have been great.

66
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,440
Yeah.

67
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,400
And of course, we've got our virtual lug,

68
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,200
time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

69
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,680
Hey, hey.

70
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,180
Hello.

71
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,680
Hello there.

72
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,760
Hello.

73
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,680
Hello, Brandon and Neil.

74
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,000
And who else do we got in there?

75
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,720
We got Laura Deak in there, MiniMech, Tat2D,

76
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,400
and The Drifter.

77
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,280
Of course, The Silent Drifter.

78
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,000
What, you wouldn't call him Tat2D?

79
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,080
I think it's a good name.

80
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,000
No, it's a great name.

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,840
It's a great name.

82
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,720
He's just cracking up over there silently,

83
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,720
throwing me under the bus, that's all.

84
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,760
All right, yeah, OK, well, we got some big news

85
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,680
to get into today.

86
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,120
First of all, hot off the presses,

87
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,040
CentOS version 8 has been released, build 19.05.

88
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,640
As I mentioned last week, I think,

89
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,120
at least I mentioned it in Linux Action News,

90
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,760
this is the release of CentOS, which is based on RHEL 8.

91
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,080
Which came out back in May.

92
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,800
Which is based on Fedora 28, essentially.

93
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,680
So you get things like software modularity,

94
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,480
a little bit easier and more modern approach

95
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,360
to installing third-party drivers, a lot of things

96
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,280
that are really nice in Fedora 28

97
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,760
that made its way into this version of CentOS.

98
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,280
And that would be big news.

99
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,920
This is a release I've actually been personally looking forward

100
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,720
to for a really long time.

101
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,840
But Red Hat has gone and made even bigger news

102
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,680
and announced CentOS Stream.

103
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,200
CentOS Stream, Westpac.

104
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,400
Yeah, that's right.

105
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,840
What is CentOS Stream?

106
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,000
OK, well, the CentOS Stream project

107
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,280
sits between the Fedora project and RHEL

108
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,040
in the RHEL development process.

109
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,880
So it provides something like a rolling preview of future RHEL

110
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,680
kernels and features.

111
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,680
This enables developers to stay one or two steps ahead

112
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,960
of what's coming in RHEL, which was not really previously

113
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,880
possible with the traditional CentOS release style.

114
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,360
Right.

115
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,520
You wouldn't use CentOS to figure out how to build.

116
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,680
It doesn't make sense.

117
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,320
You could maybe figure out if you

118
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,080
target a certain version of Fedora,

119
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,560
you're likely to be building for a future version of RHEL.

120
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,880
But it wasn't a clear-cut solution,

121
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,120
whereas this really is now.

122
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,640
And keep in mind, this is going to be in parallel

123
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,360
with the existing CentOS release.

124
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,160
So nothing changes for current users of CentOS, Linux,

125
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,240
and services.

126
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,400
They can just keep using it like they always have.

127
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,480
This is an additional release stream now.

128
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,280
That's pretty neat.

129
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,120
That is neat.

130
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,600
I actually kind of think we're maybe really good candidates

131
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,240
for this kind of thing here in the studio, potentially.

132
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,000
Because one way you could consider this,

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,840
though they won't call it this, but it's

134
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,120
kind of like a Fedora LTS a little bit.

135
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,520
So Fedora is the foundation for future RHELs,

136
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,880
but CentOS Stream will be really an ecosystem for developers

137
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,720
and folks like us that want to see not just a great, stable,

138
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,360
enterprise-grade distro, but something that stays fairly

139
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,600
modern and current, too.

140
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:55,880
Right.

141
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,400
And it's interesting, now there's

142
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,920
a way for people who want to contribute back up

143
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,960
and are using CentOS, or at least using CentOS Streams,

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,640
to do so.

145
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,800
They can have more input on what's

146
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,000
going to end up in RHEL and therefore in CentOS.

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,160
This is a pretty cool development.

148
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,600
Didn't really see this coming.

149
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,640
I was just expecting CentOS 8.

150
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,240
Neil's here.

151
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm curious to know what your take is on this.

152
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,480
Well, this is actually super exciting.

153
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,000
When I was at Red Hat Summit, there

154
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,440
were hints about doing something like this.

155
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
But I was kind of blown away this morning

156
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,840
when I read the news about it.

157
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,800
So from how I've digested it, it's

158
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,480
basically we now have a neat little progression

159
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,400
going from Fedora to internal RHEL development,

160
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,400
now becoming CentOS Stream to RHEL to CentOS stable.

161
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,520
And I think this gives us something closer

162
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,920
to how people have talked about Fedora LTS, as you mentioned.

163
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,680
But also, it gives people a way to develop

164
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,960
for what people will be using in the future,

165
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,200
because everything that's in CentOS Stream

166
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,400
eventually lands in CentOS stable

167
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,360
when the next point release comes out.

168
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,840
And the bigger point to this that I think a lot of people

169
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,920
kind of missed is that this will also

170
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,320
be an avenue in which the community can contribute

171
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,720
directly to RHEL.

172
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,080
Because what a lot of people don't understand,

173
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,280
maybe because it's not immediately obvious

174
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
because we don't talk about it that much,

175
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,320
is that the relationship between Fedora and RHEL

176
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,800
is more or less a one-time thing.

177
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
When a release is about to be cut

178
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,360
and they branch from Fedora, that is a permanent branch

179
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,400
for that whole, the lifecycle of that release.

180
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,240
From that point, they're operating with their own lifecycle,

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,080
their own components development,

182
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,200
their own patches and things like that.

183
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,280
So they create their own bugs.

184
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,320
And so the idea behind this is that

185
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,880
if the community discovers these things in the CentOS Stream,

186
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,240
they can send changes to be incorporated

187
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,200
by the RHEL engineering team

188
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,160
to integrate into RHEL and CentOS.

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,160
And it gives an avenue for that to be

190
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,800
a proper community enterprise platform.

191
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,040
Yeah, so a couple of notes I made here is,

192
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,880
I got a couple of questions.

193
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,640
I'm wondering if you have some of the same questions

194
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,920
or if you've heard any answers, but one note,

195
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,240
there are gonna eventually be clear differences

196
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,880
between CentOS 8 proper and CentOS 8 Stream.

197
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,000
And so on their Wiki,

198
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,560
I don't know if this link will last forever,

199
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,480
but in our show notes, we have a link to the Wiki spot

200
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,320
where they're documenting the differences between the two.

201
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,080
Right now, it's just like a kernel difference.

202
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,920
Yeah, right.

203
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,000
They say the Linux kernel is the first part

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,720
of CentOS Stream to move ahead

205
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,400
of the upcoming RHEL point release.

206
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
But here's what I'm wondering, Neil.

207
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Will this roll into eventually CentOS Stream 9

208
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,160
or will they cut major versions to match every major RHEL?

209
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,120
So I think it'll actually be both.

210
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,440
So currently right now,

211
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,680
if you look at how it is synced out to the mirror network,

212
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,320
it's called Stream 8.

213
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,520
So the way I suspect it's going to work

214
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,920
is that there will be a Stream 9 after they branch

215
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,800
based on how they're gonna set up this structure.

216
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,240
And then people can switch to Stream 9

217
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,320
and help with the development

218
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,080
of what will eventually become the RHEL 9 tree.

219
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,440
And that is actually gonna be super exciting

220
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,520
because that would bring,

221
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,520
because I've had the experience of this process

222
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,440
with the way that SUSE Linux Enterprise has now developed.

223
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,120
Since SLE 15, they've done it this way

224
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,960
where OpenSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise releases

225
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,840
are actually developed in parallel

226
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,560
and community contributions can go in

227
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,360
and feed into SLE during development and vice versa.

228
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,120
So having this on the Red Hat family

229
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,320
is going to be a big improvement, I think, across the board.

230
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,880
And it's gonna be very interesting

231
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,560
to see how the community takes up with it

232
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,880
because historically speaking,

233
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,240
CentOS is a very passive community.

234
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,160
There isn't very much that they have been

235
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,640
historically allowed to contribute to.

236
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,720
And now I think this is going to give them

237
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,560
the opportunity to step up and turn into

238
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,960
what I feel is more of a proper diverse community

239
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,240
of users and contributors

240
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,680
because there's now an avenue

241
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,720
in which they can influence the RHEL branch

242
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,520
to improve it for what they need.

243
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah, I think it's a huge change for them

244
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,840
and it's gonna mean that the project's gonna have

245
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,280
some growing and adjusting to do.

246
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,880
But going back to one of the things

247
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,000
that I'm wondering about technically here

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,040
is how does this now work with software modularity

249
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,360
or I think what RHEL calls app streams.

250
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,200
Could one somehow use software modularity now

251
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,080
to use a CentOS 8 stream repository?

252
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,000
So you could be on CentOS 8 proper or RHEL 8

253
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,120
but using software modularity,

254
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,920
take advantage of a CentOS 8 stream.

255
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,640
In theory, yes.

256
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,360
I think in practice,

257
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
people won't necessarily do this

258
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,520
without switching all of their content

259
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,400
over to the 8 stream version.

260
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,480
But of course, I think it's absolutely possible.

261
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,840
That's gonna be something.

262
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,120
But because of the way that this stuff is being set up,

263
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,120
I think that moving on to 8 stream proper

264
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,200
is not going to be as dangerous or problematic for people

265
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,760
and I suspect a larger portion

266
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,320
than what they would have normally expected

267
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,280
will switch from 8 stable to 8 stream

268
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,560
and start leveraging that content

269
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,440
and become part of that process,

270
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,040
especially since there is now an avenue

271
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
for them to help make that better

272
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,800
because it means that if there is problems

273
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
and things like that and they know how to fix it,

274
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,160
there is a way to make sure it stays fixed

275
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,760
rather than having to work around it locally

276
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,680
like a lot of CentOS users do today.

277
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,920
Yeah, this is really cool

278
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,400
and it's something that we'll play around with

279
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,240
here in the studio.

280
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,200
I was about to say something tells me

281
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,760
we're gonna be reinstalling.

282
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,200
I think it could work pretty good on FakeNAS.

283
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,920
Right now we have Fedora 30 on there

284
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,120
and we were wondering if we were gonna go to 31

285
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,800
or CentOS 8 and now I think we might consider

286
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,000
CentOS 8 stream, although CentOS 8 could be fine.

287
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,160
There's a lot to consider now.

288
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,560
Right, but if we just jump on for the ride,

289
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,800
we'll find out how it goes.

290
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, get on board.

291
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,520
One other thing that is something

292
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,960
you might have to get on board with

293
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,080
at All Systems Go, a conference about

294
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,600
some of the plumbing things

295
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,560
in our beloved operating system.

296
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,640
The one and the only Mr. Lenot Pottering

297
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,280
gave a presentation about reinventing home directories

298
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,680
and introducing a new technology

299
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
called System D, Home D.

300
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,840
Yes, you heard me right, System D, Home D.

301
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,400
Hi, I'm Lenot Pottering and I'm going

302
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
to take away your home directories now.

303
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,400
So what's happening here is kind of a rethink

304
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,040
on the concept of Unix home directories,

305
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,280
which really hasn't changed much

306
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,560
in the last nearly 40 years.

307
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,560
And System D, Home D is a way to make the home directory

308
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,760
fully portable and treat the user

309
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,880
as a file on the operating system.

310
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,040
Everything is a file.

311
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,120
So yeah, self-contained home directories, right?

312
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,640
The metadata about the user

313
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,680
should not be distributed across the system

314
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,960
with all its information about the user itself,

315
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,560
with all the resource management and stuff.

316
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,520
It should be part of the home directory itself.

317
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,120
This then means that the mere existence

318
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,160
of the home directories file,

319
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,560
where everything's stored,

320
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,720
should synthesize the user account in full, right?

321
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,240
It should make sure that if you call get pwnem

322
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440
or something like this, like the classic Unix APIs

323
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,440
to query user, the mere existence of the user file store

324
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,200
should synthesize everything else, right?

325
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,680
In a way, you could say I want that,

326
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,640
yeah, you know, Unix, everything's a file.

327
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,000
But yeah, users should be a file too, right?

328
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Like where you just have one concept in the file system

329
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,520
and that everything else comes from there during runtime

330
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,360
and is not propagated persistently anywhere else.

331
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,000
This is a radical new idea.

332
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,920
He's talking about divorcing user configuration

333
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,520
from system configuration.

334
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,360
Right.

335
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,680
Getting us closer to having a fully immutable system,

336
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,920
getting us closer to having an Etsy directory

337
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,360
that can be read only.

338
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,640
Yeah, you could have a machine

339
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,760
that you've totally configured

340
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,360
and then some user in your organization,

341
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,520
whatever that may be, just walks up to it,

342
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,760
maybe with a thumb drive with all their user info on it

343
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,640
and they can just pop up and use the system.

344
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,640
The existence of the home directory creates the account.

345
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,120
So you're not modifying the system

346
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,920
to create or change passwords.

347
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,800
It's all stored in there.

348
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,640
Really the whole idea is to manage this stuff

349
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,640
at scale and sort of solve problems

350
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,320
that we've hacked together in the past.

351
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,040
We always have this goal that if a system's configuration

352
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,440
not supposed to change, Etsy should be read only,

353
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,320
should be immutable ideally even.

354
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,440
And hence the requirement that if a user is created

355
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,240
or removed or modified or whatever,

356
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
you need a writable Etsy kind of sucks

357
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,560
because a user's existence is not really configuration

358
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,200
at least in my view, right?

359
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,280
So the concept that mixes state,

360
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,640
yeah, I believe that the user record is state,

361
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,960
it's not configuration.

362
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,800
And the rest in Etsy is generally understood

363
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,160
to be configuration this way.

364
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,800
So there's this semantical,

365
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,360
this is a philosophical problem already

366
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,840
that Etsy mixes state and configuration

367
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,680
and then this propagates into the problem

368
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,120
that Etsy needs to be writable.

369
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,040
There's a couple of new ideas in here

370
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,200
that make all of this really kind of possible

371
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,080
including West's favorite.

372
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,440
There's some of my JSON magic.

373
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,280
Oh yeah.

374
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,600
There are two new concepts.

375
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,760
Like one of them is,

376
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,360
I want to go for JSON user records, right?

377
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,280
Like everyone knows JSON.

378
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,840
JSON is like what the internet people all do.

379
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,760
I think we should just start using that

380
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,440
for our user records.

381
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,840
Yeah, the reason why JSON is because

382
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,280
it's just the most basic thing.

383
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,480
It's supposed to be machine readable.

384
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,960
It's not supposed to be so much something you write.

385
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,840
It's something that computers write for you

386
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,440
and things like that.

387
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,560
And it's also what probably most of the internet

388
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,840
facing user databases probably use anyway

389
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,720
when they exchange information about users

390
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,800
across the network.

391
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,640
So that's the first thing.

392
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,720
JSON user records.

393
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,840
And we keep saying the user is a file.

394
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,080
The user directory is a file.

395
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,600
What the hell kind of file are we talking about?

396
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,040
We're talking about, in some cases,

397
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
a LUX encrypted loopback file.

398
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,520
So everything is encrypted to a LUX key.

399
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,760
Concept B is I want that home directories

400
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,760
are encrypted LUX loopback files in slash home, right?

401
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,760
So that if I have a user called foobar in slash home,

402
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,520
traditionally there was slash home slash foobar

403
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,760
and it was a plain directory.

404
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,240
I want that there now is slash home slash foobar dot home

405
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
and it's a file.

406
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,720
And it's actually a LUX loopback image.

407
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,760
And then when the user logs in, what do we do?

408
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,800
We set it up via LUX stuff as a loopback file.

409
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,960
And then we finally mount it after validating

410
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,120
that everything's okay.

411
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,880
And by making it a file, you also make them portable.

412
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,840
The goals that I want to be able to deliver

413
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,200
with what I'm talking about here

414
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,840
is first of all, migratable home directories, right?

415
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,560
Migratable home directories means

416
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,400
that you can take a home directory as one unit

417
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,480
from this laptop to your new laptop

418
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,120
or to your third laptop and it will always work

419
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,680
and be self-consistent in itself

420
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,960
and comprehensive and hence migratable, right?

421
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,480
So this basically means that as little as necessary

422
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,800
should leak into the system surrounding it

423
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,720
and particularly when it comes to configuration,

424
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,320
which is very different from what was there before, right?

425
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,840
Like before, home directories user accounts

426
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,080
were not migratable, right?

427
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,520
Like because as mentioned,

428
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,360
we have all these sidecar databases

429
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,600
and there's no way you can sensibly migrate

430
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,200
all that metadata that's distributed

431
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,920
in all these configuration files in Etsy

432
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,320
and all the weird sidecar database in VAR and whatnot

433
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,800
from one system to another.

434
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,880
We'll talk more about those sidecar databases there

435
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
in a moment, but he's demonstrating a system

436
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,440
where you can have everything on that thumb drive

437
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,360
you plug it in, you're now a member of that system,

438
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,680
you remove the thumb drive,

439
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,960
you're no longer a member of that system.

440
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,000
But he also wants to address some glaring security issues

441
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,960
that we just don't talk about in the current configuration.

442
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,160
Number one, if you're on a laptop,

443
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,360
you're likely at this point using Lux, I am.

444
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,800
It works really well for me.

445
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,040
One thing that sucks about it

446
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,280
is it's a shared password by default

447
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,680
because everyone has to use that one password to unlock it.

448
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,280
This was an issue at my wife's clinic.

449
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,560
They all have to know the encryption password

450
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,040
to get the system to boot.

451
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,400
Then there's their user password,

452
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,480
and then usually passwords for services.

453
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,160
Lenart's proposing you change that

454
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,320
and link it to the user password.

455
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,000
And he's proposing to solve the other problem,

456
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,120
which we never talk about.

457
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,480
And that is when you suspend these systems,

458
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,160
when you put them to sleep, the data remains unencrypted.

459
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,520
The key remains in memory.

460
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,600
And I don't know about you,

461
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,920
but that's pretty much what I always do with my laptop.

462
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,160
It's always in my bag of sleep.

463
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,960
Yeah, of course, that's just the most convenient option.

464
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,400
And I'm like, oh, my data's protected.

465
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,200
No, if they get it, not only will it still be unencrypted,

466
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,000
but with USB-C, they can plug it into any old USB-C thing

467
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,160
to keep it going.

468
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,840
And they'll have physical access to my box.

469
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,480
And sitting in memory is your password right there.

470
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,400
Yeah, so he wants to solve that problem.

471
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,320
Also, one of my really important goals, actually,

472
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,080
is to lock Lux on system suspend.

473
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,920
So nowadays, I'm pretty sure that, first of all,

474
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,480
most of you probably use hard disk encryption

475
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,320
on your laptop.

476
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,160
And second of all, I think most of you probably

477
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,320
don't even turn off the computers anymore at all, right?

478
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,400
Like usually, you just close the screen

479
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,680
and that suspends the system.

480
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,000
And then when you come back, you just authenticate again.

481
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,160
But it systematically, I mean, it kind of defeats

482
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,720
the encryption, like the encryption that you have there,

483
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,480
because basically, the way it's currently implemented,

484
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,440
you use hard disk, like full disk encryption.

485
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,440
So while the system is up, suspended or running,

486
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,440
yeah, up in that context, the decryption key is in memory.

487
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,920
Right, so if I go through customs to a country

488
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,000
that I don't trust, and I have the laptop with me

489
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,240
and it's suspended, and I pick up the laptop,

490
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,320
in that memory, you'll find the decryption key

491
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,960
from a hard disk, and that's something I think

492
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,680
we should not do, right?

493
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,080
We should, and this is something that people might

494
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,760
not find important, but I think it's actually

495
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,720
one of the most important things

496
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,640
in this entire approach at all, is yeah,

497
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,320
when you suspend the system, the decryption keys

498
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,760
need to be removed from memory, right?

499
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,960
So that I know for sure that if somebody steals

500
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,880
my laptop in suspended state, because that is

501
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
the most common state that they will probably

502
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,080
steal my laptop in, they should not be capable

503
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,920
of getting any access to my hard disks, right?

504
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,880
Again, this is something you really, really

505
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,720
should care about, because it basically,

506
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,280
so far, defeated all kind of encryption that you had,

507
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,160
because yeah, as long as you did system suspend

508
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
and everybody of you does that,

509
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,120
if somebody steals your laptop,

510
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,160
they can extract everything they want.

511
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,840
Now they are proposing to make the system

512
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,760
backwards compatible with the existing approach.

513
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,480
Yeah, right, there'll just be shims in place,

514
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,320
so all the existing Unix tooling will talk to system D.

515
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,520
And it's mostly a collection of existing utilities,

516
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,280
like PAM and other mechanisms.

517
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,880
It's not like system D is re-implementing

518
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,920
all of this stuff in some giant binary.

519
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,520
Right, and it just uses Lux, right?

520
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,840
It's not rolling its own encryption there either.

521
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,320
And it could use other backends as well,

522
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,760
that are just file system stuff,

523
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,680
like it can use SIFs or whatever.

524
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,080
So there's all kinds of network possibilities.

525
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,000
It does require some workarounds or development though,

526
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,520
because it kind of turns, it turns out

527
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,400
all this stuff's a bit of a hot mess.

528
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,560
I never really appreciated how patched together

529
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,000
all of this is, and certain things,

530
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
just kind of like bypass our basic authentication

531
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,400
mechanisms as it is.

532
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,920
Certain kind of important things that a lot of us rely on.

533
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,040
There's some complications with all of this.

534
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,240
SSH logins, right?

535
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,360
I mentioned that I wanted that user authentication

536
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,720
and decryption of the hard disk is the same thing, right?

537
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,520
This is inherently incompatible

538
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,480
with how SSH traditionally works, right?

539
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,000
Because as mentioned, if you authenticate via SSH,

540
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,720
it goes via the authorized keys file in the home directory.

541
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,120
So if you want to authenticate something

542
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,760
that is inside of the home directory

543
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,280
so that it can access the home directory,

544
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,320
where does the decryption key come from

545
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,040
to access the home directory, right?

546
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,160
You follow what I mean?

547
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,760
It's the chicken neck problem.

548
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,480
You're reading out the key that allows you access

549
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,120
from the encrypted thing,

550
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,080
which you only can after you authenticate it, right?

551
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
And there's a couple of ways to solve that problem,

552
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,040
like maybe just unlocking it locally first

553
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,560
or coming up with mechanisms to patch that process.

554
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,400
Right, and a lot of this too is, Leonard tries

555
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,040
to be pretty clear that he's,

556
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,480
some of this stuff is more general, right?

557
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,640
Just like this extensible user record, however it's stored.

558
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,240
That's an interesting idea on its own.

559
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,960
Some of this encryption stuff makes sense really

560
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,760
only for client machines, right?

561
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,960
Machines that will be offline or you may want to protect

562
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
because you're moving them around,

563
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,360
not server machines that you have up

564
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,080
and unencrypted anyway.

565
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,800
Right, it's both trying to solve a problem

566
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,920
of making querying users more rich

567
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,680
and like information you can store about them,

568
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,240
maybe that are appropriate for your company.

569
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,840
So that's all in that JSON file.

570
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,360
It's also about supporting things like Yuba keys

571
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,560
for authentication by default.

572
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,560
There's a lot of those kinds of the common,

573
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,880
making the UIDs on systems common

574
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,320
and in solving for conflicts.

575
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,280
But it's also about kind of solving the whole hot mess

576
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,240
of authentication.

577
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,920
You heard Leonard earlier mentioned

578
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,440
that there's all these sidecar databases.

579
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,240
And when you think about it, it's a bit of a hot mess.

580
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,880
I also see the problem.

581
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,080
Yeah, Etsy, PassWD only knows Unix passwords, right?

582
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,720
Like passwords as you know them.

583
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,360
It doesn't know anything else, right?

584
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,720
Everything else how you might want to authenticate

585
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,280
these days, Yuba keys, whatever else,

586
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,080
cannot be an Etsy PassWD because it's not extensible.

587
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,840
Right, so anything more modern,

588
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,440
anything if you even want to authenticate with a pattern,

589
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
right, like which is what phones do

590
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,520
and which you might want to do on your laptop too

591
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,200
if you have a touchscreen,

592
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,560
doesn't really fit into that model

593
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,200
because yeah, there's no way how that's viable there.

594
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,240
It's not extensible.

595
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,000
This is actually a massive problem, right?

596
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Like Etsy PassWD, this database was designed in 1985

597
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,160
or something like this,

598
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,840
has not been modified once since then.

599
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,360
There has been this extension like the shadow database

600
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,840
which added like five more fields or something like this,

601
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,920
but everybody wants to add their own fields.

602
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,440
And this is like fucking ugly if you ask me

603
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,160
because they created these sidecar databases, right?

604
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,160
These databases that extend the user record,

605
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,360
but they're not actually stored in Etsy PassWD

606
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,560
in the user database itself, but at some other place.

607
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,080
And that other place means something very different

608
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,240
regarding where you're looking.

609
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,360
All right, if you're going now, this sounds interesting

610
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,840
or this is a horrible idea or I want to know more,

611
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,040
we have a link in the show notes to Lenard's talk

612
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,960
which includes the slides

613
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,880
from the All Systems Go conference.

614
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,560
And there's a lot more in there.

615
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah, right, I mean, you should also know

616
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,240
that signing of these user records,

617
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
that's another big part of this.

618
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,920
There's a lot of implications for security

619
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,520
and how you might manage this at scale,

620
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,120
but you're going to have to go learn more yourself.

621
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,840
It may never hit a desktop near you

622
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,280
or it could end up all happening and be totally transparent

623
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,320
because that's the other thing to take away from this

624
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,240
is all said and done, you log in,

625
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,760
your home directory would mount and you wouldn't even know.

626
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,040
You could just, if you've got these services going,

627
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,920
you can just add this on

628
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,480
and not have to change anything else.

629
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,120
And because it's backwards compatible

630
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,920
with the previous system,

631
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,000
it's not like something distributions are forced to adopt,

632
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,120
but you could see where at scale operations

633
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,880
might want some of this management capability.

634
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,200
Hey, I want to play with it already.

635
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,360
I mean, it could be handy even for smaller stuff too, right?

636
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,640
Like you could add me and I have a little movable account.

637
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,720
If I need to use a new studio machine,

638
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,360
just pop up right on it and use it.

639
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,960
Yeah, absolutely.

640
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,080
Or I use sync thing to sync around my Lux home directory

641
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,720
to all the systems and just set down everywhere

642
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,240
and I'm good to go, maybe.

643
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,120
Could be the dream one day, we'll see.

644
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,280
Hey, just a quick bit of good news for OBS, OBS,

645
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,240
our streaming application of choice.

646
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,000
Also, you know, people sometimes say,

647
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,080
hey, what's a great quick screen cap application now?

648
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,200
There's a bunch out there, but OBS is one of the best ones

649
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,840
too, just for that kind of stuff.

650
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,080
It's such a cool project.

651
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,040
It's like the number one streaming application

652
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,080
that Twitch streamers use or people,

653
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,840
a lot of people use it for-

654
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,640
It's just taken for granted now.

655
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,120
You remember the days before a project like this

656
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,120
and it was just only commercial applications

657
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,480
that probably didn't run on Linux.

658
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,040
It's so quickly become just like the go-to

659
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,200
that it's almost like a non OBS, yeah.

660
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,000
But I mean, game changer.

661
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,920
And so that's why it's so great to see Twitch becoming

662
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,240
the premier sponsor of the OBS project.

663
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,120
It seems like a pretty good match.

664
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,200
They write on the page that we're excited to announce

665
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,760
that Twitch is now officially sponsoring my work on OBS.

666
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,720
This sponsorship allows me to work full-time

667
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,440
on the project without much worry.

668
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,040
And with it allows me to support other contributors

669
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,120
to help maintain, manage the project

670
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,840
and work on important features.

671
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,920
I expect more good things from the OBS project

672
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,760
in the future.

673
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,600
Yay.

674
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,480
I am so happy for them because it's such a great tool.

675
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,360
We run it dang near 24 seven here in the studio,

676
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,560
either doing live stream reruns

677
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,680
or doing something in-house and-

678
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,600
And it makes a lot of sense for Twitch to do this too,

679
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,440
right?

680
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,240
I mean, they, so many of their users are using this.

681
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,080
No kidding.

682
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,600
They needed to stick around and stay healthy, don't they?

683
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,440
They sure do.

684
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
That's a really good point.

685
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,200
All right, how about a little housekeeping?

686
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,520
So if you are not signed up

687
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,580
as a Linux Academy community member, it's free.

688
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,420
Totally free.

689
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,400
Go check that out because every month

690
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,840
L is dropping new batches of content

691
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,360
and October is just around the corner, my friends.

692
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,720
So you can still get a little bit of September in there

693
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,240
and then go check out the October stuff.

694
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,600
Plus there's evergreen stuff that stays free all the time.

695
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,040
L curates that.

696
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,000
I really recommend it.

697
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,300
So we'll have a link in the show notes

698
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,000
for the September courses.

699
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,560
But if you just Google like Linux Academy community account

700
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,320
or go to linuxacademy.com, go get that

701
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,440
because that's a great deal.

702
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,480
Absolutely free.

703
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,720
Texas Cyber Summit also I want to let you know about

704
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,040
is coming up very soon.

705
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,800
The crew is getting ready to go a party

706
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,600
at Texas Cyber Summit.

707
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,480
There's going to be a hacker birthday meetup.

708
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,560
Pre-funk the summit.

709
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,080
For L and Ali, it's their birthdays

710
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,920
and we're going to do a meetup.

711
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,880
We're going to just combine the whole thing

712
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,080
and make it great.

713
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,280
It's October 10th and the 12th

714
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,640
for a Texas Cyber Summit, texascybersummit.org.

715
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,480
Are you going, Wes?

716
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,320
Yeah.

717
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,160
Yeah, yeah.

718
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,980
Of course.

719
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,820
Was I going to miss this?

720
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,660
No way, man.

721
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,500
You'd hike there if you had to.

722
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,340
That's right.

723
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,000
I think we just did a ticket giveaway too, didn't we?

724
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,840
Yeah.

725
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,680
Oh yeah.

726
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,380
I think Rob was our winner from the ticket giveaway.

727
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,080
If you would like a chance to win a ticket,

728
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,600
you too can enter to win.

729
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:30,600
And to do that, all you have to do is go to tcs2019.ellopunk.com.

730
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,720
It's tcs2019.ellopunk.com.

731
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,640
You'll be dropped into the Telegram chat

732
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,880
and Elle has a randomizer, name randomizer

733
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,400
that she's using to pull those.

734
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,880
And Rob was our first winner.

735
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,880
So if you want to go and maybe you don't have the money

736
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,760
just to drop to go, jump in there.

737
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,720
See if you can't win yourself a ticket or two.

738
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,560
And if you're in the area,

739
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
you could always join us at Two Brothers Barbecue

740
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,600
for the birthday party.

741
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,000
Details at meetup.com slash jupesbroadcasting.

742
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,840
That's Jupiter.

743
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,680
If you want to hear more too,

744
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,400
there's an extra out over in Jupiter Extras.

745
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,880
That's what I was trying to remember.

746
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,720
Right.

747
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,240
Elle and I sat down with the blind hacker

748
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,280
and he tells us a little bit about the great ABCs

749
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,240
of CTF's talk he's giving,

750
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,480
which might just help us, Chris,

751
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,040
if we're going to impress Elle.

752
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,840
There's been some really good stuff

753
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,200
pop into the Extras feed.

754
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,280
We haven't been plugging it very hard,

755
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,080
but if you're looking for just a little bit extra

756
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,000
Jupiter Broadcasting content, extras.show,

757
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,560
some good stuff in there,

758
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,640
usually something coming out every single week.

759
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,440
And of course it's an easy RSS subscribe

760
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,720
to go get that extras.show slash subscribe.

761
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,080
But that, my friends, is everything in the housekeeping.

762
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,120
All right, let's talk about your next Linux laptop.

763
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,320
I'm curious to know what your requirements are

764
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,280
and if they shift like mine do.

765
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,520
So you've been sitting there

766
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,080
using the System76 Adder workstation.

767
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,160
Yes, I have.

768
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,880
And you traditionally spend your days

769
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,560
on your ThinkPad T480.

770
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,680
That's right.

771
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,240
And if you were to go in the market today

772
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,720
and buy one for yourself personally,

773
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,120
I'm curious to know what your requirements

774
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,600
for your next Linux laptop would be.

775
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,960
And I'd like to know the audience's too.

776
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,080
Let me know at chrisles,

777
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,920
because I'm kind of wondering if your shift like mine do,

778
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,520
mine kind of swing between ultra portable,

779
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,040
long battery life and, oh my God,

780
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,600
I want all of the power.

781
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,760
Yeah, I mean, workloads vary, right?

782
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,240
And I absolutely do love something that's ultra portable.

783
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,280
A lot of work that I am doing is just reading the news

784
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,520
or working in a terminal.

785
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,800
And that's perfect for that,

786
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,760
especially when you might be flying to a conference

787
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,600
or something.

788
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah, that's where portable and low powered,

789
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,960
like there's nothing better.

790
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,720
Yeah, but also, I mean, we're doing work with audio,

791
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,560
we're rendering things out,

792
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,560
maybe doing some video work from time to time.

793
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,960
Plus, I just can't stand when the machine is slow.

794
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,280
You know, once you start noticing those little stutters

795
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,520
or delays, it doesn't feel right.

796
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,480
Yeah, this machine did break me in a couple of ways,

797
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,760
which I'll talk about here in a second.

798
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,080
But first, let me tell you what we have here in the studio.

799
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,400
So the System76 Adder workstation that we have

800
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,400
is configured with a Core i7 9750 at 4.5 gigahertz,

801
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,160
six physical cores, 12 threads.

802
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,920
It is ridiculous having 12 threads on a laptop.

803
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,600
It feels like it's like,

804
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,880
I feel like I'm getting a deep fake CPU over there.

805
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,920
It's incredible.

806
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,920
This has two eight gig modules in there, DDR4.

807
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,000
So it's a pretty smokin' fast RAM.

808
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,680
It's got a Samsung 970 EVO 250 gig.

809
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,400
And get ready for this, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070

810
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,160
with eight gigabytes of RAM.

811
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,800
Whoa!

812
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,160
That's insane. Yeah.

813
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,280
And it's running Pop OS based on Ubuntu 19.04

814
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,880
with Gnome Shell 3.2.2, X Server 120,

815
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,880
NVIDIA graphics driver 435.21, and a screen resolution

816
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,440
nominally running at 3840 by 2160.

817
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,480
Although I did mess around with that a bit.

818
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,480
So by my calculation, my price before tax and shipping,

819
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,920
I suppose, is a grand total of $2,314.

820
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,520
Okay, so not on the cheap end, but-

821
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,880
It is a workstation laptop.

822
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,320
Yeah, this is spec'd out.

823
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,840
It's got a 15.6 inch 4K OLED display.

824
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,720
Ooh, and boy is that putting my ThinkPad display

825
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,000
to shame today.

826
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,080
Oh my God, lapping the ThinkPad display

827
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,360
doesn't appropriately describe-

828
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,200
Not even close.

829
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,880
How much of it is just crushing the ThinkPad display.

830
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,480
But in fairness, this legitimately might be

831
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,880
one of the best displays I've ever looked at

832
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,600
because the blacks on this OLED are so incredible

833
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,320
that basic logos when video games load look incredible.

834
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,000
That's it, everything that we've been doing,

835
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,880
even just basic stuff.

836
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,600
I'm looking at like a night mode notes program right now,

837
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,520
and it's beautiful.

838
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,360
Like the fonts pop off the screen.

839
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,840
And then it is running in high DPI mode,

840
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,240
so of course it looks gorgeous.

841
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,400
It has two M.2 slots in there,

842
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,360
so you can pop in two MV&E drives or something.

843
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,480
So you can get up to eight terabytes of MV&E storage

844
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,840
if you like.

845
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,960
Yeah, it's also got a gigabit ethernet,

846
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,000
of course it's got Intel AC, yep, oh yeah.

847
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,880
It's got one USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort on there.

848
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,000
It's also got another USB 3.1 Gen2

849
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,040
with Thunderbolt Type-C connector.

850
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,440
So it's got a Thunderbolt port Type-C connector,

851
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,880
and then three USB 3.0 ports.

852
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,200
With the blue coloring, which is always a nice touch.

853
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,800
Plus SD card reader.

854
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,720
It's got a big power adapter,

855
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,640
not like as big as I've seen in the past,

856
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,480
but it's big compared to what you would normally get

857
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
on some systems, but that's because this thing's got

858
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,600
all of this machinery in there.

859
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,000
230 watt power adapter, so it does not charge over USB-C,

860
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,720
but that's because you can't deliver that much power

861
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,080
over USB-C.

862
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
What I would love to see, and this is Cheez's idea,

863
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,480
is in the future, I would love to be able to charge

864
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,920
the battery over USB-C when the system is off,

865
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,280
because this is something I do with the old ThinkPad ski,

866
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,880
is I have a dash charger in my RV that is USB-C,

867
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,960
so I just plug it in, and it takes all night to charge,

868
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,800
but I don't care.

869
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,840
Right, if you're just leaving it there

870
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,680
and you're not using it.

871
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,800
In fact, it may be better for the health of the battery

872
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,040
to charge slower with less heat, who knows?

873
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,520
So that'd be fun to see down the road,

874
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,920
but in the meantime, it makes up for it

875
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,240
by the fact that a lot of the bulky ports,

876
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,360
like your HDMI and the power adapter,

877
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,440
which is a bit of an L-plug, are on the back.

878
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,340
So your big I.O. plugs are all on the back,

879
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,800
coming out the back of the laptop,

880
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,040
which means they're not along the side,

881
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,840
so it's not blocking your hands from mouse in.

882
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,680
I love that.

883
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,280
I mean, I frequently sort of add my ThinkPad to a desk

884
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,120
and take it away, and that's not the best on the ThinkPad.

885
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,140
Honestly, this would do better.

886
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,500
Yeah, it's so nice having those big ports on the back.

887
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,820
I love that.

888
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,900
It does have a removable six cell lithium battery

889
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,500
at 62 watt hours, so you're getting,

890
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,540
with my rather aggressive usage,

891
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,540
you're getting an hour and 45 to two hours of pushing it.

892
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,720
If you're sitting there doing a little light work

893
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,100
and you're using Firefox as opposed to Chrome,

894
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,840
you can push that a little bit further,

895
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,960
but it's definitely enough power that we could use it

896
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,200
during the show on battery and do some work,

897
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,320
and as long as we eventually get back to the plug, we're okay.

898
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,840
If you're just gonna go to a coffee shop for an hour or two,

899
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,120
great, if you're gonna be there all day,

900
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,460
then pack the plug.

901
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,000
And it is a 5.51 pound stock,

902
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,600
depending on your config, it'll change.

903
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,240
5.5 pound laptop, two and a half kilograms.

904
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,640
It's kind of right on the boundary.

905
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,980
It's honestly not that heavy.

906
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,960
I'm sitting here with all my knees as we're doing the show,

907
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,780
and I think I could reasonably carry it around in a backpack,

908
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,360
but it's not exactly comfortable,

909
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,280
and it would be a little bit much on a plane, I think, too.

910
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,080
I took this on a trip down to the river.

911
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,280
I took my RV down to a river, had very little connectivity,

912
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,720
and really kind of spent as much time offline as possible

913
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,680
playing No Man's Sky when I was online

914
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,280
or just sort of enjoying having a little bit of peace

915
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,900
and quiet, and so I ended up lugging it around

916
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,760
in a backpack that you and I got as a company event.

917
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,400
So it's a Linux Academy swag backpack.

918
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,480
Standard issue.

919
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,360
And yeah, standard swag issue.

920
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,560
And you know, I thought I'd be griping about,

921
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,120
oh, it was so heavy to carry around in the backpack,

922
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,400
but my ThinkPad with its extended battery on there,

923
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,760
kind of, I mean, it's a little bit heavier,

924
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,640
but not a lot heavier.

925
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,320
It's like 4.8 pounds versus 5.5 pounds.

926
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,880
It feels like what you think it would feel like.

927
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,240
It's not like it seems heavier than it should be or anything.

928
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,880
And that's great.

929
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
Oh, Jesus.

930
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,120
Oh, I know.

931
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,620
So there's some things I don't like,

932
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,680
and there's some things I really like.

933
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,360
I'll start with a couple of things that I really like.

934
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,520
Number one, this isn't unusual, but System76

935
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,000
does a great job of putting together

936
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,840
what they kind of coined a quick start guide,

937
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,320
but it's more than that.

938
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,720
It completely illustrates everything

939
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,840
from what each key and port does to how

940
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,120
to pull out the cooling on the CPU

941
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,440
in case you want to repaste it, and everything in between.

942
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,600
See, that's so nice.

943
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,080
With color-coded motherboard diagrams

944
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,560
of this is your storage, this is your Wi-Fi, totally like.

945
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,200
You don't get that from other vendors.

946
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,520
No, and in that same kind of vein,

947
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,480
replacing the keyboard is simple.

948
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,120
Just requires a cross-head screwdriver,

949
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,000
and you could pop that keyboard off if you damage it

950
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,960
and replace it.

951
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,300
So there's aspects about this that I find when you're

952
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,100
investing in a workstation where it really kind of matches

953
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,200
that workstation name.

954
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,340
Replaceable keyboard, replaceable battery,

955
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,640
the storage, the memory, technically even the CPU

956
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,240
cooling if you really want to go crazy,

957
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,840
they're all user serviceable.

958
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,600
That is really pretty great.

959
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,440
And when you consider if you're going to spend $2,200, $2,300

960
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,120
on a machine like this, you kind of

961
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,800
want to be able to do that.

962
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,680
It's a big investment, yeah.

963
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:38,960
Right.

964
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,600
So I think that kind of stuff actually does matter,

965
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,480
and it's something you don't see very much.

966
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,800
Also, without making a big fuss about it,

967
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,320
there's some keyboard combos that I really like.

968
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,080
One keyboard combo kills the webcam.

969
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,760
I like that a lot.

970
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,680
Another keyboard combo can turn on and off airplane mode.

971
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,180
So you can just kill all the radios.

972
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,720
Nice.

973
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,220
Doesn't have to be some tacky switch on the side of the case.

974
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,640
It's just a keyboard combo.

975
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,840
And something else I like, because every now and then I

976
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,160
know I'm going to just push this machine to the limit,

977
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,520
you can toggle on and off the fans to absolute maximum.

978
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,800
I discovered this once on accident, but now that I know,

979
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,640
it's like function F1 or function 1, something like that.

980
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,920
Now that I know it's that, and it's in their quick start

981
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,040
guide, I love it.

982
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,540
Right.

983
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,600
Maybe it's a hot summer day here in the Pacific

984
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,880
Northwest, but you just need to get some work done.

985
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,440
It's a hot summer day in the Pacific Northwest,

986
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,600
and Chris Fisher and Wes Payne are turning their laptop fans

987
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,940
up to max.

988
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,560
I don't know what just happened there.

989
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,600
I don't know what happened there.

990
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,400
But speaking of laptop fans, I did

991
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,360
want to kind of talk about fan noise a little bit.

992
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,320
So I'm no Wendell Wilson, but it seems to me

993
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,440
that they have a somewhat kind of aggressive cooling

994
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,080
curve on there where I'll hear the fan kick in,

995
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,480
and then it kind of holds sort of low,

996
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,740
and then it really kicks in.

997
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,960
And I'll give you an example.

998
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,240
This is near the side of the laptop

999
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,520
during some benchmarking that I conducted,

1000
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,900
just to give you kind of idea what the laptop noise is like.

1001
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,680
It's not horrible, but it's noticeable.

1002
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,560
And you'll hear it kind of ramps up now.

1003
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,720
It moves quite a bit of air.

1004
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,920
There's two fans in this thing, so you can actually

1005
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,680
hear a little bit of fan noise, and it's just on the table,

1006
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
right?

1007
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:27,880
And it's not horrible, and we were playing some games,

1008
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,080
and you could hear it over the speakers, which

1009
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,880
were turned up all the way.

1010
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,280
You could still hear the fans, but it wasn't that bad

1011
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,640
for what you're getting.

1012
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,280
You're getting incredible graphics.

1013
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,680
So it's sort of like, what do you expect?

1014
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,880
I suppose I would love to see something a little more

1015
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,560
graceful in the ramp up, but at the same time,

1016
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,520
I'm a stick it in high performance kind of guy

1017
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,440
and just let it go.

1018
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,000
Right, and you've got some control,

1019
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,040
just not maybe all the control that you'd like.

1020
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,600
So this laptop was an opportunity for me

1021
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,720
to really experience something with some profoundly better

1022
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,160
graphics than what I'm used to.

1023
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,360
I've spent the last year and change on Intel graphics.

1024
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,000
So when I was digging around in Pop OS

1025
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,200
and seeing different options for switching graphics

1026
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,080
and performance governor options that were in the Nome menu,

1027
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,200
I wanted to know if this is something they invented

1028
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,280
or if this is just something that people that

1029
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,080
have these fancy graphics cards experience.

1030
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,480
That is not specific to System76 products.

1031
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,640
It's any time you have a battery show up on the system,

1032
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,680
it assumes the system is a laptop.

1033
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,080
And the System76 power daemon, which

1034
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,960
is a component of Pop OS, creates that extension.

1035
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,680
So it allows you to set the CPU into a lower power mode.

1036
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,160
I'm sure you've seen that there's the performance mode,

1037
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,040
there's the balance mode, and then there's

1038
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,600
the battery saver mode.

1039
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,840
And what those do is change the turbo settings of the CPU.

1040
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,440
And also, there should be a graphic switch

1041
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,080
that shows up in that same area if you have NVIDIA Optimus.

1042
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,880
And this is on any system, not just our systems,

1043
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,260
although many of our systems have NVIDIA and have Optimus.

1044
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,220
It's super cool having a machine with these advanced graphics,

1045
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,340
because it's like a whole new world of things

1046
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,240
I get to play with.

1047
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,160
And one of the other things that I don't often get to mess around

1048
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,960
is really brilliant high DPI screens.

1049
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,000
My last experience is on a really kind of small high DPI.

1050
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,200
This is a very large screen for a laptop.

1051
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,880
And I noticed when I went into Nome Shell display area,

1052
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,200
there's some customization there to enable that.

1053
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,720
Can you talk about that a little bit?

1054
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,240
That's right.

1055
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,560
So on the Adder, we have an OLED high DPI screen.

1056
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,960
It's our flagship in terms of displays.

1057
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,920
I'm typically on a Galago with a 13-inch high DPI screen.

1058
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,040
And it is a world of difference when you move to OLED.

1059
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,040
It's so bright.

1060
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,240
The colors are crisp.

1061
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,560
The contrast is incredible.

1062
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,280
But software support is not that great right now

1063
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,900
in upstream Nome.

1064
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,080
So what we had to do was develop a number of items

1065
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,080
to perform brightness control for OLED screens.

1066
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,360
Brightness control is done in software on OLED screens.

1067
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,880
Since there is no backlight, the brightness

1068
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,860
of each individual pixel has to be

1069
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,440
edited by the graphics card, essentially,

1070
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,560
using a transform.

1071
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,400
So we do that with X11 gamma settings.

1072
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,840
And this works in X11 in any display environment,

1073
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,960
in any desktop environment.

1074
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,320
So whether you're in Nome or KDE,

1075
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,820
we have a daemon called System76-OLED that controls

1076
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,680
the X11 gamma settings.

1077
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,320
In addition, Nome with Wayland, we

1078
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:44,160
have integrated into Nome Settings daemon the ability

1079
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,360
to control gamma settings in Wayland as well.

1080
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,240
So there is Wayland support.

1081
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,240
But since there isn't a common way of setting gamma,

1082
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,760
it's only available in the Nome Wayland setting,

1083
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,400
not in other Wayland sessions.

1084
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,320
OK, that makes sense.

1085
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,240
And how portable is some of those System76 daemons?

1086
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,920
Say, maybe, I'm an Arch guy or an OpenSUSE guy or gal.

1087
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,760
Am I going to have a shot of running those?

1088
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,800
Yes, they're highly portable.

1089
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:18,560
What you have to do is just go to the GitHub page for PopOS

1090
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,920
and search for System76-OLED.

1091
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,600
That project, you can compile.

1092
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,080
It's standalone.

1093
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,560
It requires the Rust compiler.

1094
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,920
And there's already, I believe, an Arch package

1095
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,280
for it on the AUR, which, of course, there is, right?

1096
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,720
Of course, yes.

1097
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,000
In addition, we hope to upstream the Nome support for this.

1098
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,080
So we're not sure exactly what the transition will

1099
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,160
look like for non-Nome environments.

1100
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,920
But I do predict upstreaming the Nome support for OLED.

1101
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,960
It will require specific DMI information for each model.

1102
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,440
When we were doing this, we did some research and development.

1103
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,400
We tried to figure out what other vendors were doing.

1104
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,520
It turned out none of them were enabling backlight support

1105
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,800
or brightness support on OLED.

1106
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,160
So there's a Lenovo laptop that has OLED.

1107
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,720
There's a Dell laptop that has OLED.

1108
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,800
The Dell one actually comes with Linux out of the box from Dell.

1109
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,560
And they simply don't enable brightness control.

1110
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,960
And that really struck me as odd.

1111
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,120
But it also made us think, how would this have to be?

1112
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,760
If we're the first laptop company

1113
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,080
to upstream something like this, how would it

1114
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,720
have to merge into the X11 stack, into Nome,

1115
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,400
into different desktop environments

1116
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,840
to be as open as possible and work

1117
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,920
across different laptop vendors?

1118
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,280
So hopefully what we've done is generic enough

1119
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,640
that other laptops from other vendors

1120
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,120
can use it if they have an OLED display.

1121
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,880
Something else that came up on your call

1122
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,560
was some additional work for high DPI users.

1123
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,480
There's an additional component.

1124
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,240
So in addition to OLED support, we have a high DPI daemon.

1125
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,320
And what that does is if you plug

1126
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,040
in displays that have different DPIs,

1127
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:24,240
it will attempt to match them using a combination of X11

1128
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,640
scaling and changing the DPI settings.

1129
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,240
And with Nome Shell, this works really well.

1130
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,920
So you could plug into your adder

1131
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,960
a low DPI display or a standard DPI display,

1132
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,600
I guess is the way you should call it.

1133
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,040
And it will ask if you want to render the standard DPI

1134
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:47,200
display in X11 at two times its native resolution.

1135
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,120
And that way you get really crisp graphics

1136
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,600
on both displays without compromising

1137
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,400
software compatibility or having to move to Wayland.

1138
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,040
I want to thank Jeremy again for taking a few minutes there

1139
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,960
to take my call.

1140
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,920
And it's just so nice to be able to pick up the phone

1141
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,560
and just say, I got a couple of questions for you.

1142
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,960
System 76 is great.

1143
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,240
Right, easy, straightforward.

1144
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,340
You don't have to go through layers of bureaucracy.

1145
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,680
And you get to find out all of the cool details there.

1146
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,400
All the very details.

1147
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,720
So I played around with what he was talking about there.

1148
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,640
And this is how I eventually ended up

1149
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,920
setting the panel to 120 hertz.

1150
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,360
So when I set it down to 1080 to match a 1080 screen

1151
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,400
that I was plugging in, I noticed

1152
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,920
I had the option to set the refresh rate to 120 hertz.

1153
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,600
And when I ran XRender, it looked

1154
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,840
like I might be able to get other fun combinations

1155
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,840
if I wanted to push it.

1156
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,040
But I didn't want to push it.

1157
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,360
I just wanted to see what that was like.

1158
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,560
To my eye, and I'm curious to see what you think,

1159
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,040
but to my eye it seems, did you just change it?

1160
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,800
You're changing it right now?

1161
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,240
To my eye, it feels like a whole other dimension.

1162
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,960
When you and I were playing No Man's Sky, when that thing was

1163
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,320
at 120 hertz, now granted, you take your 4K screen down

1164
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,200
to 1080p to do this.

1165
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,120
No Man's Sky, it looked like we were looking through a window,

1166
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,320
not like we were looking at a screen.

1167
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,520
You described it as it's broken that screen game barrier.

1168
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,040
Yeah.

1169
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,640
I mean, you were just immersed in it.

1170
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,720
It broke me.

1171
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,440
We were both just sitting there gawking at it, playing with it,

1172
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,400
just moving, just looking around the world.

1173
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,480
I will never be able to unsee that on all of the systems

1174
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,600
I game on now.

1175
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,260
It will never be as satisfying as gaming on this system.

1176
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,440
Because of that graphics card in there with that screen, which

1177
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,160
means the blacks just are truly black, and then at 120 hertz,

1178
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,480
and you're getting like, oh, I don't know, 70,

1179
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,800
80 frames per second.

1180
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,200
I mean, when you're playing this thing at 1080p,

1181
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,800
the frame rate is just ridiculous.

1182
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,680
I mean, it's like, even at 4K in some of the games,

1183
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,480
I was getting 70 frames a second on some of my games.

1184
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,880
So even at 4K, I was getting great frame rates.

1185
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:03,400
So when you're in 1080p at 120 hertz, I can't even describe it.

1186
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,040
It broke my brain, and I will never be able to go back.

1187
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,000
Now I know my next system I build,

1188
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,520
I will have to have these components in the chain.

1189
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,280
That's just how it's going to be.

1190
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,240
And again, 12 cores on that system means anything you do.

1191
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,360
I built our app pick that we're about to talk about today

1192
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,520
on there, and it's just nuts because then I built it

1193
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,960
on my six core Intel desktop, and that thing really

1194
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,920
did trounce it.

1195
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,200
So that's what I want to talk about now

1196
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,760
is I want to talk about the actual performance

1197
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,920
because that's what you're buying this thing for.

1198
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,760
And I guess it depends.

1199
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,400
If you're buying the Adder workstation

1200
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,440
to take on, say, like a Thalia workstation

1201
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:46,200
or a similar system that you would build with modern parts,

1202
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,520
that desktop is going to beat this laptop when

1203
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,000
you go toe to toe.

1204
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,280
It's just how it is because it's a laptop.

1205
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,120
However, if you are looking for something

1206
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,120
that is beating all of the other laptops on the market,

1207
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,080
that's where this thing really shines.

1208
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,920
This is like, in my estimation, as good

1209
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,520
as it kind of gets right now in supported Linux laptops

1210
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,280
for ultimate performance.

1211
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,920
Like a mobile workstation that does all the things

1212
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,720
you might want or need to do on a desktop,

1213
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,920
but you can move it around.

1214
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,440
It's not as fast as a desktop of today,

1215
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,080
like a really great desktop of today.

1216
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,760
But it is as fast as a really great laptop of today

1217
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,920
that has full Linux support.

1218
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,040
And I want to make a couple amendments to that.

1219
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,600
First of all, this laptop has a pretty good set of compromises.

1220
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,000
Most laptops are a series of compromises.

1221
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
This one has weighed in a couple of ways

1222
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,960
that I am in my current phase of future laptops appreciating.

1223
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,720
I could see myself with something like this

1224
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,040
because of this.

1225
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,320
It compromises portability and battery life and USB-C

1226
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:01,080
charging for a really just unbelievable screen,

1227
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:07,120
a extremely fast processor, and extremely competent graphics,

1228
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,400
and a lot of storage.

1229
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,160
You can put a lot of storage into this thing.

1230
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,240
You can also put standard SATA SSDs in this thing.

1231
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,880
I mean, I have an Evo in this thing right now.

1232
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,600
But it also has, like I said, two slots, two M.2 slots.

1233
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,240
Ready to go.

1234
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,160
So you can put a lot of storage.

1235
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,760
You get a lot of CPU power.

1236
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,520
You get a lot of GPU power.

1237
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,360
It's leaning to that power side, not as much the portability

1238
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:30,880
side.

1239
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,000
If you're doing encoding, you're doing TensorFlow,

1240
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,400
you're doing these kind of CUDA work, these kinds of tasks,

1241
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,720
this is so far and above and beyond buying something else

1242
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,480
that you would slam Linux onto.

1243
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,600
But if the one thing you need and above anything else

1244
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,040
is just raw horsepower, a desktop's

1245
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,360
still going to beat this thing.

1246
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,160
That's just the reality of it.

1247
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,920
So it really does depend on what you need.

1248
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,920
So here's what I did.

1249
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,080
Last night and this morning, I uploaded a few benchmarks

1250
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,840
to openbenchmark.org.

1251
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,800
Memory speed benchmarks, where this thing really

1252
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,880
crushes it, by the way.

1253
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,760
File system stressing benchmarks and graphics magic computation

1254
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,640
benchmarks.

1255
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,560
So you can do a one-to-one comparison with this laptop

1256
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,600
to your laptop.

1257
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,520
There's a command line when you go to the web page.

1258
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,400
If you have the Ferronix benchmark installed,

1259
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,840
there's a command line that you can

1260
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,480
copy that will compare your system to this system,

1261
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,400
using all of the data I have uploaded OpenBenchmark.

1262
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,520
And you can use that to put real numbers to compare

1263
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,760
what kind of difference you would see in your workloads

1264
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,600
and maybe quantify the value.

1265
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,800
So if you're on the fence and you can't really decide,

1266
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,280
use that tool, because it's a fantastic resource.

1267
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,080
But I'll note, as you've sat here now, because we kind of

1268
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,200
mentioned the fan noise.

1269
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,840
As you sat here just using it, running, I presume,

1270
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,160
Chrome or Firefox, maybe?

1271
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,840
Yeah, I got Chrome going here.

1272
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,280
Nice, because I didn't put Chrome on there.

1273
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,040
No, I installed Chrome.

1274
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,160
It hasn't made a peep.

1275
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,360
There's been zero fan noise.

1276
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,400
No, it's been totally fine.

1277
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,200
I got NetData going on here, too, and you can tell.

1278
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,000
It's just, you know.

1279
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,320
You're putting NetData on there?

1280
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,360
Well, yeah, and it looks beautiful.

1281
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,600
So if you're not pushing it, the noise profile

1282
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,680
is surprisingly low.

1283
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,280
In fact, I think it's probably one

1284
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,880
of the quietest large system 76 laptops I've ever used.

1285
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,200
And when you push it, it doesn't seem unreasonable,

1286
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,000
because it's got to have cooling in there,

1287
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,680
because you've got a big old GPU and you've got a big old CPU.

1288
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,800
Like, you've got to cool that.

1289
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,680
And that's the compromise you make on this kind of thing.

1290
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,380
And it's not like a really harsh noise.

1291
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,680
It's kind of a white noise fan noise.

1292
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,080
No, it wasn't offensive at all.

1293
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,680
Overall, I'm really impressed with this.

1294
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,360
The keyboard is pretty good.

1295
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,840
It's not my favorite keyboard.

1296
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,240
It's not a ThinkPad keyboard, but it's better than a MacBook.

1297
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,240
Oh, but by far and away, yes.

1298
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,480
Trackpad is bigger than they typically have been.

1299
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,360
It's smooth.

1300
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,160
It's not my favorite trackpad.

1301
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,000
It's not better than a MacBook, but it's

1302
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,640
better than historically we've gotten on laptops.

1303
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,440
It's not bad.

1304
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,400
I mean, I jumped on it today, and it hasn't been a big issue.

1305
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,240
I actually, I really kind of got my,

1306
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,840
with the exception of when I'm gaming,

1307
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,040
I've been using the trackpad for the entire review,

1308
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,160
which at times was hard.

1309
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,680
But I'm just not a big trackpad guy to begin with.

1310
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,840
The I.O. is fantastic on this thing.

1311
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,600
And when you match it with the performance,

1312
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,680
it's pretty killer.

1313
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,360
And throughout, I was like, can I

1314
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,280
do this on a different distribution?

1315
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,080
I actually thought, just as a side tangent,

1316
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,520
I actually thought I'd blow Pop!

1317
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,120
OS away and put Fedora on there, or Manjaro.

1318
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,840
Sure.

1319
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,040
Never bothered.

1320
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,680
I was so impressed with the entire process

1321
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:37,200
from first time setup, where it reinstalls and encrypts

1322
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:43,920
the drive, to the pop shop, the extensions that they've

1323
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,040
chosen to install, the theme.

1324
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,400
All of it was so damn nice.

1325
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,480
And then you combine a really fast gnome shell

1326
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,200
at 120 hertz, where the animations are butter.

1327
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,680
Even at 4K, when the thing's at 60 hertz, it still looks great.

1328
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,920
I was never compelled to remove Pop!

1329
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,320
Partly because for a large portion of my usage,

1330
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,480
I was mostly offline.

1331
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,520
So I really couldn't download a distro,

1332
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,560
and so I kind of had to stick with it.

1333
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,960
But once I got rolling, I was like, this is pretty great.

1334
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,160
I mean, just having Linux already on it,

1335
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,600
then you can just sit down and get to work.

1336
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,040
And I also can now better appreciate

1337
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,080
Pop! OS's role in System76's mission,

1338
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:30,400
using it on their hardware, where they've got just

1339
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,800
some rough edges smoothed, like moving between GPUs,

1340
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,440
and hooking up the external display,

1341
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,720
and these little things that you could get to on any distro,

1342
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,000
probably, but they've already done it for you.

1343
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,320
And now I get it.

1344
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,600
Oh, they're really actually doing

1345
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,840
quite a bit of customizations.

1346
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,360
They've done their own installer.

1347
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,800
They have their own shop.

1348
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,400
They are making these extensions pre-installed by default

1349
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,280
that they think make their experience better.

1350
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,000
And I agree.

1351
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,640
In fact, there was not a single one I went in there

1352
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,240
and pulled out.

1353
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,720
And I'll be the first to be like, nope.

1354
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,520
And opened that out of there, did not do any of that with these.

1355
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,240
The entire through-and-through process

1356
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,200
felt like it was very cohesive.

1357
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,920
And I want to remind everybody that I've

1358
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,000
bought a lot of System76 hardware over the years.

1359
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,700
I was one of their very first customers.

1360
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,280
So I've experienced different levels of integration

1361
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,880
with the operating system.

1362
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,880
And in, I don't know, what is this, 12 years

1363
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,560
that I've tried out System76 hardware?

1364
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:18,920
I don't know what.

1365
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,200
It might be more than that.

1366
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,400
This is clearly the most integrated experience

1367
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,800
I've ever seen.

1368
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,160
And my instincts on it are, I don't know,

1369
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,520
but my instincts on it is they're still

1370
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,360
just getting really started.

1371
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,320
There are only a couple of releases into this.

1372
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,020
And that's why, through the entire review,

1373
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,920
I was fishing to see is it dependent on Pop!

1374
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,840
OS?

1375
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,120
Because I think that's a deal breaker for some

1376
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:38,760
of our audience.

1377
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,600
Sure, right.

1378
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,000
And each time, the answer was no.

1379
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,360
Sometimes, well, you might have to build it.

1380
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:42,760
Right.

1381
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,200
You might have to do a little customization yourself

1382
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,480
that we've done for you.

1383
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,240
But it's all out there in the open, right?

1384
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,240
And that's one thing we love about System76.

1385
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,400
It's pretty nice.

1386
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,120
Pretty good rig.

1387
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,620
You just got to make the decision for yourself.

1388
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,600
So that's why I encourage you to try out the Ferronix test

1389
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,200
suite, it's absolutely free.

1390
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,960
And that's the tool that Michael Larable uses

1391
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,960
for the Ferronix website.

1392
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,980
And compare it to the ones I did.

1393
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:07,720
I uploaded the ones that I thought were more relevant.

1394
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,120
I tried a few.

1395
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,760
Some of them didn't execute properly.

1396
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,120
Some of it was a bit of a mixed bag.

1397
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,320
But one of the fun things is that comparison.

1398
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,120
Because it'll generate all the charts for you.

1399
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:16,960
I love that.

1400
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,680
So geeky.

1401
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,320
And we'll have more information in the show notes

1402
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,360
if you would like it.

1403
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,780
Mr. Westpain, I've got a very fun app pick for you this week.

1404
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,240
I know you need another terminal, right?

1405
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,680
Like you need another shell, I guess.

1406
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,520
But Starship is a minimal and fast shell prompt that is,

1407
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,720
get ready for it, written in Rust.

1408
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,220
Yep.

1409
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:40,720
Yeah.

1410
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,640
And because of that, I saw you sneak this into the show notes.

1411
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,140
And I've got it installed right here.

1412
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:46,400
Yeah.

1413
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,100
Isn't it cool?

1414
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:47,600
It is.

1415
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,480
So did you use Cargo on that system?

1416
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,120
No, they've also got some release binaries

1417
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,840
that you can go download and just stick it

1418
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,880
on your path somewhere.

1419
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,380
Yeah.

1420
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,800
Then you've got to just add a little thing that starts it up

1421
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,920
in your Bash RC.

1422
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,080
They've got instructions.

1423
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,960
Or maybe you're doing CSH or Phish or whatever.

1424
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,360
And it's much like it's a Powerline style

1425
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,660
prompt that you might be familiar with from other things.

1426
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,320
But it's just fast.

1427
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,520
It's fast and has a nice, what looks

1428
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,600
like a nice little Tomwell configuration file

1429
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,360
if you want to customize it a little more.

1430
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,000
Yes.

1431
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,160
You will have to install the Powerline font first,

1432
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,960
which is how to do that is linked in the guide

1433
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,560
that we have in the show notes.

1434
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,680
It is just fun and cool.

1435
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,680
I just thought it'd be.

1436
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,480
You know, there's nice little things

1437
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,540
like indications of return code status

1438
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,880
or how long the last command took

1439
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,780
and how long it executed right there for you out of the box.

1440
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,680
I do like that.

1441
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,360
I'm a numbers guy with that kind of stuff.

1442
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,280
Yeah, there's lots of little configuration options,

1443
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,360
which are really cool, too, like ways

1444
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,280
to display the current prompt order and configuration

1445
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,200
on how your path should look, all those little things

1446
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,400
that you can really tweak to make the shell feel

1447
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,400
like it's perfect.

1448
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,080
It's nice that it's fast, too, because some of those prompts,

1449
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,840
once you've got a lot of options,

1450
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,280
they can get kind of sluggish.

1451
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,280
And it's always annoying when you open up a terminal

1452
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,560
and it takes any time at all to be ready for you.

1453
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,400
I'll tell you my motivation.

1454
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,920
I wonder what you think of this.

1455
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,680
Oh, that's cheese, too.

1456
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,320
I have been thinking about becoming

1457
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:13,040
one of those guys that's like, rah, rah, use the terminal.

1458
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,920
Noobs should use the terminal.

1459
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,360
Yeah, come join me, man.

1460
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,720
Because it's like the universal interface

1461
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,000
to all Linux distributions.

1462
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,680
You can message people commands that they can run.

1463
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:31,680
But also, it's like the common denominator.

1464
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,640
Your system can be really, really hosed.

1465
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,360
And if you're somewhat comfortable on the command line,

1466
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,320
you have a chance of getting it going again.

1467
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,200
Jeez, you think I'm crazy?

1468
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,680
You think I'm going to scare off all the noobs if I

1469
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,840
tell them to use the command line?

1470
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,800
No, I mean, I feel that, yeah, it

1471
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,600
can be intimidating to jump in the command line initially

1472
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,480
and try and figure it out yourself.

1473
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,120
I know it was for me whenever I first

1474
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,160
started experimenting with Linux back in the 90s.

1475
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,640
But it's really one of those things now where

1476
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,800
you can jump right in.

1477
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,840
You shouldn't be scared to get in there on the terminal

1478
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,040
and do a little bit of work.

1479
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,160
And like you said, it can really save you a lot of grief

1480
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,880
if you know enough to get in and start looking at what's

1481
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,960
going on in the bootloader.

1482
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,560
It can instantly lead you down a path

1483
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,280
to troubleshoot for yourself.

1484
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,920
So here's the other reason.

1485
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,320
Inevitably, it always happens.

1486
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,400
You're browsing the web for a guide.

1487
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,920
You eventually come across something

1488
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,120
that says, copy this command and paste it in your terminal.

1489
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,520
Now, if you have no idea what any of these commands do,

1490
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,800
you've got no idea if that's a good idea or a bad idea.

1491
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,880
You can't evaluate it.

1492
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,600
How are you supposed to be a responsible command line

1493
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,680
user if you don't use it from time to time?

1494
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,120
And then you eventually will come across an opportunity

1495
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,080
where somebody says, pop open the old terminal

1496
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,440
and sudo w get this bash script.

1497
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,640
I mean, we've all seen that.

1498
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,400
I like your idea here, though, because I don't

1499
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,480
think it needs to replace it.

1500
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,720
We should still try to get great graphical user

1501
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,800
interfaces out there, right?

1502
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,480
But for some people, that can be better for some interfaces,

1503
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,160
for some commands, for some tasks on the system.

1504
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,240
And we happen to have a great terminal

1505
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,640
environment on these Linux operating systems.

1506
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,920
We should take advantage of it.

1507
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,560
That's just it.

1508
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,520
There's some really good tools in there that aren't hard to use.

1509
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,800
They're just different to use.

1510
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,120
One example, too, and I mentioned this last week,

1511
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,080
with the 2-in-1 laptop that I was messing with,

1512
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,200
it has an accelerometer and a gyroscope in it.

1513
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,440
And so whenever the machine boots up,

1514
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,040
the login screen would be rotated and upside down.

1515
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,640
I would still be able to log in.

1516
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,140
And as soon as I launched a terminal,

1517
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,880
I could run XRender, TACO, normal, and boom.

1518
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,440
Everything's right itself.

1519
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,160
I'm good.

1520
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,520
I can go back and blacklist kernel modules, whatever

1521
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,840
I need to do from there.

1522
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,520
And then I'm done, right?

1523
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,160
Yeah.

1524
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,840
And yeah, I mean, it took a couple of commands

1525
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:50,280
on the command line to do that, because even the GNOME

1526
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,160
rotation lock wouldn't work in that instance.

1527
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:57,560
So you can get yourself out of some really tricky situations

1528
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,080
by just knowing a few commands and not

1529
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,160
being intimidated by the terminal, for sure.

1530
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,040
Back in my day, you had to write your own Xconfig.

1531
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,800
That's what I say.

1532
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,240
Get out of here, old man.

1533
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,320
XF86 config, baby.

1534
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,240
All right, listen, there's a few bits of housekeeping

1535
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,360
that we should probably wrap on, too.

1536
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,480
We should include these in the actual housekeeping.

1537
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,160
Too late.

01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,760

And we'll see you next Tuesday.

1551
01:01:44,400 --> 01:02:14,200
I'm Chris Ellis, and I'll see you next week.

1552
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:22,520
CentOS Stream, CentOS Stream, CentOS Stream.

1553
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,560
Which one do you like better?

1554
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,480
I kind of like CentOS.

1555
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,000
CentOS.

1556
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,760
Yeah, I think I find myself using multiple ones.

1557
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,480
I mean, mostly CentOS and CentOS.

1558
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,160
But it's so it's hard to keep that straight.

1559
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,480
I fluctuate on pronunciations.

1560
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,960
Thankfully, everyone knows what you're talking about either way.

1561
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,520
I personally use CentOS, but a lot of people around me

1562
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,160
have been using the word CentOS, and it's

1563
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,560
bled into the way I refer to it.

1564
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,280
I'm having that happen with GNOME Shell.

1565
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,000
The reverse of it.

1566
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,760
Yes.

1567
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,960
Like at some point, I was like, I'm going to be stubborn.

1568
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,480
I'm just going to call it GNOME.

1569
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,240
But then now everybody around me has been calling it GNOME,

1570
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,200
and now I'm GNOMing it up over here.

1571
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,840
Tell you what, on the GNOME desktop and the GNOME Shell.

1572
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,400
One of the things about the adder

1573
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,040
that I think is really interesting too

1574
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,560
is that there is the full gigabit ethernet there.

1575
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,560
So you have all this power, and you actually

1576
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:13,560
have the bandwidth to push these, I don't know,

1577
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,040
heavy graphics projects through video rendering,

1578
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,280
whatever you might be doing.

1579
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,160
Also, you got DisplayPort, HDMI, and you

1580
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,480
can do video over one of the USB-C ports.

1581
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,960
So there's all of the ways to get screens on this thing.

1582
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,440
Right.

1583
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,620
If you ever show up to a conference and they're like,

1584
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:31,120
you're going to need a DisplayPort, you're like, dude,

1585
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:31,620
I got it.

1586
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,120
I got it.

1587
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,280
I got it, yeah.

1588
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,200
I was like, I wish I had enough screens

1589
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,120
to try to use up all the ports on this thing

1590
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,520
just to go at it for a little bit.

1591
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,880
But they do not grow on trees around here, unfortunately.

1592
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,640
But I love that those ports are on the back.

1593
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,200
Love that.

1594
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,240
You got a USB on the back.

1595
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,360
You got your ethernet.

1596
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,360
You got your display adapters and your power

1597
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,480
all on the back behind the screen.

1598
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,960
So you never have to see the cables.

1599
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,360
They're never on the side.

1600
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,840
And if you're Bluetooth mousing it,

1601
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,440
you're basically good to go.

1602
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,520
It's pretty nice.

1603
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,360
Yeah, that's great.

1604
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,200
But I don't know.

1605
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:06,040
I am very giddy about CentOS 8 and CentOS stream

1606
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,520
because starting about Fedora 28,

1607
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,760
I started really enjoying Fedora.

1608
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,080
And so it's essentially time-capsuled

1609
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,120
what has been one of my favorite releases of Fedora.

1610
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,800
And I've got all these projects right now.

1611
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,400
I've got these Raspberry Pi.

1612
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,920
So I'm going to set up another Raspberry

1613
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,760
Pi in a few weeks.

1614
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,160
And I'm thinking, well, do I maybe try out CentOS now?

1615
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,000
Yeah, I think you do.

1616
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,280
I think you do, bud.

1617
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,440
But do I do CentOS 8?

1618
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,920
Do I do CentOS stream?

1619
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:34,880
Definitely stream.

1620
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:35,800
You think so?

1621
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,160
You start with 8, and then you can go to stream

1622
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,640
whenever the hell you want.

1623
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,360
OK, I just got to process that for a second.

1624
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,320
That's really cool.

1625
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,200
It does make sense, too, right?

1626
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,920
I mean, with the Rel8 transition and focus

1627
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,640
on containers, which, I mean, you're also

1628
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,560
running a whole bunch of containers.

1629
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,840
So it's ready for you.

1630
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:54,760
It's important to realize that the CentOS stream is not

1631
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,520
fundamentally different than CentOS 8 right now.

1632
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,760
It is just essentially, at this point,

1633
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,600
going to eventually become CentOS 8.1 or CentOS 8.2.

1634
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,200
So it's just a little bit of the future

1635
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,120
with maybe some new stuff that Red Hat has been cooking

1636
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:13,640
on backporting from Fedora into the Rel tree.

1637
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,040
That seems like the right gearing for a home server.

1638
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,000
It does sound nice, right.

1639
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,760
Because you don't need crazy stability,

1640
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,560
but you also don't need a whole bunch of crazy new changes.

1641
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,320
Yeah.

1642
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,320
Oh, boy.

1643
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,360
One really cool thing that I noticed today

1644
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,280
researching all this and looking at it,

1645
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,000
the 8 stream has a newer kernel than what's

1646
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,280
in the Rel8.1 beta right now, which is awesome.

1647
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,040
Yeah, because right now, CentOS stream

1648
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,640
is actually based on 8.2.

1649
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,720
Of course.

1650
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,360
Right.

1651
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,280
That's how it's going to be.

1652
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,120
Well, just the kernel right now, the rest of the stuff

1653
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,280
matches 8.0.

1654
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,440
Yeah, they say they'll document it on the wiki.

1655
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:49,960
We shall see.

1656
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,600
I'm going to be watching this pretty closely.

1657
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,400
I honestly didn't think Rel would get first to streaming.

1658
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,520
I mean, I appreciate it's not Rel, or to rolling.

1659
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,520
I thought, honestly, we'd see an Ubuntu rolling first.

1660
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,400
It doesn't make sense for an Ubuntu rolling

1661
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,080
to really exist, because what is Ubuntu rolling but just

1662
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:12,080
a rebuild of Debian most of the time?

1663
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,760
The way that the Ubuntu development process starts

1664
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,000
from is they are mass importing Debian packages

1665
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,200
and just rebuilding it with the Ubuntu branding.

1666
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,060
They don't make changes until they freeze the tree

1667
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:24,480
and stop importing.

1668
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,600
I feel like I'm much more comfortable running

1669
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,200
an Ubuntu LTS on a server than a current release of Debian.

1670
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,120
And I know that sounds crazy to some people.

1671
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,620
And I am running Debian on a server.

1672
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:35,620
I acknowledge that.

1673
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:42,560
But to me, an Ubuntu LTS feels more like a Fedora,

1674
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,640
and Ubuntu feels more like a Rel in LTS.

1675
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,040
And I think they don't necessarily

1676
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,320
need a rolling, because they've kind of nailed the update

1677
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,920
methodology where they backport the driver enablement

1678
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,520
stack to the LTS release.

1679
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:58,280
This just sort of keeps that LTS relevant and ticking.

1680
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,200
Debian default doesn't have that live patch ability either

1681
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,360
that you do get with Ubuntu, because I'm the same way.

1682
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,800
I have a Debian, Armbian based server

1683
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,160
running on a single board computer,

1684
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,320
but I also have stuff in the cloud running LTS.

1685
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,400
Also, another thing that I don't know

1686
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,880
if anybody picked up on in the last couple of months or so,

1687
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,640
but now Red Hat is slowly working through,

1688
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,760
including kernel live patching in the basic subscriptions

1689
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,320
for Rel.

1690
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,920
It's no longer a separate component.

1691
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,000
I don't think we will see that trickle down into CentOS

1692
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,200
yet, because the amount of effort

1693
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,600
it actually takes to make live patches that work

1694
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,920
is kind of ridiculous.

1695
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,200
Hey, Neil, I think you mean CentOS.

1696
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:56,560
Oh, I mean CentOS.
