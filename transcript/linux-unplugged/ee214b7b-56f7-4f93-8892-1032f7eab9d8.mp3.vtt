WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.380
Although, maybe before we start, we

00:01.380 --> 00:03.800
should probably start with a very special happy birthday.

00:03.800 --> 00:04.640
Happy birthday!

00:04.640 --> 00:06.120
Happy birthday, Brent.

00:06.120 --> 00:07.040
Happy birthday, dude.

00:07.040 --> 00:07.840
Oh, you guys.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.000
Thank you.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.760
Still out there traveling the world in parts.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.960
It's the new normal.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.920
I assume he wouldn't want it any other way.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.020
Well, I'm glad you're here, Brent,

00:18.020 --> 00:20.400
even though it's your birthday, because we went down

00:20.400 --> 00:24.440
to Intel's Portland campus and learned all about Clear Linux

00:24.440 --> 00:26.440
and got some really good takeaways.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.820
So we'll be talking about that in today's show.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.160
But that's for later.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.360
Just right now, I want to say happy birthday, sir.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.440
I kind of didn't even realize it was coming up,

00:33.440 --> 00:36.960
because I don't even know which day of the week it is anymore.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.080
Time compression.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.600
It's a real problem.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.600
I don't know how Elle deals with it, to be honest,

00:41.600 --> 00:43.680
because how do you deal with it?

00:43.680 --> 00:45.840
Do you not suffer from time compression like I do?

00:45.840 --> 00:47.960
I think I just never know what time it is.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.560
Yeah, I think there's some of us out there

00:49.560 --> 00:51.960
that when you travel a lot, you're dateless.

00:51.960 --> 00:55.520
The only thing that keeps me pinned is the show recordings.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.280
Like, if I don't do a show, I don't really

00:57.280 --> 00:58.680
know what day of the week it is.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.520
That's why when you change which day you do a show,

01:00.520 --> 01:02.200
it really, I mean, your whole week changes.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.400
It really messes with you.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.720
It's a weird phenomenon.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.880
You're running stateless, is what you're saying, right?

01:06.880 --> 01:07.880
Stateless and dateless.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.000
There it is.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Ouch.

01:10.000 --> 01:26.840
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 303 for May 28, 2019.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.160
Well, hello there, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk

01:30.160 --> 01:30.640
show.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.440
My name is Chris.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.320
My name is Wes.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.680
Hello, Mr. Payne.

01:33.680 --> 01:34.480
How are you feeling?

01:34.480 --> 01:35.480
Jet-lagged at all today?

01:35.480 --> 01:37.520
I think finally I'm back to normal.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.560
You actually look good.

01:38.560 --> 01:39.040
Thank you.

01:39.040 --> 01:39.640
You do look good.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.400
I'm ready to do Linux Unplugged again.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.000
It was a pain to be away last week,

01:44.000 --> 01:45.240
but you guys did a great job.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.080
Special thanks to my pal, Brent.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.360
Somebody has to go to Spain.

01:48.360 --> 01:48.840
Somebody.

01:48.840 --> 01:49.960
I mean, yeah, it's whew.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.840
Barcelona is somebody's job.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.500
We didn't want Elle to go alone, right?

01:53.500 --> 01:55.760
I mean, it's not as much fun that way.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.480
Yeah, so Wes and Elle are back from Barcelona this week.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.200
They went to Kubicon, and they grabbed a few really good

02:02.200 --> 02:04.160
insights from the entire event.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.880
We'll share those with you.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.320
And Brent and I are back from our trip

02:08.320 --> 02:11.740
to Clear Linux in Portland, Intel's campus.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.000
We'll tell you all about that.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.560
There's a ton of stuff to get into.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.480
But before we can do any of the community news

02:16.480 --> 02:20.000
and our own legit form of journalism,

02:20.000 --> 02:23.160
I want to say time-appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.000
Hello, mumbles.

02:24.000 --> 02:24.520
Hello.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.720
Hello.

02:25.720 --> 02:26.560
Hello.

02:26.560 --> 02:30.680
And I do believe, rumor has it, we also have Alex Ellen.

02:30.680 --> 02:31.640
She's here too.

02:31.640 --> 02:32.120
Hey, guys.

02:32.120 --> 02:32.620
Hey.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.280
Hey, what's up?

02:33.280 --> 02:34.440
What up?

02:34.440 --> 02:36.720
Oh, you know, doing a podcast, doing a podcast.

02:36.720 --> 02:37.720
How you doing, Alex?

02:37.720 --> 02:38.560
How are you doing?

02:38.560 --> 02:40.120
Oh, it's 98 here today.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.200
I am melting.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.320
It's too hot.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.120
It's too hot.

02:44.120 --> 02:47.080
Well, geez, I hope your equipment doesn't fall apart.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.720
Yikes.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.120
I'm like on top of the world right now.

02:51.120 --> 02:54.800
I pulled off a thing recently, and it feels good.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.420
You know, something I've been toying with,

02:56.420 --> 02:57.920
doing for a really long time.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.080
It's kind of been a dream.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.680
There's a nice thing happening right now,

03:00.680 --> 03:02.200
that now that all of us are working

03:02.200 --> 03:04.000
full-time for Linux Academy, we're

03:04.000 --> 03:06.720
kind of like infecting each other with Linux enthusiasm.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.420
You wouldn't believe what we did to the studio today,

03:08.420 --> 03:09.800
but that's a story for another time.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.760
It's like being a Windows switcher all over again.

03:11.760 --> 03:12.800
It's so exciting.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.080
And so we keep like, everybody is experimenting

03:15.080 --> 03:16.580
with different stuff right now.

03:16.580 --> 03:21.560
And I decided to tackle hardware pass-through in a VM

03:21.560 --> 03:22.840
on my ThinkPad.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.060
Because those that listen to the show for a while now

03:25.060 --> 03:29.240
may recall that a bit back, I bought one of those GPU docks.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.280
It's a Thunderbolt 3 Lenovo dock with an NVIDIA

03:32.280 --> 03:34.000
1050 built into it.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.180
So you get a discrete graphics card,

03:36.180 --> 03:38.520
and you get all the ports and all that kind of stuff.

03:38.520 --> 03:39.020
Right.

03:39.020 --> 03:40.080
And I got it to work.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.320
It's actually nice, but it has its drawbacks.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.240
Mostly that when you don't have it connected,

03:45.240 --> 03:47.840
the NVIDIA driver goes crazy looking for the hardware.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.500
It's pretty common that you've got this separate graphics

03:49.500 --> 03:51.460
card that mysteriously connects and disconnects,

03:51.460 --> 03:53.920
and not many other systems have that limitation.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.680
No.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.920
So I thought, well, wouldn't it be cool if I just said,

03:57.920 --> 04:02.160
ah, bag it, and let's just pass the entire dock through

04:02.160 --> 04:03.200
to a VM.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.960
Make it simpler on the host system,

04:04.960 --> 04:06.460
and now you have two computers in one.

04:06.460 --> 04:09.160
See, at first I thought I'd pass my GPU through to KVM,

04:09.160 --> 04:10.080
and I'd call it good.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.200
But now going through this, I've learned

04:12.200 --> 04:15.240
that all of the devices that are in that PCI group

04:15.240 --> 04:17.200
have to be allocated to the VM.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.880
So if you've got, say, in this case,

04:18.880 --> 04:23.280
an NVIDIA card that also has an HDMI port with a sound chip

04:23.280 --> 04:27.040
on it, those are both in the same PCI group,

04:27.040 --> 04:29.660
and both have to be removed from the host system

04:29.660 --> 04:30.960
and allocated to the VM.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.040
All or none?

04:32.040 --> 04:33.400
I didn't realize that.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.040
And it gets even more complicated

04:35.040 --> 04:37.880
with a Thunderbolt 3 dock, because you've

04:37.880 --> 04:41.080
got the Thunderbolt 3 bus, you've got the USB adapters,

04:41.080 --> 04:42.840
plus you've got low energy mode bus.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.040
Like, there's multiple things.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.120
So I really did this deep dive on my Fedora 30

04:48.120 --> 04:50.920
install of my ThinkPad of going through and blacklisting

04:50.920 --> 04:53.720
all of these PCI devices and making sure

04:53.720 --> 04:55.880
that the Nuvoo driver wouldn't load and all of this.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.460
But at the end of it, I am happy to say

04:58.460 --> 05:01.200
I successfully managed to allocate the entire Thunderbolt

05:01.200 --> 05:04.840
3 dock to a Windows 10 VM running on my ThinkPad

05:04.840 --> 05:05.880
under Vert Manager.

05:05.880 --> 05:06.600
And just works?

05:06.600 --> 05:08.720
I mean, Windows sees the GPU?

05:08.720 --> 05:11.120
Yes, now, there's one big drawback.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.040
And so I haven't taken the final plunge yet.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.160
In order to get it working, you have

05:15.160 --> 05:17.800
to uninstall the virtual machine graphics card.

05:17.800 --> 05:22.360
You can't have both the VM graphics and the host graphics.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.760
So you've got a little graphics card dance to perform.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.560
And I know how much you love administering Windows.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.640
Yeah, so I was getting everything set up.

05:29.640 --> 05:32.280
It's funny, though, because now the Windows machine is connecting

05:32.280 --> 05:34.680
over the ethernet port on the dock.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.280
And if I don't have the ethernet plugged in,

05:36.280 --> 05:37.720
my Windows VM doesn't have network.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.080
It really is too machined.

05:39.080 --> 05:39.960
It really is.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.760
So I'm going to hook up a mouse and keyboard and a monitor

05:42.760 --> 05:47.120
to the dock, and I will have a separate machine there.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.080
Not really any plans to use it for anything

05:49.080 --> 05:50.600
other than I just wanted to see if I could pull it off.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.040
But so far, it's been really cool.

05:52.040 --> 05:52.960
So now I just got to take the plunge,

05:52.960 --> 05:56.280
remove that virtual graphics card, hook up a monitor,

05:56.280 --> 05:58.160
and see if it works.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.160
If you're on Fedora and you want to mess around

06:00.160 --> 06:02.240
with something like this, Red Hat themselves actually

06:02.240 --> 06:03.720
have decent-ish documentation.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.240
Really?

06:04.240 --> 06:05.000
Mm-hmm.

06:05.000 --> 06:05.920
The problem with all this stuff is it

06:05.920 --> 06:08.080
gets out of date really quick, especially if it's

06:08.080 --> 06:09.800
documentation for RHEL.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.680
So just make sure you double check everything.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.080
Sometimes, like the path for where the grub config

06:14.080 --> 06:15.360
is changed and stuff like that.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.880
PCI passthrough was what got me interested in Linux

06:17.880 --> 06:18.840
in the first place.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.520
I wanted to put one graphics card into my server

06:22.520 --> 06:24.480
so I didn't have to buy another computer because I

06:24.480 --> 06:26.360
was a poor student at the time.

06:26.360 --> 06:31.880
And now it's so easy using OVMF, which support UEFI graphics

06:31.880 --> 06:34.520
cards, that in the old days, you used

06:34.520 --> 06:37.260
to have to eject the GPU before shutting down Windows

06:37.260 --> 06:39.600
because the BIOS on the graphics card

06:39.600 --> 06:41.280
didn't know what was happening.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.640
Whereas now, they support resetting,

06:43.640 --> 06:46.520
and it's just dead easy now.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.960
But if you're interested in this kind of thing,

06:48.960 --> 06:51.600
I highly recommend there's an Arch Linux wiki

06:51.600 --> 06:55.100
article called PCI passthrough via OVMF.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.080
And that takes you through everything

06:57.080 --> 06:59.180
you need to know about this topic and more.

06:59.180 --> 07:00.880
And if you want to reach out to me as well,

07:00.880 --> 07:02.400
I still run this every day.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.040
I have a Windows VM that I use for Lightroom

07:05.040 --> 07:06.800
and other Adobe stuff.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.240
But there's a really cool project

07:08.240 --> 07:10.120
called Looking Glass, which I think you might

07:10.120 --> 07:11.760
want to investigate, Chris.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.560
I actually have it bookmarked right now.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.400
It looks really promising, although it

07:15.400 --> 07:18.480
looks like it's also early days, and it's a little finicky

07:18.480 --> 07:19.740
to install, possibly.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.360
So can you explain what it is and why

07:21.360 --> 07:22.360
I might want to check it out?

07:22.360 --> 07:25.440
Yeah, I'll do my best because it's not simple.

07:25.440 --> 07:29.320
So when you are outputting graphics

07:29.320 --> 07:32.280
through a graphics card, you are sending frames

07:32.280 --> 07:35.760
to a frame buffer, which then go out through the HDMI port.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.960
So what this guy, I think his name

07:37.960 --> 07:41.720
is Ginniff or Galliff or something is his username.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.960
He worked with Wendell over on level one text

07:43.960 --> 07:47.000
to do some really funky stuff, actually.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.640
You install a driver, which hooks into that frame buffer.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.080
Then on the Linux guest, you run a client,

07:55.080 --> 07:57.160
which can view that frame buffer, which

07:57.160 --> 07:58.900
is a kind of shared piece of memory

07:58.900 --> 08:01.540
between the VM and the host.

08:01.540 --> 08:04.160
And then you can basically, like a VNC window,

08:04.160 --> 08:07.000
just open up the client on your host machine

08:07.000 --> 08:10.800
and view Windows in a window, if that's not

08:10.800 --> 08:15.180
too much of inception for you, with maybe two or three

08:15.180 --> 08:16.800
milliseconds of latency.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.480
It is incredible.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.920
And recently, there was a new plug-in announced

08:20.920 --> 08:23.580
called Scream, or IV Scream or something,

08:23.580 --> 08:26.320
which does audio through that same method as well.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.000
Oh, no kidding.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.560
So in the Windows VM side, it's using DirectX

08:30.560 --> 08:31.920
to do all that frame buffer stuff.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.280
So whatever DirectX can render, as fast as it can render it,

08:34.280 --> 08:35.780
it can toss it in that frame buffer.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.560
It's very high performance.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.960
It's just also very early days and a little finicky.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.560
But it seemed like a great way to get very high performance

08:42.560 --> 08:46.000
Windows without having to have a dedicated monitor, which

08:46.000 --> 08:47.360
is what they were going for.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.720
It's a really interesting kind of journey I ended up on.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.640
Because I think long term, it might

08:52.640 --> 08:54.560
be how I try to solve this issue for my son

08:54.560 --> 08:56.480
if he ever gets in a position where he really

08:56.480 --> 08:58.560
wants Windows 10.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.060
And I want to say thank you, because I

09:00.060 --> 09:01.480
got a couple of audience members who

09:01.480 --> 09:04.480
submitted me part systems from PC Part Picker.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.200
That's great, just a nice little build you can put together.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.660
A couple of really nice ones, including

09:08.660 --> 09:12.640
a nice little small one that uses a case that Linus Tech

09:12.640 --> 09:13.840
Tips just featured.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.340
And I'm really looking forward to doing this rise and build.

09:16.340 --> 09:17.600
But now they just got the new CPUs.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.100
We'll see.

09:18.100 --> 09:18.600
We'll see.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.560
I might have to wait.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.600
So on that note, there is something

09:21.600 --> 09:25.580
to be aware of with Intel versus AMD in this space.

09:25.580 --> 09:32.200
So Intel requires for this to work the extension VT-D and VT-X.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.880
AMD have their own, and the name escapes me right now.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.040
But the important thing is that you can pass through IOMMU

09:38.040 --> 09:38.880
groups.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.460
And that's the important thing you want

09:40.460 --> 09:42.360
to look for in any motherboard.

09:42.360 --> 09:45.480
And it can vary down to the exact BIOS version

09:45.480 --> 09:46.480
on that motherboard.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.680
So sometimes the only way to be sure it's actually going to work

09:49.680 --> 09:52.000
is to buy the product and try it out.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.600
So buy it from Amazon, because you can send it back

09:54.600 --> 09:55.760
if it doesn't work.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.760
Yeah, so those IMMOU groups, if I'm getting that right,

09:59.760 --> 10:01.260
is like what I was talking about where

10:01.260 --> 10:03.760
you have a couple of PCI devices that are grouped together,

10:03.760 --> 10:06.440
like an NVIDIA graphics card, GPU,

10:06.440 --> 10:09.560
as well as the HDMI audio output.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.440
And anytime you have devices that are essentially

10:11.440 --> 10:12.960
like that in the same group, they all

10:12.960 --> 10:15.500
have to be allocated at once to the virtual machine.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.320
It's all or nothing, which is tricky, but doable.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.720
There is a kernel patch you can apply

10:20.720 --> 10:26.360
called ACS, which can sometimes break down those IOMMU groups

10:26.360 --> 10:28.040
into smaller chunks.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.000
So occasionally, I mean, into my Arch install right now

10:31.000 --> 10:34.640
in front of me, I have that kernel patch installed,

10:34.640 --> 10:37.960
which enables me to only pass through a couple of devices

10:37.960 --> 10:39.680
instead of 10 or 15.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.880
So I can have two GPUs in the same system,

10:42.880 --> 10:45.520
pass one through, and leave the other one

10:45.520 --> 10:46.720
with the host, for example.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.500
So there are ways around these things,

10:48.500 --> 10:50.800
but it does get quite involved quite fast.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.520
Yeah, but nothing more than maybe an evening or two.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.100
That's about how I would sum it up.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.160
Nowadays, you're absolutely right, yeah.

10:57.160 --> 10:57.640
That's nice.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.120
I mean, not super simple, but something someone

11:00.120 --> 11:01.960
looking for a project could easily handle.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.400
And then once you have it done, you essentially

11:03.400 --> 11:04.520
have two computers out of one.

11:04.520 --> 11:05.920
And what I'm really trying to get out of this,

11:05.920 --> 11:07.440
I was telling you this yesterday,

11:07.440 --> 11:11.080
is I just kind of feel like I'm done repartitioning

11:11.080 --> 11:12.720
my disk for a while.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.640
I've got a really solid base install on that Fedora 30

11:15.640 --> 11:16.800
on that ThinkPad.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.400
I mean, I may have to repave just

11:18.400 --> 11:20.060
to be compatible with the studio machines,

11:20.060 --> 11:22.520
but right now, Fedora 30 is working so good.

11:22.520 --> 11:27.000
And if I can avoid having to reload that system

11:27.000 --> 11:29.080
by using things like virtualization

11:29.080 --> 11:34.120
with hardware pass-through and kexec, hey-o, I might.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.800
I might try to make it like the entire release of Fedora

11:36.800 --> 11:38.160
30 without repartitioning.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.740
You're in love with this installation.

11:39.740 --> 11:40.520
I can tell, right?

11:40.520 --> 11:41.800
You don't want to make any changes.

11:41.800 --> 11:42.960
You're trying to figure out anything

11:42.960 --> 11:45.560
you can do to make stuff work on Fedora, which has actually

11:45.560 --> 11:47.120
proven pretty possible.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.240
Yeah, it's been really good.

11:48.240 --> 11:48.920
All right.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.680
Oh, there's our warning that we've

11:50.680 --> 11:51.720
waded off into the weeds.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.180
Let's get into some community news.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.080
What do you say?

11:54.080 --> 11:57.240
Start with speaking of Ubuntu, Ubuntu 19.10

11:57.240 --> 11:58.780
is going to have a new trick.

11:58.780 --> 12:02.640
It's going to bundle NVIDIA's proprietary driver right

12:02.640 --> 12:04.480
into the ISO.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.600
The NVIDIA binary drivers won't be activated by default,

12:07.600 --> 12:09.680
but they will be present on the install media

12:09.680 --> 12:11.720
to make it easier to turn on afterwards.

12:11.720 --> 12:12.680
Yeah, that's right.

12:12.680 --> 12:14.960
Novu will still be the default if you've

12:14.960 --> 12:18.880
got an NVIDIA graphics card on new Ubuntu installations.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.240
Really, the change is just positioning the mainline

12:21.240 --> 12:25.000
and legacy proprietary drivers onto the actual ISO

12:25.000 --> 12:28.640
so it can be easily obtained locally post-install, right?

12:28.640 --> 12:30.200
So maybe you have a system set up.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.960
You want to use the proprietary drivers.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.200
You might not have internet after or during installation.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.120
You don't need it now for that.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.460
I guess the not having internet thing

12:40.460 --> 12:42.320
is a business customer request.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.400
I guess I got the word that that trickled down

12:44.400 --> 12:47.400
from requests on large installations in enterprises.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.640
I mean, it is nice when you can sort of do all these things

12:49.640 --> 12:51.360
and not have to futz with gateways.

12:51.360 --> 12:54.040
Do you care that it made the ISO bigger?

12:54.040 --> 12:54.560
Not really.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.600
I usually use something like the Bootstrap

12:56.600 --> 13:00.680
anyway to build my systems from a more minimal ISO anyway.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.760
A lot of people seem to be super excited about the new ZFS

13:03.760 --> 13:07.300
on Linux 0.8 release that came out in the last week.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.880
I guess there's some pretty nice features

13:09.880 --> 13:13.200
that people have been waiting for for quite a long time.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.880
Oh, yeah, things like native encryption support,

13:16.880 --> 13:20.040
as well as raw encrypted ZFS send and receive support,

13:20.040 --> 13:23.040
which, man, send and receive stuff is just great.

13:23.040 --> 13:27.280
Another prominent feature is support for device removal

13:27.280 --> 13:30.480
and pooled checkpoints, as well as trim or discard

13:30.480 --> 13:31.520
for solid state drives.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.480
All of those things people have been waiting for

13:33.480 --> 13:34.840
to be shipped as part of ZFS.

13:34.840 --> 13:38.360
Now, in the past, you could layer things together, right?

13:38.360 --> 13:42.680
You could use Lux and ZFS or some other combination.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.480
This just means ZFS has more features.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.080
And since it already does, I don't know, everything,

13:47.080 --> 13:49.240
violates all the layers, eats everything related

13:49.240 --> 13:52.040
to the file system and disks, now it does more of those things.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.600
If you trust ZFS, you're probably

13:53.600 --> 13:54.720
going to like these changes.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.880
Yeah, I mean, I think the encryption support's huge,

13:57.880 --> 13:58.360
right?

13:58.360 --> 13:59.720
And so is the trim support.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.000
That's for solid state drives.

14:01.000 --> 14:01.960
That's massive.

14:01.960 --> 14:06.480
And hey, OK, Python 3 compatibility with its tools,

14:06.480 --> 14:07.640
the conversion marches on.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.240
OK.

14:08.240 --> 14:08.720
Yeah, you're right.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.320
You're right.

14:09.320 --> 14:09.640
You're right.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.240
Have you seen what?

14:10.240 --> 14:11.720
There's a website now that tracks

14:11.720 --> 14:16.200
how many days, hours, and months left until Python 2.7,

14:16.200 --> 14:17.960
whatever.

14:17.960 --> 14:18.680
Good for them.

14:18.680 --> 14:19.120
Yeah, right?

14:19.120 --> 14:20.280
I mean, steady improvements.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.880
Are you running this anywhere?

14:21.880 --> 14:23.680
I have not updated to this release.

14:23.680 --> 14:24.840
But I do use ZFS on Linux.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.520
Yeah, of course.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.520
Do you?

14:26.520 --> 14:28.040
Who do you think I am?

14:28.040 --> 14:28.560
Where?

14:28.560 --> 14:29.880
I mean, on my, like, arrays at home.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.480
Now, I do still have one that needs

14:31.480 --> 14:33.000
to get converted that's on ButterFS.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.560
But that's just kind of been something

14:34.560 --> 14:35.560
to watch and to play with.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.680
How many arrays you got?

14:36.680 --> 14:37.960
You got ButterFS arrays.

14:37.960 --> 14:38.960
You got ZFS arrays.

14:38.960 --> 14:39.880
Yeah, right?

14:39.880 --> 14:42.320
Now, there aren't any Bcache ones right now.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.680
I need to, or Stratus.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.160
So I'm not that hipster.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.160
I got to work on that.

14:46.160 --> 14:46.520
Yeah, man.

14:46.520 --> 14:47.480
Get your Stratus set up.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.120
What the heck?

14:48.120 --> 14:49.520
Alex, you got any Stratus rolling

14:49.520 --> 14:53.040
at home in your home lab with the new fancy rack I saw.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.000
Congratulations.

14:54.000 --> 14:54.520
Thank you.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.400
Yeah, I had some offcuts of wood left around.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.400
So I thought, get it off the floor,

14:58.400 --> 15:00.040
away from the spiders that jump.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.480
Built himself a server rack.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.280
Nice.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.040
Very nice.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.840
So you got any ZFS or ButterFS or Stratus

15:05.840 --> 15:07.040
rolling any of that stuff?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.600
So after listening to a couple of episodes of TechSnap

15:09.600 --> 15:12.560
where Jim and Wes evangelized it and going

15:12.560 --> 15:16.080
to the talks at Linux Fest Northwest from Jim

15:16.080 --> 15:19.080
and the one and only Alan Jude, they

15:19.080 --> 15:20.880
convinced me that I was missing out

15:20.880 --> 15:23.680
by not having some ZFS in my life.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.320
And yeah, I've given it a go.

15:25.320 --> 15:30.520
And I'm presenting a ZFS pair now.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.240
And then on top of it, I'm using MergerFS

15:32.240 --> 15:34.480
to kind of blend it in with my normal.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.080
There you go.

15:35.080 --> 15:35.600
Very neat.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.920
Normal storage stuff.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.920
So anything I really care about is now on ZFS.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.440
Anything I don't care about is just on the JBOD MergerFS

15:43.440 --> 15:45.720
kind of XT4 drives.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.320
So yeah, I'm using ZFS.

15:48.320 --> 15:52.440
Oh no, I said Z. I'm turning into an American.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.360
We're getting there.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.680
Yeah, so I'm using it for a bit.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.320
And I must be honest, the learning curve I felt like

15:57.320 --> 16:02.080
was quite steep because I feel like if you make an array,

16:02.080 --> 16:06.160
if you make a pair, like a pool, wrong on day one,

16:06.160 --> 16:09.360
that can have some serious ramifications in a year

16:09.360 --> 16:12.000
or two's time when you're trying to recover data.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.360
So I wanted to make sure I was right.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.000
So I ran everything past Alan and Jim,

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
and they said it was OK.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.880
So so far, so good.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.760
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show

16:21.760 --> 16:24.240
that's too busy getting actual work done

16:24.240 --> 16:26.520
to care about what your silly display server.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.200
My name is Alan.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.480
Alan Jude.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.720
You know, Chris, you don't want to touch your install.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.440
I'm thinking it's time to pave my ThinkPad.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.240
And you know what?

16:36.240 --> 16:37.680
It's probably going to have ZFS on route

16:37.680 --> 16:38.720
on this next generation.

16:38.720 --> 16:39.560
I think so.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.520
What distro?

16:40.520 --> 16:42.160
Sticking with Ubuntu or?

16:42.160 --> 16:44.160
Probably, but that's most likely.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.880
I haven't convinced you to try Fedora 30, huh?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.040
I think I'll have set it up.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.920
There may be some room for a Fedora installer too on there.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.560
Or at least a K, exactly.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.600
Well, maybe the biggest hoopla news this week

16:54.600 --> 16:56.320
in the desktop Linux community has

16:56.320 --> 17:02.280
been this big post by a group of GNOME application developers.

17:02.280 --> 17:06.040
Stop theming my.app.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.840
Please don't theme our apps.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.560
An open letter from independent app developers

17:10.560 --> 17:14.440
to the wider GNOME community.

17:14.440 --> 17:18.720
This is all about users that are changing the themes

17:18.720 --> 17:22.040
on their GNOME desktop, and in the opinion

17:22.040 --> 17:24.400
of these developers, breaking their apps

17:24.400 --> 17:27.400
because they're now inconsistent with how the application

17:27.400 --> 17:29.200
developer had designed them.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.080
Isn't this fascinating?

17:30.080 --> 17:32.640
Right on the heels of our conversation with Cassidy

17:32.640 --> 17:34.400
last week about this.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.120
By the way, congratulations to Cassidy, who is now a new dad.

17:38.120 --> 17:38.880
That's wonderful.

17:38.880 --> 17:42.120
Like, he was just on the show last week right before that.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.680
That's some commitment.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.840
And was talking about trying to create a free desktop

17:46.840 --> 17:48.640
standard around dark theming.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.600
Because a big part of why people are switching their theme

17:51.600 --> 17:52.360
is to go dark.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.480
They want the dark theme, yeah, of course.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.200
Not everybody, but a big part of it.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.120
I'll raise my hand.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.440
That's right, me too.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.800
They say, all of our efforts designing, developing,

18:00.800 --> 18:04.440
and testing our apps are made futile by theming in many cases.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.900
And they do have a couple of examples.

18:05.900 --> 18:06.600
Yeah, they do.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.800
Things like GTK style sheets.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.400
Well, they can make applications look broken,

18:11.400 --> 18:14.520
and sometimes in corner cases, unusable.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.060
Icon themes can change icon metaphors,

18:17.060 --> 18:18.920
leading to interfaces with icons that

18:18.920 --> 18:22.240
don't express what the developer actually intended.

18:22.240 --> 18:25.560
And app icons, well, they're the identity of an application.

18:25.560 --> 18:29.080
So changing an app's icon denies the developer the possibility

18:29.080 --> 18:30.540
to control their brand.

18:30.540 --> 18:34.600
I really actually kind of agree with that last point the most.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.080
I think that is true.

18:36.080 --> 18:40.240
And I think at the user individual level,

18:40.240 --> 18:41.480
the offense is mild.

18:41.480 --> 18:44.080
But it's a much bigger deal when you

18:44.080 --> 18:45.800
have a large distribution that does it,

18:45.800 --> 18:47.320
because by default, out of the box,

18:47.320 --> 18:48.560
it's changed for the users.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.320
You know, it's interesting.

18:50.320 --> 18:51.760
I'm not sure at some point, there

18:51.760 --> 18:54.320
was a section of open source, maybe just free,

18:54.320 --> 18:57.360
I don't know, open source software that, I don't know,

18:57.360 --> 18:59.520
in the past we would say had a brand, right?

18:59.520 --> 19:01.600
I mean, if it's some code in a repository.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.200
But now things are thought of as apps, right?

19:04.200 --> 19:06.200
We're using those terms, and they have brands.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.600
Everything has a brand.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.560
And of course, there's trademarked art and logos.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.840
And there is a brand, but we're taking that more seriously.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.880
And maybe there's older schools of thoughts

19:14.880 --> 19:18.320
about how open source software is shipped.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.720
It does seem to be a confliction of those two things,

19:20.720 --> 19:21.680
doesn't it?

19:21.680 --> 19:22.680
You're right.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.800
We now live in a world where people want Thunderbird

19:24.800 --> 19:27.280
and GIMP to look like Thunderbird and GIMP.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.800
And developers want to be able to ship an application expecting

19:30.800 --> 19:32.840
a style sheet to look a certain way.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.240
And then you have distributions that sort of make it

19:35.240 --> 19:37.760
a point of pride to customize the distribution

19:37.760 --> 19:39.560
to represent their brand.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.000
This is not a new thing either.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.280
We kind of touched on this about six months ago.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.160
We said, hey, this thing is brewing out there

19:46.160 --> 19:49.000
in the community, especially in the GNOME community.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.200
And now we're really seeing it being taken to the next level.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.200
And there's also a response to this letter

19:55.200 --> 19:57.680
that tries to point out in its own letter

19:57.680 --> 19:59.520
that this crap's open source.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.720
So no matter what you do, we can still get to it and theme it.

20:02.720 --> 20:06.760
And it is, quite frankly, much, much, much cheaper for us

20:06.760 --> 20:10.000
to re-theme these things than it is for us to create new ones

20:10.000 --> 20:11.120
from whole cloth.

20:11.120 --> 20:14.000
And as long as it's free and legal for us to do so,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
and the code's right there, it's always

20:16.000 --> 20:18.560
going to be in our best interest to re-theme this stuff.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.280
So why don't we just try to come to some common ground?

20:21.280 --> 20:23.000
Yeah, that does seem like a good approach, right?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Acknowledge it's going to happen.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.420
Maybe we can build things in a way

20:25.420 --> 20:27.360
that at least mitigates some of the worst

20:27.360 --> 20:30.360
cases of their examples, which, I mean, those do happen.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.840
They make a good point here, Cheez,

20:31.840 --> 20:33.080
and I want to get your thoughts on this.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.080
They say, the problem we're facing

20:35.080 --> 20:37.800
is the expectation that apps can be arbitrary restyled

20:37.800 --> 20:43.400
without manual work, which is and has always been an illusion.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.020
Like, if you restyle it, there's things

20:45.020 --> 20:47.200
that have to be fixed up and tweaked and changed.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.820
That's just not how design works.

20:48.820 --> 20:52.200
Well, I think that, first off, if you want Linux

20:52.200 --> 20:55.120
on the desktop, these are growing pains for that, right?

20:55.120 --> 20:57.720
Everybody, like you said, they want GIMP to look like GIMP.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.560
They want Firebird to, you know, Thunderbird

20:59.560 --> 21:02.720
to look like Thunderbird, so on and so forth.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.920
And it is free and open source.

21:04.920 --> 21:09.660
So regardless of how they feel, people

21:09.660 --> 21:11.240
are still going to iterate on this,

21:11.240 --> 21:13.080
and they're going to continue to do what they do.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.720
I mean, I think that we do need to find some common ground,

21:15.720 --> 21:20.480
a kind of unified standard that everything can be designed

21:20.480 --> 21:23.280
under to some extent.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.980
But that's also part of the reason

21:25.980 --> 21:27.520
that I got into Linux was because you

21:27.520 --> 21:29.440
could tinker with it and change it and make it

21:29.440 --> 21:31.440
into what you wanted.

21:31.440 --> 21:35.160
So to say that all of a sudden this isn't cool, guys,

21:35.160 --> 21:39.640
stop doing this, I think is just you're

21:39.640 --> 21:45.120
pushing people away from these different distros in Linux

21:45.120 --> 21:46.680
in general.

21:46.680 --> 21:52.280
As for the iconography and the branding and redoing that,

21:52.280 --> 21:54.960
you know, that comes on the heels of the purism stuff,

21:54.960 --> 21:59.060
too, and them lifting some icons that maybe they

21:59.060 --> 22:02.400
weren't OKed to use.

22:02.400 --> 22:06.680
So to me, that's the bigger problem,

22:06.680 --> 22:11.360
is that if you take something and brand it as your own

22:11.360 --> 22:13.520
and then put it into something that's

22:13.520 --> 22:18.240
going to be made commercially available,

22:18.240 --> 22:19.800
there's a problem with that.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.360
And you should not do that.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.920
From a moral standpoint, really.

22:22.920 --> 22:23.880
Absolutely.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.000
Absolutely.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.800
Part of me thinks with this whole situation

22:28.800 --> 22:33.120
and Cassidy talking last week and Gnome and just everything

22:33.120 --> 22:38.240
that's going down, I see why elementary kind of went

22:38.240 --> 22:41.120
its own way to develop its own thing.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.960
Right, they might have the most sane approach

22:43.960 --> 22:46.560
when you play this whole thing out long term,

22:46.560 --> 22:48.440
especially if they work in a dark mode.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.520
Absolutely, man.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.880
And they will, right, because they're

22:50.880 --> 22:52.800
listening to the feedback, and they're

22:52.800 --> 22:54.240
going to respond to that feedback.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.640
So they absolutely will.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.760
And I expect that when they do it, they're going to nail it.

22:57.760 --> 22:58.880
They're going to do it right.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.880
I want to pick up on something you said earlier.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.880
You said one of the things that drew you to desktop Linux

23:03.880 --> 23:05.160
was the ability to theme it.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.520
And I'm going to echo that.

23:06.520 --> 23:10.100
I thought that was like, oh, this is next level power user.

23:10.100 --> 23:12.060
Because you remember one of the stupid things

23:12.060 --> 23:13.600
you could do in early Windows that you

23:13.600 --> 23:15.040
could get that stupid plus pack?

23:15.040 --> 23:16.320
Oh, right.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.160
Window blinds, I think it was called.

23:18.160 --> 23:18.800
Yes.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.840
Or you could go third party and do window blinds.

23:20.840 --> 23:21.640
Yeah.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.360
I thought that was the bee's knees, man.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.760
It was kind of the first step in.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.600
Oh, look at all the tweaks I can make.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.520
So the fact that that was built into my desktop

23:28.520 --> 23:30.960
was like, oh, I'm amongst my people.

23:30.960 --> 23:33.520
You know, that's what I mean.

23:33.520 --> 23:38.320
But I also completely connect with where these developers are

23:38.320 --> 23:39.400
coming from.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.640
It is probably one of the most frustrating experiences

23:42.640 --> 23:45.680
in the world to build something and care about it

23:45.680 --> 23:47.400
and then release it.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.520
And an end user has a bad experience,

23:49.520 --> 23:51.960
not because of a bug you've introduced,

23:51.960 --> 23:55.080
but because of something that happened simply by a style

23:55.080 --> 23:57.240
sheet that developer never expected hiding something,

23:57.240 --> 23:58.800
making something hard to recognize,

23:58.800 --> 24:01.720
making the UI less intuitive, or even break in some cases.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.480
And they do have some examples where that happens.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.920
I would imagine that's got to be supremely frustrating,

24:06.920 --> 24:08.240
because it's just something that's totally

24:08.240 --> 24:09.080
out of your control.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.880
Like, you did everything right.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.160
You made something good.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.760
It wasn't a bug you've created, and yet the user

24:14.760 --> 24:16.440
is still hitting a wall.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.720
And you've got to sit there and go, this is impossible.

24:18.720 --> 24:19.960
I could never be successful.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.120
And I could see how they'd want to get together.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.680
They'd probably get together at events and kind of thinking,

24:24.680 --> 24:26.080
we got to do something about this.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.120
This has been in the works for a long time.

24:28.120 --> 24:31.000
When you look at the developers that are on this list,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.720
a bunch of great apps on here that I like.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.040
The maintainer of podcasts, the maintainer of UberRider,

24:36.040 --> 24:39.840
and Fractal, and Gnome Games, and Lollipop, and Passbook,

24:39.840 --> 24:44.000
and Authenticator, amongst others, are on this list.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.640
So I think even if you as an end user react to this and say,

24:47.640 --> 24:50.240
don't take away my theming, which I can also completely

24:50.240 --> 24:52.720
connect with, I think it's worth hearing them out,

24:52.720 --> 24:54.960
because we got to find some common ground here.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.600
And this is a direction that I think

24:56.600 --> 24:59.920
is going to become more and more important to these developers

24:59.920 --> 25:01.360
on the Gnome side of things.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.480
Well, I think, like I said, this is a growing pain

25:03.480 --> 25:06.520
for desktop Linux, right?

25:06.520 --> 25:08.360
At some point, we're going to have

25:08.360 --> 25:12.200
to come to this crossroads where we say, hey, guys,

25:12.200 --> 25:15.400
everybody that's developing a distro around Gnome,

25:15.400 --> 25:20.200
we need to set some common goals for Gnome and how we style

25:20.200 --> 25:21.720
things, what's expected to be here,

25:21.720 --> 25:24.880
what's not expected to be here, and then cut you loose

25:24.880 --> 25:28.240
and let you do what you do best and create

25:28.240 --> 25:30.040
an awesome distro for us.

25:30.040 --> 25:35.120
I think, too, in a way, if we don't figure this out,

25:35.120 --> 25:37.640
if you ever did have a Photoshop, or a Premiere,

25:37.640 --> 25:40.120
or one of those applications like AutoCAD

25:40.120 --> 25:42.080
that people live in to do their jobs,

25:42.080 --> 25:45.080
and it's one of the top of the list of things

25:45.080 --> 25:48.360
we really need on Linux for people to switch,

25:48.360 --> 25:50.440
you think they're going to use GTK or Qt,

25:50.440 --> 25:52.520
and then have the user themes or distro themes

25:52.520 --> 25:54.160
break the experience?

25:54.160 --> 25:56.520
No, they're going to build their own custom toolkits.

25:56.520 --> 25:59.160
They're going to build their own custom UI elements.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.560
And they're going to ship that, just because they can't.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.680
I mean, that's what Reaper does.

26:02.680 --> 26:03.160
Yeah, right.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.840
I mean, we're using Reaper right here to record the show,

26:04.840 --> 26:06.160
and that's exactly what they do.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.240
It's kind of a shame, though, because then you

26:07.240 --> 26:09.040
don't get to take advantage of all those new technologies.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.240
Yeah, that's true.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.560
It is like a cheese as a growing pain, I guess.

26:12.560 --> 26:15.880
Yeah, we are having, instead of them shipping this thing that's

26:15.880 --> 26:18.800
meant as a blank canvas that you sort of drop on and theme

26:18.800 --> 26:21.600
and customize, they have a higher level goal, right?

26:21.600 --> 26:23.880
They're trying to make this whole end-to-end package

26:23.880 --> 26:25.480
and experience for you.

26:25.480 --> 26:27.800
And that does mean pruning some branches.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.720
You're just not really allowed to go down.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.640
Couple of housekeeping items today.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.360
So I think for this one, I say we kick off the Joe

26:36.360 --> 26:37.280
Rez original.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.720
Let's do it.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.680
Now, first up and foremost, this weekend, ladies

26:41.680 --> 26:48.600
and gentlemen, it is finally here, Texas Linux Fest 2019.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.280
It's happening.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.680
It's happening May 31 through June 1.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.120
Link in the show notes.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.520
And there'll be a family dinner, too, Friday night

26:56.520 --> 26:59.000
at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for details

26:59.000 --> 27:00.640
on that if you're going to Texas Linux Fest

27:00.640 --> 27:04.360
and you want to hang out with Elle and I and others.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.480
I almost got it up.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.680
Cheese and Alex aren't going to be there till later.

27:07.680 --> 27:08.600
They're missing the dinner?

27:08.600 --> 27:10.200
They're going to be there, though, but just not till later.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.200
I actually might get there a little earlier now.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.120
Really, girl?

27:13.120 --> 27:14.840
Yeah, you know that.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.080
I did not know that, actually.

27:16.080 --> 27:16.760
That's great.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.480
Well, you do now.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.360
That's great.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.320
Because otherwise, Elle and I are just

27:20.320 --> 27:23.360
going to totally talk trash about you the entire time.

27:23.360 --> 27:24.920
It might still happen, but.

27:24.920 --> 27:25.880
That's never stopped me.

27:25.880 --> 27:26.380
Shocker.

27:29.000 --> 27:29.960
All right, OK.

27:29.960 --> 27:33.000
So that's coming up really, really soon.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.880
And I know a lot of you can't be there,

27:34.880 --> 27:36.080
but if you're going to be there, I'd

27:36.080 --> 27:37.880
love to see you at the meetup.

27:37.880 --> 27:40.600
I want to also mention, now that we're doing the housekeeping,

27:40.600 --> 27:44.160
Friday stream, fridastream.com slash 5.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.880
I've got some big news.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.500
You know, I've been thinking about this.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.520
A lot of our shows, like this show,

27:48.520 --> 27:50.600
it's about Linux and the open source community.

27:50.600 --> 27:51.400
Oh, that's what it's about.

27:51.400 --> 27:51.920
OK, OK.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.840
Linux Action News, you know, same thing.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.760
You've got to eat it.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.720
But this show, the Friday stream, it's really about us.

27:56.720 --> 27:57.840
It's just totally a selfish show.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.040
It's really about the people that

27:59.040 --> 27:59.960
make these shows possible.

27:59.960 --> 28:00.720
Yeah, they're warning.

28:00.720 --> 28:01.840
Their stories.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.160
And some of the stories we're interested in that

28:03.160 --> 28:04.720
don't fit in other shows.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.480
Ways to express the stuff we are interested in, yeah.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.320
We did talk about some SpaceX stuff in that one.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.600
Yeah, why don't you talk about all the space stuff

28:09.600 --> 28:10.360
when I'm not on it?

28:10.360 --> 28:11.040
I know.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.320
Yeah, you've got to come on the next one, actually.

28:13.320 --> 28:17.560
There's a problem that came up in the show that only Westpac can solve.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.240
That's how Brendan and I ended up going to Portland.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.160
In the Friday stream, we were chatting about it.

28:21.160 --> 28:24.840
And in this last one, I'm sharing some life.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.320
The wife joins, and we share some big news, some big news.

28:27.320 --> 28:29.040
Fridaystream.com slash five.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.360
Yeah, things happen on Fridays.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.080
You've got to watch it.

28:33.080 --> 28:36.480
Also, speaking of things happening, we should mention

28:36.480 --> 28:39.760
Linux Academy just did a bunch of new content updates

28:39.760 --> 28:43.080
and just recently pushed out 26 new hands-on labs

28:43.080 --> 28:44.760
with a new interface and a lot more.

28:44.760 --> 28:45.760
26?

28:45.760 --> 28:48.440
No better way to learn than actually doing.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.560
And a great example of this is if you just finally

28:50.560 --> 28:52.720
want to completely wrap your head around SELinux,

28:52.720 --> 28:54.840
a hands-on lab is such a great way to do it.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.240
There's probably no other way to get it, right?

28:56.240 --> 28:56.600
Yeah.

28:56.600 --> 28:56.840
Yeah.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.560
Also, the community edition will begin its June rotation soon.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.720
So if you're not a community member at Linux Academy,

29:01.720 --> 29:06.400
which is the free account where Elle maintains a fresh rotation,

29:06.400 --> 29:07.640
go sign up over there.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.900
And we'll have a link to the Linux Academy weekly update,

29:09.900 --> 29:13.560
which has some information about the new UI stuff and the new labs.

29:13.560 --> 29:18.240
Go check out the YouTube channel at linuxacademycom on YouTube.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.440
Some good stuff there.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.240
Also, speaking of the community edition,

29:21.240 --> 29:22.760
the mobile app has that now, too.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.040
So you can get in on that stuff.

29:24.040 --> 29:24.640
There you go.

29:24.640 --> 29:28.000
Right there, ladies and gentlemen.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.200
That is the housekeeping, as I have it, at least.

29:30.200 --> 29:31.240
Did I miss anything?

29:31.240 --> 29:32.200
I think you got it all.

29:32.200 --> 29:32.960
Perfect.

29:32.960 --> 29:33.480
Thank you.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.760
10 out of 10.

29:34.760 --> 29:35.280
Thank you.

29:35.280 --> 29:38.920
Big shout out to Alex over there for working on that UI, UX

29:38.920 --> 29:39.680
stuff, man.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.480
Yes, it looks good.

29:41.480 --> 29:41.980
It does.

29:41.980 --> 29:42.480
I know.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.040
They got a good team over there.

29:44.040 --> 29:47.560
So we have been doing some legit straight up journalism.

29:47.560 --> 29:50.040
I feel so proud of us as a team right now,

29:50.040 --> 29:52.640
because we are covering multiple events across the world

29:52.640 --> 29:53.560
at the same time.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.880
And I don't know, man.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.200
It's just like big time.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.160
It's something we could never have done on our own.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.920
And that was part of a large organization.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.200
I just feel like we can crush some of these things.

30:02.200 --> 30:06.600
And so Elle had an opportunity to go to Kubicon,

30:06.600 --> 30:09.520
and she decided she would bring Westpain.

30:09.520 --> 30:12.480
Drug me alone.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.920
So it was a great event, because I got to hang out with, what,

30:14.920 --> 30:17.560
7,000 of my closest friends.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.080
And the keynote was really focused

30:20.080 --> 30:21.600
on the concept of diversity.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.060
Well, the keynote on the first day,

30:23.060 --> 30:24.580
there were lots of keynotes.

30:24.580 --> 30:28.680
And they really did a lot to promote the diversity that

30:28.680 --> 30:31.000
was going on for not only the projects,

30:31.000 --> 30:32.940
but the contributors behind the work.

30:32.940 --> 30:34.080
That's great to hear.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.880
Well, let's fast forward to, I believe, it's Friday.

30:36.880 --> 30:40.360
Westpain wakes up and takes us on a stroll to the keynote.

30:40.360 --> 30:45.200
This is obviously a huge year for Kubernetes and the Cloud

30:45.200 --> 30:47.080
Native Computing Foundation.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.800
The estimates I've heard is that there's

30:48.800 --> 30:53.140
7,700 attendees this year.

30:53.140 --> 30:58.600
And keep in mind, Kubernetes didn't get a 1.0 until 2014.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.580
And I know, we keep calling this KubeCon.

31:00.580 --> 31:03.680
But really, it's KubeCon and the Cloud Native Computing

31:03.680 --> 31:06.760
Foundation convention, because that's a big part of it.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.520
Sure, Kubernetes is the platform.

31:09.520 --> 31:13.040
But the Cloud Native family of tools and open source

31:13.040 --> 31:15.480
utilities, they tie this all together.

31:15.480 --> 31:18.080
And that's a lot of what people are here to talk about today.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.080
Yes, you're probably running Kubernetes.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.800
But maybe you're just running Fluentd.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.680
I've also been very pleased to note

31:24.680 --> 31:28.760
that while there are plenty of business, marketing, sales,

31:28.760 --> 31:32.480
and the usual assortment of team members,

31:32.480 --> 31:35.240
there are a lot of engineers here.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.140
You can tell, you walk up to any of the booths

31:37.140 --> 31:39.720
in the sponsor showcase, or you just

31:39.720 --> 31:42.040
look around at the clothes people are wearing

31:42.040 --> 31:45.960
and the name tags, and you can tell the people that are here.

31:45.960 --> 31:49.600
Sure, there's operators and sys admins.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.520
But primarily, it's application developers.

31:52.520 --> 31:56.960
These are people who are using Kubernetes and users excited

31:56.960 --> 31:59.420
about the possibilities of this platform.

31:59.420 --> 32:01.200
And that's a big difference when you compare it

32:01.200 --> 32:03.120
to something like the Open Infrastructure

32:03.120 --> 32:05.680
Summit and the OpenStack community, which

32:05.680 --> 32:09.240
is a lot more focused on the people running the software

32:09.240 --> 32:11.400
and not the people targeting the software.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.240
All right, now I'm going to play a couple of moments

32:13.240 --> 32:15.560
from that keynote that Mr. Westpain was hustling

32:15.560 --> 32:16.920
to from his hotel.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.240
So yes, Kubernetes in 2019.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.840
Don't stop believing.

32:21.840 --> 32:25.240
So let me set this talk.

32:25.240 --> 32:31.300
So there's been 31,000 contributors to Kubernetes.

32:31.300 --> 32:35.040
Oh my god.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.360
That's a lot of contributors.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.840
That is a lot of ideas.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.840
That is a lot of thoughts.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.680
That's a lot of time.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.260
And if you sit in the SIG meetings

32:44.260 --> 32:46.720
and you see how the sausage is made,

32:46.720 --> 32:48.960
you understand, wow, that's crazy.

32:48.960 --> 32:52.960
If you look at Slack, that's crazy.

32:52.960 --> 32:57.120
There's been 164,000 commits.

32:57.120 --> 33:00.040
This is a large, large project.

33:00.040 --> 33:04.040
Brian is a VMware senior software engineer.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.820
And he makes one other point that I

33:05.820 --> 33:08.760
want to play before we circle back to this that I thought

33:08.760 --> 33:10.960
was very interesting and I want to get West's take on.

33:10.960 --> 33:15.280
Kubernetes is a cloud-native platform for building platforms.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.160
Sounds weird.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.560
A lot of people don't think about it that way.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.080
Kubernetes is not the end.

33:20.080 --> 33:20.840
It's not a product.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.700
Unless you're a cloud or a vendor,

33:25.700 --> 33:28.600
you don't get anything from selling Kubernetes.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.920
The real power of Kubernetes is what it allows you to build.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.880
And that's how I want us to think about it.

33:33.880 --> 33:36.640
Kubernetes is a cloud-native platform

33:36.640 --> 33:38.200
for building platforms.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.920
And then this was West's thoughts

33:39.920 --> 33:42.960
right after that keynote, which we'll pick up from.

33:42.960 --> 33:47.080
That wraps up the keynote for the day, the last and final day

33:47.080 --> 33:50.240
of KubeCon EU 2019.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.960
I think the theme of don't stop believing

33:52.960 --> 33:55.760
is very much on point because there's

33:55.760 --> 33:58.760
something of a tacit acknowledgment here.

33:58.760 --> 34:02.300
It's an undercurrent buried a bit below the hype.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.300
There's a lot of companies here, and a lot of them

34:04.300 --> 34:06.880
are using and working with Kubernetes.

34:06.880 --> 34:11.040
But there's an open question of, how much of this is production?

34:11.040 --> 34:13.960
I think, by and large, most of what people are doing

34:13.960 --> 34:16.040
is still in the exploratory stage.

34:16.040 --> 34:19.400
And we saw that, as Brian mentioned in the keynote.

34:19.400 --> 34:23.140
Kubernetes didn't graduate as a CNCF project

34:23.140 --> 34:24.940
until about a year ago.

34:24.940 --> 34:27.000
March 2018.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.800
And that was the date when they started to say to the world,

34:29.800 --> 34:32.520
look, Kubernetes might be ready for you.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.760
It's one thing if you're a developer, or an advocate,

34:34.760 --> 34:36.200
or someone at the forefront who really

34:36.200 --> 34:37.460
does have the largest problems.

34:37.460 --> 34:39.600
Maybe you're someone like Amazon, or Microsoft,

34:39.600 --> 34:40.200
or Google.

34:40.200 --> 34:43.060
OK, maybe you need to develop that.

34:43.060 --> 34:45.520
It's very different if you're trying to just use

34:45.520 --> 34:50.040
this platform, or platform for a platform, as they said,

34:50.040 --> 34:52.000
to develop things.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.160
So don't stop believing is a call, a call to action,

34:56.160 --> 34:59.280
a call to continued action.

34:59.280 --> 35:02.920
Many companies have begun the journey to Kubernetes.

35:02.920 --> 35:04.920
And while there's so many problems left, right?

35:04.920 --> 35:07.460
I mean, stateful applications, from Brian's point of view,

35:07.460 --> 35:10.760
are still something of a maybe.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.360
But you can see the momentum.

35:12.360 --> 35:18.120
I mean, 7,000 attendees here, engineers, business leaders,

35:18.120 --> 35:19.200
everyone.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.960
And there is an embrace of this common tooling.

35:21.960 --> 35:24.840
Kubernetes, all of the cloud-native,

35:24.840 --> 35:27.640
computing foundations, projects.

35:27.640 --> 35:31.080
The theme is that instead of hiding away in data centers,

35:31.080 --> 35:32.900
because we're all using the cloud,

35:32.900 --> 35:35.480
because we all have very similar goals,

35:35.480 --> 35:37.960
there's this democratization, standardization

35:37.960 --> 35:40.900
of the base layer of computing.

35:40.900 --> 35:42.360
Whether you're on a cloud provider,

35:42.360 --> 35:45.280
or doing a little more work, and rolling your own hybrid,

35:45.280 --> 35:49.320
or on-prem solution, these tools are all designed

35:49.320 --> 35:53.040
not as full products, but as components of a solution,

35:53.040 --> 35:56.600
so that you, a vendor, a consultant, your engineers,

35:56.600 --> 36:00.200
can work together to take these components

36:00.200 --> 36:01.680
and build your own custom solution.

36:01.680 --> 36:05.120
But at the same time, leaving a robust, upstream path,

36:05.120 --> 36:07.800
a way that, regardless of what company you work on,

36:07.800 --> 36:08.600
there's a community.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.440
There's a community of engineers all working on the same stuff,

36:11.440 --> 36:14.400
because these tools are a common business goal.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.040
It's a common business platform, too.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.960
So LL, I'm curious, since you were at DockerCon,

36:17.960 --> 36:19.560
you said it almost felt like Docker

36:19.560 --> 36:21.960
was in the shadow of Kubernetes.

36:21.960 --> 36:26.320
Now that you've gone to KubeCon, is this the common platform?

36:26.320 --> 36:29.280
Did you get the other part of that picture?

36:29.280 --> 36:30.840
I think that it's definitely going

36:30.840 --> 36:33.040
to be when the worlds collide kind of concept,

36:33.040 --> 36:35.920
because I walk in, and I start seeing people

36:35.920 --> 36:38.760
from the Docker community from day one.

36:38.760 --> 36:42.920
There are so many of the contributors of actual Docker

36:42.920 --> 36:44.040
ink staff there.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.680
They had a booth there.

36:45.680 --> 36:49.240
I think they really are wanting to just be that underlying

36:49.240 --> 36:52.160
container runtime for Kubernetes as a standard.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.540
I'm thinking that's where they're

36:53.540 --> 36:54.800
going to head to their bet.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.000
That's just my opinion.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.040
I didn't have anyone confirm it, but that's really

36:58.040 --> 36:59.880
what it feels like.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.400
That seems like if I was going to put money,

37:01.400 --> 37:03.280
if we had betting, if we could bet on this kind of stuff?

37:03.280 --> 37:04.360
Next time, next time.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.240
We should come up with something.

37:06.240 --> 37:10.480
Overall impressions, L, of not just the size of the conference,

37:10.480 --> 37:13.640
because it sounds like it was huge, but just comparison

37:13.640 --> 37:15.400
to other industry events and the things

37:15.400 --> 37:16.760
that they tried to cover.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.480
What was your takeaway in that regard?

37:18.480 --> 37:21.760
You know, I come in from more of the community architect

37:21.760 --> 37:23.960
mindset of, how are we going to build the community?

37:23.960 --> 37:25.800
How are we going to get the contributors?

37:25.800 --> 37:27.800
And one thing I just kept talking to Wes about

37:27.800 --> 37:31.280
is how distant this conference feels compared to others.

37:31.280 --> 37:33.460
When I would go to Open Infrastructure at the time,

37:33.460 --> 37:36.720
Open Stack Summit, there were a lot of user groups that meet.

37:36.720 --> 37:39.300
There are established dinners, established times

37:39.300 --> 37:42.200
to go in and talk about contributing to the project.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.580
And it really is about building up and fostering

37:44.580 --> 37:46.840
that contributor groundwork so people

37:46.840 --> 37:49.740
want to spend the time helping this project grow.

37:49.740 --> 37:52.280
I didn't really feel that at the Kubernetes conference.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.880
I just really felt that it was more vendor-targeted,

37:54.880 --> 37:58.380
more trying to sell, more trying to get the name out there.

37:58.380 --> 38:00.280
The keynotes were great with the message,

38:00.280 --> 38:02.600
but I didn't feel there was any follow-through.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.800
I think if you were to attend and you're one person in 7,000,

38:05.800 --> 38:07.880
it would be easy just to get lost in the bunch

38:07.880 --> 38:09.880
and not really get your money's worth

38:09.880 --> 38:12.440
or find out how to become a contributor

38:12.440 --> 38:14.240
or a part of the community.

38:14.240 --> 38:15.120
Hmm.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.000
It did seem like they made some efforts,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.720
like there was a mental health in tech talk, it sounded like.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.160
That's something, but not quite connecting

38:23.160 --> 38:24.520
with what you're talking about.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.680
Yeah, it was more like, here's some information.

38:26.680 --> 38:27.920
Take it in.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.320
But then what?

38:29.320 --> 38:31.600
It's like handing somebody a deck of cards,

38:31.600 --> 38:33.920
but not really showing them what to do with it,

38:33.920 --> 38:36.960
where I felt that DockerCon with their hallway tracks,

38:36.960 --> 38:39.520
and I've already talked about OpenStack, really

38:39.520 --> 38:42.060
kind of give you the tools and then say, OK, go over there,

38:42.060 --> 38:43.960
and we'll teach you what you're going to do next.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.000
Is that your impression too, Wes?

38:45.000 --> 38:46.960
Yeah, it seemed like they were talking the right talk.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.720
They had the right intentions, perhaps.

38:48.720 --> 38:51.800
They want to find ways to have more contributors

38:51.800 --> 38:54.600
or find users and turn them into contributors,

38:54.600 --> 38:56.240
but it's not very fleshed out yet.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.000
So unless you already have enough motivation

38:58.000 --> 38:59.920
that maybe you're using one of these tools at work,

38:59.920 --> 39:02.480
so you're familiar and you started sending pull requests,

39:02.480 --> 39:04.600
that sort of person I'm sure could make their way.

39:04.600 --> 39:07.320
But if you're just an interested party coming in,

39:07.320 --> 39:08.900
you would feel pretty disconnected.

39:08.900 --> 39:11.000
Can we talk for a second about that message

39:11.000 --> 39:13.360
of don't stop believing?

39:13.360 --> 39:15.760
Seems like they sort of hit on that a couple of times.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.680
Like that was the key part of the keynote there.

39:17.680 --> 39:21.440
So yes, Kubernetes in 2019, don't stop believing.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.640
What's that about?

39:22.640 --> 39:24.200
Why drive that message home?

39:24.200 --> 39:26.960
Well, there's just been a lot of change,

39:26.960 --> 39:29.320
and it's not that old of a project.

39:29.320 --> 39:32.360
So you're just now seeing things like financial firms

39:32.360 --> 39:37.360
or telcos or large scientific institutions moving over

39:37.360 --> 39:38.560
to Kubernetes.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.680
There's been a lot of gains.

39:40.680 --> 39:43.120
There's huge adopters that all the cloud services,

39:43.120 --> 39:46.120
all the cloud providers provide these Kubernetes services.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.440
But we're not even, I mean, to be fair,

39:47.440 --> 39:48.960
we're not even fully out of the hype cycle yet.

39:48.960 --> 39:50.160
Yes, exactly, right.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.800
So there's a long way to go and there's a lot of work.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.680
I liked he had a slide, Brian had a slide there

39:55.680 --> 39:57.240
where he said, this is old advice.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.600
And it was talking about stateful applications

39:59.600 --> 40:01.440
on Kubernetes and you shouldn't do it.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.520
And he goes, well, here's my new advice.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.200
Slide is replaced just with the word maybe.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.240
And so it's not there, right?

40:07.240 --> 40:08.600
Like Kubernetes isn't finished.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.760
There's not, it's not some ultimate solution,

40:10.760 --> 40:12.400
but there's, along with Kubernetes

40:12.400 --> 40:15.560
and the whole suite of cloud native applications,

40:15.560 --> 40:18.520
they're all communally building building blocks

40:18.520 --> 40:20.360
they can further their businesses with.

40:20.360 --> 40:23.120
And I think that's been a lot of it is leaving,

40:23.120 --> 40:25.640
so we saw the merger of two projects,

40:25.640 --> 40:27.680
open census and open tracing.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.840
They've become open telemetry.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.360
They were very clear when talking about it

40:31.360 --> 40:33.840
that they're not trying to provide an end to end solution,

40:33.840 --> 40:36.760
like some like APM monitoring tool.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.800
No, they just wanna provide the building blocks

40:38.800 --> 40:41.840
and that leaves a lot of room for businesses on top.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.600
Maybe that seems weird from the open source,

40:43.600 --> 40:45.320
but the results I think are that

40:45.320 --> 40:47.200
all these businesses feel comfortable

40:47.200 --> 40:50.040
sharing and working on the same lower end tool set.

40:50.040 --> 40:51.460
Well, because of that,

40:51.460 --> 40:53.080
they're all going open source by default.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.680
In fact, an observation you made

40:54.680 --> 40:57.320
while walking around the streets of Barcelona.

40:57.320 --> 40:59.840
One thing that's very apparent at KubeCon

40:59.840 --> 41:03.440
is that open source is front and center.

41:03.440 --> 41:06.600
In almost every product, whether it's a paid service or not,

41:06.600 --> 41:08.800
open source is one of the first words you hear.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.220
Now you get some interesting reactions

41:10.220 --> 41:12.680
when you start asking about the license,

41:12.680 --> 41:14.460
but several of those interactions

41:14.460 --> 41:16.400
end up being with one of the lead programmers

41:16.400 --> 41:18.160
or architects of the product.

41:18.160 --> 41:20.760
And usually they just pull up the GitHub page

41:20.760 --> 41:23.100
and show you the license directly.

41:23.100 --> 41:24.480
To be clear, many of these services

41:24.480 --> 41:26.000
are paid commercial offerings.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.560
Some are totally open source and provide support.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.560
Some are more of an open core model,

41:30.560 --> 41:32.480
although I'm not sure they would like to be called that.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.120
It is very apparent that this is a community

41:34.120 --> 41:37.200
focused on open source as a balancing layer.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.600
So I guess if you take nothing else away

41:39.600 --> 41:42.400
from all this talk about Kubernetes and containers

41:42.400 --> 41:45.200
and all of that is at the very high level,

41:45.200 --> 41:48.480
it is resulting in a ton of new open source code.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.360
Some of these little companies are gonna go away

41:50.360 --> 41:53.220
or get consolidated, but they're all still producing

41:53.220 --> 41:55.000
open source code that will be useful.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.760
Yeah, I think many of these companies,

41:57.760 --> 42:00.600
I went to a great talk by some Spotify employees

42:00.600 --> 42:02.260
talking about how they had reinvented

42:02.260 --> 42:04.240
so many of these cloud native projects internally.

42:04.240 --> 42:06.000
I think that happened to a lot of companies.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.560
Data centers were set up just enough differently

42:08.560 --> 42:09.880
that there wasn't this motivation

42:09.880 --> 42:13.080
for that shared internal coding and infrastructure.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.920
And as one outcome of the cloud is,

42:15.920 --> 42:17.840
everyone was using the same APIs

42:17.840 --> 42:20.120
and had sort of the same set of problems.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.320
So there became this base

42:21.320 --> 42:24.520
that you could easily build open source tools on top of.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.840
Everybody was super, super worried for a very long time

42:26.840 --> 42:27.800
that the cloud was gonna mean

42:27.800 --> 42:29.200
like all this really crazy vendor lock-in.

42:29.200 --> 42:31.160
And it still does, it still will for some people.

42:31.160 --> 42:34.120
But Kubernetes is sort of creating this common platform

42:34.120 --> 42:35.320
that is vendor neutral.

42:35.320 --> 42:38.520
And that's why I think it has so much excitement around it.

42:38.520 --> 42:41.400
Yeah, one of the things that was a big takeaway for me

42:41.400 --> 42:42.880
that this was the first time

42:42.880 --> 42:45.080
that I've been to any container event

42:45.080 --> 42:48.200
where we actually talked about the concept of in production.

42:48.200 --> 42:49.940
And one of the things that we kept joking around

42:49.940 --> 42:51.000
is like, yeah, Kubernetes,

42:51.000 --> 42:52.400
everyone's doing it in development,

42:52.400 --> 42:53.880
but who's doing it in production?

42:53.880 --> 42:55.760
And that was always the naysayer.

42:55.760 --> 42:57.840
And this was the first conference where companies are like,

42:57.840 --> 43:00.440
you know what, we're running thousand level nodes

43:00.440 --> 43:02.400
in production, here's our failover rate.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.060
It was actual information,

43:04.060 --> 43:06.380
actual statistics of companies doing it live.

43:06.380 --> 43:08.520
Real lessons learned in production.

43:08.520 --> 43:09.360
Yep.

43:09.360 --> 43:10.180
That is nice.

43:10.180 --> 43:11.020
Yeah, they're not there, right?

43:11.020 --> 43:12.320
I mean, it's usually the easy ones,

43:12.320 --> 43:13.520
but there is real stuff.

43:13.520 --> 43:14.360
It's getting there, right?

43:14.360 --> 43:15.200
The first workloads.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.800
They talk about reliability as one of the factors, right?

43:17.800 --> 43:19.600
So they are seen in those scenarios

43:19.600 --> 43:21.880
where it is well-developed and makes sense.

43:21.880 --> 43:22.720
Better results, you know,

43:22.720 --> 43:24.440
it's not just that it's lower maintenance or what,

43:24.440 --> 43:26.520
the applications are running better.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.640
Brian, that senior software engineer at VMware,

43:28.640 --> 43:30.560
I have a link in the show notes to his keynote.

43:30.560 --> 43:31.400
He also talks about

43:31.400 --> 43:33.600
what Kubernetes is not doing well right now.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.040
It's a bit of a hype buster keynote,

43:35.040 --> 43:36.320
but I really appreciate that.

43:36.320 --> 43:39.000
Yeah, I mean, so the keynotes were at times awkward,

43:39.000 --> 43:41.840
but the upside of that is I think a reason

43:41.840 --> 43:44.600
is it was mostly engineers, not business executives.

43:44.600 --> 43:46.080
Sure, there were like product managers and people,

43:46.080 --> 43:48.480
but these were mostly nerdy people

43:48.480 --> 43:50.200
directly involved in these products.

43:50.200 --> 43:51.640
Maybe they weren't coding anymore,

43:51.640 --> 43:54.260
but they'd been coding for years.

43:54.260 --> 43:56.000
Elle, did you get any step tracking?

43:56.000 --> 43:57.800
I would imagine you must've gotten.

43:57.800 --> 43:58.640
I did.

43:58.640 --> 44:00.920
I think we averaged about 20,000 a day,

44:00.920 --> 44:02.760
except for the day that we went to the after party

44:02.760 --> 44:05.040
and Wes says, we should just walk back to the hotel.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.320
And then we were almost at 30,000 steps

44:07.320 --> 44:10.560
because why look at the map before you leave?

44:10.560 --> 44:11.480
No regrets.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.040
Oh man, that's the only exercise I get

44:15.040 --> 44:18.520
is going to cover these events, so I shouldn't complain.

44:18.520 --> 44:19.440
We were in the same venue

44:19.440 --> 44:21.120
that they hold Mobile World Congress at,

44:21.120 --> 44:23.520
which that's way more attendees,

44:23.520 --> 44:26.000
and we weren't using all of it, just a little bit.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.400
It just meant that between,

44:27.400 --> 44:30.020
if you wanted to go look at all the sponsors

44:30.020 --> 44:31.960
being displayed out on the expo hall,

44:31.960 --> 44:33.180
and then you wanted to go to a talk,

44:33.180 --> 44:36.240
well, you have to walk literally between buildings.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.320
It's fenced off in a way,

44:37.320 --> 44:40.160
kind of like the Boston airport, you might say, Chris,

44:40.160 --> 44:43.800
where you just, there's no choice but to go the long way.

44:43.800 --> 44:44.640
Oh man.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.120
And the long way is like a 20 minute walk

44:46.120 --> 44:48.480
with actual escalator, you know,

44:48.480 --> 44:50.920
with like moving walkways like you find in an airport.

44:50.920 --> 44:52.440
Yeah, you should note that the only place

44:52.440 --> 44:54.400
that they had coffee located at the venue

44:54.400 --> 44:56.620
was next to the showcase showroom.

44:56.620 --> 44:58.320
So if you were at a talk and you wanted coffee,

44:58.320 --> 45:00.360
you had to make the walk all the way through.

45:00.360 --> 45:03.360
That's brutal.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.800
Well, I know we've got even more stories

45:04.800 --> 45:06.360
that we want to share in the Friday stream.

45:06.360 --> 45:07.560
And when we do that again,

45:07.560 --> 45:08.980
I'm looking forward to some of that.

45:08.980 --> 45:09.820
And I got a couple of things

45:09.820 --> 45:11.480
I think I might ask you in the post-show.

45:11.480 --> 45:12.780
We should probably keep going.

45:12.780 --> 45:14.600
Any other thoughts, Elle, before we wrap up?

45:14.600 --> 45:16.400
I think that we are going to see

45:16.400 --> 45:18.560
and bigger things coming out of Kubernetes.

45:18.560 --> 45:21.360
I almost hate to say that because I did want to be a person

45:21.360 --> 45:22.920
that say, you know, it's all hype,

45:22.920 --> 45:24.920
but I'm really changing my mind on that

45:24.920 --> 45:27.160
and really seeing what it can do for businesses.

45:27.160 --> 45:30.120
So you know that I work day in, day out with OpenShift,

45:30.120 --> 45:33.840
which is the Red Hat version of Kubernetes, if you like.

45:33.840 --> 45:36.560
And I agree that it's not hype.

45:36.560 --> 45:40.400
There are huge, huge companies using OpenShift

45:40.400 --> 45:43.200
to run their entire websites,

45:44.200 --> 45:46.800
shipping millions of parcels every day.

45:46.800 --> 45:48.920
You know, there are huge businesses using it.

45:48.920 --> 45:50.080
So it's not just hype.

45:50.080 --> 45:53.600
I know, and it's making a maturity transition now,

45:53.600 --> 45:56.400
which you, I think, pointed out pretty well in your clip

45:56.400 --> 46:00.240
about the fact that it's really, we're talking like 2018

46:00.240 --> 46:02.480
is when this thing kind of hit gold master status.

46:02.480 --> 46:04.360
So very good.

46:04.360 --> 46:05.280
Well done, you two.

46:05.280 --> 46:06.720
Thank you for going over there.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.080
How long was the flight?

46:08.080 --> 46:09.440
I mean, pretty long.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.640
I think I set the record getting back

46:11.640 --> 46:15.320
from leaving my hotel door to my apartment in Seattle,

46:15.320 --> 46:16.720
23 hours.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.440
I thought Elle would have set the record back

46:18.440 --> 46:19.880
since she had all those delays.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.320
He beat me by one hour.

46:22.320 --> 46:23.960
My God, you guys.

46:23.960 --> 46:25.960
Nearly 24 hours of traveling.

46:25.960 --> 46:27.280
It was pretty smooth for me.

46:27.280 --> 46:28.960
I got a little layover in Heathrow

46:28.960 --> 46:30.840
and then just a short little hop to Spain,

46:30.840 --> 46:32.840
but the way back was a bit more complicated.

46:32.840 --> 46:35.280
Next year, why don't you consider sending somebody

46:35.280 --> 46:38.520
from the JB crew you've already got in Europe, you know?

46:38.520 --> 46:40.320
Save the bodies.

46:40.320 --> 46:42.600
I think maybe they wanted to go, but I'm not sure.

46:42.600 --> 46:43.440
Or maybe.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.640
I'm even more impressed that TechSnap went out then.

46:45.640 --> 46:47.320
That's really something.

46:47.320 --> 46:48.920
Well, glad you guys are back

46:48.920 --> 46:52.680
and glad that the jet lag is beginning to fade.

46:52.680 --> 46:55.960
I did not have to go as far for my event.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.520
I was lucky enough to notice

46:57.520 --> 47:00.960
that the folks at Intel had launched a meetup

47:00.960 --> 47:02.960
to explain what they're doing with Clear Linux,

47:02.960 --> 47:04.320
and I was all about it.

47:04.320 --> 47:07.120
I really, I felt like I had not really been able

47:07.120 --> 47:08.480
to wrap my head around Clear Linux,

47:08.480 --> 47:12.320
and this was an opportunity to finally write that.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.920
Well, Intel campus number two for me this time

47:14.920 --> 47:17.200
at the Hawthorne Farm Campus,

47:17.200 --> 47:19.920
and it's just outside of Portland, Oregon,

47:19.920 --> 47:22.560
and they had an event all about Clear Linux,

47:22.560 --> 47:24.200
with an architecture overview,

47:24.200 --> 47:25.720
and then some demonstrations,

47:25.720 --> 47:28.120
and now they're actually doing a hands-on lab right now.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.680
They just also gave out dinner.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.200
And I wanted to step outside with Brent

47:32.200 --> 47:35.080
and kind of share our thoughts about the presentation,

47:35.080 --> 47:37.120
what they're kind of offering.

47:37.120 --> 47:39.920
Yeah, well, first, I think showing up

47:39.920 --> 47:42.080
to the campus was really special.

47:42.080 --> 47:42.920
It was really neat.

47:42.920 --> 47:44.160
The people were really nice here.

47:44.160 --> 47:47.320
Going into the actual auditorium to take in the presentation,

47:47.320 --> 47:49.240
for me being pretty visual, I thought, okay,

47:49.240 --> 47:52.720
there's, I don't know, maybe like 60 people in attendance

47:52.720 --> 47:55.360
or so, I think the meetup page at 63 or so.

47:56.360 --> 47:58.840
And then, but I felt, at least initially,

47:58.840 --> 48:00.560
it was quite technical right away.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.600
Really technical, and the people that were talking

48:02.600 --> 48:05.440
obviously knew some of what they were talking about,

48:05.440 --> 48:07.600
and with the focus on basically

48:07.600 --> 48:09.360
the update mechanism and security

48:09.360 --> 48:13.480
were what I saw as the overarching theme, really.

48:14.920 --> 48:17.440
Some concepts that they're doing sounds really great to me.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.360
I think a lot of distributions can put some

48:19.360 --> 48:22.040
of what they're talking about in play.

48:22.040 --> 48:24.400
But in other parts, I was a little underwhelmed.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.720
Like, they were fumbling a little bit

48:26.720 --> 48:30.240
in answering some of the questions from the crowd.

48:30.240 --> 48:32.160
So I just wondered, you know, they've been working on this,

48:32.160 --> 48:34.080
what, for four or five years now?

48:34.080 --> 48:37.240
And I just wondered why the push all of a sudden

48:37.240 --> 48:39.640
to push it out, and wondered,

48:39.640 --> 48:40.840
maybe it needs a bit more polish.

48:40.840 --> 48:43.120
But overall, I was impressed.

48:43.120 --> 48:44.640
Aha, so that's an interesting thing

48:44.640 --> 48:45.480
you picked up on there.

48:45.480 --> 48:46.600
So I asked about that.

48:46.600 --> 48:48.320
I said, why the push now?

48:48.320 --> 48:50.760
And the answer essentially came down to,

48:50.760 --> 48:53.120
for the last two years, we've really been cranking

48:53.120 --> 48:54.440
to make this thing good,

48:54.440 --> 48:56.240
and now we think we've gotten there.

48:56.240 --> 49:00.520
And so this is the first of what's going to be

49:00.520 --> 49:03.720
a quarterly kind of event that they're gonna hold

49:03.720 --> 49:06.600
to tell people about Clear Linux and do demonstrations.

49:06.600 --> 49:09.040
And they're refining it with this one.

49:09.040 --> 49:10.560
I mean, well, not even refining it,

49:10.560 --> 49:13.720
it's really 1.0, this whole thing.

49:13.720 --> 49:14.720
It's the first time some of these people

49:14.720 --> 49:16.360
have ever talked in front of people before.

49:16.360 --> 49:19.480
And so, yeah, sometimes they couldn't answer

49:19.480 --> 49:20.560
like the stateless question.

49:20.560 --> 49:22.680
They had a hard time explaining

49:22.680 --> 49:25.960
how Clear Linux did stateless versus other distributions.

49:25.960 --> 49:28.200
And then after some back and forth in the conversation,

49:28.200 --> 49:30.400
people were able to kind of grok that,

49:30.400 --> 49:33.240
essentially to Clear Linux, stateless means

49:33.240 --> 49:34.760
you can install the application

49:34.760 --> 49:36.440
and not have to configure its state.

49:36.440 --> 49:37.360
It's ready to go.

49:37.360 --> 49:39.680
Nothing has to be in slash Etsy at all.

49:39.680 --> 49:41.480
And you could delete slash Etsy

49:41.480 --> 49:43.480
and the applications will still start and run.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.120
That's what their version of stateless is.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.960
But that's not everybody's definition of stateless.

49:46.960 --> 49:48.640
And they didn't come out with a clear answer

49:48.640 --> 49:49.480
to that right away.

49:49.480 --> 49:50.640
And I think that's what you picked up on

49:50.640 --> 49:52.280
was one of those instances,

49:52.280 --> 49:54.880
and that is them working this out.

49:54.880 --> 49:58.760
But that message of we've been really working

49:58.760 --> 49:59.840
at this thing for two years,

49:59.840 --> 50:02.200
and now we're just gonna start talking about it like crazy.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.200
Like they're ramping up a whole messaging program

50:04.200 --> 50:05.080
around this.

50:05.080 --> 50:06.840
I think she said next month,

50:06.840 --> 50:08.680
I talked to Chris, one of their,

50:08.680 --> 50:11.840
she's one of their head open source community organizers.

50:11.840 --> 50:13.640
And she said that they're doing essentially

50:13.640 --> 50:16.120
this same presentation with this same crew,

50:16.120 --> 50:17.320
but they're gonna take another crack at it

50:17.320 --> 50:19.200
in California next month.

50:19.200 --> 50:23.320
I think maybe it's their strength is iteration.

50:23.320 --> 50:26.600
If you saw the version numbers on ClearOS,

50:26.600 --> 50:27.760
they're pretty high.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.080
They're very high.

50:29.080 --> 50:30.680
So maybe that's one of their strengths.

50:30.680 --> 50:32.600
I mean, a lot of these people are really technical.

50:32.600 --> 50:35.320
So iteration is a good way to push forward, right?

50:35.320 --> 50:37.240
So maybe this presentation, it's a first go.

50:37.240 --> 50:39.280
They're here, they're doing it smaller group.

50:39.280 --> 50:41.200
Maybe in California, they can have a bigger groups

50:41.200 --> 50:42.320
and practice and things like that.

50:42.320 --> 50:44.080
So maybe it's a good approach.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.520
Yeah, I'd be curious to circle back to this in a quarter

50:46.520 --> 50:48.400
and see what the presentation is like

50:48.400 --> 50:49.680
and see what they're talking about.

50:49.680 --> 50:50.520
And you know, I'll say this,

50:50.520 --> 50:52.120
I learned a few things in the presentation

50:52.120 --> 50:54.040
that I didn't quite understand before,

50:54.040 --> 50:56.320
about how they control versions, about how the updates,

50:56.320 --> 50:57.680
how bundles work.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.320
Like that was pretty good to wrap my head around.

50:59.320 --> 51:02.360
And I think it makes it worth the trip down here alone.

51:02.360 --> 51:03.560
But then to get the bigger picture

51:03.560 --> 51:05.480
where Intel is going with this,

51:05.480 --> 51:06.880
they're clearly trying to build something

51:06.880 --> 51:08.400
for the entire stack.

51:08.400 --> 51:11.440
So you have an OS that's optimized for your containers.

51:11.440 --> 51:13.560
You have an OS that's optimized for machine learning.

51:13.560 --> 51:16.480
You have OSs that are optimized for developer workstations.

51:16.480 --> 51:18.160
Because their whole approach is,

51:18.160 --> 51:19.760
you can use them as upstream

51:19.760 --> 51:22.160
and then bundle up and mix your own software

51:22.160 --> 51:23.440
and make it your own distribution

51:23.440 --> 51:26.520
with them as sort of a, a sort of upstream.

51:26.520 --> 51:29.200
It could be a compelling sell to some enterprises.

51:29.200 --> 51:30.360
So we'll see how they do.

51:30.360 --> 51:31.200
I'm glad we made it.

51:31.200 --> 51:32.640
You, are you glad you came down here?

51:32.640 --> 51:33.480
I'm definitely glad.

51:33.480 --> 51:36.320
I mean, it's been great to be more part of the community

51:36.320 --> 51:39.240
and having someone like Intel pushing something out,

51:39.240 --> 51:41.000
of course we're going to have to be here and cover it.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.320
I'm really glad we made it.

51:42.320 --> 51:43.840
And I would, like I said,

51:43.840 --> 51:45.880
I got an opportunity to better understand

51:45.880 --> 51:48.040
a couple of aspects of clear Linux.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.160
And I thought maybe I'd share

51:50.160 --> 51:52.040
a few of those insights with you.

51:52.040 --> 51:55.440
The thing I didn't really understand before was bundles.

51:55.440 --> 51:57.240
So I grabbed a little audio,

51:57.240 --> 51:59.800
the entire presentation where the audio is,

51:59.800 --> 52:01.920
the recording, the audio is actually much, much worse

52:01.920 --> 52:02.760
than what I'm about to play.

52:02.760 --> 52:03.600
Wow.

52:03.600 --> 52:05.280
It's like done over a phone line.

52:05.280 --> 52:06.400
So it's quite bad.

52:06.400 --> 52:09.120
But I have the link to the, to a video version

52:09.120 --> 52:11.960
and a link to the slides, if you want to know more,

52:11.960 --> 52:12.800
and if you want to see the slides

52:12.800 --> 52:14.200
to this guy's presentation.

52:14.200 --> 52:16.080
But here's a little, little tiny bit

52:16.080 --> 52:18.720
about what bundles are in clear Linux.

52:18.720 --> 52:23.720
So the idea behind, behind bundles is to simplify

52:24.160 --> 52:28.120
discovery installation of, of the software that you need

52:28.120 --> 52:30.440
to satisfy certain use cases.

52:30.440 --> 52:33.480
If you're familiar with the set of bundles

52:33.480 --> 52:36.440
that phones provide, right now there's around 900 or so.

52:36.440 --> 52:38.240
A lot of them, especially the ones that have been around

52:38.240 --> 52:42.080
for a long time are, are very use case focused.

52:42.080 --> 52:44.000
Some of them are providing, you know,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.520
like interpreters for various languages

52:46.520 --> 52:49.520
like Python two, Python three, et cetera.

52:49.520 --> 52:51.840
But others are a bit more use case focused

52:51.840 --> 52:55.400
like application server, cloud control.

52:55.400 --> 52:57.520
Some of the ones that I've, that are shown

52:57.520 --> 52:59.720
in the diagram on the right.

52:59.720 --> 53:01.960
Bundles are, you can kind of think of them

53:01.960 --> 53:05.040
as similar to package groups and other distros in a way.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.920
And they can be more work case specific.

53:06.920 --> 53:09.240
They can have a wider range of applications.

53:09.240 --> 53:11.380
Some of them are fairly complicated.

53:11.380 --> 53:15.760
And another aspect about packaging on clear Linux

53:15.760 --> 53:17.680
that is unique to clear Linux

53:17.680 --> 53:19.800
is when they resolve dependencies.

53:19.800 --> 53:21.600
It's not when you install a package.

53:21.600 --> 53:24.040
All dependencies are resolved at build time

53:24.040 --> 53:26.300
instead of at runtime, which is what you usually see

53:26.300 --> 53:29.040
with package managers and other distributions.

53:29.040 --> 53:32.120
The main motivation behind this is to keep things simple

53:32.120 --> 53:34.880
for what's running on the end user system.

53:34.880 --> 53:37.080
And also just to speed up update times

53:37.080 --> 53:39.280
is another motivation for that.

53:39.280 --> 53:40.280
It's kind of neat, huh?

53:40.280 --> 53:42.760
I like that they're rethinking some things

53:42.760 --> 53:44.640
about how you put together a Linux distribution.

53:44.640 --> 53:46.520
And we've seen that in other projects,

53:46.520 --> 53:49.960
but few with backers who have the resources of Intel, right?

53:49.960 --> 53:51.180
So they might actually get away with it

53:51.180 --> 53:53.760
if they can get enough stuff running on their system.

53:53.760 --> 53:55.640
And Brent, I don't know about you,

53:55.640 --> 53:58.720
but I had the sense that we were witnessing

53:58.720 --> 54:01.720
the beginning of something new for Intel.

54:01.720 --> 54:04.880
Yeah, I like that insight too.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.960
It felt like we were there at the start

54:06.960 --> 54:09.320
and that there were some small group people

54:09.320 --> 54:11.560
that are pretty jazzed about what they were doing.

54:11.560 --> 54:13.600
And we weren't the only ones trying to wrap our heads

54:13.600 --> 54:14.520
around everything they were doing.

54:14.520 --> 54:16.300
There was a lot of really insightful questions

54:16.300 --> 54:19.200
coming from the audience and some really good answers too.

54:19.200 --> 54:24.200
And they were also kind of upfront when they said,

54:24.480 --> 54:26.680
we're still learning about this too at the same time.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.520
So when we know more,

54:27.520 --> 54:29.520
we'll definitely communicate more about that.

54:29.520 --> 54:32.440
So it was kind of neat to see that back and forth happening

54:32.440 --> 54:36.440
between the audience and the clear OS team as well.

54:36.440 --> 54:38.240
Can I ask, it seems like we're,

54:38.240 --> 54:39.860
maybe skeptical is too strong of a word,

54:39.860 --> 54:41.240
but we're obviously very curious about

54:41.240 --> 54:44.040
why Intel's doing this, what are the motivations?

54:44.040 --> 54:45.560
It's funny, especially in the times, right?

54:45.560 --> 54:47.320
We've just lost Antegos

54:47.320 --> 54:50.280
and we've seen many small distributions die off.

54:50.280 --> 54:52.040
Should we just be kind of happy

54:52.040 --> 54:54.720
that there's a new player in the field?

54:54.720 --> 54:57.200
Yes, I think that is a default,

54:57.200 --> 55:01.600
but I think we're underestimating them.

55:01.600 --> 55:03.640
Part of what I got a better appreciation of

55:03.640 --> 55:04.820
over the last couple of years,

55:04.820 --> 55:07.600
because you remember it was not too long ago,

55:07.600 --> 55:11.120
I went to meet BSD, which was also at the Intel campus.

55:11.120 --> 55:13.840
And that's where I learned like the number of people

55:13.840 --> 55:16.380
in their open source division is over 100.

55:16.380 --> 55:18.040
Like we're talking...

55:18.040 --> 55:19.480
That's some significant staffing, yeah.

55:19.480 --> 55:23.120
Yeah, I mean, so they have some resources here

55:23.120 --> 55:26.200
and they've been really heads down

55:26.200 --> 55:27.960
for about two years on Clear Linux.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.540
And I think they're kind of getting to a point now

55:30.540 --> 55:32.560
where they're pretty proud of what they made

55:32.560 --> 55:35.120
because they've built a couple of different scenarios

55:35.120 --> 55:37.600
where you can see there's some clear advantages,

55:37.600 --> 55:41.400
ha ha ha, and they're able to tout those use cases.

55:41.400 --> 55:42.740
And it's compelling.

55:42.740 --> 55:46.020
In fact, they don't really talk about this very much,

55:46.020 --> 55:50.400
but even on AMD systems, you can see clear optimizations

55:50.400 --> 55:52.400
and benefits of using Clear Linux.

55:52.400 --> 55:53.960
Yeah, it's not just Intel.

55:53.960 --> 55:55.160
So they've done a good job with it.

55:55.160 --> 55:56.960
Yeah, it's really anything back to Haswell,

55:56.960 --> 56:01.960
and which is any modern CPU, it's gonna work great.

56:02.380 --> 56:06.160
And they have a very sharp community manager, Carrie,

56:06.160 --> 56:07.320
who I met.

56:07.320 --> 56:08.720
She's also, she's doing like...

56:08.720 --> 56:10.200
Do you remember the name of the podcast, Brent,

56:10.200 --> 56:11.120
that they're doing?

56:11.120 --> 56:12.840
Something like Open Source Voices.

56:12.840 --> 56:13.680
Or Clear Voices.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.360
Clear Voices, something like that.

56:15.360 --> 56:16.200
We'll have to find it.

56:16.200 --> 56:17.120
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to her more

56:17.120 --> 56:20.540
and see if maybe we can't be of assistance in some way.

56:20.540 --> 56:23.440
But she was really sharp and I think they have a good plan

56:23.440 --> 56:24.720
of how to try to get the word out there.

56:24.720 --> 56:27.400
They're not, they're just getting started.

56:27.400 --> 56:31.820
So I think our skepticism that we have today at mid-2019,

56:31.820 --> 56:33.560
at this time in 2020, will be gone.

56:33.560 --> 56:36.960
It'll be obvious what their value is, I think.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.320
And I think they're gonna do a good job explaining it.

56:39.320 --> 56:41.360
Well, I've got it running on my system,

56:41.360 --> 56:43.560
and maybe I'll just let it stick around for a while.

56:43.560 --> 56:44.520
What did you think of the install?

56:44.520 --> 56:46.320
Did you use the GUI installer or did you use the...

56:46.320 --> 56:47.720
I did use the GUI.

56:47.720 --> 56:48.600
What'd you think?

56:48.600 --> 56:50.560
For me, it was actually surprisingly smooth.

56:50.560 --> 56:52.200
Really? Yeah, I didn't mind it.

56:52.200 --> 56:53.520
And now you have GNOME?

56:53.520 --> 56:54.360
Or what, what'd you go with?

56:54.360 --> 56:55.960
I mean, I'm back in Plasma for the show.

56:55.960 --> 56:58.560
I wasn't ready to do Unplugged on that.

56:58.560 --> 56:59.920
Did you do it in a VM?

56:59.920 --> 57:02.800
I did it in a VM, but I booted into it as well.

57:02.800 --> 57:03.920
Did you K-exec into it?

57:03.920 --> 57:04.760
I mean, maybe.

57:04.760 --> 57:07.120
I can't believe you.

57:07.120 --> 57:08.960
Well, it's just the easiest way to try it out, okay?

57:08.960 --> 57:10.840
Okay, well, how come you don't show me how to do this?

57:10.840 --> 57:12.480
This is something I wanna know how you do.

57:12.480 --> 57:13.320
That I can do.

57:13.320 --> 57:15.520
So you're applying it, so you installed it via a VM,

57:15.520 --> 57:17.760
and then once it's a VM, you K-exec into it

57:17.760 --> 57:20.080
and run it like it's on your actual machine.

57:20.080 --> 57:22.680
Like, then at that point, it thinks it's running,

57:22.680 --> 57:24.800
I mean, it is running, your kernel switches over to it,

57:24.800 --> 57:25.640
right? Yeah, I mean,

57:25.640 --> 57:26.720
there's like a little overhead with the way

57:26.720 --> 57:27.720
the disk is set up right now.

57:27.720 --> 57:28.720
It doesn't have to be that way,

57:28.720 --> 57:30.440
but otherwise it works great.

57:30.440 --> 57:34.280
Okay, how does K-exec compare to like a Chirrut

57:34.280 --> 57:37.880
or an Alex C or something?

57:37.880 --> 57:39.800
The biggest difference is just that it's booting

57:39.800 --> 57:41.360
into a new kernel, basically.

57:41.360 --> 57:42.560
So you could do it with grub too.

57:42.560 --> 57:46.520
The K-exec part is just a little smoother or faster,

57:46.520 --> 57:48.480
I guess, you don't have to make a modification to your-

57:48.480 --> 57:50.920
The host OS just goes away?

57:50.920 --> 57:52.720
Is it like just pulling the power point?

57:52.720 --> 57:54.400
It like loads the new kernel in memory

57:54.400 --> 57:55.600
and then jumps to the new kernel.

57:55.600 --> 57:57.200
So as far as like the processes are concerned,

57:57.200 --> 57:58.800
you've just pulled the power on your machine?

57:58.800 --> 58:01.840
Yes, System D has a nice command option,

58:01.840 --> 58:03.960
so it will do all the shutdown stuff,

58:03.960 --> 58:06.320
and at the very end, instead of like issuing a halt,

58:06.320 --> 58:07.360
it'll do a K-exec.

58:08.360 --> 58:10.720
This has been built with a kernel for a while now.

58:10.720 --> 58:13.400
Yeah, there's a whole bootloader based around

58:13.400 --> 58:14.520
just using it, right?

58:14.520 --> 58:16.560
It's such a great, this is between that

58:16.560 --> 58:19.040
and hardware pass-through with my virtual machines,

58:19.040 --> 58:22.440
I just feel like I could make it an entire release cycle

58:22.440 --> 58:23.840
without having to repartition.

58:23.840 --> 58:25.560
I could try out different distros

58:25.560 --> 58:27.840
with full hardware support.

58:27.840 --> 58:30.560
Clear Linux though, as a workstation,

58:30.560 --> 58:32.360
that I feel like I would want to give a go

58:32.360 --> 58:34.720
on physical hardware for a while.

58:34.720 --> 58:37.320
It's to me, it's a clear winner on the server

58:37.320 --> 58:39.200
and as a container platform,

58:39.200 --> 58:41.320
depending on what your different workloads are,

58:41.320 --> 58:43.440
what your requirements are.

58:43.440 --> 58:46.240
But as the workstation OS, maybe.

58:46.240 --> 58:47.520
I mean, they do have support for Flatpak,

58:47.520 --> 58:49.200
so that does open the door to a lot of apps.

58:49.200 --> 58:50.600
That's what I'm curious about is, you know,

58:50.600 --> 58:52.720
how well they've changed the idea, right?

58:52.720 --> 58:54.600
They've gone from packages to bundles.

58:54.600 --> 58:55.680
How well does that play out?

58:55.680 --> 58:57.760
And I'm not sure on a server I wouldn't,

58:57.760 --> 58:59.840
I might not interact with that as much as I would

58:59.840 --> 59:00.680
on a desktop.

59:00.680 --> 59:03.520
And it's a rolling release distro to the extreme.

59:03.520 --> 59:07.400
Like they sometimes have three releases in a day.

59:07.400 --> 59:08.520
Woo.

59:08.520 --> 59:09.760
Yeah.

59:09.760 --> 59:12.240
And what's crazy is there's a way to build

59:12.240 --> 59:14.280
every version they've ever released

59:14.280 --> 59:17.520
and they keep on their server the source code

59:17.520 --> 59:21.500
and compiled versions of every version

59:21.500 --> 59:22.720
they've ever released, every branch.

59:22.720 --> 59:24.440
You remember what their version number that they're at now?

59:24.440 --> 59:26.240
It's something like in the thousands,

59:26.240 --> 59:28.000
like maybe the multiples of thousands.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.720
Yeah, they iterate on tens, if I remember correctly.

59:30.720 --> 59:35.720
So, but the number was at like 2,500,

59:35.760 --> 59:36.600
something like that.

59:36.600 --> 59:37.520
It was ridiculous.

59:37.520 --> 59:41.680
Yeah, and so they keep a copy on their servers

59:41.680 --> 59:44.000
and they were just moving around cloud providers

59:44.000 --> 59:48.360
and they say when they apply aggressive deduplication,

59:48.360 --> 59:52.480
the whole ClearLinux source stack is about 16 terabytes.

59:52.480 --> 59:55.240
But if they don't apply aggressive dedupe,

59:55.240 --> 59:56.520
do you have a guess?

59:56.520 --> 59:57.360
You have a guess what it would be?

59:57.360 --> 59:58.520
100 terabytes?

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.560
Very close, 76 terabytes.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:03.000
Yeah, 76.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.120
So they said, we might not do this forever.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.960
We might not keep every build forever.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.160
Giant, immutable storage of all packages.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.440
I would love to know how big the Ubuntu package archives are

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.840
just for comparison.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.920
I wonder, you figure ClearLinux has been around

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.480
for a couple of years and it's that large.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.720
I can't do that forever.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.560
They are Intel though.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.480
Right, but they're moving fast,

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.080
so generating lots of versions.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.120
Yeah, yeah, it looks like, I think it's a,

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.520
I feel like it is a Linux distribution

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.440
that deserves to be here.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.720
All right, so when do you think we're gonna see

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.040
the first distro based on ClearLinux?

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.080
Oh, hmm.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.160
But you know, with its own branding and website.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.320
It seems like that'd be pretty doable

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.520
because they have this whole mix system

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.400
where you can mix your own ClearLinux

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.720
that has like stuff pre-built in and ready to go

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.520
that's still based on their upstream stuff.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:57.280
So it's almost like a distro re-spinners dream in a way.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.960
They've already thought of that and made it easy for you.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.080
Or does that just mean that they won't need it as much

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:03.920
because you can do it yourself?

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.800
Have you thought of a date?

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.120
Have you thought of a timeline?

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.760
Because I had, you know, you just sprung this up.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.920
No, I just think of that might be a sign of a success

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.440
at some point.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.640
So the numbers are in.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.640
Pixel Geek from the IRC says the version number current

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.240
is 29,660.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.080
How about that?

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:24.920
That's their version number.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.760
Go, baby, go.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.440
29,000.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.280
Version 29,000.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.640
Take that, Chrome.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.640
Wow, yeah.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.320
I just missed a decimal point.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.160
No big deal.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.760
Oh, yeah.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.040
Jeez.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.200
Well, anyways, you're right.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.480
Anyways, it was a cool insight,

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.600
and I feel like I understand them a lot better now.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.920
And I'm kind of rooting for them.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.360
Are they going to do more of these events?

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.560
Yeah, frequently.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.920
In fact, I think next month they have one in California

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.760
or something like that,

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.440
and then they're going to try to do one.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.000
I think they're at the campus like nearly every quarter.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:56.840
They're important.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.360
Wow, that's a lot of outreach.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.280
Yeah, it is.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.120
It is.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.720
They did a catered dinner too.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.240
Wow, first class.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.360
They really had a nice setup.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.120
You get there and it's structured beautifully.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.240
You start with a architecture overview

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.040
that was really well presented by,

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.240
I believe his name was Patrick McCarty.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.880
And he did a great job of going through

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.960
the overall architecture of it.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.640
Then you got a couple of use case demos.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.320
So they did some onstage demos

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.080
of how Clear Linux can be kind of handy.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.240
And they were legit demos.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.400
Then you break for dinner,

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.880
and then you come back and it's hands-on.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.720
You set up Clear Linux,

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.560
you go through some scenarios

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.280
with the engineers in the room there.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.440
And you just bug them for any questions or tips.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.920
Yeah, and the Intel campus is,

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.000
they have auditoriums.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.320
In fact, I encourage everyone

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.800
to go check out the blog posts for,

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.680
don't call it a blog.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.640
They're really articles.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.320
They're not blogs, they're articles.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:53.320
For both Wes and Elle's trip to Barcelona,

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.080
and Brent and my trip to Portland,

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.480
they're both beautifully visualized.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.680
What's the word I'm looking for?

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.200
Come on, Wes, help me out, great photos.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.320
You guys, did you take that photo of Elle?

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.160
Yeah.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.000
That's a great photo.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.960
Yeah, that worked out really nicely.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.040
I mean, and you know.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:08.880
Elle, I'm just saying.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.720
Working with a good subject, too.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.560
That photo, that photo that Wes took of you

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.600
would make like a good Twitter banner, you know?

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.440
It's a little scary,

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.920
because I never saw him take them.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:20.040
That's always the best ones.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.120
Those are always the best photos.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.280
In your element.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.880
Yeah, and you can see me being a goof.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.760
In your element.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.720
A hint of some of my big news.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.800
Those are both posted.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.520
Brent wrote up the trip to Portland,

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.840
and Elle wrote up the trip to Kubicon.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.120
And they're both posted.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.480
Now, they're in the show notes.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.960
But if you would like to just go over there,

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.640
if you click on the little blog link,

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.480
I don't know why they call it that,

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.320
because they're articles.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.280
Articles. Obviously, obviously.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.760
Or you go to linuxonplug.com slash articles,

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.640
then you'll see them.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.920
And many others, like my factory tour of system memory

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.760
went to systems.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.600
That was a lot of fun.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.600
It's on there, too.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.800
Great write up, both of you.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.000
Elle and Brent, you guys.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:57.840
Thank you, guys.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.640
Yeah, yeah, and Cheese's previous write ups

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.560
about LinuxFest are on there.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.640
So go check that out.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.360
We don't talk about it very much,

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.040
but this is an audio podcast,

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.520
and there's some great visuals right there on the blog.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:12.320
So you can go check it out all over at linuxonplug.com.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.440
And while you're over there,

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.720
go to linuxonplug.com slash contact,

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.960
and send us your feedback.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.160
Of course, we've got this wonderful virtual lug,

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.040
but not everybody can make it on a 2 p.m.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.480
We get it, it's a hard time.

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.520
Tuesdays are workdays.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.280
And 2 p.m. is, that's Pacific time.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.840
Who's, we're at the end of the world over here.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.680
Who's in Pacific time, right?

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.240
Yeah, so I totally get it.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.040
So let us know what you think.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.800
Go to linuxonplug.com slash contact,

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.520
and also linuxonplug.reddit.com.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.440
We monitor both those and Telegram,

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.520
jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.560
Now the show is live.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.000
I'll be doing it from Texas next week.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.160
We'll see how that goes.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.560
Thanks so much for tuning in.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.120
See you back here next Tuesday.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:05:08.120
I'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:31.440
So the one thing that we didn't talk about in the show,

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.600
because it'd be completely inappropriate,

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.200
but I'm curious to hear your take and Elle's take

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.120
on how the press aspect of Kubicon was.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.400
Did they have a media room?

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.000
Was there media food and all that kind of stuff?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.600
Yes, there was a media room,

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.640
and they had a little area for quiet meetings.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.720
I actually saw some pictures,

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.160
I guess someone had recorded,

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.400
but looked like a podcast in there.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:55.320
Although the room was way too reflective for my taste.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.160
We avoided it.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.760
But they had space to sit and access to power chargers

01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.600
and that sort of thing.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.420
What did you think?

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:01.960
How did it stack up compared to other events, Elle?

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.720
Yeah, the room was pretty barren.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.540
I would say that they were just kind of like,

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:08.040
here's the extra leftover room that we had.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.880
And I love that Wes says that they had access to power

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.680
chargers and adapters because we couldn't use them.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:18.200
We forgot that not everyone runs the same way the US does.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.560
Oh, I want to hear all about that.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.160
We got to tell that story in the Friday stream.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.360
So I would say it was definitely,

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.200
they had some stuff,

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.860
so we got to see Jim Zemlin basically fawn over Google

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.560
and just thank them over and over

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.220
for giving the world Kubernetes.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.720
So they had some people and they had like a little panel

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.720
we got to see, but that was it.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.840
It was like kind of media stuff on one day

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.640
in a little room with terrible audio.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.920
They couldn't hear any of the questions

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.760
coming back at them.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.960
So nowhere near as good as the Red Hat Summit.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.400
Ah, interesting.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.560
How was the food?

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.920
Well, it was all right.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.400
Elle had some misadventures in food

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.920
because the her and the Barcelona tastes

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.920
just don't really align.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.760
That's another Friday stream.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.000
Yeah, we'll talk more about it on Friday.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:57.840
I can't.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.440
Oh, Elle lost six pounds.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.280
That's right.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.360
Oh, no.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.600
Well, that's just because Wes has you walking everywhere.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.480
He did the same thing at Red Hat Summit.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.600
Now, we did do our best to try to like

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.920
eat all of Amazon's money.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.920
They had one of the after parties we went to.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.280
So those snacks were pretty good.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.720
Were the parties all right?

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:16.720
I drug him to every single party, I think.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.000
Attagirl, good for you.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.080
Did he complain, Elle, or was he a trooper?

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.280
No, I think he made friends with my friends, so.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.600
That's Wes for you.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.560
You have nice friends.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.400
You know what?

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.840
It's like that's one of the great things

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.440
about hanging out with Brent, too.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.240
Wes and Brent, same way, it's like,

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.640
you guys are pretty much down for anything.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.040
Except we hate each other for some reason.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:36.840
Yeah, right.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.960
Nice.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.560
Brent, I had such a great time.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.040
Again, I'm just so glad we did that.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.600
You know, Brent's down for whatever you want to do.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.640
Like, you want to sit around and watch some YouTube,

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.760
Brent's good with that.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.480
You want to go take a crazy ass road trip to some coastal town

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.040
so that way you can get tacos, Brent's good with that.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.280
You want to get pulled over?

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.320
Sure.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.720
Oh, yeah.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.440
Oh, my story about getting pulled over

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.400
with Brent in the car, totally embarrassing,

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.000
in episode five of the Friday stream.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.480
Were those prawn tacos?

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.400
Yeah, they were.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.360
They were prawn tacos.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.040
Have I told you about prawns?

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.160
I'd like to take a moment and tell you about prawns.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:11.640
Oh, my.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.320
Oh, my.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.320
It's something we're working on.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.480
I don't want to tell you now.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.640
But I'm very excited about a new prawn opportunity.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.800
Project prawn?

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.640
We'll get there.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:19.240
You'll see.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:46.800
You'll see.
