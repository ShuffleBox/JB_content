00:00.000 --> 00:04.440
This is CNN Breaking News.

00:04.440 --> 00:08.680
We're learning this now in the Jupiter Broadcasting Studios, Linux 5.8 is out.

00:08.680 --> 00:12.160
Wes, you're on the scene right now reporting outside Linus Torvalds' house.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.160
What are you learning?

00:13.160 --> 00:14.160
Oh my, Chris!

00:14.160 --> 00:20.880
We've got AMD GPU trusted memory zone, TMZ, support for encrypted video memory, also some

00:20.880 --> 00:22.920
new user space patches for Mesa.

00:22.920 --> 00:35.240
Wes, I can't believe you let me get away with that.

00:35.240 --> 00:39.000
Hello friends and welcome into 365 of your weekly Linux talk show.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
My name is Chris.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
My name is Wes.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Wes, quite the show today.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.080
Not only are we going to make you an online audio pro with our favorite headsets, but

00:48.080 --> 00:52.520
we're going to tell you why everybody's making a big deal out of BootHole, some other

00:52.520 --> 00:57.720
community news and your feedback, as well as some follow-up stuff from a couple episodes

00:57.720 --> 00:58.720
ago.

00:58.720 --> 01:02.160
It's a well-rounded episode and to help us sort through it all, Drew's joining us here.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.160
Hello, Drew.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.160
Hello.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.160
Hello.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.480
I like that you brought your own chair today with all of those nice stickers and stuff

01:08.480 --> 01:09.480
on it.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.480
This is a nice looking chair.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.880
You should leave this here.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.640
I just really wasn't feeling the chairs that you provide, man.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.120
They're just not good enough for my butt.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.120
I understand.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.120
I understand.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.480
You could make them out of just scraps and boxes, so I can appreciate that.

01:23.480 --> 01:26.120
The people that really got the best chairs, that's our virtual lug.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.120
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.120
Hello.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.120
Hello.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.120
Salutation.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.120
Aloha.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.120
Howdy.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.120
Hello, everybody.

01:34.120 --> 01:39.420
24 of you in there and we've been having a good pre-show hanging out on the live stream

01:39.420 --> 01:45.080
now for, well, we were actually live for an hour and a half, but then we had a fantastic

01:45.080 --> 01:48.760
Comcast outage, which brought us down for a bit.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.840
We're limping along, making do, making possible.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.440
Yeah, so there's stuff going on.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.440
There's a lot going on.

01:54.440 --> 01:58.320
Kernel 5.8 just landed, of course, everybody's already excited about what's going to be in

01:58.320 --> 01:59.320
5.9.

01:59.320 --> 02:04.680
5.9 will probably be what ends up in distributions like Fedora 33 and there's supposedly some

02:04.680 --> 02:07.320
nice improvements for ButterFS in 5.9.

02:07.320 --> 02:11.820
So we'll leave links to that stuff in the show notes, but let's follow up with some

02:11.820 --> 02:14.920
of the RSI feedback that we got on the show.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.280
I just want to do this briefly, won't become the RSI podcast, but I just wanted to say

02:18.280 --> 02:19.280
thank you.

02:19.280 --> 02:23.060
I heard from a lot of you who are also either just now learning to deal with this or have

02:23.060 --> 02:24.060
some tips.

02:24.060 --> 02:29.040
I got lots of gear suggestions, so I'll put a link to some of that in the show notes.

02:29.040 --> 02:33.840
I expected a lot of you to just yell exercise, exercise, exercise at me, but instead I got

02:33.840 --> 02:35.720
a little bit of that and a lot of gear.

02:35.720 --> 02:39.000
David wrote and he says, hey Chris, sorry to hear you're battling repetitive stress

02:39.000 --> 02:43.480
injury and I'm wondering if you're still using a mouse and have you considered a trackball?

02:43.480 --> 02:46.880
Now he recommends one of them thumb trackballs, but I'll come back to that in a minute.

02:46.880 --> 02:51.280
He says, I find that I need to take a break from time to time and also that I have to

02:51.280 --> 02:54.560
keep the trackball clean about every three days, so consider that.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.560
Best wishes.

02:55.560 --> 02:56.560
I love Linux unplugged and self-hosted.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.560
Well, thanks David.

02:57.560 --> 03:03.760
So David recommended the Logitech M570, which I actually have right here, M570 here in the

03:03.760 --> 03:05.740
studio and it's a thumb trackball.

03:05.740 --> 03:09.960
And I don't know if that's universally considered the best route to go for RSI.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.920
I think something more like the Kingston trackball.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.960
Now Wes, I don't know if you remember these.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.120
I grew up with one of these.

03:16.120 --> 03:23.320
My mom was a graphic artist since Photoshop 1.0 and as soon as these big trackball mouse

03:23.320 --> 03:28.640
came out, it's like the size of a pool ball, like from playing pool, not like the swimming

03:28.640 --> 03:29.640
pool.

03:29.640 --> 03:30.640
Yeah, much bigger than the thumb version here.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.640
Huge, Wes.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.640
It's huge.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.640
Like it takes your whole hand.

03:33.640 --> 03:38.240
And so it seems to be the people like those Kingston style trackballs for RSI and Drew,

03:38.240 --> 03:39.920
I think you recommended one of those too.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.920
Yeah.

03:40.920 --> 03:48.000
The Kensington Slimblade and it has that gigantic pool ball right in the middle and four buttons

03:48.000 --> 03:49.440
surrounding it.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.720
You twist the ball to scroll up and scroll down.

03:52.720 --> 03:57.120
I think it's much better with the thumb trackballs.

03:57.120 --> 04:03.000
My thumb will get tired and will just kind of get fatigued and sore.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.320
But with this, you know, my wrist is nice and supported and I'm able to roll the ball

04:08.320 --> 04:09.500
with my fingers.

04:09.500 --> 04:15.440
So yeah, my RSI went considerably down to the point where it's pretty much gone.

04:15.440 --> 04:20.640
I decided this time around, I think I'll have a variety of gear because I think one of the

04:20.640 --> 04:25.000
things that helps is changing up what I'm using to work, like not using the same device

04:25.000 --> 04:29.040
for eight hours a day, but moving between computers that have different MES.

04:29.040 --> 04:32.440
And so one of the MES I got is the Logitech MX Vertical.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.240
MX Vertical.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.840
They claimed to have done a ton of research on this and it keeps your wrist in a better

04:37.840 --> 04:38.840
position.

04:38.840 --> 04:39.840
I've seen this in the show notes.

04:39.840 --> 04:40.840
Oh yeah, I've seen these.

04:40.840 --> 04:41.840
Yeah.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.960
It does charge over USB-C, which I'm kind of looking forward to, I think.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.280
It has gotten a lot of positive comments from the audience.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.780
It's a pretty wild looking mouse.

04:50.780 --> 04:52.200
It's like, you know, it looks comfortable.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.860
Just imagining using it, putting your hand in the shape that it is.

04:54.860 --> 04:55.860
It seems, yeah.

04:55.860 --> 04:56.860
All right.

04:56.860 --> 04:57.860
I'm going to give it a go.

04:57.860 --> 05:00.360
I know the big old huge trackballs.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.720
I've used them, you know, as a kid.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.160
I bet I could probably pick it back up again.

05:04.160 --> 05:08.120
I also got wrist pads for the studio keyboards and the one upstairs and that's helped.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.480
I'm trying not to buy a ton of stuff to fix this.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.060
Like the real solution isn't buying stuff.

05:13.060 --> 05:18.020
There's two other things I've done and I'm just kind of hitting pause after that and

05:18.020 --> 05:19.200
seeing where things go.

05:19.200 --> 05:24.240
And the other thing is it's something I've needed to do five years plus is I've decided

05:24.240 --> 05:28.000
to replace my desk and I've ordered a standing desk.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Oh, look at you.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.040
Autonomous.ai has, I don't know why that's the name, but they have a bunch of cool standing

05:34.040 --> 05:35.040
desks.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.040
So I got one of those on the way.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.160
Should be here middle of the month.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.560
This is, I assume, one that you can switch between modes, adjust the height and yeah.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.560
Oh yeah.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.560
Oh yeah.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.560
Oh yeah.

05:43.560 --> 05:49.000
And I'm trying to take stretch breaks, trying to get up at least once an hour and move around

05:49.000 --> 05:51.520
and stretch my wrists out and that has helped.

05:51.520 --> 05:56.560
Additionally, and this is not medical advice, but this has just been something that I've

05:56.560 --> 06:04.680
noted has helped is a couple of weeks ago I started trying to take these pill form CBD.

06:04.680 --> 06:09.480
I'm not a medical doctor here, so don't follow my lead.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.600
But over the last two weeks, I started with a couple of pills and now I'm on like four

06:12.600 --> 06:17.560
of them and I'd say it's taken my pain from an eight to like a three and a half.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.360
I was telling Wes, you know, over the years I've tried vitamins, I tried all these different

06:20.360 --> 06:24.140
things and I always end up just stop taking them, but I have not missed a single night

06:24.140 --> 06:31.480
of this because it really, I feel like between the stretching and the increased water consumption

06:31.480 --> 06:36.200
and the breaks and these CBD things, it's helped a lot.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.800
And you know, I don't get like, I'm not all like wacky stoned or anything from them.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
It's right.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.480
I mean, all of these are just like, you know, aims to help you work better, you know, be

06:43.480 --> 06:44.680
able to continue to work.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.680
I gotta be honest.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.080
I wasn't planning to come on air and mention that I was trying CBD to help because it feels

06:49.080 --> 06:52.200
embarrassing and makes it, it's very vulnerable for me to even admit that because a lot of

06:52.200 --> 06:54.560
people will take that the wrong way.

06:54.560 --> 06:57.880
But if it's something you've considered, I'm saying it's helped for me.

06:57.880 --> 07:03.520
I did a very, very loose and fast kind of check on research.

07:03.520 --> 07:07.280
Some stuff out there of course says that studies have been done that look like they have really

07:07.280 --> 07:12.960
positive indicators, but you know, you gotta, you gotta follow your own medical doctor's

07:12.960 --> 07:15.440
advice on that kind of stuff, not some podcasters advice.

07:15.440 --> 07:18.840
But for me it's helped and a lot of this gear I've ordered hasn't arrived yet, but I'm hoping

07:18.840 --> 07:24.760
combining it with the vertical mouse and, and trying to come up with a system of stretches

07:24.760 --> 07:27.480
and breaks every morning, I hope we'll do it.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.480
Yeah.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.920
It seems like you're just trying to get in some good habits, you know, just to support

07:30.920 --> 07:31.920
things.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.920
Change the bad habits.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.920
It's so easy cause you know, we have to, you have to be at the computer pretty much all

07:35.920 --> 07:38.040
day to do work, to do show prep.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.000
It's easy to not take that seriously.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.320
But if you were going to do, you know, some, some job where you needed to operate equipment

07:43.320 --> 07:47.200
or you're training for a sport, well you use the right tools and I don't think it's any

07:47.200 --> 07:48.200
different here.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.480
I'm an extreme computer user.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.640
Not always for the best way.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.200
Anyways, I just wanted to kind of put an end cap on that because we've been getting a lot

07:54.200 --> 07:56.720
of feedback and I want to say thank you to everybody.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.800
And please do continue to send it in.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.600
That doesn't necessarily mean you have to stop, but it's been a couple of weeks since

08:00.600 --> 08:01.600
we addressed it.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.600
So I wanted to touch on that.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.440
All right, Wes, let's get into what everybody really seems to be focusing on this week.

08:06.440 --> 08:13.480
And that's boot hole, a rather nasty looking security exploit that involves our good friend

08:13.480 --> 08:14.760
secure boot.

08:14.760 --> 08:18.040
And there's a lots of explanations out there on the web.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.000
We've consolidated some of them for you in the show notes.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.440
So absolutely do feel free to look further, but you found a really good one over on Debian's

08:25.440 --> 08:26.440
website.

08:26.440 --> 08:31.320
And the security team has written a very readable write up.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.320
The readable write up.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.240
Yeah, you know, I just really impressed because there's a lot going on.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.600
You know, the first vulnerability here, there's actually multiple that was found.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.120
There's a white paper out on that.

08:40.120 --> 08:45.360
There's going to be a webinar, all the usual stuff you get when a big security firm finds

08:45.360 --> 08:46.360
stuff.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.360
But they didn't stop there.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.640
You know, the researchers found this problem and kept going to actually turned up a number

08:50.640 --> 08:52.960
of different problems all happening.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.200
But if you remember things about secure boot, it was a big deal.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.200
We talked about it here on the show.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.500
You know, it's kind of a big kerfuffle in the Linux world as that was happening.

09:01.500 --> 09:06.240
But I think we've kind of all forgot about what it is and, you know, why we care.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.760
I got to be honest, that is true because I really rarely deal with it because I'm not

09:09.760 --> 09:12.560
typically buying Windows machines now and trying to put Linux on them.

09:12.560 --> 09:16.700
But my understanding was, is that ultimately Microsoft has to be involved in the signing

09:16.700 --> 09:17.920
process.

09:17.920 --> 09:23.640
And the way this works is only signed code is going to boot in a secure boot environment.

09:23.640 --> 09:27.440
Yeah, you know, it's a way of helping secure the whole boot process of loading up your

09:27.440 --> 09:28.440
computer.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.160
If you imagine the old days, if you didn't have a BIOS password or anything like that

09:30.160 --> 09:35.560
configured, you just walk over, plug in a USB drive and the firmware is happy to, you

09:35.560 --> 09:39.560
know, just into dumb BIOS, just jumps over there, starts running the code and away you

09:39.560 --> 09:40.560
go.

09:40.560 --> 09:44.440
But in the UEFI world, we've got secure boot so that, you know, in theory, maybe you're

09:44.440 --> 09:48.120
at a hotel and someone unscrupulous comes and wants to try to steal information off

09:48.120 --> 09:49.120
your computer.

09:49.120 --> 09:54.680
Well, with secure boot, you've got a chain of trust and you basically tell your firmware,

09:54.680 --> 09:58.480
these are the keys of, you know, people I trust uses public key cryptography and then

09:58.480 --> 10:01.340
it will only boot into stuff that's been signed by those keys.

10:01.340 --> 10:05.240
So in theory, totally fine if you were paranoid about your devices and not that you need to

10:05.240 --> 10:10.200
be paranoid, you know, in use by corporations, anyone who's trying to have secure devices,

10:10.200 --> 10:13.540
you would roll that in the bootloader and only your stuff will run.

10:13.540 --> 10:15.960
But of course, I mean, what, regular users?

10:15.960 --> 10:16.960
They're not going to do this.

10:16.960 --> 10:21.040
So by and large, the implementation and the most way we run into it is that Microsoft

10:21.040 --> 10:25.920
worked out deals so that all the major manufacturers, well, they've enrolled Microsoft's key in

10:25.920 --> 10:26.920
there.

10:26.920 --> 10:30.040
Now, you could remove it and most firmwares allow you to do that, not on ARM, but, you

10:30.040 --> 10:31.040
know, on x86.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.760
But they ship it with Microsoft.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.760
Microsoft is shipped.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.040
And that also means that, you know, in the Linux world, we were like, well, we don't

10:37.040 --> 10:41.880
want to have to tell people to go turn secure boot off as the first step in how do you install

10:41.880 --> 10:42.880
Linux.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.940
That's an awkward thing.

10:43.940 --> 10:47.280
That's already a barrier to entry when we, you know, they already got this far.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.400
They've figured out that they want to try Linux.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.760
All that stuff is no good.

10:50.760 --> 10:55.760
So many of the major distributions worked with Microsoft and got Microsoft to sign with

10:55.760 --> 10:58.640
the Microsoft key, some of our boot infrastructure.

10:58.640 --> 11:02.360
And that way you can just take, you know, your regular old Ubuntu ISO that's signed,

11:02.360 --> 11:05.520
plug it into your new laptop that you picked up from Best Buy, not have to fuss around

11:05.520 --> 11:06.520
with secure boot.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.960
Essentially then in that case, transparent to the end user.

11:08.960 --> 11:09.960
Right.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.840
So that's what was involved and really to respect the standard here, it's all about

11:12.840 --> 11:15.280
maintaining that sequence of boot.

11:15.280 --> 11:20.000
So the firmware is told to trust the keys and then it will only run stuff that's been

11:20.000 --> 11:21.080
signed by those keys.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.140
But everything after that needs to follow the same rules, right?

11:24.140 --> 11:25.280
They have to have a system in place.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.840
Doesn't have to be the same key necessarily, but that needs to have their own set to maintain

11:28.840 --> 11:29.840
that security.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.960
Otherwise, all of it's basically for nothing.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.000
And that set has to be signed by a trusted set.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Right.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.880
I mean, you've got to have trust at each layer so that you load a trusted bootloader, which

11:37.880 --> 11:39.840
then loads the trusted operating system.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.440
And then there's even some, you know, stuff that you have to think about in the OS level

11:42.440 --> 11:45.680
and Linux has these where you lock down the kernel a little bit more so you would only

11:45.680 --> 11:47.560
load signed kernel modules, for example.

11:47.560 --> 11:48.560
Right.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.040
So there can be implications, especially for folks like in the Linux world who want to

11:51.040 --> 11:52.820
go run a bunch of custom stuff.

11:52.820 --> 11:56.600
But if you think about it as an average end user, this is just an added way that at least,

11:56.600 --> 11:59.840
you know, this has been signed by, in theory, an organization you trust because you're running

11:59.840 --> 12:00.840
their operating system.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.840
All right.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.680
So that's a secure boot recap and sort of the value it seems to provide.

12:05.680 --> 12:11.300
And then what happened here is various vulnerabilities in grub, which meant that you could get arbitrary

12:11.300 --> 12:14.920
command execution as a result of grub loading its config file.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.480
And there's some other ones too, but that was the first one figured out.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.680
It's a bug in grub itself.

12:18.680 --> 12:19.680
Right.

12:19.680 --> 12:24.040
So it's parsing the config file, you know, does some bad stuff in memory and boom.

12:24.040 --> 12:28.360
Now the person who maliciously, you know, modified that config file, they've got control

12:28.360 --> 12:30.320
and it's running in a trusted way.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.400
They can load unsigned code.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.400
Okay.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.280
So this is, you know, this would be one way that you might see it is to install a root

12:36.280 --> 12:40.600
kit that you wouldn't notice, you know, secure boot still on.

12:40.600 --> 12:44.720
But because this happened, they were able to take over control of grub for a bit and

12:44.720 --> 12:46.840
install whatever code they wanted.

12:46.840 --> 12:52.480
So this could affect more than just Linux boxes because you could take a live environment

12:52.480 --> 12:57.480
with this vulnerability, plug it into a Windows 10 workstation, a high security Windows 10

12:57.480 --> 13:01.360
workstation, and essentially exploit secure boot.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.400
Even though that machine never ran Linux, never used grub.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.040
But if you just brought a vulnerable grub in a live environment, you could have at it,

13:08.040 --> 13:09.040
right?

13:09.040 --> 13:11.280
Interestingly, there were some issues found in Linux too.

13:11.280 --> 13:15.060
Several not necessarily verified, at least from what Debian writes here, but possibly

13:15.060 --> 13:18.000
could have interviewed to also allow secure boot bypass.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.680
But our friend Jason Doenfeld from the WireGuard project, he managed to fix those.

13:22.680 --> 13:26.640
This is kind of tricky to patch too, because unlike most normal security vulnerabilities

13:26.640 --> 13:29.920
where you just sort of get the new grub or whatever, it doesn't have that flaw anymore.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.140
Some versions that are signed still exist.

13:32.140 --> 13:37.880
And so as part of mitigations, at some point you basically need to take out the old Microsoft

13:37.880 --> 13:41.120
key and add in the new key infrastructure.

13:41.120 --> 13:47.440
And anything aligned with boot updating these sorts of trusted components is tricky.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.880
So is it basically a firmware update for these machines?

13:49.880 --> 13:50.880
Right.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.160
At some point you probably will need firmware updates, things that fix the keys.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.080
And then a whole bunch of components had updates too, right?

13:56.080 --> 14:00.800
So like the FWPT infrastructure, because there's signed versions of those if you want to operate

14:00.800 --> 14:01.800
in a signed way, right?

14:01.800 --> 14:06.300
So you're going to do, there's also the shim that works that fits between EFI and grub,

14:06.300 --> 14:09.620
new grubs that are out without this vulnerability that have to get re-signed.

14:09.620 --> 14:11.700
For most of us, it's not a big deal.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.660
You might not even have secure boot turned on for your computer.

14:14.660 --> 14:19.360
But there's a lot of thought and infrastructure and planning and ceremony that is involved

14:19.360 --> 14:20.360
in all of this.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.460
And it's kind of just embarrassing that our, you know, obviously the Linux community takes

14:24.460 --> 14:26.080
security seriously.

14:26.080 --> 14:30.120
We've sort of had outside parties, in this case Microsoft, it's unfortunate we have to

14:30.120 --> 14:35.040
have that arrangement, but we've sort of had to convince them that, look, we have a secure

14:35.040 --> 14:36.120
stack too.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.880
By trusting us, we're not going to let a bunch of your Windows machines get hacked.

14:38.880 --> 14:42.680
And while I don't know that that's actually happened in the wild or that will happen,

14:42.680 --> 14:43.800
it's just kind of embarrassing.

14:43.800 --> 14:48.200
I am imagining a scenario where there's Windows machines out there that are no longer supported

14:48.200 --> 14:54.240
by the OEM, be it HP or Lenovo or Dell or whoever it might be, and they'll never get

14:54.240 --> 14:55.360
a firmware update.

14:55.360 --> 14:59.360
The other tricky part, too, is once some of those changes happen, old install media that

14:59.360 --> 15:02.120
you might have laying around, well, that won't work anymore because that was signed with

15:02.120 --> 15:04.040
the old key that's no longer trusted.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.040
Oh, right.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.640
So it's just somewhat tricky all around.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.240
You don't have to freak out about it, eventually do these updates.

15:10.240 --> 15:14.520
But, and we'll have an article linked over at ours from our friend Jim Salter kind of

15:14.520 --> 15:17.880
breaking down some of the patches, some of the updates.

15:17.880 --> 15:21.080
Some users have reported problems because, I mean, you know, anything happening, changing

15:21.080 --> 15:22.720
up your boot is tricky.

15:22.720 --> 15:26.720
So just maybe don't rush to apply those or at least do so in an environment with backups

15:26.720 --> 15:28.200
and with time to troubleshoot.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.520
Yeah, this has been a tricky one.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.360
It has left some systems unbootable.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.840
Jim did do a good job of covering that.

15:34.840 --> 15:39.440
I just kind of imagine a parallel universe where the relationship between open source

15:39.440 --> 15:44.640
and Microsoft isn't super cozy and we have serious egg on our face where a flaw in grub

15:44.640 --> 15:51.060
plus some compounding problems in Linux led to essentially a bypass in the secure boot.

15:51.060 --> 15:53.620
Not perfect like intentions or whatever.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.720
Like I've never been a big fan of secure boot, so I'm not like crushed by this.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.340
But it's embarrassing nonetheless.

15:58.340 --> 15:59.360
It's still embarrassing.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.360
It's not like the world ender, but it's embarrassing.

16:01.360 --> 16:07.340
And I'm imagining a scenario where the relationship with Microsoft isn't quite as comfortable

16:07.340 --> 16:08.400
as it is right now.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.440
And Microsoft responds by just saying, we're not doing this anymore.

16:11.440 --> 16:15.600
Or I mean, you could imagine there is some other vendor out there who suddenly, you know,

16:15.600 --> 16:18.640
we have a relationship with a provider who, you know, we want to add this distros key

16:18.640 --> 16:19.640
or whatever.

16:19.640 --> 16:20.800
And it's just harder to make that case now.

16:20.800 --> 16:21.800
Yeah.

16:21.800 --> 16:26.200
We should we should probably also point out that grub is used all over the place by tons

16:26.200 --> 16:27.200
of people.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.600
Probably another one of those projects that really deserves more appreciation and funding

16:30.600 --> 16:34.360
than it gets because it's very useful and critical.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.700
Yeah, I think that's an understatement.

16:37.700 --> 16:38.800
And I think really well put.

16:38.800 --> 16:44.560
So boot hole is really it's this ability to bypass this chain of trust and secure boot

16:44.560 --> 16:50.200
and run untrusted code on any system with secure boot right now that hasn't been updated.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.200
Right.

16:51.200 --> 16:55.120
If you've got a version of grub with this flaw and a computer that's trusting that version

16:55.120 --> 16:56.880
of the Microsoft key, then, yep.

16:56.880 --> 17:01.760
Once you've got grub loaded with a modified config file, you can run whatever you want.

17:01.760 --> 17:05.200
All that work, all that signing, all that fuss for nothing.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.200
Shucks.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.200
Yeah.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.520
So it's it is an interesting story and you can see why it's getting so much attention

17:10.520 --> 17:11.520
right now.

17:11.520 --> 17:18.480
And like Wes said, there will be more information in a in a like a video webinar webinar, thanks.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.760
It hasn't happened yet, so we can't link it to it.

17:20.760 --> 17:23.260
But keep an eye out for that, because by the time you're hearing this, it'll probably be

17:23.260 --> 17:24.260
posted on YouTube.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.260
Yeah.

17:25.260 --> 17:26.920
Another one, too, where, you know, I'm sure at some point they'll have figured out some

17:26.920 --> 17:30.420
of the problems with some of these updates and just go check your local distribution

17:30.420 --> 17:32.960
for more info there.

17:32.960 --> 17:40.140
Well, some interesting valve news has percolated up on the interwebs, and that is they've hired

17:40.140 --> 17:45.220
a full time developer to work on open source graphics for Linux.

17:45.220 --> 17:50.620
Senior developer Tony Wasirka has announced that he is going to be joining Valve to work

17:50.620 --> 17:56.400
on the open source graphics for Linux as part of a general push on improving graphics.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.680
I like to hear that.

17:57.680 --> 18:03.720
Yeah, it seems maybe specifically he's trying to make an impact on the open source AMD GPU

18:03.720 --> 18:04.720
driver project.

18:04.720 --> 18:09.660
He's been a major contributor to the GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin in the past.

18:09.660 --> 18:10.920
And you know, that really stands out.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.480
That's for a long time there.

18:12.480 --> 18:16.100
The blog has been one of my favorite things to check out just because, I mean, I don't

18:16.100 --> 18:19.780
do graphics programming in that way at all, but workings of these consoles, the intricacies

18:19.780 --> 18:20.860
of the graphic stack.

18:20.860 --> 18:21.860
It's fascinating.

18:21.860 --> 18:22.860
It's so awesome.

18:22.860 --> 18:25.980
And there's a lot of challenges there, so this guy probably knows what he's doing.

18:25.980 --> 18:31.100
I mean, the people that pull those projects off are like some of the elite of the elite,

18:31.100 --> 18:37.340
and he maintained the GPU subsystem and implemented the Direct3D 11 rendering engine, which has

18:37.340 --> 18:40.580
to be some of the hardest work there is for this.

18:40.580 --> 18:41.580
Pretty neat.

18:41.580 --> 18:44.700
I wonder if he's going to do some work on Proton and if the AMD graphics drivers aren't

18:44.700 --> 18:47.420
just going to be seeing a whole bunch of improvements.

18:47.420 --> 18:50.980
Some just landed in 5.8 that came out today, Linux kernel 5.8.

18:50.980 --> 18:56.460
You've got Valve that's hiring a developer to work full time on Linux drivers, including

18:56.460 --> 18:59.660
specifically calling out the AMD graphics stack.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.940
You've got even more improvements coming to the AMD graphics stack in kernel 5.9.

19:02.940 --> 19:03.940
Wow.

19:03.940 --> 19:07.260
I think I need to build myself a new AMD gaming rig.

19:07.260 --> 19:11.100
Yeah, I'll be interested to see where Valve takes this because last time Valve did some

19:11.100 --> 19:12.500
of this, we ended up with Proton.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
So we'll see.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
That's the Valve news.

19:14.500 --> 19:18.940
While we're kind of talking about gaming stuff, though, Nvidia is making some news that looks

19:18.940 --> 19:23.900
like that deal that we hinted at recently about them snatching up the ARM division from

19:23.900 --> 19:29.140
SoftBank is like looking real serious right now, looking close, like it's actually going

19:29.140 --> 19:30.540
to happen.

19:30.540 --> 19:34.620
And a principal analyst over at Trius Research said that if the merger goes through, it will

19:34.620 --> 19:36.420
be a disaster.

19:36.420 --> 19:42.100
This will defect from ARM and more ARM customers will start looking at RISC-V, to which I say,

19:42.100 --> 19:43.100
yes, please.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.100
All right.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.100
Maybe we're fine with this.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.780
How do we feel about Nvidia snatching up ARM?

19:48.780 --> 19:53.220
I don't feel good about this at all.

19:53.220 --> 19:59.660
I think that what we're going to see here is people are going to get very, very concerned

19:59.660 --> 20:05.700
very quickly about ARM being owned by a primary licensee.

20:05.700 --> 20:11.100
I mean, it could be a history repeats itself kind of moment, like what happened with Intel

20:11.100 --> 20:12.100
and x86.

20:12.100 --> 20:18.700
I mean, because in the 80s, there were multiple 80s and early 90s, there were multiple sources

20:18.700 --> 20:21.260
of x86 CPUs.

20:21.260 --> 20:25.240
Today there's just AMD and Intel.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.660
And that's only because they have each other at gunpoint, essentially.

20:28.660 --> 20:32.240
And Nvidia is not a good player in the ecosystem.

20:32.240 --> 20:38.800
They generally do not help contribute to the advancement and the development of standards

20:38.800 --> 20:46.460
to support applications in gaming, as well as in professional GP GPU cases and things

20:46.460 --> 20:47.940
like that.

20:47.940 --> 20:53.060
After 10 years, CUDA is still a closed thing.

20:53.060 --> 20:58.060
It seems like a clear move for ongoing licensing revenue, first of all, and maybe cornering

20:58.060 --> 21:02.760
the market a bit more and a turning point for ARM as a platform, I think.

21:02.760 --> 21:06.080
It will not change the current momentum around around ARM.

21:06.080 --> 21:10.880
It just won't because one of the problems that the industry has is that they like to

21:10.880 --> 21:14.500
capitulate to the strongest tech company.

21:14.500 --> 21:20.360
And when you look at that with even in the hardware space, you know, people talk very

21:20.360 --> 21:26.900
highly of Nvidia because their technology works, quote unquote, the best.

21:26.900 --> 21:32.280
But that's largely due to a lot of work they've done on the backroom side, making everybody

21:32.280 --> 21:36.780
like conform to their protocols, their standards, optimizing for their drivers and stuff like

21:36.780 --> 21:37.980
that.

21:37.980 --> 21:42.780
And it has shorted out all the competitors in the graphics space.

21:42.780 --> 21:48.100
And I think the same thing would essentially happen with the CPU space with the ARM ecosystem.

21:48.100 --> 21:51.700
But the thing is, nobody can peel back that investment.

21:51.700 --> 21:55.780
And moving to risk five would be a recipe for disaster for most companies, because the

21:55.780 --> 22:01.280
hardware industry, unlike the software one, operates on such tight margins that redoing

22:01.280 --> 22:07.020
everything would take literally years to figure out the investment profile, much less try

22:07.020 --> 22:08.300
to actually do it.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.300
I think that's very true.

22:09.300 --> 22:12.740
I think the existing momentum that people have invested in ARM isn't going to change.

22:12.740 --> 22:13.740
It can't change.

22:13.740 --> 22:16.700
The phone mobile ecosystem isn't going to change.

22:16.700 --> 22:23.500
I think the turning point will be in considering ARM as a platform that you're safe to build

22:23.500 --> 22:24.500
your business around.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.500
I think that's a shift.

22:25.500 --> 22:30.340
Once it changes again, once it changes hands like this again, something, I think, changes

22:30.340 --> 22:31.340
in the way people perceive it.

22:31.340 --> 22:35.140
I don't know if it's going to change really much in terms of how many Samsung phones ship

22:35.140 --> 22:36.140
with an ARM processor.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.420
I don't think that'll be affected one little bit.

22:38.420 --> 22:42.540
But future projects, things people are tinkering with, I wonder.

22:42.540 --> 22:45.300
I really don't feel very positive about any of it right now.

22:45.300 --> 22:51.820
Part of me kind of just hopes Intel pulls out of this downward spin, and we just move

22:51.820 --> 22:53.420
into an AMD Intel world.

22:53.420 --> 22:56.820
I'd be OK with x86 for another couple of generations.

22:56.820 --> 22:58.460
At least let me get to my 50s.

22:58.460 --> 23:02.340
I just can't get that image of Linus making a certain symbol when referencing Nvidia out

23:02.340 --> 23:03.340
of my head.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.340
Yeah, there's that.

23:04.340 --> 23:05.340
There's that, too.

23:05.340 --> 23:06.340
I think there's that history there.

23:06.340 --> 23:09.380
Maybe that might be informing a bit of my reaction to this news.

23:09.380 --> 23:10.540
I think that's very likely.

23:10.540 --> 23:17.700
Maybe if I was a RGB gamer and I had three Nvidia cards in my extreme Twitch gaming box,

23:17.700 --> 23:19.100
I would feel differently about it.

23:19.100 --> 23:24.780
But sitting here right now looking at the momentum around AMD graphics and AMD CPUs

23:24.780 --> 23:29.260
and the challenges like we've covered just recently in our ARM episode, I'm not feeling

23:29.260 --> 23:31.040
particularly great about it.

23:31.040 --> 23:36.280
Something though that does make me smile is Pine's invitation to get some input on a physical

23:36.280 --> 23:41.380
keyboard, a Nokia N900 style keyboard, if that invokes a certain image.

23:41.380 --> 23:42.380
What?

23:42.380 --> 23:46.540
Yeah, it's really kind of a neat idea of a little QWERTY keyboard that's totally portable

23:46.540 --> 23:50.420
that would make an SSH session really practical on a mobile device.

23:50.420 --> 23:53.460
And it can be integrated with a case where it slides up or down.

23:53.460 --> 23:54.460
I think this is neat.

23:54.460 --> 23:58.300
And they say they're in talks with a number of hardware vendors regarding this N900 style

23:58.300 --> 24:00.900
slide-out keyboard design for the Pine phone.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.820
It won't be thin enough, Chris.

24:02.820 --> 24:09.040
Yeah, I'm really glad that they're not hung up on that at all in this because there are

24:09.040 --> 24:15.500
so many of us out there that are perfectly happy throwing an extended battery pack on

24:15.500 --> 24:16.700
their iPhone.

24:16.700 --> 24:20.980
I haven't done it with this one, but iPhones in the past, I go get the big old fat battery

24:20.980 --> 24:23.980
pack and it like triples the thickness and weight of the thing.

24:23.980 --> 24:26.020
Or people are putting the pop sockets on the back.

24:26.020 --> 24:27.020
You know, there's all...

24:27.020 --> 24:28.020
It's not super minimal.

24:28.020 --> 24:31.340
And actually, in a way, it's kind of perfect if you can pop it all off and then you have

24:31.340 --> 24:32.340
a fairly thin...

24:32.340 --> 24:34.180
I mean, you have the Pine phone right there.

24:34.180 --> 24:36.420
That fits in the pocket just fine.

24:36.420 --> 24:37.420
Totally fine.

24:37.420 --> 24:40.300
It would be like having a Nexus in your pocket.

24:40.300 --> 24:44.300
It's like the small Nexus size, like the Nexus 6-ish.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.660
And your pocket's big, but it's not too big.

24:46.660 --> 24:50.360
But then you can snap these accessories on that actually make it a functional device.

24:50.360 --> 24:53.780
And as these things get more powerful, and as in the case of the Pine phone, the operating

24:53.780 --> 24:58.300
systems are more sophisticated, I love seeing these kind of things.

24:58.300 --> 25:02.380
And so I think it's early days, as a lot of this stuff is when we talk about this, but

25:02.380 --> 25:05.700
they're looking for feedback and they have some suggested design ideas and they have

25:05.700 --> 25:06.940
a form thread set up on it.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.220
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

25:09.220 --> 25:10.220
I could see it.

25:10.220 --> 25:12.300
I could see it one day all kind of coming together.

25:12.300 --> 25:16.580
It just makes me so excited that we've got, you know, manufacturing capability in a manufacturing

25:16.580 --> 25:20.460
company that's interested in thinking outside the box, making some of these projects that,

25:20.460 --> 25:23.900
okay, maybe they don't appeal to a wider audience, but then we don't need that.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.100
We'll find out.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.100
Maybe they'll sell millions.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.100
Maybe.

25:27.100 --> 25:28.100
I don't know.

25:28.100 --> 25:31.920
I mean, if you think about it, anybody that has infrastructure they need to maintain,

25:31.920 --> 25:35.860
you could make the case at the price point for the Pine phone, if it is your day job

25:35.860 --> 25:39.700
to keep systems online, you could make the case that you could have a daily driver that

25:39.700 --> 25:44.740
is your Android or your iPhone, and then you've got this with you in the bag or in the pocket.

25:44.740 --> 25:48.700
If you need to just bust something out, that's got a mobile data connection, that's got a

25:48.700 --> 25:53.940
fully complex operating system with terminal and all that and a keyboard, people walk around

25:53.940 --> 25:55.620
with Mac book and iPads all day.

25:55.620 --> 26:01.020
Maybe us Linux users will do something similar, but just thousands of dollars cheaper would

26:01.020 --> 26:02.020
be our style.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.020
All right.

26:03.020 --> 26:08.620
Well, a little bit of housekeeping here before we go on.

26:08.620 --> 26:13.220
Join us next week live if you can, because we're doing another classic chat room attacks

26:13.220 --> 26:14.640
episode.

26:14.640 --> 26:20.440
We've come across the old JB device from the hardware archive, and we're going to give

26:20.440 --> 26:25.260
it a full refurb, load it up with a modern OS, and then open it up to the chat room for

26:25.260 --> 26:28.380
quote load testing and quote.

26:28.380 --> 26:29.680
I love these.

26:29.680 --> 26:33.500
So join us next week if you can, because you'll get a chance to punish one of our machines.

26:33.500 --> 26:34.500
We need your help.

26:34.500 --> 26:35.500
Right.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.880
And now if you don't know when we're live, you can get it converted to your local time

26:37.880 --> 26:43.000
zone via robots at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.960
It's over at JB live dot TV noon Pacific, and you can just come on over.

26:47.960 --> 26:53.020
We start the show up usually like the live stream usually starts 20 30 minutes before

26:53.020 --> 26:54.160
the actual show.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.860
We get music playing and we get on there, start chatting.

26:56.860 --> 27:00.380
Sometimes like this week we started like 15 minutes late because we were goofing around.

27:00.380 --> 27:05.180
You get to hang on all of that and then also get to help punish the system and name the

27:05.180 --> 27:06.180
show.

27:06.180 --> 27:07.180
Like a whole extra show.

27:07.180 --> 27:08.180
It is.

27:08.180 --> 27:11.460
So check us out over at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar for the time and JB

27:11.460 --> 27:13.620
live dot TV is where it's streamed at.

27:13.620 --> 27:15.300
And also a reminder for the luck lug.

27:15.300 --> 27:19.360
I was hanging out in the luck lug this Sunday while I was out working on the storage bays

27:19.360 --> 27:20.660
of lady jupes.

27:20.660 --> 27:25.580
So I'm like, I'm carrying the phone in my pocket and I'm like spraying stuff and scratching

27:25.580 --> 27:30.820
down rust stuff and painting over stuff and chatting with the luck lug about cellular

27:30.820 --> 27:33.420
antennas and all the kind of stuff.

27:33.420 --> 27:38.180
It was pretty good, pretty good couple hours with the chatting and I got a lot done, took

27:38.180 --> 27:39.180
a break during some books.

27:39.180 --> 27:41.900
I ran out of Rustoleum and then got back at it.

27:41.900 --> 27:42.900
It was good.

27:42.900 --> 27:43.900
So you can join us too.

27:43.900 --> 27:47.980
The luck lug is on Sundays at noon Pacific and it's in the same mumble room we use for

27:47.980 --> 27:48.980
the show.

27:48.980 --> 27:49.980
We just do it up in the lobby.

27:49.980 --> 27:52.780
So you just have to have the open source mumble software.

27:52.780 --> 27:54.500
Pretty easy to have it for the phone too.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.740
They have for the phone too.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.740
Don't tell anybody though.

27:56.740 --> 27:58.300
We don't tell people about that.

27:58.300 --> 27:59.300
No.

27:59.300 --> 28:06.140
All right, well this week we're going to tell you about our favorite headphones on Linux

28:06.140 --> 28:08.400
for like meetings or joining the mumble room.

28:08.400 --> 28:12.780
This would be, these would be great headphones potentially to jump into the luck lug on Sunday.

28:12.780 --> 28:14.200
I also wanted something.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.200
That's actually why I bought mine.

28:15.200 --> 28:20.460
I bought mine specifically for the luck lug and then I wanted to start using them for

28:20.460 --> 28:26.060
zoom meetings and whatnot and the requirements were something that works really well with

28:26.060 --> 28:30.660
Linux and I think for you and I at least, we'll see where Drew falls down.

28:30.660 --> 28:33.580
I think that's going to be an interesting one, but where for you and I, I think we both

28:33.580 --> 28:34.580
wanted wireless.

28:34.580 --> 28:35.580
Right.

28:35.580 --> 28:41.640
So you have the newer version of ones that I tried a couple, like maybe a year and a

28:41.640 --> 28:46.420
half ago, the Jabra Elite Active 65Ts.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.420
These are no bigger than AirPods.

28:47.420 --> 28:48.420
Right.

28:48.420 --> 28:49.420
That's it.

28:49.420 --> 28:52.620
I mean then they're very much marketed as, you know, competitor Android version of the

28:52.620 --> 28:53.620
AirPods.

28:53.620 --> 28:55.620
Although of course they'll work with iOS too.

28:55.620 --> 28:56.620
Yeah, they're not bad.

28:56.620 --> 28:59.460
You know, they, there are newer ones now.

28:59.460 --> 29:00.460
There's also the 75T.

29:00.460 --> 29:03.740
I don't know why they don't make the, you know, the version in between, but that's not

29:03.740 --> 29:04.740
my business.

29:04.740 --> 29:08.700
And we should probably say the price upfront, they're $120.

29:08.700 --> 29:11.700
So they're cheaper than AirPods, but they're not like super economical.

29:11.700 --> 29:12.700
Yeah.

29:12.700 --> 29:13.700
You'll see them on sale sometimes.

29:13.700 --> 29:16.820
Or actually I bought a refurbished pair just because, hey, why not?

29:16.820 --> 29:18.660
Even though they might've been in somebody else's ear balls.

29:18.660 --> 29:21.420
Well, and then I immediately dropped them on the floor and one of my dogs tried to chew

29:21.420 --> 29:22.420
on it.

29:22.420 --> 29:26.660
I was like, these are not, these are not necessarily pristine, but that's kind of the point is

29:26.660 --> 29:29.900
that, you know, I've already gotten some nice audio equipment, nice headphones and nice

29:29.900 --> 29:30.900
microphone.

29:30.900 --> 29:33.100
And I just wanted something that was a little more convenient where, you know, maybe I'm

29:33.100 --> 29:37.780
not the star of the show for this particular meeting, but I want to be able to get up,

29:37.780 --> 29:41.380
walk to the kitchen, make myself a snack or go deal with the dogs barking at something.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.380
They're not bad.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.380
I was definitely inspired.

29:43.380 --> 29:48.820
I think I'd seen you and some other folks I know with AirPods and that looked very convenient.

29:48.820 --> 29:49.820
Audio quality.

29:49.820 --> 29:53.140
Well, you got to make sure you switch it, you know, into the high quality audio playback

29:53.140 --> 29:59.540
mode, which I will say having used it both on a Mac and Linux sort of struck me as just

29:59.540 --> 30:03.860
how these things go with Mac and Linux because on Mac it figures out if you're recording,

30:03.860 --> 30:05.380
you know, it figures out like, oh, are you trying to talk?

30:05.380 --> 30:07.860
Do you have an application that needs to, it needs an audio input?

30:07.860 --> 30:08.860
Oh yeah.

30:08.860 --> 30:09.860
Okay.

30:09.860 --> 30:10.860
Well then you'll be in headset mode.

30:10.860 --> 30:14.180
If not, then you'll just automatically switch to high quality playback mode.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.320
Although sometimes it gets that wrong.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.320
So it's perfect.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.320
Beautiful.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.320
When it works.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.420
On the Linux side, there may be ways to make it automatically switch.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.100
I've not investigated that because you just go in pulse.

30:24.100 --> 30:28.340
It's an option on the device, super simple, easy, and you can configure it yourself.

30:28.340 --> 30:29.340
So I like that.

30:29.340 --> 30:30.700
And I was actually kind of impressed.

30:30.700 --> 30:35.280
They're a little bassy for my taste, but the audio quality just for playback, watching,

30:35.280 --> 30:38.540
you know, watching a YouTube video at my desk or just listening to stuff.

30:38.540 --> 30:39.540
Totally fine.

30:39.540 --> 30:40.540
Yeah.

30:40.540 --> 30:41.540
For listening.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.540
Totally usable.

30:42.540 --> 30:43.540
Yeah.

30:43.540 --> 30:44.540
Where things fall down a little bit.

30:44.540 --> 30:45.540
Come in Levi.

30:45.540 --> 30:46.540
Come in Levi.

30:46.540 --> 30:47.540
This is Charlie.

30:47.540 --> 30:48.540
Repeat Levi.

30:48.540 --> 30:49.540
Come in Levi.

30:49.540 --> 30:50.540
This is Charlie.

30:50.540 --> 30:51.540
I found the truth.

30:51.540 --> 30:52.540
I found the truth.

30:52.540 --> 30:53.540
Okay.

30:53.540 --> 30:54.540
I'd say that's phone quality.

30:54.540 --> 30:55.540
That's it.

30:55.540 --> 30:56.540
It's phone quality.

30:56.540 --> 31:01.140
And it's definitely noticeable if, you know, you're switching from a different mic or honestly

31:01.140 --> 31:05.140
these days, even just like the phone on my pixel three, the microphone built in, I mean,

31:05.140 --> 31:07.300
to the, to the handset itself is better.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.300
Is better.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.300
Yeah.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.300
And that's a little embarrassing.

31:10.300 --> 31:11.300
Yeah.

31:11.300 --> 31:14.100
Although if you're, you know, for me and I think for you too, I wanted something that

31:14.100 --> 31:20.500
was totally just like, I just got to chime in a couple of times in a, in a work meeting

31:20.500 --> 31:22.100
and I'm not running the meeting.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.260
I'm not talking a whole lot.

31:23.260 --> 31:27.500
I'm doing a lot of, yeah, or I think so's or yeah, we can definitely look into that.

31:27.500 --> 31:28.500
Exactly.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.700
And it does totally work for that, for something you just really easy to pop in.

31:31.700 --> 31:35.520
So when you pop them in, does it auto connect or do you have to go into the Bluetooth settings

31:35.520 --> 31:38.580
in like say Linux and connect them each time?

31:38.580 --> 31:41.900
You know, it depends on the operating system and how you've configured it, of course.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.860
But yeah, for the most part it just, it just automatically connects, no problem.

31:44.860 --> 31:48.540
I did run into an issue and I think this might've just been an issue with the device itself

31:48.540 --> 31:53.700
is I paired it from the same machine with the same Bluetooth hardware ID and everything,

31:53.700 --> 31:55.220
but from two different distros.

31:55.220 --> 32:00.760
And after that I had to keep repairing it with those though I was able to do like a

32:00.760 --> 32:04.480
factory reset on it that fixed it, which makes me think it was a problem with just being

32:04.480 --> 32:08.260
confused about all, you know, all these devices, which made me having repaired it a whole bunch

32:08.260 --> 32:12.100
of times before I bothered to do that, made me suddenly have opinions.

32:12.100 --> 32:16.720
I really actually kind of liked Gnome's Bluetooth settings more than I do in the plasma world.

32:16.720 --> 32:22.660
I'm going to jump ahead to mine because mine is about accomplishing a lot of that and totally

32:22.660 --> 32:26.940
avoiding Bluetooth, which I think is now the way to go.

32:26.940 --> 32:33.340
I wasn't sure I was, these were recommended to me by the Luplug and I went with the Corsair

32:33.340 --> 32:38.780
Void RGB Elite Wireless Gaming Headset.

32:38.780 --> 32:42.780
That's a horrible name and RGB, I don't know about that.

32:42.780 --> 32:44.660
It does have a logo on it that changes color.

32:44.660 --> 32:50.460
But the thing that is fantastic about these is, now these are not earbuds, I will disclaim

32:50.460 --> 32:56.060
they're full over ear headphones, but Wes, no Bluetooth, but they're still wireless.

32:56.060 --> 32:57.060
How does that work?

32:57.060 --> 33:03.300
Well, Wes, it's good old fashioned RF and I think they sound lovely.

33:03.300 --> 33:08.180
Let me play you a little audio sample I recorded this morning here at the studio, just to give

33:08.180 --> 33:11.900
you a sense of what it's like when you're outside a studio environment, you're just

33:11.900 --> 33:14.420
in a, in like a working office environment.

33:14.420 --> 33:15.820
Here's the audio quality.

33:15.820 --> 33:19.360
Ah, the freedom of true mobility.

33:19.360 --> 33:26.700
The Corsair Void RGB Elite Wireless Gaming Headset for the connoisseuring pup who likes

33:26.700 --> 33:30.980
to game a little bit, but maybe also has a pup day job.

33:30.980 --> 33:36.660
The Corsair Void RGB Elite Wireless Push Hard on the gaming angle, but I don't really see

33:36.660 --> 33:37.660
it.

33:37.660 --> 33:42.460
They're all black, nice design, very comfortable to wear, and everybody needs a good headset

33:42.460 --> 33:47.380
and microphone from time to time with today's video calls and whatnots, and this certainly

33:47.380 --> 33:48.740
seems to fit the bill.

33:48.740 --> 33:52.660
I really like the way they feel on the head, not too tight, but they're not going anywhere.

33:52.660 --> 33:55.520
If you got the zoomies, they're not flying off.

33:55.520 --> 33:58.380
But additionally, they sound fantastic.

33:58.380 --> 34:01.100
Music sounds incredible on these.

34:01.100 --> 34:07.220
But let's talk about the real feature, RF wireless, true mobility.

34:07.220 --> 34:08.220
I'm up.

34:08.220 --> 34:09.220
I'm moving.

34:09.220 --> 34:10.220
Let's do a live demo.

34:10.220 --> 34:14.820
I'm in my studio office upstairs in the JB One studio, and I'm going to walk out into

34:14.820 --> 34:18.380
the foyer and move about.

34:18.380 --> 34:24.520
But now as I continue to move across the foyer, I'm into another office space, multiple walls

34:24.520 --> 34:27.620
between us, yet we are still communicating.

34:27.620 --> 34:30.800
But friends, let's be honest.

34:30.800 --> 34:35.460
If you're an entrepreneurial pup, easy for me to say, and you're going in and out of

34:35.460 --> 34:39.340
zoom meetings all day, like I find myself, you want something that lets you sneak away

34:39.340 --> 34:41.620
for those important moments.

34:41.620 --> 34:46.900
Well an RF wireless headset means if you've got to go potty during a meeting, no problem,

34:46.900 --> 34:52.780
because one of the features that I absolutely love about the Corsair is the way the microphone

34:52.780 --> 34:53.780
mutes.

34:53.780 --> 34:55.220
You can push to mute.

34:55.220 --> 35:05.220
So when you're ready to flush, you can just simply push up on the microphone, notice,

35:05.220 --> 35:08.420
and no one's the wiser that you were just flushing.

35:08.420 --> 35:13.800
It has a nice little chime when it mutes and a nice little soft chime when it unmutes.

35:13.800 --> 35:18.740
So you can sneak off and do nature's business without anybody knowing.

35:18.740 --> 35:23.620
Ultimately, while the mobility is great and I can sit here and yack my face off while

35:23.620 --> 35:29.300
walking around the studio, I think my favorite feature is how fricking easy it worked with

35:29.300 --> 35:30.300
Linux.

35:30.300 --> 35:33.660
I'm going to throw this thing that right there was me throwing the box because it works so

35:33.660 --> 35:34.660
damn good.

35:34.660 --> 35:35.820
I plugged it in.

35:35.820 --> 35:41.420
Linux sees everything, even the full name of the device, Corsair wireless gaming.

35:41.420 --> 35:44.600
And it shows an analog connection and a digital connection.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.780
So if you want to try messing around with that seven point one surround sound fake audio,

35:47.780 --> 35:48.780
you can.

35:48.780 --> 35:53.980
If you just want things to work, you just want a simple stereo audio device that's available

35:53.980 --> 35:56.380
to both show up to pulse audio.

35:56.380 --> 35:58.680
And I think that might be my favorite part.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.500
Plug it in, turn it on, and it just goes.

36:01.500 --> 36:10.760
And because the USB dongle is always persistent, Linux always sees my audio device.

36:10.760 --> 36:15.300
Even if I don't necessarily need to hear sound, I don't want my headphones on.

36:15.300 --> 36:16.300
It's still there.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.500
So my settings aren't changing all the time.

36:18.500 --> 36:22.100
The USB device is always there, even if I'm not using the headphones.

36:22.100 --> 36:26.100
So if I have, say, like something start playing and I want to hear it, I just grab the headphones,

36:26.100 --> 36:28.420
turn them on, and everything's already going.

36:28.420 --> 36:32.780
No settings to change, no Bluetooth device to connect, none of that fussy stuff.

36:32.780 --> 36:33.780
It's just always on.

36:33.780 --> 36:38.140
It's always working because it's a physical USB device that's the actual sound card.

36:38.140 --> 36:40.580
And then it does all the RF magic for you.

36:40.580 --> 36:41.980
I think these are keepers.

36:41.980 --> 36:45.500
These are going to be my go to headsets, gaming or not.

36:45.500 --> 36:50.140
I really got to say, the thing that I love about them is that the device is always on.

36:50.140 --> 36:53.740
It's always there because I leave the dongle plugged in 24-7.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.660
So there's essentially the pulse audio.

36:55.660 --> 36:56.820
The sound device is always there.

36:56.820 --> 36:57.820
It's always there.

36:57.820 --> 37:00.440
No crazy change in a default, no switcheroo.

37:00.440 --> 37:03.460
It's none the wiser if the headphones are on or off.

37:03.460 --> 37:07.500
So I can just have my sound device always available, and then I just flip them on.

37:07.500 --> 37:11.120
The other thing I like about it, and you could hear a little bit there in the clip, is because

37:11.120 --> 37:16.620
it's analog, it actually tends to degrade a little bit more elegantly.

37:16.620 --> 37:20.380
When I'm walking to the other room, you can start to hear a few pops and drops, and there's

37:20.380 --> 37:23.900
actually a channel switch pop in there towards the very end of that clip.

37:23.900 --> 37:31.100
So you have those analog drawbacks, but at the same time, it means instead of my cutting

37:31.100 --> 37:35.500
out audio, you just sort of get slightly degraded.

37:35.500 --> 37:36.500
Continuous degradation.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.500
Yeah.

37:37.500 --> 37:43.060
And I do really like the fact that when you flip up the microphone, the little blue light

37:43.060 --> 37:47.180
on the microphone turns off and has a really soft little tone in the headset that it plays

37:47.180 --> 37:48.180
to let you know.

37:48.180 --> 37:49.180
You stop.

37:49.180 --> 37:50.180
Yeah.

37:50.180 --> 37:51.180
So if you've got to take a potty break, no big deal.

37:51.180 --> 37:52.180
It's right there.

37:52.180 --> 37:53.180
You just flip it right up.

37:53.180 --> 37:54.420
You don't have to embarrass yourself.

37:54.420 --> 37:55.420
And it's comfortable.

37:55.420 --> 37:57.620
I can wear it all day long if I need to.

37:57.620 --> 38:00.740
It is also slightly cheaper because it's not fancy earbuds, right?

38:00.740 --> 38:01.740
It's a big over-ear.

38:01.740 --> 38:02.740
Yeah.

38:02.740 --> 38:03.740
What are we talking about here?

38:03.740 --> 38:04.740
$99.99.

38:04.740 --> 38:05.740
Oh.

38:05.740 --> 38:06.740
Yeah.

38:06.740 --> 38:11.380
So I would probably, I've got to imagine I'll use these for five years, and I would buy

38:11.380 --> 38:15.220
these same, these, when it comes to headphones, if you find the right headphones, I try to

38:15.220 --> 38:16.220
buy the same one.

38:16.220 --> 38:17.220
I know it works.

38:17.220 --> 38:18.220
Yeah.

38:18.220 --> 38:19.220
Why change it?

38:19.220 --> 38:20.220
These are my go-tos now.

38:20.220 --> 38:21.220
I hope they don't drop them.

38:21.220 --> 38:24.260
I did think you sounded pretty good, although maybe a little congested.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.260
Yeah.

38:25.260 --> 38:26.260
Is that, you think, the microphone?

38:26.260 --> 38:27.260
Yeah.

38:27.260 --> 38:28.940
I mean, it was just a couple hours ago.

38:28.940 --> 38:33.220
It's a small capsule, so I would imagine it's, but it's not awful.

38:33.220 --> 38:34.860
I think it's a step up from yours.

38:34.860 --> 38:35.860
Oh, definitely.

38:35.860 --> 38:40.100
If you're doing a lot of the talking, or you want to sound really professional, I don't

38:40.100 --> 38:43.060
think it's adequate enough, and I bet you that's where Drew could probably help us out

38:43.060 --> 38:44.060
a little bit.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.060
Yeah.

38:45.060 --> 38:50.500
My impression is that it wasn't a full range signal that it's pushing through, so you're

38:50.500 --> 38:53.900
definitely missing some frequencies in like the high mids.

38:53.900 --> 38:55.640
They're just gone.

38:55.640 --> 39:01.860
So that's why you sound so nasally is because you're not getting your full voice.

39:01.860 --> 39:06.260
Now one thing that I will say is that in the pro audio world, when you see people walking

39:06.260 --> 39:11.060
around with like wireless mics on stage and stuff like that, they're all RF.

39:11.060 --> 39:16.900
So this is using technology that is tried and true in the pro audio space, which is

39:16.900 --> 39:17.940
great.

39:17.940 --> 39:23.180
You know, RF is also going to go through walls a lot better than Bluetooth, as you demonstrated.

39:23.180 --> 39:25.820
It's a great technology for audio.

39:25.820 --> 39:30.100
I highly, highly recommend RF if you're going to go wireless.

39:30.100 --> 39:34.540
You know, Bluetooth is fine for super short range stuff, especially if you have like a

39:34.540 --> 39:39.820
good strong connection, but it's not going to beat RF for straight audio.

39:39.820 --> 39:40.820
Yeah.

39:40.820 --> 39:46.100
And then also you don't have all of the Bluetooth pairing trickery or management that you have

39:46.100 --> 39:47.340
to do with it either.

39:47.340 --> 39:48.340
Just plug it in and go.

39:48.340 --> 39:51.100
Do you do anything below a professional grade microphone?

39:51.100 --> 39:54.140
Does Drew go out and buy a cheap headset microphone ever?

39:54.140 --> 39:55.140
No.

39:55.140 --> 40:04.100
Well, for this, I actually did dig out my old collarbone set like Logitech.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.100
It's an old one.

40:05.100 --> 40:10.380
They don't even sell it anymore, Bluetooth headset that I used to use on mobile back

40:10.380 --> 40:13.860
when I would have to go visit clients and stuff and, you know, be working on computers

40:13.860 --> 40:15.920
and answer a call.

40:15.920 --> 40:20.240
So I had, you know, this hands-free thing and I wanted to see how well it would work

40:20.240 --> 40:22.620
on Linux connecting over Bluetooth.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.820
I did get it paired.

40:24.820 --> 40:27.740
They're just fine and playback worked fine.

40:27.740 --> 40:33.340
The audio quality was great, but the input didn't work.

40:33.340 --> 40:38.820
I could select it in Pulse and as soon as I hit record, the application that was trying

40:38.820 --> 40:43.700
to record would just freeze up and I tried this out in multiple different applications

40:43.700 --> 40:45.900
that record straight from Pulse Audio.

40:45.900 --> 40:48.460
Every single one of them had the same issue.

40:48.460 --> 40:50.740
Just hit record, boom, it's done.

40:50.740 --> 40:53.120
The application is no longer responding.

40:53.120 --> 40:57.120
So total fail on recording for that.

40:57.120 --> 41:02.580
So the microphone did not work and I don't really think it's a Bluetooth issue.

41:02.580 --> 41:04.100
I think it's a headset issue.

41:04.100 --> 41:08.420
I think it's just too old because I've had issues with it on the phone recently too.

41:08.420 --> 41:14.480
Last time I tried it, I had to, you know, stop using it and go straight to the handset.

41:14.480 --> 41:20.420
These days for me, I've got a professional mic in my booth and at my desk and I've got

41:20.420 --> 41:24.420
professional grade headphones in my booth and at my desk.

41:24.420 --> 41:30.180
So yeah, you do have noticed what reason do I have to have yet another headset just for

41:30.180 --> 41:32.860
hands free wireless, blah, blah, blah.

41:32.860 --> 41:33.860
I don't.

41:33.860 --> 41:34.860
So no.

41:34.860 --> 41:38.220
Well, and it's something you were saying in the pre-show and I think it's worth considering.

41:38.220 --> 41:43.340
One option is to just buy one microphone by and buy it once and get a good one and use

41:43.340 --> 41:44.540
it for everything.

41:44.540 --> 41:48.580
I specifically was looking for something that I could get up and walk around with because

41:48.580 --> 41:52.580
I mean just so many of these now and I'm trying not to sit there at my desk all day.

41:52.580 --> 41:54.740
But I like that point that you made.

41:54.740 --> 41:58.700
And there are, we'll link to some microphones that are quote unquote professional grade

41:58.700 --> 42:01.720
that are like a hundred dollars that are a good starting point.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.720
You know, it's funny.

42:02.720 --> 42:06.900
That's basically what I've ended up doing is for calls that I want slightly better audio,

42:06.900 --> 42:10.820
but I'm still not having to talk all the time is I just plug in my USB mic at my desk and

42:10.820 --> 42:13.900
then I switch the headphones to just high quality playback mode so I can still go get

42:13.900 --> 42:15.380
up, you know, refresh my beverage.

42:15.380 --> 42:19.260
I just have to sit at my desk if I actually want to talk, but I sound great.

42:19.260 --> 42:22.460
I will try to remember to put a link to the USB microphone that I like.

42:22.460 --> 42:26.180
They're all in the same range and we'll put a link to a professional grade mic that starts

42:26.180 --> 42:29.140
about around a hundred dollars and then links to these headsets.

42:29.140 --> 42:32.740
I really liked this Corsair for just using my computer as well.

42:32.740 --> 42:37.900
I actually edited the audio for it on there just to hear what it sounded like and I thought

42:37.900 --> 42:39.540
it did a pretty decent representation.

42:39.540 --> 42:40.540
Oh, that's great.

42:40.540 --> 42:44.260
I then listened on my studio monitor speakers where there was a difference, but you know,

42:44.260 --> 42:49.780
in terms of just like enjoying music and playing video games, these headsets are really good.

42:49.780 --> 42:50.780
I really liked it.

42:50.780 --> 42:52.940
So, and the sound was better than I expected.

42:52.940 --> 42:53.940
So I like it.

42:53.940 --> 42:56.600
It seems like a kind of a sweet spot and you know, just usable.

42:56.600 --> 43:00.700
You can use it for multiple purposes, comfortable, sounds good, and a good audio quality on

43:00.700 --> 43:01.700
long recording.

43:01.700 --> 43:02.820
Boy, listen though.

43:02.820 --> 43:08.500
Like what is really sticking with me is the beauty of these RF devices is it's a USB audio

43:08.500 --> 43:11.540
interface that's detected by Linux and it's always there and it just works.

43:11.540 --> 43:14.260
No pairing, no Bluetooth involved at all, just works.

43:14.260 --> 43:19.660
Well, you know, I had to learn in this experimenting that I guess we've switched and now the Bluetooth,

43:19.660 --> 43:23.560
the main Bluetooth implementation is done in Pulse and not in Allset.

43:23.560 --> 43:27.580
You can still set that up if you want, but of course I was planning to record with Jack

43:27.580 --> 43:30.100
and things got more complicated than I want.

43:30.100 --> 43:34.580
So I've been down in the bowels pulling around with Pulse Audio loopback devices and virtual

43:34.580 --> 43:39.380
syncs trying to get what's a simple, you know, simple mix situation and Jack going in Pulse

43:39.380 --> 43:43.860
Audio so that I can play music while using my Bluetooth speakers on a Zoom call and it's

43:43.860 --> 43:46.020
been way more direct than I anticipated.

43:46.020 --> 43:49.960
So tell me a little bit about that because I think ultimately are you saying you could

43:49.960 --> 43:51.820
send music into the Zoom call?

43:51.820 --> 43:52.820
Yeah.

43:52.820 --> 43:53.820
You're sending systems.

43:53.820 --> 43:57.020
You know, playback a YouTube video and then have that and my mic go into the Zoom call

43:57.020 --> 43:58.020
as me.

43:58.020 --> 43:59.020
All in Pulse?

43:59.020 --> 44:00.020
No Jack audio?

44:00.020 --> 44:02.460
No Jack audio because again, I would have had to figure out some routing between Pulse

44:02.460 --> 44:03.460
and Jack.

44:03.460 --> 44:04.460
Right.

44:04.460 --> 44:05.460
Pulse can do this?

44:05.460 --> 44:06.460
Pulse can do this.

44:06.460 --> 44:07.460
What's the secret sauce there?

44:07.460 --> 44:12.340
Well, you kind of have to bust out the command line and start loading Pulse modules yourself.

44:12.340 --> 44:13.740
That's not too hard.

44:13.740 --> 44:15.820
Zoom makes it a little more complicated too in particular.

44:15.820 --> 44:19.180
So you can basically make these virtual syncs, which is kind of what it sounds like, a place

44:19.180 --> 44:23.420
to send audio that doesn't have to be a real device, and then you can use loopbacks to

44:23.420 --> 44:24.420
connect them.

44:24.420 --> 44:27.440
I'll have linked to a nice blog post that was written up with the intention of recording

44:27.440 --> 44:29.600
from a video game while you were talking.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.600
That works fine.

44:30.600 --> 44:33.260
In their case, they were playing it back through a Google meeting, you know, of RTC in the

44:33.260 --> 44:36.780
browser and that's not as picky about what it treats as a microphone.

44:36.780 --> 44:41.680
But Zoom wants to see some kind of thing that isn't virtual anyway.

44:41.680 --> 44:47.220
So I was able to find a great Stack Overflow write-up that actually uses an audio cleanup

44:47.220 --> 44:51.220
filter inside Pulse to get rid of echoes that Zoom accepts.

44:51.220 --> 44:55.980
So it sets up another layer of abstraction that basically tricks Zoom into thinking that

44:55.980 --> 44:58.980
you're sending it from a real stuff, but it totally works.

44:58.980 --> 45:04.300
I'm surprised to hear that Zoom even has any facilities to detect virtual audio devices

45:04.300 --> 45:07.740
on Linux and then choose which ones it accepts and which ones it doesn't.

45:07.740 --> 45:09.220
That seems like more work than I would expect.

45:09.220 --> 45:13.580
It lists it, but won't let you choose it, and if you change it in Bavu Control, it just

45:13.580 --> 45:14.580
changes it right back.

45:14.580 --> 45:15.580
Oh, yeah.

45:15.580 --> 45:16.580
It's a...

45:16.580 --> 45:17.580
Really?

45:17.580 --> 45:18.580
Uh-huh.

45:18.580 --> 45:19.580
I was surprised to see that.

45:19.580 --> 45:20.580
They've put thought into this.

45:20.580 --> 45:24.580
They don't want you using it this way, I don't think.

45:24.580 --> 45:25.580
No.

45:25.580 --> 45:26.580
That's interesting.

45:26.580 --> 45:29.660
But you could use the same trick, I guess, to do only Pulse audio routing to, say, take

45:29.660 --> 45:32.340
a video game capture and send it to OBS for streaming.

45:32.340 --> 45:33.340
Yep.

45:33.340 --> 45:35.780
And the guides are really nicely done.

45:35.780 --> 45:39.780
The one aimed at video games has a neat diagram and a sort of method you can apply to work

45:39.780 --> 45:40.780
out.

45:40.780 --> 45:44.260
Like, you list all your devices, you circle ones that are actually hardware, you draw

45:44.260 --> 45:47.260
some arrows between them, and then connect all the arrows.

45:47.260 --> 45:50.900
You basically open Bavu Control and assign, like, okay, this goes to this virtual sync,

45:50.900 --> 45:54.080
this one goes here, and at the end, your audio routes correctly.

45:54.080 --> 45:59.420
And so, ultimately, Zoom is pointing at virtual devices that you could change what's going

45:59.420 --> 46:00.420
to them at any time.

46:00.420 --> 46:03.860
So you could switch out microphones or whatever you want and never have to change Zoom.

46:03.860 --> 46:07.020
Yeah, and then Bavu Control is just a mixer console where you can, you know, slide things

46:07.020 --> 46:08.020
for the virtual stuff.

46:08.020 --> 46:10.940
So you can either lower your mic or you could lower the mix, you know, the one that has

46:10.940 --> 46:11.940
both of them.

46:11.940 --> 46:14.140
Yeah, it worked surprisingly well.

46:14.140 --> 46:17.420
I kept wanting to play back sound clips when I was in the meeting with friends, right?

46:17.420 --> 46:18.420
Of course, who doesn't?

46:18.420 --> 46:21.980
And I was just playing them on my phone in front of the microphone because I didn't have

46:21.980 --> 46:22.980
a better solution.

46:22.980 --> 46:26.660
And I just kept thinking to myself, like, in Jack, this would be so simple.

46:26.660 --> 46:28.740
You know, I already have it all set up.

46:28.740 --> 46:33.500
So I was just neat to see that Pulse is more capable than we give it credit for, even if

46:33.500 --> 46:35.180
the ergonomics are terrible.

46:35.180 --> 46:40.860
Yeah, I'd love to hear others' audio tricks or solutions they've had to come up with for

46:40.860 --> 46:44.020
more virtual calls that everybody is doing.

46:44.020 --> 46:46.220
Telegram is probably the best place for it.

46:46.220 --> 46:47.220
Jupiterbroadcasting.com.com.

46:47.220 --> 46:51.500
Join the group there and chat with us about your audio hackery.

46:51.500 --> 46:54.060
So how long did it take you to wire all that up?

46:54.060 --> 46:56.100
I mean, that was definitely...

46:56.100 --> 46:59.540
I was very distracted for the first hour of that call, let's just say.

46:59.540 --> 47:01.540
You're doing a dirty call.

47:01.540 --> 47:05.700
Well, I wanted the reveal, you know, where it just like comes out as me.

47:05.700 --> 47:09.940
Because you can share audio in Zoom, but then it shares to everyone and only the host, you

47:09.940 --> 47:11.740
know, they can configure who can do that.

47:11.740 --> 47:13.340
No rules for me.

47:13.340 --> 47:14.340
Nobody ever...

47:14.340 --> 47:16.820
Who wants a soundboard, right?

47:16.820 --> 47:21.780
So we have some feedback from Marvin, and he points out about a neat little tool in

47:21.780 --> 47:24.860
MX Linux that I don't think we've ever shared with the audience.

47:24.860 --> 47:26.180
And it seemed worth talking about.

47:26.180 --> 47:31.420
He says, hey guys, recently you mentioned the snapshot capability of Fedora and how

47:31.420 --> 47:33.860
it nearly protects against OS killing disasters.

47:33.860 --> 47:38.820
Well, there's no facility for that yet, but there could be one day.

47:38.820 --> 47:42.420
OpenSUSE works to have that and so is Ubuntu with CFS.

47:42.420 --> 47:46.900
He says, I think your listeners would benefit to know that MX Linux also has a snapshot

47:46.900 --> 47:48.500
feature sort of like this.

47:48.500 --> 47:54.340
With MX Linux, an ISO of the complete installation can be made on demand.

47:54.340 --> 47:58.580
In the event of any trouble, your system can be reinstalled exactly as it was at the time

47:58.580 --> 48:00.580
of making the ISO.

48:00.580 --> 48:02.260
This saves a ton of time.

48:02.260 --> 48:06.420
And all the customizations and software that I did are instantly available again.

48:06.420 --> 48:10.340
I think it's just one of these awesome features that are making MX Linux so popular today.

48:10.340 --> 48:11.500
You know, it's really interesting.

48:11.500 --> 48:16.060
I find myself thinking to myself, gosh, I would hate to have to do that, like just not

48:16.060 --> 48:17.800
wanting to do it that way.

48:17.800 --> 48:21.740
But at the same time, that seems great for just a consumer.

48:21.740 --> 48:25.100
And you know, here's a simple backup step you can do, save this on a flash drive that

48:25.100 --> 48:28.980
you know, or two of them that you store in a drawer and somewhere else, now you've got

48:28.980 --> 48:29.980
your backups.

48:29.980 --> 48:33.600
You know, what I used to do for family is I would give them a Linux box.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.400
And then essentially something kind of like this.

48:36.400 --> 48:42.440
And it's first it was I would tape a CD in a sleeve to the inside of their PC case.

48:42.440 --> 48:46.060
And then towards the end, it was I'd tape the thumb drive inside the case.

48:46.060 --> 48:50.200
And then in case of emergency, you break the seal and you restore.

48:50.200 --> 48:53.420
And so you could easily accomplish that with this feature.

48:53.420 --> 48:58.880
And I really like that because that's sort of the my Hail Mary remote tech support solution

48:58.880 --> 49:01.660
back in the day was break the seal, reload the machine.

49:01.660 --> 49:05.220
And I knew because I had made that custom snapshot that it would get them back to a

49:05.220 --> 49:07.340
state where I could remote support them.

49:07.340 --> 49:08.340
You could do that with this.

49:08.340 --> 49:09.820
It'd be a pretty good way to go.

49:09.820 --> 49:12.900
He says also, he threw this in at the end.

49:12.900 --> 49:15.940
He says there's so much to like about Fedora, I agree.

49:15.940 --> 49:18.260
But DNF is a total deal breaker.

49:18.260 --> 49:19.260
It's so slow.

49:19.260 --> 49:20.460
They just can't stand it.

49:20.460 --> 49:24.420
They need to work on that before anything else, in my opinion, he says, glad you made

49:24.420 --> 49:25.420
it home safely.

49:25.420 --> 49:29.260
Keep up the good work, Marvin, them fighting words about DNF.

49:29.260 --> 49:30.260
I love it.

49:30.260 --> 49:31.260
It's slow because it's sound.

49:31.260 --> 49:32.260
All right.

49:32.260 --> 49:34.060
It's doing a good job of updating your system.

49:34.060 --> 49:35.300
I'll tell you what.

49:35.300 --> 49:37.180
It's slow because it gets it right.

49:37.180 --> 49:43.620
And if you want to see you want to see painfully slow, check out brew on Mac OS.

49:43.620 --> 49:45.780
However, I'll also add this.

49:45.780 --> 49:49.660
We always talk about how fast Pac-Man is and yay in those tools.

49:49.660 --> 49:53.800
But when you stop and pay attention to how many frickin questions by default the arch

49:53.800 --> 49:58.440
tools ask you, obviously you can configure them or flag them so they don't.

49:58.440 --> 50:03.720
But by default, like you're getting 20 questions before you install like five packages on some

50:03.720 --> 50:04.720
of these things.

50:04.720 --> 50:09.060
And so if you think about the actual time it takes, I think DNF may not be so bad and

50:09.060 --> 50:13.940
probably would have fared better when you upgraded that box, not in a team accession

50:13.940 --> 50:15.700
the other the other week.

50:15.700 --> 50:16.700
Probably would have.

50:16.700 --> 50:20.900
And then also there was I was doing an update upstairs just the other day when gnome crashed

50:20.900 --> 50:21.900
on me.

50:21.900 --> 50:22.900
Right.

50:22.900 --> 50:23.900
And I ended up reloading my machine.

50:23.900 --> 50:24.900
I've had some bad luck recently, Wes.

50:24.900 --> 50:28.460
I'm just going to skip updates for a while.

50:28.460 --> 50:30.580
I'm just going to just let things take more snapshots.

50:30.580 --> 50:33.060
I'll just let them sit, I think.

50:33.060 --> 50:34.060
Well, you know me.

50:34.060 --> 50:35.060
That's not true at all.

50:35.060 --> 50:37.580
In fact, I come in on the weekends and I update machines.

50:37.580 --> 50:38.580
I just something about it.

50:38.580 --> 50:40.780
I love fresh, free software.

50:40.780 --> 50:42.500
I always have.

50:42.500 --> 50:44.740
And it's kind of like, you know, something you cross off the list.

50:44.740 --> 50:47.060
Oh, yeah, I updated all my machines today.

50:47.060 --> 50:49.540
It does feel like I'm taking care of stuff.

50:49.540 --> 50:50.740
I'm doing my maintenance.

50:50.740 --> 50:55.500
I'm I'm being a good custodian, if you will, of my systems.

50:55.500 --> 50:58.820
Well, that brings us to the end of today's unplugged.

50:58.820 --> 51:03.060
We'd love to have you join us live next week for that live punishment test because we need

51:03.060 --> 51:07.160
as much traffic as our little Comcast connection will handle.

51:07.160 --> 51:10.940
We actually got pretty far last time, so it has fared fairly well.

51:10.940 --> 51:14.400
Did you know this show is on Twitter for new release announcements and other things at

51:14.400 --> 51:15.400
Linux Unplugged.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.160
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

51:17.160 --> 51:18.740
I'm at Chris Lass.

51:18.740 --> 51:19.740
He's at Westpane.

51:19.740 --> 51:20.740
Right.

51:20.740 --> 51:21.740
Or is it at Noble?

51:21.740 --> 51:22.740
I can't remember.

51:22.740 --> 51:23.740
It's at Westpane.

51:23.740 --> 51:24.740
Why don't I remember that?

51:24.740 --> 51:25.740
I should just have it on a sticky right here.

51:25.740 --> 51:26.740
Really?

51:26.740 --> 51:27.740
Really?

51:27.740 --> 51:28.740
I could just put it on a sticky.

51:28.740 --> 51:30.020
Remember, Wes is at Westpane.

51:30.020 --> 51:31.020
Or you just ask me.

51:31.020 --> 51:32.020
Could do that.

51:32.020 --> 51:33.620
It could just be a bit that we do now at this point.

51:33.620 --> 51:34.620
Who really knows?

51:34.620 --> 51:35.620
But I do know this.

51:35.620 --> 51:36.620
I'll see you next Tuesday.

51:36.620 --> 52:00.020
Bye.

52:06.620 --> 52:20.780
Now, I definitely saw in the chat room while we were talking about MX Linux's ISO restore

52:20.780 --> 52:26.900
mode that several people were mentioning other distros like Puppy do this as well.

52:26.900 --> 52:29.400
So what's a what's a pretty well-known tool?

52:29.400 --> 52:32.380
Is there one that all these distros are using or they all roll it themselves?

52:32.380 --> 52:38.800
So the Mandrake family had Drac Snapshot, which evolved into its own tool called Make

52:38.800 --> 52:40.840
Live CD, which became My Live CD.

52:40.840 --> 52:45.800
The current descendant of the Mandrake family that still uses this is PC Linux OS.

52:45.800 --> 52:49.140
So you can respin from a PC Linux OS system.

52:49.140 --> 52:54.780
You can respin the whole system as an ISO that you can then use somewhere else.

52:54.780 --> 52:55.880
So that one exists there.

52:55.880 --> 52:58.680
And of course, Puppy Linux has its own tool.

52:58.680 --> 53:03.280
The problem with making one that's generic is that since every distro does their plumbing

53:03.280 --> 53:07.700
layers a little bit differently, well, every distro family, that is, of course, yeah, every

53:07.700 --> 53:10.500
distro family does their plumbing layers a little differently.

53:10.500 --> 53:12.580
These tools generally cannot be shared.

53:12.580 --> 53:15.020
I still just really like using my friend Clonezilla.

53:15.020 --> 53:18.800
Clonezilla is just recently been updated back in May.

53:18.800 --> 53:21.620
It's still a project is still going strong.

53:21.620 --> 53:27.300
And it is like my universal like go to for when I for when I receive a review machine,

53:27.300 --> 53:28.860
I try to do a Clonezilla.

53:28.860 --> 53:29.860
Right.

53:29.860 --> 53:36.580
Also, with regards to DNF speed or whatever, DNF is getting rewritten into C++ for DNF

53:36.580 --> 53:39.780
version five, which is coming hopefully this fall.

53:39.780 --> 53:42.260
Boy, Fedora is going to be getting to be a spicy meatball.

53:42.260 --> 53:43.260
I tell you what.

53:43.260 --> 53:44.260
Why not in Rust?

53:44.260 --> 53:45.260
Oh, no.

53:45.260 --> 53:59.940
No, no, no.
