WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
Wes, you probably catch XKCD from time to time, but I thought this was hilarious.

00:03.880 --> 00:07.760
They have posted the perfect phone, the XKCD Phone 4.

00:07.760 --> 00:10.960
And there's a couple of things that I think are just, I don't know why they're just obvious.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.840
First of all, it has a built-in dog whistle.

00:12.840 --> 00:13.840
Yeah.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.720
It has exposed duck work on the sign that is software defined.

00:16.720 --> 00:22.080
It has a new bright glow display that incorporates genetically spliced together jellyfish protein.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.320
It integrates Siri, Cortana, Google Now, and Alexa all at once.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.320
They all respond simultaneously.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.320
Yes.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.320
Oh, that's great.

00:29.320 --> 00:34.520
And of course, it also has a parallel port on the bottom and 12, count them, 12 headphone

00:34.520 --> 00:35.520
jacks.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.160
Now, that's your phone.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.440
How often have you been with your 11 best friends and you want to listen to exactly

00:40.440 --> 00:41.440
the same thing?

00:41.440 --> 00:42.440
Exactly.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.440
Or maybe Linux Unplugged.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.440
Right?

00:44.440 --> 00:45.440
Right?

00:45.440 --> 00:46.440
Yep.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.440
Boom.

00:47.440 --> 00:48.440
There's your upgrade, Wes.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.440
Just bring it to your local Lug.

00:49.440 --> 01:06.240
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 162 for September 13th, 2016.

01:06.240 --> 01:10.720
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's going back to school.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.720
My name is Chris.

01:11.720 --> 01:12.720
My name is Wes.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
Hello, Wes.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.720
How's the install going over there?

01:14.720 --> 01:15.720
Oh, it's wonderful.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.520
I'm up and doing the show.

01:17.520 --> 01:18.520
Nice.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.840
Well, we got a big show for you today.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.840
So buckle up, Wes.

01:22.840 --> 01:23.840
Buckle up.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.440
Coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged show, we're going to go through some breaking

01:26.440 --> 01:28.320
news just as a sort of a community heads up.

01:28.320 --> 01:33.600
We're going to talk about a drone that also doubles as an Ubuntu desktop PC.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.640
Apparently also, speaking of Ubuntu, they're getting attacked for being copyright pirates

01:38.640 --> 01:39.640
or something like that.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.640
I'll tell you about it coming up in the show next.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.960
Nextcloud's got a surprise in store.

01:43.960 --> 01:47.280
We've got some really interesting open source projects we want to highlight, some updates

01:47.280 --> 01:52.400
to cover, some digging around on getting rid of that Intel spyware, a.k.a. the management

01:52.400 --> 01:53.400
firmware.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.400
Oh, strong words from Chris over here.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.400
I know.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.400
I know.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.520
Plus, I had to fix a key ring bork this week.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.520
I'll tell you about my key ring bork.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.480
We also have jets flying overhead right now as we record the show.

02:03.480 --> 02:05.520
To do great honor to Linux Unplugged.

02:05.520 --> 02:10.120
Sending your USB devices over the network, a follow up on making Linux look a little

02:10.120 --> 02:11.120
better.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.120
We're going to talk about it in the context of the Loki review.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.120
You hear that?

02:13.120 --> 02:14.120
You hear that thing?

02:14.120 --> 02:15.120
Wow.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.120
That's for the show.

02:16.120 --> 02:23.560
So we'll talk about the state of Linux desktop customization and then we have a very important

02:23.560 --> 02:24.560
email to get to.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.880
We have a couple of good feedback items.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.280
We're going to do something we haven't done for a while.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.800
We're going to reach into my mail sack and we're going to read some really great emails.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.800
Yes.

02:31.800 --> 02:32.800
Some stuff that people have probably been wondering.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.280
So we've got all of that coming up in today's show.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.360
But you know what else we've got, Wes?

02:37.360 --> 02:40.320
We've got a totally locked and loaded Mumble Room.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.960
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:42.960 --> 02:51.320
Hello guys, boy, it's great to hear all of you in there and welcome back to Popey's.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.720
Been a long time since I've heard Popey's charming voice.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.720
It's good to have you here.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.720
You smell good, Chris.

02:55.720 --> 02:56.720
Thank you.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.120
It's handsome even over Mumble.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.280
I know you do, Popey.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.720
I don't even have to smell you to know.

03:00.720 --> 03:01.720
I know.

03:01.720 --> 03:02.720
You know what?

03:02.720 --> 03:03.720
He truly is.

03:03.720 --> 03:07.920
So guys, let's just sort of just as a sort of a public service announcement because there's

03:07.920 --> 03:11.900
a lot of things we could we could start today's episode off with, but we should probably start

03:11.900 --> 03:16.280
with some legitimately breaking news.

03:16.280 --> 03:21.640
So there is a zero day vulnerability right now that could lead to total system compromise

03:21.640 --> 03:22.920
for MySQL.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.340
It came out yesterday, so it's still pretty new.

03:25.340 --> 03:27.640
And I just wanted to put the word out there for any of you out there.

03:27.640 --> 03:32.960
It affects, this is directly from the CVE, the vulnerability affects all MySQL servers

03:32.960 --> 03:39.240
in the default configuration in all version branches being 5.7, 5.6, and 5.5, including

03:39.240 --> 03:44.720
the latest versions, and could be exploited both by local and remote attackers.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.000
That was an advisory that was published yesterday afternoon.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.600
Both the unauthenticated and authenticated access to MySQL databases are an issue.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.840
So a sequel, and it's a sequel injection apparently, but I don't know the details.

03:54.840 --> 04:03.240
It's CVE, if you want to look it up, it's CVE 2016 6662.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.240
Well said.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.680
If that's not a sign, I don't know what is.

04:06.680 --> 04:11.240
Anyways, so just a heads up to those of you out there that may have MySQL installed, but

04:11.240 --> 04:14.940
I actually thought this would be a really fun story to start with.

04:14.940 --> 04:18.400
I love this so much.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.200
This makes it feel like we're in Marty McFly's future right now.

04:22.200 --> 04:26.280
I might not be able to have the video wall that he had that was super cool, or the dehydrated

04:26.280 --> 04:28.080
pizza refresher thing, which was amazing.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.880
We could be eating pizza right now.

04:29.880 --> 04:34.880
But I bet Marty didn't have a drone that also doubles as an Ubuntu PC.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.240
I bet Marty didn't have that.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.240
No he did not.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.240
Because we've got that.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.240
We have that.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.240
Or we could.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.240
Well, that's true.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.240
It's a development kit from Parrot, I think.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.240
Or is that how you say it?

04:43.240 --> 04:44.240
I think so.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.240
Okay.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.240
I just want to make sure I'm not making fun of him.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.520
It's designed to create drones that can avoid obstacles, like the new DJI Phantom 4 that's

04:50.520 --> 04:56.640
super fancy, which is, I got to tell you, somebody who's tried doing, well, we've crashed

04:56.640 --> 04:57.640
our drone before.

04:57.640 --> 04:58.640
Let's just put it that way.

04:58.640 --> 04:59.640
It was awful.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.160
The development kit itself doesn't have wings, and it needs to be attached to a drone and

05:02.160 --> 05:03.160
a flight controller.

05:03.160 --> 05:07.640
Otherwise, the kit can be used to create robots.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.840
It's called Slam Dunk, and it's a fisheye camera that can capture 1500 by 1500 pixel

05:11.840 --> 05:14.800
resolution images at 60 frames per second.

05:14.800 --> 05:18.840
The camera allows the drone to process the images, which it will then be able to identify

05:18.840 --> 05:24.240
obstacles, which is very nice, because then it can use that identification to avoid those

05:24.240 --> 05:25.240
obstacles.

05:25.240 --> 05:30.500
It also has an ultrasound sensor, a magnetrometer, and, just for Wes, a barometer.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.840
They say it doesn't need GPS to operate.

05:32.840 --> 05:37.360
The development kit has an HDMI port, as well as ports for keyboard and mice, which means

05:37.360 --> 05:39.800
you can build a PC out of it.

05:39.800 --> 05:40.800
There's no price yet.

05:40.800 --> 05:45.400
We're going to probably get something in the fourth quarter, but just, you know, what do

05:45.400 --> 05:48.200
we always hear about what makes Ubuntu work so great on the cloud?

05:48.200 --> 05:51.680
What makes Ubuntu work so great on the cloud, Wes?

05:51.680 --> 05:54.240
I think it's the built-in drone support.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.640
No, I don't.

05:57.640 --> 05:58.640
Maybe not yet.

05:58.640 --> 06:03.840
I think what you often hear is, I can build in my local environment and have it run just

06:03.840 --> 06:04.840
like it builds.

06:04.840 --> 06:05.840
Dev matches production.

06:05.840 --> 06:06.840
Yes.

06:06.840 --> 06:12.140
So, this is the ultimate version of that, because you can make this little kit.

06:12.140 --> 06:16.920
You could hook it up, a keyboard and a monitor and a mouse, and develop directly on it, and

06:16.920 --> 06:24.960
strap it onto a drone or a robot, and this is the true 100% dev matches production kind

06:24.960 --> 06:25.960
of scenario here.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.320
Or when your friends come over and you need an extra computer, you just sit them down

06:29.320 --> 06:30.320
by your drone.

06:30.320 --> 06:34.800
It has to charge anyway, right?

06:34.800 --> 06:40.880
When you have a full Ubuntu machine up in the sky, what are the possibilities?

06:40.880 --> 06:48.000
With a camera on it that has a 1500x1500 resolution at 60 frames per second, it runs Ubuntu 14.04,

06:48.000 --> 06:49.480
so it's going to feel a little old.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.480
A little old.

06:50.480 --> 06:51.480
I'm just teasing.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.480
It's a drone.

06:52.480 --> 06:57.440
I want to see, like the diagram in the blog post shows a keyboard and mouse and a screen.

06:57.440 --> 07:01.440
I want to see someone running after the drone with a keyboard and mouse and a screen trying

07:01.440 --> 07:02.440
to use it.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.440
Oh my God, yes.

07:03.440 --> 07:09.000
Or like a really long USB cable.

07:09.000 --> 07:17.200
I think it's a super neat example too of how Ubuntu can be used on a range of devices that

07:17.200 --> 07:20.680
are actually approachable by consumers, so somebody who really had an inspiration could

07:20.680 --> 07:24.480
go out and get this stuff, eventually at least, in the fourth quarter it looks like.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.480
That is neat.

07:25.480 --> 07:30.280
And it's the first time where the in the clouds is legitimate.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.440
Oh no, that's good too.

07:33.440 --> 07:34.840
I hadn't thought of that.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.440
You guys are on top of it today.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.880
Okay, so while we're talking about Ubuntu, let's talk about this.

07:38.880 --> 07:45.640
The Ubuntu torrent was removed from Google using the infringing DMCA takedown.

07:45.640 --> 07:51.080
It's a horrible process where big companies outsource to these third party contracting

07:51.080 --> 07:55.560
firms who go out and do these massive sweeps of the net and then they submit these huge

07:55.560 --> 08:00.280
DMCA takedown requests.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.680
Or perhaps Hollywood is, hold on a second, full stop.

08:03.680 --> 08:07.300
Perhaps Hollywood is telling us something.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.600
Maybe the robots are on Ubuntu.

08:10.600 --> 08:16.280
So Ubuntu 12.04 LTS torrent was taken down because apparently, according to Hollywood,

08:16.280 --> 08:19.320
it infringed on Transformers Age of Extinction.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.440
That was the Ubuntu release that came with Transformers Age of Extinction, right?

08:22.440 --> 08:23.440
Just pre-installed.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.440
Yes.

08:24.440 --> 08:25.440
Starts right on startup.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.440
Yeah.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.440
That's an example.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.440
Content.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.440
Yeah, exactly.

08:29.440 --> 08:35.840
Yeah, and I just, this, boy, if this isn't just such a great example, taking down open

08:35.840 --> 08:39.560
source software like this, what a broken system is this.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.960
This could be worse.

08:40.960 --> 08:44.340
There's an even better example of why this is broken.

08:44.340 --> 08:51.000
Last week, Warner Brothers ordered Google to remove several sites from its own websites

08:51.000 --> 08:53.960
because they infringed their own copyright.

08:53.960 --> 08:59.240
They had the Batman Dark Knight and Matrix stuff yanked out of Google search results

08:59.240 --> 09:00.480
for their own sites.

09:00.480 --> 09:04.360
Boy, I don't mean to take this down a notch.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.960
Take down your own stuff.

09:05.960 --> 09:10.680
What happens when this, what happens when they start taking down other legitimate stuff

09:10.680 --> 09:11.680
accidentally?

09:11.680 --> 09:12.680
Right.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.680
Where does this stop at?

09:13.680 --> 09:17.320
Well, Google aren't going to put any real effort into checking this because they get

09:17.320 --> 09:21.720
millions of these things a day, so how, you know, nobody can be-

09:21.720 --> 09:24.500
It'd be nice if they could charge a fee.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.700
If you want to take something down, you have to pay X amount so they can't just generate

09:27.700 --> 09:30.400
a bunch of bogus requests.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.240
Moe's and Rath, you have an idea of where it stops.

09:33.240 --> 09:38.320
Yeah, when you sit there and you think about it, what happens when they take down someone

09:38.320 --> 09:41.200
else's stuff, then lawyers show up.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.000
Remember how you were discussing lawyers?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.460
I don't know which show that it was, but it was in the past couple of weeks.

09:46.460 --> 09:51.680
The lawyers will have a field day if Warner Brothers accidentally manages to take down

09:51.680 --> 09:57.040
something by say, Fox or something by just some other company, any other company.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.720
Let's just say it was something that involved say Microsoft, for example.

10:00.720 --> 10:05.760
Microsoft would say, oh, you decided to impinge upon our ability to make money through legitimate

10:05.760 --> 10:06.760
means.

10:06.760 --> 10:09.240
Well, we have a few people that would like to talk to you.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.640
Snap, snap, the shark lawyers show up.

10:11.640 --> 10:12.640
Sure.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.520
Yeah, so basically once they start picking on somebody their own size.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.520
Yeah, well, mm-hmm.

10:16.520 --> 10:20.680
Well, it's not a matter of picking on because remember, as you're saying, this is pretty

10:20.680 --> 10:23.000
much a blanket sweep, right?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.040
So it's not a matter of picking on.

10:25.040 --> 10:29.680
It's more like, because I have size 13 feet, so I got to be careful where I step sometimes

10:29.680 --> 10:34.080
because if there's little kids around, I could end up stepping on their foot, their feet.

10:34.080 --> 10:41.120
Now what happens to someone with size 13 feet, someone else's feet who also has size 13 feet,

10:41.120 --> 10:44.000
but they're hostile?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
That's an interesting analogy.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.840
And you just came up with that on the fly.

10:46.840 --> 10:47.840
Yeah.

10:47.840 --> 10:48.840
That was damn good, sir.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.400
What size are your feet?

10:50.400 --> 10:53.000
Yeah, maybe he's probably got big feet.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.800
He's thinking about that.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.520
Yeah, that is a good way to put it.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.120
That is a really good way to put it.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.640
And it's just as shameful right now.

11:01.640 --> 11:09.080
And I think I'm extra sensitive to it because I almost on a daily basis, I fight this problem

11:09.080 --> 11:12.440
on the YouTube side of things, which is also a Google platform.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.280
And I am assumed guilty.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.280
Exactly that.

11:16.280 --> 11:19.440
It puts the onus on the content creator who's just trying to do their thing or the people

11:19.440 --> 11:22.320
who are just trying to distribute legitimate ISOs.

11:22.320 --> 11:25.840
And now it's gotten even worse from a monetization.

11:25.840 --> 11:30.440
The only nice thing about YouTube from a content creator standpoint is it's got a great user

11:30.440 --> 11:33.960
base and sometimes you can make some ad revenue.

11:33.960 --> 11:39.980
Now for the kind of stuff that kind of views we get on YouTube, nobody goes to YouTube

11:39.980 --> 11:45.560
to watch long form content, except for the awesome people that watch our long form content.

11:45.560 --> 11:48.400
Because there is definitely an audience for it, but it's not as huge as everybody that's

11:48.400 --> 11:51.720
on YouTube to watch 15 minute, five minute, and 10 minute videos.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.980
They see that it's like, oh, an hour and 20 minutes.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.280
So it's never been like a huge platform for us.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.840
We don't make very much money on there at all.

11:58.840 --> 12:04.240
And it's almost, it barely even makes enough for them to actually even pay us.

12:04.240 --> 12:11.360
But they've started demonetizing videos simply for covering current events.

12:11.360 --> 12:16.340
And this happens to one of our shows on the JBL network on a routine basis all the time.

12:16.340 --> 12:22.220
But it's also even been retroactively happening to shows called Stoked, I used to do a Star

12:22.220 --> 12:24.400
Trek online podcast years ago.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.840
It's recently beginning to demonetize for covering current events.

12:27.840 --> 12:35.840
So they are, in some senses, they can do everything from revoke JB videos from certain audiences

12:35.840 --> 12:39.640
in the world, completely revoke it, or just not allow it to be funded.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.200
There's so much control.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.800
And never do they start with, well, let's get the creator's perspective.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.900
Let's get the content creator's perspective.

12:46.900 --> 12:47.900
Just like this Google takedown.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.480
I mean, when you get removed from Google, you're essentially gone.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.200
Just disappeared from the internet.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.960
But so far, it's just made for a few good examples.

12:55.960 --> 13:01.680
So now let's talk about something that's outside of Ubuntu.

13:01.680 --> 13:05.040
I'm going to use the word Unity, but I don't want you to get confused.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.320
It's not the Unity desktop.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.040
It's the Unity gaming engine.

13:10.040 --> 13:14.440
And it looks like the Unity gaming engine is getting some proper Vulkan work done right

13:14.440 --> 13:15.440
now.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.440
Nice.

13:16.440 --> 13:22.720
So this was posted by a software developer over at Unity Technologies.

13:22.720 --> 13:33.720
And she shows here an example of a demo, a Unity demo, running under Vulkan on Ubuntu.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.320
Pretty cool.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.320
Pretty nice.

13:36.320 --> 13:42.080
And not that I'm some huge fan of Unity games, but what this will mean is more games for

13:42.080 --> 13:43.080
Linux.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.240
This is going to get a lot more games for Linux.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.920
And that is a big deal.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.520
So it's not really news anywhere yet.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.600
I just happened to catch this on Twitter today.

13:51.600 --> 13:52.600
I was just trolling.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.040
It's a cool looking screencap there, too.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.760
Yeah, that's one of the demos that, yeah, that's, yeah.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.640
I also like that hashtag Linux.

13:59.640 --> 14:04.960
It kind of looks like a corridor of a modern retrofit Millennium Falcon.

14:04.960 --> 14:09.680
Like if the Millennium Falcon got a facelift and they went in and cleaned it up a bit,

14:09.680 --> 14:12.520
it would look like that with big balls rolling around.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.960
I don't know what that's about.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.720
But I thought that was pretty cool.

14:16.720 --> 14:21.200
Actually, speaking of trolling around on Twitter, I found this on there, too, from NyxCraft.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.280
ButterFS status in Linux kernel 4.7.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.040
And this is kind of an interesting breakdown.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.880
And by the way, NyxCraft adds the world is already moving on to ZFS.

14:30.880 --> 14:35.680
So a couple of things that are still not working properly in ButterFS as of kernel 4.7.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.660
I thought I would just mention them here.

14:37.660 --> 14:40.160
Not to ding it, but just so you know.

14:40.160 --> 14:46.060
They list defrag as mostly working okay, but extents currently get unshared.

14:46.060 --> 14:49.960
Compression is mostly okay.

14:49.960 --> 14:54.320
Auto repair and compression itself may crash from time to time.

14:54.320 --> 14:58.120
Scrub and RAID 5.6 are considered unstable.

14:58.120 --> 15:03.520
RAID 5.6 write holes still exist also, and parity is not being checksummed.

15:03.520 --> 15:07.800
And the free space treat is considered unstable.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.320
So if you're on a little Indian machine, you're okay.

15:10.320 --> 15:14.880
But if you're on anything but an x86 machine, apparently ButterFS can't calculate free space

15:14.880 --> 15:15.880
for shit.

15:15.880 --> 15:19.300
I think that's the version 2 free space tree that you have to enable by an option.

15:19.300 --> 15:22.280
So these are things that are considered totally unstable.

15:22.280 --> 15:26.960
Then they have things like device replace, balance, quotas and queue groups, out of band

15:26.960 --> 15:29.480
dedupe, and file range cloning that are all TBD.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.360
William, what do you think of that stuff?

15:31.360 --> 15:34.360
Anything else that jumped out at you about the current state of ButterFS?

15:34.360 --> 15:35.840
I mean, RAID 5.6 is broken.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.840
What a surprise.

15:36.840 --> 15:37.840
Yeah.

15:37.840 --> 15:42.600
It's like, we've kind of known that for a long time, that it wasn't in a great state

15:42.600 --> 15:45.440
and it never really has been fixed stability-wise.

15:45.440 --> 15:49.360
And I think that right there, your sentiment, is my point.

15:49.360 --> 15:54.100
I feel like as a community, enough of us have come to a, like, ah, this is never gonna,

15:54.100 --> 15:55.480
this is just not gonna work.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.440
Like I, I feel a little bit like-

15:57.440 --> 15:59.980
Yeah, so Sheep has been dumping countless hours into it, like they've definitely been

15:59.980 --> 16:02.400
submitting patches, but it's not really getting anywhere.

16:02.400 --> 16:09.120
I do feel like the window of acceptance, or I guess I should say the court of public opinion,

16:09.120 --> 16:10.920
may have come to its verdict.

16:10.920 --> 16:14.800
And that could change, but it doesn't have the same kind of, like, momentum or excitement

16:14.800 --> 16:18.760
or general, like, trust or anything that we'd like to see.

16:18.760 --> 16:22.440
I also don't see RAID 5.6 being as relevant today as they were 10 years ago, either.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.440
No, I mean, and I still use it, right?

16:23.440 --> 16:25.440
Most people are running RAID 1 and RAID 10 now.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.600
Well, I still use it myself.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
I still use it myself.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.200
It's still relevant for me.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.720
So how, why do you say that?

16:32.720 --> 16:36.000
Hold on, I don't hear you.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.440
Well, William, what else do you think people are using instead?

16:38.440 --> 16:40.000
Oh, he must be-

16:40.000 --> 16:42.760
Sorry, my mixer is flaky with the mute button sometimes.

16:42.760 --> 16:43.760
It's all right.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:44.760 --> 16:49.680
So what I was thinking is disks take so long to recover now, your large, like, four to

16:49.680 --> 16:53.800
eight terabyte disks, because the read speeds haven't, and write speeds haven't gone up

16:53.800 --> 16:57.320
enough to counteract how much space you're adding, how much capacity you're adding.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.480
So overall, you're re-silvering or you're rebuilding times are taking much, much longer

17:00.480 --> 17:01.480
than they used to.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.480
True.

17:02.480 --> 17:06.120
And so it's not as useful to use RAID 5 and 6 when you could rebuild much faster in a

17:06.120 --> 17:07.120
mirrored configuration.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.120
Yep, yep.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.440
And with less potential for data loss.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.440
Yeah.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.440
That's interesting.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.440
I do use mirrors a lot.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.440
And also storage is kind of cheap.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.440
So-

17:14.440 --> 17:15.440
Yeah, and then stripes and mirrors.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.440
It's not that big a deal to go 2X.

17:16.440 --> 17:17.440
You know, 2X is not a big deal.

17:17.440 --> 17:21.040
Yeah, you're losing some, but it's worth it for the speed of everything.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.200
All right.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.640
I think you probably, I think, you know, I think you're dead on on that.

17:25.640 --> 17:30.500
And I think, I think I will admit part of the reason I would, I would, the configurations

17:30.500 --> 17:37.000
in which I would still use RAID 5 or 6, I guess, would be not a lot of disks.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.440
And I specifically want something that's kind of a straightforward setup.

17:40.440 --> 17:45.240
And I, and I, and I, I'm thinking of like a, like a, maybe an editing, I mean, I don't

17:45.240 --> 17:48.920
even know anymore, but maybe an editing system with a few terabyte drives into that are super

17:48.920 --> 17:49.920
fast.

17:49.920 --> 17:53.400
But even there, I tend to do actually just a, just like a RAID 0 type setup.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.400
Yeah.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
Yeah.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.840
So instead of like, how much do you care about what are your priorities?

17:58.840 --> 18:02.640
So I have a feeling there may be a surprise in the air.

18:02.640 --> 18:06.640
There may be something we could be talking about next week or whenever.

18:06.640 --> 18:07.640
I actually don't know.

18:07.640 --> 18:11.600
I don't know when, but it's, if I was going to make a red book prediction, I'm going to

18:11.600 --> 18:16.080
say the next cloud project has something of their sleeve, which is going to take the project

18:16.080 --> 18:17.080
to the next level.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.080
What?

18:18.080 --> 18:23.040
Now they're kicking off a next cloud conference and they've just put up a blog post about

18:23.040 --> 18:24.040
it.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.400
There are a couple of headline speakers there.

18:26.400 --> 18:30.600
One of them is the CEO of Canonical, Jane, is it Silber?

18:30.600 --> 18:32.600
Is that how you say it?

18:32.600 --> 18:33.600
Yep.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.600
It's Silber.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.600
Yep.

18:35.600 --> 18:39.240
And then also Karen Sandler, the executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy

18:39.240 --> 18:43.560
will be giving some keynotes and they're going to have lightning talks and they're going

18:43.560 --> 18:49.320
to have hacking sessions where they encourage people to bring hardware and there's going

18:49.320 --> 18:50.320
to be a bit of a surprise.

18:50.320 --> 18:51.320
That's exciting.

18:51.320 --> 18:55.680
A bit of a surprise, a bit of a surprise that I can't tell you right now, but I will be

18:55.680 --> 18:56.680
able to tell you soon.

18:56.680 --> 18:57.680
Come on, Chris.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.680
Tell us, tell us.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.240
So if anybody gets a chance to go, let us know.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.560
Look at them having a conference.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.400
Yeah, I think that's cool.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.160
It kind of like gives them, you know, it defines them a little bit more as their own thing.

19:08.160 --> 19:14.440
I definitely want to give room to continue to listen to the own cloud version of events

19:14.440 --> 19:21.520
and just sort of break all this stuff down, but in terms of just tactical execution here,

19:21.520 --> 19:27.080
the next cloud project is lapping own cloud.

19:27.080 --> 19:31.480
Like the own cloud project or whatever, the own cloud company has stumbled to properly

19:31.480 --> 19:34.920
and fully respond to the entire series of events.

19:34.920 --> 19:39.920
When they finally did, it was through sort of indirect means and blog posts through quote

19:39.920 --> 19:41.240
unquote bloggers.

19:41.240 --> 19:48.040
And just all of this, and then all of this sort of has been rather, they've been rather

19:48.040 --> 19:49.040
quiet.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.040
They haven't really been executing.

19:50.040 --> 19:55.360
They haven't been executing on promotions as well and now this, there's a conference

19:55.360 --> 19:59.720
happening for next cloud, like there seems to be a lot of momentum there.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.720
It feels like it's, it feels more like a community.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.840
It feels more like there's like, there is life there.

20:04.840 --> 20:05.960
There's people excited about it.

20:05.960 --> 20:10.000
Like if it's just some quiet company that, if no one's talking about it, then why would

20:10.000 --> 20:11.560
we talk about it?

20:11.560 --> 20:19.120
And whereas with own cloud, I feel that there is sort of, it has the life support feeling

20:19.120 --> 20:21.120
right now.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.680
And the only thing that, and then part of me is just like, well, I know I need to, I

20:23.680 --> 20:26.600
know I need, I need to keep in mind there's two versions of events.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.320
There's always two sides to a story and we haven't fully heard their side.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.560
We've begun to hear, but we haven't fully heard.

20:31.560 --> 20:36.560
I keep keeping that in mind and the same time these guys are generating buzz right now.

20:36.560 --> 20:37.560
Exactly.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.560
But we don't want to rule it out.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.880
They might continue to be very good and they might do some exciting things that we want,

20:41.880 --> 20:44.120
that we're excited about, but you just don't know.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.920
Maybe Oracle should buy them and then kill them.

20:45.920 --> 20:46.920
Oh yeah.

20:46.920 --> 20:47.920
Why?

20:47.920 --> 20:48.920
And then we would know what to do.

20:48.920 --> 20:49.920
Why?

20:49.920 --> 20:50.920
We've established this whole path for software to die.

20:50.920 --> 20:51.920
No.

20:51.920 --> 20:52.920
Oracle buys you.

20:52.920 --> 20:53.920
Then the path would be clear, right?

20:53.920 --> 20:54.920
They can buy them.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.920
We can have the second open office and LibreOffice and go forward to LibreOffice.

20:56.920 --> 20:57.920
Eventually they shut to Apache and then it withers.

20:57.920 --> 20:58.920
Their next cloud in this case.

20:58.920 --> 20:59.920
Yeah, exactly.

20:59.920 --> 21:00.920
Oh man.

21:00.920 --> 21:04.880
I think that was the worst idea in the show yet.

21:04.880 --> 21:05.880
Donated.

21:05.880 --> 21:06.880
Hmm.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.240
I think they donated it straight to Apache and then you know it's dead.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.240
Hmm.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.560
Well, I've been using own cloud for a long, long time.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.320
In fact, I still have a droplet with it running on there.

21:14.320 --> 21:18.040
I don't actively use it, but I can still connect to it and check it out and all that stuff.

21:18.040 --> 21:21.020
So I'm keeping one toe in the water.

21:21.020 --> 21:27.440
So that's, I think, but I'm also feeling the next cloud pull.

21:27.440 --> 21:31.920
Anybody in the mob room running the next cloud installation at the moment with some regular

21:31.920 --> 21:32.920
use?

21:32.920 --> 21:33.920
Yep.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.400
I have it as a snap on a Raspberry Pi.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.760
And what are your thoughts so far?

21:38.760 --> 21:39.760
I like it.

21:39.760 --> 21:40.760
It just kind of sits there and runs.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.280
I don't really do an awful lot with it.

21:42.280 --> 21:45.880
It's not like active because I don't have a huge amount of storage attached to my Pi.

21:45.880 --> 21:46.880
Yeah.

21:46.880 --> 21:47.880
But I've just been playing with it.

21:47.880 --> 21:48.880
Yeah.

21:48.880 --> 21:49.880
Huh.

21:49.880 --> 21:50.880
I should do something like that.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.320
A Pi actually would be a good machine just to kind of, and I could, you know, I'd like

21:54.320 --> 21:55.320
to use it for calendaring.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.120
I did have a period of time.

21:58.120 --> 22:06.360
My own cloud peak, my peak own cloud was, I got all really anti-Google for a while.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.360
Exactly.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.800
And I seriously was getting creeped out by the tracking.

22:09.800 --> 22:13.120
And I went and got an iOS device.

22:13.120 --> 22:19.600
And I prototyped this, I remember I started this, I got like an iPhone 5 or something

22:19.600 --> 22:21.080
for free from Ting.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.520
And they just sent it to me so I could try this.

22:23.520 --> 22:31.480
And I set up everything to use, my calendar, my contacts, everything was pointed to my

22:31.480 --> 22:32.480
own cloud server.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.480
Right.

22:33.480 --> 22:39.800
And I had a, and I didn't use Google search, I had a 100% Google free iOS devices a little

22:39.800 --> 22:40.800
while ago now.

22:40.800 --> 22:41.800
Yeah.

22:41.800 --> 22:48.600
And own cloud, it reached that point where it was, I was totally unaware I was even using

22:48.600 --> 22:49.600
own cloud.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.600
I didn't, there was.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.600
It was just a backend.

22:51.600 --> 22:52.600
Yeah.

22:52.600 --> 22:57.100
I just had, and I had it syncing with my desktop, my gnome desktop, so I had calendar events

22:57.100 --> 22:58.100
on my phone.

22:58.100 --> 22:59.100
That is nice.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.100
Yeah.

23:00.100 --> 23:04.440
And once was I ever having to manage the own cloud server, I just got everything set up

23:04.440 --> 23:05.440
once and it worked.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.720
And it was a pretty cool experience because I didn't use Apple services and I didn't use

23:09.720 --> 23:10.720
Google services.

23:10.720 --> 23:11.720
Yep.

23:11.720 --> 23:15.880
So if I ever get around to getting that Ubuntu phone going, I might set something up just

23:15.880 --> 23:16.880
like that up.

23:16.880 --> 23:17.880
Oh yeah, that's a great idea.

23:17.880 --> 23:18.880
Yeah.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.520
But it would be nice, it does seem to work really well for that kind of stuff.

23:21.520 --> 23:25.920
It's just when you're using it for that and then the urge to use it also for your syncing.

23:25.920 --> 23:29.920
Maybe if it had better support for like, you know, just being strapped on top kind of as

23:29.920 --> 23:30.920
a layer.

23:30.920 --> 23:31.920
Yeah.

23:31.920 --> 23:32.920
I would use it more.

23:32.920 --> 23:33.920
Yeah.

23:33.920 --> 23:37.160
Wimby, are you still playing around with a Libre Vault?

23:37.160 --> 23:38.160
I am.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.160
And?

23:39.160 --> 23:40.160
And how is it going so far?

23:40.160 --> 23:45.880
Well, I haven't done anything significantly different from when we last spoke, but it's

23:45.880 --> 23:47.360
still working.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.360
That's good.

23:48.360 --> 23:55.000
Although Mark from Ubuntu podcast contacted me over the weekend because he was doing some

23:55.000 --> 23:59.680
testing and he ran into some issues actually getting the thing to run and there was a couple

23:59.680 --> 24:02.040
of bugs introduced in a recent update.

24:02.040 --> 24:07.880
So but you know, file issues on GitHub and the developers very responsive.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.940
So that was about to ask.

24:09.940 --> 24:11.480
That's kind of a good test right there.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.480
Yeah.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.480
Yeah.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.000
So I'm going to pick up with that.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.040
I've had a pause on that because I've been busy with other stuff.

24:18.040 --> 24:23.000
I'm going to pick up on that next week and put it through its paces a bit more and hopefully

24:23.000 --> 24:25.740
look to move something important over to it.

24:25.740 --> 24:35.080
My challenge is I've got about four terabytes of data in total that I'll be syncing using

24:35.080 --> 24:36.800
whatever I end up using.

24:36.800 --> 24:37.800
Wow.

24:37.800 --> 24:41.120
And one of the things I definitely noticed with it was a major issue with BitTorrent

24:41.120 --> 24:47.840
Sync is because that data set is so large, it was essentially constantly just working

24:47.840 --> 24:51.680
to recalculate the hash on the files, re-index, and by the time it got...

24:51.680 --> 24:52.680
Maintaining state.

24:52.680 --> 24:53.680
Yeah.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.680
Just churning.

24:54.680 --> 24:55.680
So I had to have a...

24:55.680 --> 24:56.960
I had a dedicated machine.

24:56.960 --> 24:57.960
Still do actually.

24:57.960 --> 24:58.960
I still do actually.

24:58.960 --> 24:59.960
I have a dedicated machine.

24:59.960 --> 25:03.280
It's a VM, but it's a dedicated machine with allocated resources just dedicated to that

25:03.280 --> 25:05.020
task.

25:05.020 --> 25:08.400
And so I don't know how LibreVault's going to handle that, but that'll be one of the

25:08.400 --> 25:09.400
things.

25:09.400 --> 25:12.120
And that's the unfiltered show notes are just huge.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.400
It's just a huge, huge set of data.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.400
And I don't...

25:15.400 --> 25:16.400
I haven't even released all of it.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.080
You should be like the testing bed for syncing solutions.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.080
I will be.

25:19.080 --> 25:22.760
It's unfortunate you can't use sync thing because they have an inotify solution which

25:22.760 --> 25:24.400
would reduce the polling of the files.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.000
Well, I don't know how LibreVault does it.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.960
So then maybe they're using Ionotify too.

25:27.960 --> 25:28.960
I think they do.

25:28.960 --> 25:29.960
Yeah, they could use inotify.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.640
I would hope if they're Linux focused.

25:32.640 --> 25:33.640
Yeah.

25:33.640 --> 25:34.640
Yeah.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.640
There's the wrapper.

25:35.640 --> 25:36.640
What's the lib something?

25:36.640 --> 25:37.640
Oh, really?

25:37.640 --> 25:40.040
Well, that does KQ and other stuff too.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.040
Yeah.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.040
Yeah.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.040
It is...

25:43.040 --> 25:46.440
If I have a dedicated machine, it's manageable and I just have it off on a set of disks, but

25:46.440 --> 25:47.760
that may be changing in the future.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.640
So I will be revisiting that.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.000
Either way, you know what?

25:51.000 --> 25:54.360
I will have it all running through a DigitalOcean droplet.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.900
That's how I do my cloud component to this.

25:55.900 --> 25:59.320
This is when I ran own cloud and if I try out next cloud, this is what I'll be doing.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.480
And when I do a LibreVault deployment...

26:01.480 --> 26:04.580
I've had a syncing on DigitalOcean for like, I don't know, two years now.

26:04.580 --> 26:05.580
It's just always there.

26:05.580 --> 26:06.580
It just sits there.

26:06.580 --> 26:07.580
It's always on.

26:07.580 --> 26:08.580
It's great.

26:08.580 --> 26:09.580
You know where the light went off for me?

26:09.580 --> 26:13.200
So DigitalOcean, you can get a droplet for $5 a month to do this.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.200
This is a $5 droplet.

26:14.200 --> 26:17.760
Especially if you're not transferring tons of stuff all the time.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.760
You just need it to kind of sit there and when you need it, it's there.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.240
And if you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you get a $10 credit.

26:23.240 --> 26:29.080
So the light went off for me when I decided it was time to do a couple of regional servers

26:29.080 --> 26:32.780
to help people that are downloading our own filter files just get it a little bit faster.

26:32.780 --> 26:36.880
So I sort of kick it off by seeding in their location and then other folks, other audience

26:36.880 --> 26:38.880
member in those areas pick it up.

26:38.880 --> 26:44.520
And of course, using BitTorrent Sync now, currently, it sort of becomes its own CDN.

26:44.520 --> 26:49.320
And so my transfer isn't that crazy because everybody that's part of the swarm is also

26:49.320 --> 26:55.120
transferring the files, but yet I'm able to serve them up at local speeds at $5 a month.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.120
That is awesome.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.120
It is great.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.120
It is so great.

26:58.120 --> 27:02.480
And you know, as I switch over to LibreVault, which I suspect I will, I'll just essentially

27:02.480 --> 27:04.480
implement the same exact setup.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.840
And you know, they have templates which makes us super nice.

27:06.840 --> 27:11.360
They also have snapshots, which is great before you make a big transition like I'll be making.

27:11.360 --> 27:15.920
And they have an API that allows me to automate like the rebooting and the managing of these

27:15.920 --> 27:17.600
systems really easily.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.920
And I can just use apps that have already been created by the open source community.

27:20.920 --> 27:24.880
So check them out at digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUG.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.040
They're all SSD-based storage.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.080
They have block storage you can attach as you need it.

27:29.080 --> 27:33.420
So as the unfilter storage grows now, I can add that, which makes being able to seed it

27:33.420 --> 27:37.840
with all of the content, the entire back catalog now much more possible, which is going to

27:37.840 --> 27:39.280
be super nice.

27:39.280 --> 27:47.640
And something else that they are sort of drawing everyone's attention to is high memory droplet

27:47.640 --> 27:48.640
pricing.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.640
It's easy for me to say.

27:49.640 --> 27:55.280
It's high memory droplet plans that offer large amounts of RAM, which is super, super

27:55.280 --> 27:56.280
cool.

27:56.280 --> 27:57.280
That's really handy.

27:57.280 --> 28:00.800
I mean, I'm talking like when I say large amounts of RAM, I'm talking like 128 gigabytes

28:00.800 --> 28:08.840
of RAM or, holy crap, 224 gigabytes of RAM.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.120
Damn.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.680
That is nuts.

28:11.680 --> 28:15.160
DigitalOcean, and then combine that with the SSD-backed block storage.

28:15.160 --> 28:18.040
And you know, they're using Linux for all of these systems.

28:18.040 --> 28:21.200
KVM for the virtualizer, I couldn't say more.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.120
DigitalOcean.com, just use our promo code DOUNPLUG.

28:23.120 --> 28:27.760
You apply that to your account, you get a $10 credit, and you just supported the unplugged

28:27.760 --> 28:28.760
program.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.760
Keep us going.

28:29.760 --> 28:37.680
Ok, bomb DOUNPLUG, and I wouldn't mind trying out one of those 256 gig droplets.

28:37.680 --> 28:38.960
I know, yeah.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.640
Just for a little while, you know, just an hour or two play with it.

28:41.640 --> 28:42.640
Geez, Louise.

28:42.640 --> 28:47.460
You know, I wonder, so what were you talking to me about before the pre-show, what you

28:47.460 --> 28:52.440
were talking about with the persistent RAM state, would that work on a virtual machine?

28:52.440 --> 28:54.500
It's a good question, it might.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.500
Yeah.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.500
Do you want to recap what it was?

28:56.500 --> 29:02.980
I was just talking about the kernel's persistent memory support for having like a block device in persistent memory

29:02.980 --> 29:04.300
So apparently I had no idea

29:04.300 --> 29:10.740
This is a module that's been available for a while that allows you to convert part of a space of memory of RAM

29:10.740 --> 29:11.080
Yeah

29:11.080 --> 29:16.460
So it's in storage and so it's meant for like for dealing with persisting like is this sort of the back-end technology that RAM dis

29:16.460 --> 29:20.900
Used to create a RAM disk or is this beyond that is it similar, but this is developed developed

29:21.580 --> 29:25.980
In theory to support like non-volatile RAM. Oh, so if you have like that bank

29:25.980 --> 29:31.740
I don't have that but for development purposes as well as other purposes. You can mark any segment of RAM

29:31.740 --> 29:36.840
Basically, you say like leave this unassigned and then the kernel can make a block device out of it. Okay

29:37.380 --> 29:41.020
And that actually the store that caught wood, but the content you store there

29:41.620 --> 29:45.020
Persists after a reboot not not like a full reboot

29:45.260 --> 29:47.020
Not if you like actually turn the system off

29:47.020 --> 29:49.780
But if you keep the system running and for instance K exec

29:49.980 --> 29:50.500
Yes

29:50.500 --> 29:54.120
Because if as long as you don't as long as you don't wipe that memory and then you boot the new kernel

29:54.120 --> 29:57.840
Also treating those memory regions as a block device then BAM. That's cool

29:57.840 --> 30:01.680
Yeah, so you can just have a whole system running and RAM reboot right back into it. Good. Oh

30:03.000 --> 30:05.780
That'd be fun. So what were you using that for?

30:06.800 --> 30:09.400
Not really anything specific. We're just playing with it

30:09.400 --> 30:10.520
But in theory, you know

30:10.520 --> 30:14.540
You can there's a lot of just like speed up use cases or maybe you just want to have a system who you know

30:14.540 --> 30:20.680
All your date you use your disk just for data and then you bootstrap into that kind of environment off like a pixie boot server or something

30:20.680 --> 30:22.280
for your root file system

30:22.280 --> 30:24.640
This is this is officially our geeky segment

30:24.640 --> 30:27.120
So I'm gonna play off that and I was just talking about KVM

30:27.120 --> 30:32.000
Which I think is the world's best virtualizer and is that even the right term? Should I hypervisor?

30:32.000 --> 30:35.560
Is that what I should be saying? Yeah, it is but this is called kimchi

30:35.560 --> 30:40.980
It's an HTML management interface for the SOB. So you course probably are familiar with boxes

30:41.520 --> 30:43.520
Mm-hmm. Very nice gooey to manage

30:44.400 --> 30:48.720
KVM or whatever but kimchi is an HTML based management tool for KVM

30:48.720 --> 30:53.280
It's designed to make it easy and possible to get started and look at these look at these screenshots

30:53.280 --> 30:58.600
Here's the login here and here's where they've got several virtual machines running. Oh, I like those icons

30:58.600 --> 31:03.960
Yeah, they match they recognize distros automatically and the virtual machines get the distro icon next to it, which is

31:04.680 --> 31:08.040
Very nice. Honestly, this is so nice. I probably should have kept it

31:08.040 --> 31:11.480
It's a secret and then done it as like a like a big segment on Linux action show

31:11.920 --> 31:13.840
They should it has a web interface

31:13.840 --> 31:19.680
It'll show you a list of running guests including live screenshots of the guest session you can use action buttons to shut down the guests

31:19.680 --> 31:23.440
Or you know, you can connect to the display of the guest in the browser. I was about to ask

31:23.760 --> 31:27.040
Mm-hmm. I think this is probably the way I'm gonna oh

31:28.920 --> 31:36.000
Boy, oh boy, I just got an idea. Oh boy. Oh boy. I see I was thinking I was oh boy

31:36.000 --> 31:40.680
I was thinking I was gonna use Proxmox in lady jupes. So one, you know, Wes

31:40.680 --> 31:45.440
I'm working on setting up a Linux based network in the RV. Yes, and I

31:46.680 --> 31:53.920
Was thinking I only want one computer. So you're gonna have like a virtualized all-in-one. I was thinking Proxmox

31:53.920 --> 31:55.300
It's worked super solid here

31:55.300 --> 31:58.520
It has been a total work champ and we've got machines have been running

31:58.720 --> 32:02.960
Literally since day one that we put when we moved in as one of the first things we stood up were these machines

32:02.960 --> 32:07.760
That's and they're still running today. It's been bulletproof. So I was thinking well, I should just set up Proxmox

32:07.760 --> 32:13.200
But honestly with kimchi, I I probably a lot, you know

32:13.200 --> 32:17.000
It's a lot easier to just bolt on I would I think I would rather do this with like a

32:17.480 --> 32:22.520
Base server install and then load kimchi to manage it because the thing is gonna the other thing about it

32:22.520 --> 32:25.680
It's gonna be under a cow. It's gonna be under a bench sealed up

32:25.680 --> 32:28.260
I there won't be a monitor I can get to or anything like that

32:28.560 --> 32:34.440
So this is this could be this this could be the virtualization solution. This might be my Proxmox replacement

32:34.440 --> 32:38.480
I was recommending Proxmox to a friend, but he was kind of running into things that he was already kind of

32:38.480 --> 32:41.000
You know the server he was had in mind. He's gonna already set it up

32:41.000 --> 32:43.840
He was already using Ubuntu on it and he didn't really feel like, you know

32:43.840 --> 32:47.600
He didn't want to wipe and reinstall and that guy so like he might just be able to bolt right on and bam

32:47.600 --> 32:48.720
All right. There you go. Okay

32:48.720 --> 32:54.600
And it could be perfect for me this because I would much rather just have like a base

32:54.880 --> 32:58.000
1604 server install or something like that and then install this on top of it

32:58.720 --> 33:00.440
Proxmox is fantastic

33:00.440 --> 33:04.960
But it still is a little too free-nazzy for me in the sense that it's too much of us

33:05.280 --> 33:08.360
Pre-built setup that I'm especially if you're only going for one device, right?

33:08.360 --> 33:10.840
So if it's your office and you just stick it in the corner, that's fine

33:10.840 --> 33:15.280
Yes, when you have the device that like in six months, you might need it to do a whole new function

33:15.280 --> 33:17.000
Yeah, Proxmox doesn't support. Yeah here

33:17.000 --> 33:21.640
We have a dedicated Proxmox machine and it runs in the garage 24-7

33:21.640 --> 33:25.880
And that is the only thing it does and I just cannot do that in an RV

33:25.880 --> 33:30.720
so this is gonna be the I I can I cannot wait to play with it. It's called kimchi and

33:31.440 --> 33:36.380
We will have a link in the show notes to the github page. So while we're in the geeky category

33:36.380 --> 33:43.200
I wanted to talk about the management firmware that comes with the pretty much most Intel machines for years now, right?

33:43.200 --> 33:45.920
I mean, I think it's been in there since the core series perhaps

33:45.920 --> 33:47.600
I don't know when it was added, but it's certainly been here

33:47.600 --> 33:53.280
Yeah for the but like all things that are in bundled with the Intel stuff. They iterated on every single release

33:53.280 --> 33:58.800
constantly adding features and it is it is some people call it like the

33:59.800 --> 34:05.400
Sort of the spyware Intel spyware that is its proprietary. There's no we have no idea what it does

34:05.400 --> 34:10.100
It's called the management management firmware. Is that what it's called an engine management engine? Thank you

34:10.100 --> 34:16.480
Thank you, and it does all kinds of crazy things like apparently it uses your network connection to go out and synchronize with NTP servers

34:16.480 --> 34:22.880
Yeah, if you run Windows, it supports functions like syncing your Wi-Fi network passwords to the firmware chip itself

34:24.000 --> 34:28.380
And of course no source code is available for this although and the core boot project

34:28.760 --> 34:36.380
Has been has been keen on replacing this or getting rid of it and there's been some experiments by I'm gonna say Tramel trammell

34:37.360 --> 34:41.320
Tramel, yeah, maybe Tramel. I apologize. I'm sorry. I'm so horrible with names

34:41.320 --> 34:44.880
Yeah, come join us and then correct us. That would be cheese. That would be great

34:44.880 --> 34:46.960
But we could just have a name person on here

34:46.960 --> 34:51.880
I'd be all about that, but you are familiar with his work if you're not familiar with his name

34:52.520 --> 34:58.920
He is the one that created the magic lantern firmware. He reverse engineered the firmware on the Canon 5d mark 2 Wow

34:59.040 --> 35:03.680
Yeah, that is really cool. Yeah, he's also he's also the guy behind thunder strike

35:03.680 --> 35:08.720
which is a proof-of-concept EFI firmware root root kit for Apple's MacBooks that uses a

35:09.520 --> 35:10.960
Thunderbolt and

35:10.960 --> 35:12.960
We've covered it extensively on tech snap

35:12.960 --> 35:17.440
I he is so he you were probably you're probably familiar with some of his work

35:17.440 --> 35:19.520
even if you're not familiar with the name like I wasn't and

35:20.160 --> 35:23.240
He's been poking around at trying to get

35:23.960 --> 35:28.360
the trying to get around or disable this management engine and

35:28.840 --> 35:34.580
He says I'm experimenting with what happens if I remove the management engine firmware from the lower

35:34.580 --> 35:37.200
SPI flash chip on a ThinkPad x2 30

35:37.200 --> 35:44.940
I just erased the first four kilobytes of its region take that and then core boot boots up fine and reports that this has a

35:44.940 --> 35:49.420
Bad firmware the management is a bad firmware, but it continues on and Linux actually

35:50.080 --> 35:52.080
initializes without any complaints

35:52.640 --> 35:57.760
And then he went to try to remove the entire region of memory and of course it immediately wouldn't boot at all

35:57.760 --> 36:03.340
But he's so he's beginning to experiment with where what he can poke at and what he can damage in the management engine

36:03.340 --> 36:09.360
I like that to make it unusable, but still to make Linux bootable right which is kind of a great idea

36:09.360 --> 36:12.120
Yeah, right what an interesting approach is we're cracking the

36:13.040 --> 36:17.960
Destroy the damn thing x2 30. What's that? Which version of the ThinkPad? Did he say?

36:17.960 --> 36:20.120
Yeah, it's the x2 30 ThinkPad x2 30

36:20.120 --> 36:26.200
So I wonder if he can still do that with later models because I've heard they are locking down the management engine more and more

36:26.200 --> 36:28.680
And relying on it. Yeah, there's some discussion about that in the thread

36:28.680 --> 36:33.560
I believe so I'm kind of curious if the x2 30 isn't the best representative model for this no interesting

36:33.560 --> 36:38.280
I didn't know that and you know I mean in some ways that might be true for actual production solutions

36:38.280 --> 36:42.680
But in other ways that it allows him to poke at this and actually be able to see

36:42.960 --> 36:45.520
What kind of results and proceed so in some ways?

36:45.520 --> 36:48.280
Maybe it's good, but in other ways it means it's not applicable to

36:48.920 --> 36:51.920
Some people they're getting newer ThinkPads. Yeah, that's a good

36:51.920 --> 36:59.600
That's good to know in the in the good-to-know column. Have you have you ever have you ever had to enter in like your keyring?

36:59.600 --> 37:05.240
Password on the gnome desktop sure yeah, yeah, maybe I think this probably apply to unity as well or Ubuntu matei

37:05.240 --> 37:09.200
I'm not sure I mean yeah, I don't know actually maybe I could add wimpy

37:09.960 --> 37:12.260
So the gnome key ring is that that's a that is a?

37:13.040 --> 37:19.900
That on the matei desktop. Yep, okay, so I had a I had a I had a very privileged thing happened to me

37:19.900 --> 37:25.820
It is one of the best things it's ever happened in my life is I had other people build a computer for me

37:25.820 --> 37:33.200
What I had to pay for the components for my own Bitcoin, but I had your own treasure. I had other people assemble them for me

37:33.840 --> 37:38.500
Mainly the beard and and Noah and he created we created a we covered the machines

37:38.500 --> 37:41.380
We said this is way. This is months and months and months and months ago, and

37:42.340 --> 37:47.420
He he even installed Anna gross for me. He set up Noah. He set up Anna gross for me

37:47.420 --> 37:49.420
He set up real nice installed a few apps for me

37:49.420 --> 37:53.540
And set the password to something generic and said all right have at it. See you later

37:54.420 --> 37:58.220
And I said thanks sat down started using it and I opened up Chrome

37:58.220 --> 38:05.860
And I got a key ring prompt for the password I typed in my password that you'd said and nothing happened wrong password I

38:06.780 --> 38:10.920
Typed in other variations of generic passwords. I know Noah's used from various studio

38:11.580 --> 38:13.580
Nothing happened

38:13.620 --> 38:15.620
It was at that point. I realized I

38:15.620 --> 38:22.060
I don't know my key ring password. Ah screw it. I don't care won't be a problem right well turns out

38:22.060 --> 38:26.660
I tried I saw I began setting up in Elias and one okay

38:26.660 --> 38:32.980
Yeah, I'm I said in LA is nihilus nihilus and one the mail client trying to set up my own server get all that stood and

38:32.980 --> 38:34.980
standing interesting and and

38:35.460 --> 38:40.740
one specifically relies on the gnome key ring to store your credentials are very like for Google and

38:40.740 --> 38:46.080
So because I could not unlock my unlock my key ring. I couldn't you couldn't you set up and one

38:46.680 --> 38:49.280
And so then I so then I had to set off on a mission

38:49.280 --> 38:51.520
I was on a mission now yep to be able to solve this problem

38:51.520 --> 38:55.520
I didn't know what I could do because I didn't know what the password was and the only way to change the password obviously is

38:55.520 --> 38:57.400
To provide the previous password can't do that

38:57.400 --> 39:02.440
And I don't want to reload because the machines freaking perfect except for this one thing yes

39:03.240 --> 39:06.360
So I eat the key ring, so here's what I did

39:06.360 --> 39:10.380
And there's probably there's probably a few ways to crack this nut so please leave a comment and let me know

39:10.380 --> 39:12.960
but what I did is I installed seahorse and

39:13.840 --> 39:19.560
Then I went into seahorse, and I selected the key ring that was there and I deleted it

39:19.560 --> 39:21.560
Which means it deleted anything that had in there?

39:22.080 --> 39:26.900
And they were prompts you for a few times, and then I went to the file menu new created a new key ring

39:27.520 --> 39:31.080
Set in a password that I knew and then this is the key part you have to do

39:31.760 --> 39:36.720
After you create the new key ring you have to right-click on the new key ring and say set as default

39:36.720 --> 39:41.780
And and then go reconfigure the applications that we're trying to store their key ring credentials

39:41.800 --> 39:48.160
So I then went and reset and reset up and one and then it prompted and actually because I already had my key ring unlocked everything

39:48.160 --> 39:50.400
Just worked just worked right so I have links in the show notes

39:50.400 --> 39:56.560
But seahorse was the key ring manager that I decided to use and I have I have a brief description in the show notes if you

39:56.560 --> 40:02.280
Ever run into this about seahorse. Yeah, it worked well. Yeah, and you know you know why I was trying out and one is

40:02.280 --> 40:08.460
Oh, this is not really related to seahorse, but and one has totally kick-ass key base

40:08.460 --> 40:10.980
Io and it really does yeah, oh have you played with it, too?

40:10.980 --> 40:12.640
Yeah, yeah, you should follow me

40:12.640 --> 40:18.640
And I should follow you on key base and all that s because I'm Chris LAS on key based on IO beautiful and that I

40:19.260 --> 40:24.040
Have been getting some emails this week that people been using my and I needed a I needed a solid way

40:24.040 --> 40:26.400
Oh, they support it very nice. I was actually quite impressed with that

40:26.400 --> 40:30.520
Yeah, so the so did you go for the pro? Did you stand on server? Yeah? No I ended up

40:30.520 --> 40:36.280
I decided I'm trying both. I'm okay building my own server, but I also be so I saw so this week

40:36.280 --> 40:40.280
I've been getting a lot of emails for on filter that are encrypted. I'm like I need a way to

40:41.080 --> 40:43.660
Yeah, I got a so I wouldn't bought pro in the meantime

40:43.660 --> 40:48.360
But I actually already have a droplet set up where I've already started to but I just didn't have time to all moving very fast

40:48.360 --> 40:50.060
It's been a busy week

40:50.060 --> 40:56.260
But damn that if that ain't if that ain't a sweet integration and it totally beats a big male or whatever you call it in Thunderbird

40:56.260 --> 41:01.260
Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Anyways key based on IO slash Chris LAS and what are you on there?

41:02.260 --> 41:07.380
I think I'm West pain. Let's jeez. Well, I'm noble pain. I'm noble pain on there. Okay. There you go

41:07.380 --> 41:11.960
Yeah, so I've been enjoying the layers in that sense and I apparently it also is

41:12.780 --> 41:14.580
super

41:14.580 --> 41:19.500
Vigilant about tracking when people read your emails. Have you noticed this? Yes, so they have this I think that's a pro only feature

41:19.500 --> 41:20.220
They have you know

41:20.220 --> 41:25.140
They have like the built-in support for like read tracking and that kind of stuff so that when they open it

41:25.140 --> 41:31.380
They're you know downloading something. Yeah, they're servers that yes track of that. They've seen it. Yeah, which maybe that's important to you. Well

41:32.140 --> 41:38.220
I'll tell you it's been interesting because I've been corresponding with an individual from the Linux Foundation recently and

41:40.180 --> 41:45.340
It is interesting to get that bit of information from time to time it is helpful

41:45.340 --> 41:48.180
I will say to get that bit of information a little metadata. Uh-huh

41:48.180 --> 41:55.860
Uh-huh. And so that was an unsurprising perk of using of using n1 that I I thought read receipts were like this

41:55.860 --> 41:59.380
It's not even it's like it's more than read receipts though, isn't it? Yeah, something else. What's the

42:00.220 --> 42:05.220
Pricing on the pro right now. Do you know I don't let me go look cuz it's not cheap

42:06.500 --> 42:12.120
But I was pretty happy with their client though, and the you know, it played pretty nicely with my work

42:12.120 --> 42:16.740
I think they make it really Oh pricing. No, here they go right here sits. Oh, it's okay

42:16.740 --> 42:18.860
It's not nearly as much as I remembered. It's seven dollars a month

42:20.300 --> 42:24.580
but for me, here's here's here's why I like this a lot is I

42:26.800 --> 42:32.860
Have a lot of I have right now I have over 13,000 unread email messages

42:32.860 --> 42:35.220
And I usually get that down to about five thousand

42:35.220 --> 42:40.680
And it's about as low as I ever get sure and so having an email client that anything that can help me search faster

42:41.180 --> 42:45.420
We're gonna actually today in this show. We're gonna we're gonna read email

42:45.420 --> 42:48.340
We're gonna cover email and later on in the show

42:48.340 --> 42:53.580
It's it's one of the it's one of the first times in probably a year that we've read a email on this show simply because

42:53.580 --> 42:59.160
I now have a slightly better workflow to collect you can actually look at the email. Yeah, so it's been worth it

42:59.300 --> 43:02.660
It actually has been worth it for me because it's been good for

43:03.980 --> 43:09.040
Some encrypted communications or you know GPG encrypted communications for and filter

43:09.040 --> 43:14.460
It's been great for corresponding with the Linux Foundation and it's been great now for this particular function

43:14.460 --> 43:20.020
So I do like it quite a bit. I think it's rather nice. It's it's bulky it is

43:20.700 --> 43:23.300
Not cheap you can stand up your own server

43:23.300 --> 43:24.700
I'm going to work on that but right now

43:24.700 --> 43:27.540
I decided to try this because I wanted to use this right away

43:27.540 --> 43:32.980
Yeah, but it also is like you know you're using some other you're using some other background anyway

43:32.980 --> 43:36.940
That's probably free so you know maybe there's an angle where you're like well

43:36.940 --> 43:43.300
Is it enough of a thing on top that I would I would not I would not recommend it for most people

43:43.300 --> 43:47.340
Just if you're concerned all about a third-party being involved in your email

43:48.780 --> 43:52.300
Unless you're using Google services, then go screw yourself. You're a hypocrite all right

43:52.300 --> 43:58.900
I want to talk about something else is totally unsecure USB IP. This is brilliant. This is such a brilliant project

43:58.900 --> 44:03.900
I this is this is something that actually could be really great for Linux terminal service project

44:04.220 --> 44:10.580
USB IP is a project aimed at developing a general USB device sharing system over an IP network USB IP

44:10.580 --> 44:18.740
Encapsulates USB I O messages into TCP IP payloads and transmits them between computers original device

44:19.020 --> 44:25.820
Divide drivers and applications can be also used on the remote computers, so they have with no modification

44:25.820 --> 44:28.460
They have no idea so USB storage discs work

44:28.460 --> 44:36.620
Just fine even even tools like fdisk and make FS and mount all work fine USB keyboards and mice webcams and speakers

44:36.620 --> 44:41.260
USB printers even this and and

44:41.820 --> 44:47.700
USB devices it currently is implemented as a Linux device driver and available under the GPL

44:47.700 --> 44:52.620
It's IO performance is enough for practical it for it says this is I think the English is a little broken

44:53.020 --> 44:56.740
Performance is enough practical and local area network for all types of devices

44:57.360 --> 45:03.120
Including IO synchronous devices without any modification of Linux original USB device drivers

45:04.300 --> 45:06.180
interesting

45:06.180 --> 45:12.500
This could be big for us because this could essentially turn any webcam into an IP camera for us

45:12.500 --> 45:16.460
Yeah, and we could bring we could bring these into our OBS machine. We could have

45:17.300 --> 45:18.780
this of this

45:18.780 --> 45:24.580
This could work so amazing because we could have little machines that could be raspberry pies all over

45:25.060 --> 45:31.020
Conferences with USB web cameras that we could pull into our OBS machine amazing. Yeah, wow

45:31.020 --> 45:33.020
I'm super excited about this project

45:33.020 --> 45:39.980
I'm very it's it's self it I'm selfish, but I'm very excited because it if if the host network was good enough to support it

45:39.980 --> 45:43.180
And it doesn't have to be crazy. We could really we could really

45:43.940 --> 45:46.940
Essentially have a Linux powered IP

45:47.700 --> 45:49.700
camera solution here

45:50.620 --> 45:56.780
Boy yeah, if that would work I'm gonna try we should we have to try yeah, I think so well

45:56.780 --> 45:58.960
Maybe I can get no Enrique to try yeah

45:58.960 --> 46:05.520
I think guys yeah, hey guys. Hey guys. Let's take all the things to put them over IP. What do you think mosenrath?

46:07.160 --> 46:13.040
I'm not so sure I would actually trust that you know like if you're gonna do that over say like a private network a

46:13.120 --> 46:20.280
Monitored network sure go right ahead, but if you're not think about it for a second people are already hacking

46:21.360 --> 46:24.520
Like you know webcams and all that kind of stuff already using whatever means

46:24.520 --> 46:30.480
I'm not smart enough to remember how that's all done, but now if you're putting them all really on the net

46:30.480 --> 46:36.240
Via the wonderful wonderful world of IP what happens if someone says oh, I know what that is

46:36.240 --> 46:37.120
I know what that is

46:37.120 --> 46:40.760
I know what that is and starts just pretty much using all those IPs to

46:40.840 --> 46:44.360
Literally just record all the stuff that you're doing that way instead of recording

46:44.440 --> 46:52.080
You know what's going on on your computer using your computer to record you so this is totally got a lot of huge massive

46:52.080 --> 46:53.680
unbelievable

46:53.680 --> 46:56.920
Security ramifications that we probably can't even begin to touch on I mean

46:56.920 --> 47:01.360
This is this is the project even says you know use this for devices you trust

47:01.360 --> 47:06.960
But on a local area network here like in the studio where we're the only thing we're doing is production, right?

47:08.280 --> 47:13.840
Or or where we could go set up a network where you could trust that network a dedicated switch that kind of thing which is

47:13.840 --> 47:15.840
What we would do oh man

47:16.160 --> 47:20.600
That if you do in a controlled environment. I think it's there's a lot of potential to this

47:20.600 --> 47:25.720
Yeah, William you have thoughts on it. We're just gonna say lock it down. Yeah lock it down

47:25.720 --> 47:29.120
It's a little environment stick it over. You know I'd be sacred and then to be great

47:29.120 --> 47:33.240
It'd be amazing could also this could also be a great way to do network installs you could have

47:34.720 --> 47:39.720
Remote IP USB flash drives, or I don't know I mean just there's a lot of I think there's a lot of

47:40.240 --> 47:46.920
Reminds me of like and DB or the network block device dr. DB. Is that what you're similar to that? Oh?

47:46.920 --> 47:53.760
Network no, what are you talking about Wes how you can mount it you mount a block device over the network. Yeah, yeah

47:53.760 --> 47:58.520
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, dear DB's for like block device replication. Yeah exactly okay, I follow you

47:58.520 --> 48:02.240
Yeah, same thing, but yep now this can be just any USB device mm-hmm

48:02.960 --> 48:06.080
Cool, it's very cool. I'm pretty excited about it anyways

48:06.080 --> 48:11.920
Well wonder if you could do like a synergy type thing not not like as synergistic obviously because it'd be you know

48:12.000 --> 48:16.240
Taken over by one machine, but like here's my keyboard over here. Yeah really mounted on that machine

48:16.240 --> 48:20.960
I think you probably could I think you I think I think that would probably I don't know why that wouldn't work

48:20.960 --> 48:26.920
I could be or and you hmm because to the Linux host it just it just looks like a USB local device

48:26.920 --> 48:32.040
They had this the the software level is just exactly the kind of thing about Linux where it's like you know

48:32.600 --> 48:35.400
Maybe you have like practical applications right in your mind

48:35.400 --> 48:37.240
But there's just so much fun and playing with it

48:37.240 --> 48:41.400
And there's like so many things that you'll discover like maybe it actually is useful to you

48:41.400 --> 48:42.340
Just because you can do it

48:42.340 --> 48:47.480
I legitimately on this computer over here already have a telegram thread going with Noah talking about how we could use this in production

48:47.480 --> 48:48.720
So we will probably test this yes

48:48.720 --> 48:53.000
And get back to you guys on it because it I think it's I think it has some serious potential

48:53.000 --> 48:57.720
I am I am constantly trying to scheme different. I actually kind of blame

48:58.480 --> 49:00.800
I kind of blame wimpy in some ways

49:00.800 --> 49:03.340
But I'm constantly trying to scheme ways we can

49:03.760 --> 49:11.040
We can come up with cool solutions for using Linux to podcast and then and then contribute back to those projects in user air

49:11.040 --> 49:15.880
For that'll come out. God knows when because I'm gonna going on a road trip cat Dev random

49:15.880 --> 49:18.680
that's when but in user air for we talked about some of the

49:19.960 --> 49:25.380
Technology changes we've been doing on the back end and one of the new open source projects that Rekha has been contributing to

49:26.040 --> 49:28.700
sending patches back to to produce user air and

49:29.280 --> 49:34.800
It is it's pretty awesome because so far at least and I know this will probably not always be the case

49:34.800 --> 49:38.000
But so far every upstream project. We've begun working with

49:38.000 --> 49:44.400
For the tools we're using in-house has been damn receptive. That's awesome and in the case of the tool

49:44.400 --> 49:47.960
We're gonna talk about user for is implementing the patches right away

49:47.960 --> 49:54.120
So some of the stuff that we needed to get fixed to improve playback on Android devices and stuff

49:54.120 --> 49:56.520
He's already he's already fixed it upstream Wow yeah

49:56.520 --> 49:59.080
It's so we started we started in-house like well

49:59.080 --> 50:02.680
We'll patch that we'll patch it ourselves and then Rekha Rekha contacted the developer

50:02.680 --> 50:05.200
We've had a couple of successes like that now so anyways

50:05.200 --> 50:10.500
We'll talk about that in the state user air for but it is really cool to be able to take this stuff and say

50:11.280 --> 50:14.400
This gives Linux an advantage in production right of course

50:14.400 --> 50:15.760
That's the lens of what I look at this

50:15.760 --> 50:22.080
but that is is where we're gonna build a pretty good list here of reasons that make Linux awesome to do media production pretty soon and

50:22.360 --> 50:24.360
It's gonna make the Mac look like a joke

50:24.640 --> 50:30.960
You know what else looks like a joke the rest of the mobile industry compared to ting I mean it is

50:30.960 --> 50:37.480
I got nothing these the duopolies they try to be creative, but really they just want to soak you for every single thing

50:37.480 --> 50:41.240
See that's not how ting does it ting is just pay for what you use wireless

50:41.240 --> 50:46.300
It's six dollars for the line, and then you just pay for what you use ting keeps rates simple

50:46.400 --> 50:48.400
We don't make you pick a plan instead

50:48.400 --> 50:53.240
You just use your phone as you normally would how much you use determines how much you pay each month

50:53.480 --> 50:56.120
You can have as many devices as you want on one account

50:56.120 --> 51:01.280
That's good because when you use more you pay less per minute message or megabyte of data

51:01.480 --> 51:06.480
Your usage plus six dollars per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill

51:07.200 --> 51:09.440
Simple that's what we mean when we say

51:11.160 --> 51:14.300
Mobile that makes sense and then they back it up with

51:14.840 --> 51:18.640
Fantastic passionate customer service you get to talk to a real human being they stay on the line

51:18.640 --> 51:21.100
I remember when I was on my road trip out to Noah's house

51:21.100 --> 51:28.920
And I had a mi-fi issue that wasn't ting's fault, and I legitimately I legitimately thought at least three times

51:29.520 --> 51:35.440
It is totally understandable for this person to bail on me right now. It's just a human that could be like listen sir

51:35.440 --> 51:40.080
It should work. I don't know I have I have I have been in that support role before

51:40.800 --> 51:43.440
so I'm like totally understandable and

51:44.200 --> 51:47.800
legitimately they stuck with me the entire time and

51:47.800 --> 51:52.800
It was I was so damn impressed with that experience, but honestly

51:52.800 --> 51:55.680
I don't often talk to the team customer support because they just have a great dashboard

51:55.680 --> 51:59.440
They the control panel really let's you manage anything and an app for your phone, too

51:59.440 --> 52:05.640
It's really nice and the nice thing about it. I'll just say you can go in there and set limits on certain people's accounts

52:07.440 --> 52:09.440
Ha I gotta lock the beard down

52:09.440 --> 52:12.440
He's a mess yeah

52:15.000 --> 52:19.120
They've also got a whole line of devices. They're unlocked you own them outright. They're yours

52:19.520 --> 52:22.680
It's such like an upfront and honest way to do mobile service

52:22.680 --> 52:26.680
There's no like secret backdoor deals. We have to call up and ask when you can get your next

52:27.240 --> 52:29.440
agreements or contracts or

52:30.000 --> 52:33.160
Commitments, it's early termination fees none of that. It's gone

52:33.440 --> 52:35.680
You just got to go to linux.ting.com that'll take

52:35.680 --> 52:39.680
$25 off your first device or if you bring a device and they get CDMA and GSM

52:39.800 --> 52:44.120
It'll take $25 off your first month which will probably pay for the whole damn thing depending on how much you use

52:44.120 --> 52:50.280
So just start by going to linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

52:51.440 --> 52:59.400
All right, so Wes you and I were sort of caveats in recently is that commencing is that about the state of desktop customization

52:59.400 --> 53:03.120
I gave Loki a pretty good review in 434

53:03.120 --> 53:07.960
I think it's a I think it's got a couple of rough spots, but overall it's a pretty polished desktop a unique product. Yes

53:08.720 --> 53:14.840
But it from a customizability standpoint. That's not its strongest standpoint. It's not where it's really

53:16.120 --> 53:18.920
That's not where you go if you want to have a really custom experience

53:19.120 --> 53:21.480
There's a lot of other options with the plasma desktop

53:21.720 --> 53:24.360
There is some great themes for the gnome desktop

53:24.360 --> 53:29.880
And it's interesting because different distributions make it easier or harder to accomplish this

53:29.880 --> 53:36.880
And if you look at if you look at distributions like arch, yep, there is easy access

53:36.880 --> 53:39.500
But there's no direct tools that allow you to necessarily

53:40.440 --> 53:47.200
Implement those themes right you look at distributions like Ubuntu Mate that come with the tweak tool that allow you to choose a general layout

53:47.440 --> 53:52.640
Which is an overall interface paradigm, but not actually a theme tool itself

53:52.640 --> 53:58.400
There's several they're separate theme tools right, but they're sort of predefined preset. You have a box in which you can play and

53:58.400 --> 54:00.400
and and and so

54:00.920 --> 54:05.040
There's a lot that can be done, but depending on the desktop you choose and the distro you choose

54:05.680 --> 54:07.680
or the combination in which

54:08.480 --> 54:13.680
The variability is very high. Yeah, really it really is and so you've been recently doing

54:13.680 --> 54:16.440
I think you just reloaded from fedora right yeah

54:16.440 --> 54:20.400
Well, I was just getting ready to my laptop has been polluted by all the various things

54:20.400 --> 54:23.040
We've tried here on the show no doubt so I thought like well

54:23.040 --> 54:25.880
Let's reinstall and I can kind of want to redo some of the partitioning to better

54:25.880 --> 54:30.480
You know have better space when I do you want to reinstall like six operating systems at a time to give them a shot

54:31.040 --> 54:32.400
and

54:32.400 --> 54:35.400
I was just thinking about it, and it's not like my main workstation

54:35.400 --> 54:39.920
It's kind of like my on-the-go laptop when I you know when I'm out and about and don't need serious power or anything else

54:39.920 --> 54:43.040
So so it's not crucial. It's not like you know the one I spend all my time on

54:43.680 --> 54:46.600
And I was just thinking about it. It's like I'm very comfortable installing arch

54:46.600 --> 54:47.600
I like installing arch

54:47.600 --> 54:53.680
But there's kind of that last layer of like picking themes choosing them remembering like which directories

54:53.680 --> 54:56.200
I need to stick them in so that they'll be picked up by the right programs

54:56.240 --> 54:59.920
you know even things down to like customizing my vim setup and that sort of stuff where it's

55:00.800 --> 55:05.240
It sometimes it takes me a little bit to get going and there are just some things about

55:05.880 --> 55:07.720
Antrigos in particular in this case. I just thinking well

55:07.720 --> 55:12.080
It's I can get like a really nice desktop where I can still customize everything

55:12.080 --> 55:15.360
I need to write like there's not crazy things installed by default

55:15.360 --> 55:20.680
But I'm up and running in a thing that looks beautiful and like I'm not ashamed to have next to my wife's MacBook

55:21.280 --> 55:23.280
That's an interesting

55:23.280 --> 55:26.960
Criteria, and I don't I don't usually do that. I'm not saying that's like yeah what I will do

55:29.240 --> 55:34.720
And I feel like when you say it was easier was it because that it just came pre-installed with new mix or is it or

55:34.720 --> 55:35.240
Is it something else?

55:35.240 --> 55:37.080
I think so I think it's more just

55:37.080 --> 55:43.360
What what we lack is that like that sense of design in a lot of ways like elementary has it right?

55:43.360 --> 55:45.800
And that's kind of one of the things that sets them apart other distributions have it, too

55:47.040 --> 55:49.840
But especially in like the Wild West of arch or some other places

55:49.840 --> 55:54.760
I feel like it's you know you see like the Unix porn subreddit and that kind of thing and there's a lot of good examples

55:54.760 --> 55:58.640
There, but it it really is something you you have to figure out if you want something

55:58.640 --> 56:00.240
That's non-standard, but you want it to look nice

56:00.240 --> 56:05.080
You really have to figure it out for yourself, and there's like such a there's such a huge array of different possibilities

56:06.280 --> 56:08.760
There's a lot of directions. I think we could go

56:10.560 --> 56:14.080
And I I guess I have one I obviously have one take on this

56:14.080 --> 56:16.200
But I kind of want to bounce it around the mumble room a bit

56:16.200 --> 56:20.720
And I haven't heard from poppy for a while, so I'll start with him. I'd like to hear poppy thoughts on

56:21.360 --> 56:23.360
desktop Linux customization

56:23.520 --> 56:25.840
if you have just general thoughts, but also on

56:27.040 --> 56:31.680
If it's if it's really something that we need to be concerned with at all

56:32.240 --> 56:35.440
I'm I'm the worst person to ask because I'm the kind of guy who

56:35.760 --> 56:42.140
Installed a desktop and then leaves it basically so I think that makes you the perfect person because it's a totally different perspective

56:42.140 --> 56:44.600
Which is I'm kind of like I want to live your world for a second

56:44.600 --> 56:49.880
And so I just don't care. I just want it to get out of the way and get on with doing my applications

56:49.880 --> 56:52.680
I'll generally accept whatever the wallpaper is I might change it

56:52.680 --> 56:56.800
but I've gone for months with whatever the default wallpaper is on my distro and

56:57.440 --> 57:02.360
Probably the only thing I would fiddle is the size of the launcher on the side. You just make it a little bit smaller

57:02.360 --> 57:04.520
I'll install loads of apps of course

57:05.000 --> 57:11.320
And I might change the default so instead of having Firefox to my default. I may have Google Chrome, but

57:11.320 --> 57:15.040
That's about as far as it goes. Um, maybe in a terminal

57:15.040 --> 57:19.960
I might change the font and the font size, but really that's it

57:19.960 --> 57:24.560
I I don't change you consider yourself a very distractible person

57:26.080 --> 57:27.600
Yeah

57:27.600 --> 57:33.120
Okay, so I guess I mean, I mean yes. Yes, totally if by that you mean, you know

57:33.120 --> 57:34.480
I mean I have

57:34.480 --> 57:37.920
loads of windows open with all my social networks in and all that kind of stuff and I also

57:37.920 --> 57:41.360
You know have a phone nearby pinging me at every and yeah

57:42.600 --> 57:44.880
Okay. Okay. I that's I

57:45.600 --> 57:48.560
I just think that for me

57:48.560 --> 57:56.480
I I the reason why I customize is because I can't stop until it's just right and I and I feel like it steals brain

57:56.480 --> 58:02.480
Cycles to use a CPU term. I feel like it steals cycles from my brain right until I've got it just right

58:02.480 --> 58:09.600
So here's a different question. Has it has it gotten easier or less important because it's easier like I feel like ten years ago

58:10.160 --> 58:13.520
If you were using Linux like especially like when comp is was the rage and all that

58:13.520 --> 58:16.960
Like you wanted to customize right you wanted to like show off me like look I can make this look cool

58:16.960 --> 58:17.800
Yeah

58:17.800 --> 58:23.960
Is it just that these days like we've done a good enough job that most distributions you install like they they look respectable like you

58:23.960 --> 58:27.440
Don't have to try to compete to make them look like Windows or Mac because they're their own thing

58:27.440 --> 58:32.560
I think there's a part of that but I mean when I was working on Windows or my

58:32.640 --> 58:34.840
When my work laptop would have been a Windows machine

58:34.840 --> 58:39.920
I would have probably done the same as Chris and I would have tuned it and moved the launcher and fiddled this

58:39.920 --> 58:43.540
So what are those gaming things for Windows even called? Oh my god. Yes

58:44.000 --> 58:45.840
Yes, the dark I would have done

58:45.840 --> 58:50.740
I would have I would have done all of that to get it absolutely perfect because I'd be sat at that computer all the time

58:51.040 --> 58:56.700
Nowadays, I actually just accept most of the defaults and I find that's fine. I have a Windows 10

58:56.700 --> 58:58.700
Machine that I do

58:58.900 --> 59:02.900
That mostly gaming but I do a bit of surfing when it happens to be booted into Windows

59:02.900 --> 59:03.140
Sure

59:03.140 --> 59:07.860
And I don't change that at all other than move the launcher to the left-hand side because that makes sense what?

59:08.540 --> 59:13.700
Barbarian as the launcher at the bottom of the screen consuming vertical real estate that just sounds insane

59:13.860 --> 59:21.420
So I move the launcher to the left and that's it job done job done. That's that's that I like it poppy

59:21.420 --> 59:22.780
That's a good perspective now. Mr

59:22.780 --> 59:28.680
Sipes is in the in the mumble room and you had a chance to look at elementary OS. What do you think about a

59:29.580 --> 59:35.140
Distribution that really focuses on we're gonna just make it look right out of the box and call it good

59:36.460 --> 59:43.260
You stole the words out of my mouth Chris. I used it this past week and it is freaking awesome

59:44.020 --> 59:50.900
I'm the guy I'm kind of like you I try to tweak everything to make it just perfect and until then it's it's not right and

59:50.900 --> 59:52.580
I

59:52.580 --> 59:54.580
popped into elementary and

59:54.980 --> 01:00:00.620
Once I got my head around the keyboard shortcuts that they write that are slightly different than unity. Yep

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.420
I was pretty much there

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:08.980
There are a couple of things which I got back to the team about that. I think are just little bugs maybe that could be

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.740
Squashed and make the experience even better

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:19.380
But man, like their defaults are like dead-on and it kind of made me upset and I hate to do this

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.700
while poppies in here, but the it kind of made me upset because

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:29.380
Elementary has the polish and has the the out-of-the-box experience that at this point

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:32.860
I really wish that I got that same feeling when I popped up unity

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:39.420
To your opinion right

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:44.340
All right, fair enough now I want to give I write I yeah, I I

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:49.060
I think if I could have if I could sum up my last review about elementary OS

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:51.060
It would be it is the default

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:55.860
Configuration in which my AGD mine can relax and I can just get work done

01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:00.980
Yep, and I think I could if I could have just said that if I could have probably summarized the entire review

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:06.180
North ever to that last episode, but North Ranger is on the opposite side of this spectrum

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:09.300
He says screw just let it just sit there and don't tweak it

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:14.860
The tweaking is the the beauty of the Linux desktop. Is that right North Ranger? Yeah, you know

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:20.500
And my experience has kind of grown I think with the way the Linux desktop has grown because you know way back in the day

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.860
I vaguely remember

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:26.620
Messing with you know for boom and an open box on Dora. Okay, I'd had at the time

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:33.460
Was you know, you know actually kind of settled into I just want it to work during the Ubuntu GNOME 2 days

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:37.180
But when they booted or the when the unity split happened

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:41.940
I kind of checked out on desktop Linux for a while and it was about I want to say about GNOME 3

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:47.860
312 or 314. Yeah when I really jumped back in but even though I liked the way that

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.140
The GNOME folks were handling things. I still wanted things to work a certain way

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:58.900
So I went down the extension rabbit hole man. I probably have about 30 GNOME extensions

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:06.220
I don't know what that's like and I tell you the beauty I think of the system that is available particularly on the GNOME side

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.860
Nowadays is how programmable it is

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:16.620
I had a great example of the screencast extension that allows you to record your desktop. Yeah, and I didn't like the

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.580
Gstreamer

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:22.260
Settings that it was using and hey, it's just a JavaScript file

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:26.640
I could go in and mess with it and I thought that was awesome that it's not only the look and feel

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.540
It's actually how the desktop works awesome and terrifying. I agree. I agree

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:36.900
Well said I actually thought you're gonna come and come at me with the plasma desktop mini mech

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.600
I want to give you a chance to jump in go go for it, sir

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.420
Yeah, especially on small screens

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:47.900
I would love that all the desktop environments will have an auto hide or in tele height top bar

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:54.100
Because that top bar takes space and there yeah, it's space lost for me

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:59.660
Yeah, that that precious vertical space because all our screens are now 16 by 9 or widescreen aspect ratio

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:04.960
So we did it vertical spaces at a premium now. There is one voice has been absent so far and that would be mr

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:11.300
wimpy and like it or not wimpy may be sort of the face of traditional desktop on

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:16.820
Linux now traditional desktop that has moved forward in ways that make a lot of sense

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:21.060
But wimpy we've talked a lot or we've talked around this a lot, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.820
Okay

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:23.980
Okay

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:30.540
Yeah, I make a distro and I added a tweak tool so I could pre bundle the defaults suit me

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:36.020
Which is the Cupertino layout? Mm-hmm. So when I installed a bunzu Marte, so you do customize it

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.020
You just build a tool to just automatically

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:41.940
The rest of us get to benefit yeah

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:45.660
That's one way to do it. I guess. Yeah, so

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:53.380
There are tools and but then there is the practical matter of getting the themes and I think this is and I'm not this

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:56.160
Is not a this is not a arch master race thing

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.640
I just think honestly, this is where arch probably pulls ahead is the AUR has all the best themes

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:09.700
It really does and and and the the simple fact of the matter is you can do pack AUR dash capital s GTK dash theme dash

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:16.100
Arc enter and you now have the best theme available for the gnome desktop. You didn't have to Google for a PPA

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:20.540
You didn't have to make sure it was the right PPA. You didn't have to add it to your software repository

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:23.260
You didn't have to add the key if you needed to you didn't have to refresh your

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.780
Source list and then you didn't have to issue the install command separately

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.540
It's already done and you've already configured your gnome desktop to have that theme

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:37.540
it is legitimately one of the best distribution when it comes to choosing a theme because it's just in the AUR and I I

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:44.740
Think that's I think that's one area where I've really enjoyed cinnamon and the plasma desktop is in their theme selector

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.180
They just download the themes for you

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:49.220
I feel like because that's one of the things about themes I guess that I would

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:53.380
From before is that it feels very much like there's not a central index

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:58.300
There's not a lot of like can you and if someone knows like is there a good like 2015 2016?

01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:03.940
really good guide about how to theme Linux and all the different options and where you go and what are popular themes and where to

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.580
Look for those things. I feel like it's kind of like something you gradually learn

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:11.340
You have to know Linux people who know what good themes are to listen to Chris Lass is, you know

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.420
Very good opinions about them. Thank you

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:17.500
So it's nice if they if you know the AUR is kind of one of those places like you have like a blessed themes

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:23.500
Well, you have a you are at least you can type in gnome theme search and then search by votes or or

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:28.420
Popularity and get a good idea of which themes people are installing. Yes, it provides like something from like that

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:33.920
That's a nice for some people like tweak their desktop. That is a that's an inherent advantage, but mr

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:41.420
Cipe says he has the ultimate solution. Yeah, so here's what I say. I say that

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:47.140
The canonical higher wimpy and higher the elementary team and

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:53.980
They work really hard on making things customer customizable, but also really nice and polished out of the box

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:56.980
What do you think of it? What do you think of that Chris? You think we should?

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:02.740
Pressure them into into doing that. I actually think what we should do

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:04.740
We'll all buy a bunch of phones if they do

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.660
Ryan if we're gonna play that game what I say we should well

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:14.180
I would say what we should do is start a campaign with in system 76 to ship one of their laptops with elementary OS

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.180
That's what I say. We should

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.300
Know I think honestly, I

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.860
Think really there is a certain design choice that should be made for the traditional desktop

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.860
Obviously that's something that canonical has

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:34.340
Gotten some flack for in the past and the and the switch over to unity 8 is probably gonna reignite that debate to some degree

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.980
After it happens, but I actually and I'm not gonna put words in wimpy's mouth

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.580
but in my opinion the way it seems to be working is

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.500
canonical

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:46.860
Acknowledges the existence of the Ubuntu Mate project. It is it is an official flavor

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:52.980
They have extended invitation invites to wimpy to go to things like the snap sprint invite. It kind of seems like

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:59.740
the ideal arrangement for end-users at this point because wimpy is able to manage his project as a

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:08.300
Independent project and make decisions the best benefit it and its user base while basing it on a technology stack that is

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:15.800
Not only aware of the project's existence, but working amicably with that project. I mean it seems right now to be

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.540
sort of an ideal

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:25.460
Arrangement and I mean I wish the best of wimpy could if canonical offered him a great salary go for wimpy

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.460
But I think wimpy

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:30.320
You have something kind of unique in your hands. I was just saying to

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.820
West before we started the show and

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:38.300
Then you you you kind of mockingly reshared this or or jokingly reshared this on Google Plus

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:43.780
But the the the sentence that stuck in my head was the Linux distribution of the year. I

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:49.660
I mean the year is not over yet, but there are there are only so many distributions

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:55.140
I would put maybe in the top three and Ubuntu Mate is there and I I think you have a good arrangement now

01:07:55.140 --> 01:08:02.020
And I think it's that's just my opinion, but I think it's I think it's one of the best distributions of the year so far

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.580
Yeah, sadly not the best. It sounds like so

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:12.460
Right yeah, yeah, well, you know Ike he's been working hard. He's been working hard, and he didn't spend some time here on the West

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.460
Yeah, no he doesn't sleep

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.620
He's actually been able to so in five years

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:23.260
He'll explode and then you guys will be somehow somehow he's even been able to ship the Mate desktop for solace

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:25.920
So yeah, now who knows what could happen good to see

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:33.340
All right, so I want to move forward we have some follow-up and feedback to get to but I would like to hear your thoughts

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:35.220
out there about

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.140
The oh well actually Ryan. Did you have thoughts on polish before we move off?

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:42.340
yeah, the the thing that gets me is I

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:50.220
whenever I was using elementary this past week, and I've used Mate before and the thing that I come back to is I

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:56.700
I've gotten so used to popping into a distribution and having like

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:01.140
These little things that bug the crap out of me and having to go through

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:04.060
you know a series of steps in order to fix them and

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:08.620
It was so weird to to pop in and feel like

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:13.460
There had been a lot of focus on that polish, and I didn't really know what you were talking about

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:17.220
In your in your review till I popped up

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:21.820
You know elementary on my own box and started playing with it, and I realized

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.500
Just the just the little things that have gotten neglected

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:32.700
neglected for what I think our visions outside of you know that that experience of I

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:38.780
Have a desktop. You know I have this desktop distribution. I'm gonna make it as great as possible and

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:47.820
Anyway, that was super frustrating and and I've and I'm glad that that we have like Mate and I've talked to Aiki quite a bit

01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.820
You know solace talking about his

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.300
his full focus being on

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.980
his desktop distribution and

01:09:55.700 --> 01:10:01.180
Elementary it sounds like they're doing the same thing and I just really wished that there was that same focus

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:07.340
From from other projects as well and making the desktop experience. Just work and be

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.100
consistent and nice

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:18.900
So anyway, that's that's I'll get off my high horse, but that's that's that's where my head's been today, and I was just so impressed

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:23.300
the past few days playing with elementary that I so wanted to

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:29.700
To talk about the great job that you know some projects are doing around that polish and that great experience

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:31.020
I feel like

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.500
elementary solace and Ubuntu bate

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:38.180
Might be my top three for the year right now at this point and

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:43.020
For different reasons for each one of them. I feel like they're they're they're all

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:50.380
Or at least to some extent distributions you can recommend and the the caveats that you would have with that would go along with that

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:55.180
Are pretty minimal, you know, well, there's a lot of other distributions that like are amazing in some ways

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:55.980
But you have to be like well

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.020
but except for this and you're gonna have to do that and

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:03.340
But all those would be like I could set those up for a lot of people and just they would be that's they would do

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:13.660
That's dead-on. That's exactly that's better than I could have ever put it. It's a that thing where you start apologizing

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:20.980
This is good, you know, but you're gonna run into this and I just turn it off to Wi-Fi off put it back on

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.780
It's fine. Don't suspend don't suspend

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:28.060
Yeah, that's exactly it. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, it is

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:30.380
it's

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:36.340
2016 I think some of the surprises have been so far now that we're more than halfway into it has have been these distributions

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:41.740
but also and not just because Ryan's here because I also say same same goes to Entraware is

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:51.480
Some and and and purism is working on it to some aggressive improvements some some really aggressive improvements to

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:56.640
the desktops and laptops that run this stuff and I think there's still people out there that have

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.840
a perfectly legitimate reasons to choose a ThinkPad or a or even a MacBook Pro

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:01.920
I mean the or a Dell Sputnik

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:07.240
there's a lot of different hardware out there at this moment that Linux will run on but the the the

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.720
locally sourced

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.720
artisan homegrown

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.840
100% organic

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.940
Laptops that run Linux have been better penguin tattoo right on them better than ever and now we have these distributions

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.680
that are better forever and it's kind of a funny because

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.120
I

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.840
Don't I don't think we really talked a lot about this at the beginning of the year. No, we didn't

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:34.880
Interesting. All right. Well, let's move on let's I think we've probably spent enough time on this

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.360
But thank you mumble room this yeah

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:41.680
And if you have if you have thoughts on Linux desktop customization, feel free to let us know in the comments

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:48.400
I want to mention Linux Academy before we move into our feedback Linux Academy comm slash unplugged go get the advanced

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.320
Skills you need around Linux the basics

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:58.040
But also really all of the cool things around Linux that are more more sophisticated they have advanced training tools that increase your skills and encourage

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.920
Critical thinking and give you hands-on experience at Linux Academy. You start by going to Linux Academy comm slash

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:12.080
Unplugged they have labs and exercises that give you real world servers where you get to actually work on this stuff

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.520
Really feel confident with it and walk away like you've actually done it before in that interview can be like, yep

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.960
I I totally hosed that easy to instance. I just destroyed it

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.720
And now I know what not to do and you know

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.600
What's nice about like specifically with the ec2 stuff all included as part of Linux Academy subscription

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.760
It's not like you got to go set up a separate thing and all of that

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.200
You can SSH right into the servers

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:36.520
They have practice exams and quizzes learning plans that give you a time frame and you can just work within that

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:41.280
In fact, if you're busy, they have availability planners that'll sort of work with you on your days

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:46.680
You have available and set up reminders. It's a super cool system full of Jupiter broadcasting community members

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.160
and

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:51.240
Created by Linux enthusiasts. I think the big thing for me is like

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:57.760
Even just outside of the JB community the amount that I've seen people jump on the Linux Academy bandwagon is amazing

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:02.120
Like yeah, you know like big old-school admins just a whole gamut of people who use Linux

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:07.000
I've seen just like they're getting really big the people who use Linux they they know about Linux Academy because it's made by people

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.680
Who use and yeah, it's high-quality stuff and they're getting bigger and bigger all the time. Exactly

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.500
It is pretty neat to see them grow Linux Academy comm slash

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.500
unplugged

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:19.340
Alright, so this is an email that came into the show from storm 77

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:23.840
He says warning they may use a pro 5 Ubuntu manual that we linked to last week

01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:31.100
Suggest formatting the external SD card. Hi. Hello by the hello there. Hi there. Hello in an episode real pain in the flash

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:36.280
Love 161 you added this manual to the show notes any links to the PDF by the way

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:41.120
He says in the TWRP section on wiping the device. It also selects the micro SD card

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:46.140
This is the external SD card. Not the internal one. I saw it in time. It just let you know

01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:48.220
I almost formatted my 120 gigabyte card

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:51.020
Just wanted to prevent anybody else from running into this

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.060
The backup is also incomplete

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:56.740
So I wrote a small tool to back up the entire flash onto an internal SD card

01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:02.140
He links us to that too and he says give wimpy his regards. Well, that's just great. Thank you for the warning

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:08.340
Yes, likewise the tool improvement. That's amazing. And it's great that that you're doing that

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:13.420
I think you you should let us know more about your experiences. It's going forward. Oh wimpy. Can we get an update from you?

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.500
Fine going well, thank you

01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:22.900
Good legally awaiting OTA 13 in the hope that

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.620
Bluetooth is

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:30.940
Bluetooth specifically Bluetooth audio is resolved for for my my device

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:33.940
I thought I thought literally you were gonna do with all is going well. Thank you

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:37.860
Yeah, I don't ask you about your phone do I

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:45.840
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I was in fact, I'm gonna cover OTA 13 a little bit in the next week's episode of the Linux action show

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.500
Yeah, no, it's all good it's good

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:54.140
I think it's it looks like a pretty great update. So I just talked about that a little bit in the next episode of last

01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:56.260
which

01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:03.620
I'll be honest was pre-recorded. I know I'm going on a little road trip and so we pre-recorded that but so we I do happen

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:07.820
To know the future and that we talked about that new update. So Bluetooth is what wimpy is looking forward to it

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:09.820
Sounds like yes. Yeah

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:13.820
All right, I'm a whole bunch of stuff. I'm looking forward to but that in particular

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:16.980
I'm gonna keep asking you wimpy all the time because you I'm living by

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:21.580
Prepared in the future. This is revenge for you asking about when the Libra was kind of

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:28.660
I was doing that for about six months

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.140
Chris you need to buy something so we can bring that back. You should take mental notes wimpy

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:37.760
You could take it. No, I'll just ask you next week. Actually, I just really want to know

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.900
Yeah, that's me too. Yeah, exactly Paul writes in

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:46.380
About a bunch of touch way into the nexus 70 says that with all the talk recently about a bunch of touching KDE

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:52.420
Have you seen plasma dash mobile org you talked about Wayland how good that will be to have

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:58.040
But on arch with gnome 320, it's already available. If you just check out your gdm custom.com file

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.900
Finally, it's rumored that there will be a nexus pixel 7 this year

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:08.500
If that happens, do you think a boon to touch would be released for it? Keep up the great shows Paul

01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:14.100
So mr. Popey, can I pick your brain on what is the process when a brand new piece of hardware ships?

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:18.860
What is sort of what is what the impetus to get a boon to touch on that devices?

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:22.620
I got to imagine it's a it's a starts with somebody picking up a piece of hardware

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:28.100
Yeah, for the most part their community ports

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:35.700
So it's you've got to have a someone skilled in doing the porting and be they've got to actually have the device

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:40.020
Yeah, and then third third the real the real killer is time

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:46.580
They've got to have time to actually sit down and do the port and when you have a never-ending supply of Android

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:52.380
Devices coming and people, you know saying hey, I want this one next this one next

01:17:52.660 --> 01:18:00.020
It's it's actually a never-ending supply and we need more people to to to get involved in that because it's just

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:04.940
You know, there are more devices out there than there are possible people who can pour them, you know

01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:10.060
I would imagine so it's it's a small team. But yeah, generally you pick up advices and

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:15.180
you know get the source code for the kernel and all that kind of stuff and then start the porting effort and

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:19.340
Follow the documentation basically so far and this could change over time

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:24.220
But it seems like the way it works is when a device reads it reaches a certain critical mass

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:28.060
Which it can sometimes be a year or two after its original release

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:30.900
you start to see

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:34.140
enough community members coming together to work on that device like

01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:36.140
The Nexus 5 for example

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:42.900
Or other devices where there's just it's kind of nice in a sense because it gives a device of yours a second life

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.660
but at the same time as

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:51.720
The community grows I would expect that might scale a bit more right and and there's a lot of resources typical like

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:54.380
Developers scratching their own itch, you know

01:18:55.180 --> 01:19:00.080
Has a Nexus 5 in front of them and once you know once the port to happen

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:04.540
Then they'll either try and do it themselves or they'll throw some money at somebody else to do it

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:05.460
It's you know

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:09.300
If you if you don't have it if if there's a device and you don't actually have one

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:14.340
You're probably not motivated to want to pull to it. Then you need that because there are a lot of people

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:16.860
yeah, there is like a there is a

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:24.460
Shoot, I'm blanking on the name poppy, but there's kind of like a bounty source equivalent for device port. Isn't there you be ports?

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:30.220
Yes, you before you have any ports. It's it's got a patreon as well. Okay, there you go

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:34.540
so that that is an eye that's a fascinating idea to in fact, I think I've I think I've actually

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:38.100
Well, cuz you kind of need that like you need the people developing it

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:42.220
They need to have the phones and then you need the people who are willing who have the phones and are willing to like run

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:47.180
It and then submit bugs and you know patches and core dumps and all that stuff. Yeah

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:53.020
It's fascinating though because it can all happen just takes a community to do it. It takes a village West

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:57.820
It takes a village to raise a phone. So Java King writes in and wants to know my Bitcoin Linux details

01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:00.740
He wants me to expose all my secrets. He says hi Chris. You mentioned using Bitcoin

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:05.520
I'm a new bitcoiner and I wonder if you might elaborate on your setup. Maybe share you with your audience

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:11.100
Here are some questions. I have do you use Bitcoin core or a lightweight client with multi bit or electrum?

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:15.860
Have you securely backed up your wallet dot dad? Do you perform all transactions from a single desktop? And

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:22.260
What currency exchange do you use and what app do you use to monitor the Bitcoin value? Thanks Java King. Boom

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:29.120
Give us the deets Chris. So Java King. He said you're a new bitcoiner and you wanted to know how how I

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:34.780
Secure my setup. No, I'd say my first step is don't tell people how you use Bitcoin. That's my first hint

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:40.860
Because that is the worst thing you could do. But since I am here, it's helped. I am here at your service

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.500
I am here for you. I will I will expose myself

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:48.260
so I use electrum as my wallet of choice it has I've

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:54.540
Mainly since I started plan B. I've used this because I I've had an on-and-off

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:59.820
Conversation thread over the years with the developer and so I just happened to know the person behind it and I like it

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.740
But also I like the fact that it fires up right away. That's one of the things I really enjoy about it

01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:09.620
Have you tried electrum? Yeah, I have. Yeah. I also like the instant on yes, really. That's a big sell

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:15.560
Yeah, so electrum is the the wallet of choice. So then he said do I back up my wallet dot dat file?

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:18.600
How do I securely back up my wallet dot dat file?

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:26.520
Well, one of the cool things about Bitcoin Java King is you could actually store it offline and there are methods to actually even print

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.520
It out and store it if you want. So look into that

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.960
Do you perform all transactions from a single desktop? Yes

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:38.300
And I back that directory up. What currency exchange do you use? I'm lazy. I use coinbase

01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:40.600
Yeah, what do you know? I also am lazy and use coinbase

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:44.460
And I've also talked to the people behind coinbase before and I know them and I like them

01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:48.380
So what desktop after you used to monitor the current Bitcoin value? Well, I

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:51.300
am

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:56.780
Apparently a masochist. I use a gnome extension. And so I have a gnome extension that works all the time

01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.740
So right now at the Bitcoin price as we record this episode

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:04.580
$609 and 64 cents a US greenback this morning. It was at

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:09.100
$611 and so I made a small Bitcoin transaction on behalf of the Jupiter broadcasting

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:14.900
Well my Bitcoin, but I purchased something for the Jupiter broadcasting network because I made the guesstimate that that's the high for the day

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.380
And I need this thing

01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:20.180
And so that's I kind of watch that and if I know there's something that the network needs

01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:26.420
I watch that on my desktop and I try to I try to make my purchase in the point where it's at the highest value

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.340
of the day

01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:32.040
and there's there's I have I have so many Bitcoin bookmarks that I also check but

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:39.280
I believe coin average. That's the one I was gonna say Bitcoin average is just a little pin tab. Yeah, check out Bitcoin average

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:44.440
We also have the we also have some Bitcoin functionality built into J bot. Oh, yeah, that's right

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.000
Yeah, and if you want to follow news of the Bitcoin subreddit, it's usually pretty good

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.960
you can go there and check that out Bitcoin still hanging around it's hanging around and

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:58.000
Noah is actually still mining Bitcoin to this day. Oh, is he? Yeah. Wow, he does

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.880
He has some dedicated rigs to wimpy. Do you mind any Bitcoin anymore? No, it's a false game. Yeah, I agree

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:04.640
Yeah, I agree

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:09.080
I think Noah gets the power for free for some reason and a like it's like from like this

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:14.360
All right, this building overall payment that he made not even sure it's worth it for the heat that it generates

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:18.920
Anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I did look into getting some of those

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:22.160
faster USB

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:29.400
A6 yeah to plug into a pie. Yeah, but the difficulty now is astronomical

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:34.800
Even if you sort of used a dozen of those, you know, you yeah. Yeah, it's not worth it

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:40.160
You're just you're just participating in network playing your role in keeping the network healthy

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:47.480
But you're not actually gonna make anything you need some serious horsepower these days. I have I have I have been experiencing

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:53.760
some interesting like holy what you're using Bitcoin and like

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.280
Yeah Bitcoin, yeah, they what Bitcoin and I'm like

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.160
I'm totally shocked

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:04.800
I mean I look at them like you know what Bitcoin is they look at me like I've heard this word before but I have

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.440
No idea what you're talking about

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:10.760
There are more and more small independent shops in Washington

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:16.960
That are using Bitcoin as a back-end payment as a back-end sort of

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.080
What is the right word to use it's like it's like this it's the payment processing

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:26.800
They're using Bitcoin to fund the transactions and the payment processing and then they're immediately converting it into cash

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.360
Right, and so at the point-of-sales device, I give them a visa or a MasterCard

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:39.480
but when they swipe it the payment processor is using Bitcoin to float the transaction or something and then

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.040
the

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.040
Merchant receives the payment in cash

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:51.000
Interesting and this is there's a lot of little businesses doing this now and they have it hooked up to the tablets and Wow

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:59.200
Yeah, so you just use your your visa regular Visa card, but Bitcoin is used on the back end as some sort of facility interesting facilitator

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.360
Yeah, huh? I've been meaning to look into it more. We should definitely look into them

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:07.840
Yeah, yeah. So anyways, it's it's Bitcoin still out there. Yeah, Electrum is my wall

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:13.080
There's multi bits and other multi bits another good one. Yeah, check out but I like Electrum

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:18.160
So when be do you do you have a wallet that you like to mention or do you want to talk about your setup at all?

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:26.100
Well these days I use coin corner as my exchange and my wallet. Mmm coin corner. Yeah, nice

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:32.000
so they're based in the Isle of Man which is in the shores of the

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:34.720
British Isles, but

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.080
independently governed I

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.860
Like I like that. That was that was your requirement

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:48.080
Well, it wasn't a requirement back when I was looking because I went through the whole you know getting out of Mount Gox

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.980
That all yeah, I mean and and even when that was

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:56.740
like the only reputable exchange around it was

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.240
It was always a heart-in-mouth moment whenever you did any kind of

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:07.400
Yes, gosh, it was man. It was just awful. So I was looking for an exchange and

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.160
A few couple of years ago. Yeah about two years ago

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:17.440
I found coin corner and they were a startup then but they'd got all the right bits in that they could do

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:21.520
Sterling euros dollars

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:27.600
they'd got all the necessary financial approvals they'd got a sensible bunch of people behind them and

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.240
I

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:34.120
Switched all that over to them and I've not looked back since they've been a really good service

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:39.880
So they're much like coinbase, but that they are in this part of the world, which was kind of important

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:45.880
Absolutely. Sure. That makes sense. And of course our our Bitcoin expert poppy any Bitcoin update from you?

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:52.200
Hmm. No, it seems like he wandered off to bed. Nope. He doesn't have a Bitcoin update. I think he just

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:57.800
Doesn't have one. He's counting all these bitcoins. Yes. Yeah filthy rich bastard

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:58.520
All right

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:03.720
That brings us to the end of this week's unplugged if you would like to send us an email go to Jupiter broadcasting comm

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:10.100
Contact you're also encouraged to leave feedback wherever you watched this or visit the subreddit

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:12.440
It Linux actually showed our reddit comm and man

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:19.200
Would we love if you showed up live Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar and also shout out to the Linux gamer

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:22.480
Who may be joining us next week on the program. That's right. Don't forget

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:28.240
Tune in live at JB live TV and if you'd like to join our virtual lug go get mumble and then bang mumble in our

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:49.760
Chat room to find out more. We'll see you back here next Tuesday

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.240
Oh

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:25.520
JB titles comm let's go pick our title you guys. Let's go figure out what we're gonna call this sucker. Hey guys

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.920
Thanks for being here. It was a good show. I really appreciate a great mumble turnout. Yeah, absolutely

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.500
Hmm that mumble the room virtual log

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.080
While we do that

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:45.080
Let's see if I can type now with the live updating too. So have you been doing desktop customization?

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.640
What do you been you got what do you got going on over here? No, I I this has not been customized at all yet

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:54.920
Oh, I installed I installed it as we started the show damn damn snickety

01:28:54.920 --> 01:29:00.040
Thankfully causal is really easy to install so that's true. That's true. That's why I'm running Firefox. Well, I have Chrome now

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:03.940
I just haven't switched Linux flying high Linux is for tweakers yikes

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.160
Yeah, that's right week

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:10.920
All right, well, let's see while

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:18.040
While we go vote at JB titles comm a brief distraction. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:22.240
You said commercial software. I don't know what to make of this Indiegogo project

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.840
It's it's title it gets me excited big brother needs to be stopped

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:34.440
Independence Day for your private data a new way of using cloud services and messaging apps and they've got 20 days left to raise some funds

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:36.840
I'll play a little bit of their publicity video and maybe we can

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:42.240
Can I get a larger version of here? They see it's trapped in the yeah. Here we go. Let's watch this thing

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:47.960
Hi, we are saying we'd like to show you a new way using cloud services

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:55.720
Messaging apps a way that's simpler and more secure than ever before. Are you one of the 1.6 billion people on our planet?

01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:02.240
Using messaging apps and cloud storage. It's kind of a cool track. You can share anything you want with the whole wide world

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.200
But what if you don't want to share?

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.560
Set even up to you

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:14.880
Think about it. What actually happens to messages when you hit sent and what happens to your data when you upload it to your cloud service?

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.680
Some cloud services are easy to use including for data snoops

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:25.040
Some are transparent about what's under the hood and if you even manage to keep the door shut on big brother

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:32.520
But there's not a single solution out there that delivers all three of these requirements, but with Zengi you're always protected

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:36.680
Not only do we encrypt your data with the best available code

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:40.000
We split every single file into countless fragments

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:47.160
Which we then distribute across all cloud storage services you use. So this is like a layer that says on top of your cloud services

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:48.920
I see interesting

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:57.320
So for the cloud provider and anyone else your data is just a random collection of unreadable data chunks

01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:02.680
Because with Zengi only you have the key to the fully assembled files

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:09.080
Nobody should see your messages, but the people who sent them to whatsapp and other providers claim they encrypt your message

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:12.720
But you are also just claiming that you encrypt my message

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:15.160
You got to give me a little more here and don't snoop on them

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:23.160
But do you really believe them Zengi is open source so you can see yourself that our code secure and free of any backdoors

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.040
I like that. Or get a nerd you can trust to check for you

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:31.080
Zengi the world's first encryption solution for the people by the people

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.080
Not some big multinational

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:37.480
Even when there are secure solutions out there, they never just hand it to you on a platter

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:43.000
The thing is your security shouldn't be some puzzle you have to solve

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:43.960
He's got a Rubik's Cube

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:47.000
It's a serious game and you should be free to play it by your own rules

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:47.800
Did he saw that there?

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.800
Rules that you configure

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:53.000
You know what would be great is if it was part of you know

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.440
You know, it's a stretch goal for a project like this that I would be totally behind is

01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:01.640
You know you do your main funding for for actually accomplishing this

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:06.040
But then in one of the stretch goals a full third party audit

01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:09.640
Oh, that would be great. Yeah, that would be a great stretch goal that I could get behind

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.640
Using the simplicity of Zengi

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:19.080
Rules that protect you and the people who you really trust

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.400
If somebody is hyper security conscious

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:24.280
Are they less likely to use a Fitbit because he's got a Fitbit on

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.400
I don't know

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.360
Who those people are

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:28.760
What they're thinking

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:29.480
Where they're from

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:31.560
How they look like

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.600
What they're working on

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:33.240
How they look like

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.440
And who they are

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:38.680
Basically everything they want to keep private is protected by Zengi

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:42.040
Zengi works and for one very simple reason

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:50.840
Security transparency and usability to give you back total control

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.360
Stu!

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:55.240
I feel like this is also them wanting to show off their entire team

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:55.880
Yeah, probably

01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:58.200
That guy did just solve that Rubik's cube in the background

01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.000
That was kind of cool

01:32:59.000 --> 01:32:59.880
All right, that is cool

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:02.680
Other solutions lets you choose a key

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:06.360
With Zengi you have ownership of the key and the lock

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:10.680
Zengi will create a complete ecosystem where security

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:15.160
Transparency and usability are yours anytime anywhere

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:19.000
So your digital identity is always protected

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.320
And sometimes that can be pretty important

01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:25.960
And Zengi puts you back in control of your personal data

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.280
Zengi will give you the power to protect your digital identity

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.360
These guys do look a bit like a stereotype though

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.080
Good for them though

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:37.320
Okay

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:41.720
Their music sounds like a radio spy novel

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:43.320
Yeah, that's a good way to put it

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.680
I like that, that's a nice way to put it

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.440
So let's look at the

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.640
Let's see if they tell us much about the underlying technology

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.680
They have good dress like a boss, that's cool

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:54.680
They have cool the all in

01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.160
They have good price levels

01:33:58.520 --> 01:33:59.240
Let's see though

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.160
We got to get some details on this

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:06.120
They say they created a foundation for a new standard of security and transparency and usability

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.480
Well, those are all things that we like

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:08.440
That sounds good

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.800
That's not the details I want

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.640
They say that your data is encrypted with AES 256

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:17.480
It is split into tiny chunks and distributed to all cloud services you use

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:21.320
So for the cloud provider, it sounds like it really is a layer that sits on top of your

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:24.120
Dropbox in your Google Drive and just gives them bits and pieces

01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:29.080
So what happens if you split it between all these places and one of them goes down

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:29.960
Is all your data gone?

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.840
I think they're saying that it sounds like they're

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:36.680
They're not splitting it across the separate things, but they're splitting it

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.280
They have to know how to put pieces back together and they're all

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:44.360
They have all the bits, but they're put there because they're separated

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:47.160
You'd have to have the key to put them all back together

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:50.760
It looks like Linux isn't supported until $70,000 is raised

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:53.480
But it says it's a messaging app, right?

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:55.480
It's not clear

01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.360
It says it does those things

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.960
How does it actually sync with other users?

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:00.040
Does your phone do the federation?

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:02.360
Here's the question

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.120
Can I use my existing cloud accounts?

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:05.240
Absolutely

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.280
You can link all your existing cloud accounts or simply add new ones

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:11.560
However, the data in your existing accounts must be re-uploaded to guarantee full security

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:12.520
Wow, that's interesting

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:14.040
Geez

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:17.880
These guys become the gatekeeper for all of your online services

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.480
That's what I was thinking

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:24.120
You're now trusting a company you've never heard of with all of your online storage

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.640
They would argue that's their advantage

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:30.200
Is that they are a non-multinational small group of folks

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.200
That are creating something by the people for the people

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:32.920
That's what they say

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:33.720
That's their argument

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:37.640
I mean, you trust inseminators for something

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:38.920
Even your grandma can use it

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:40.680
Is that thing plugged in?

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:41.800
Does that say it's plugged in there, Wes?

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:42.600
Is that what it says there?

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.360
Can you tell, I don't know what those icons mean

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:45.640
Windows

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.120
Yeah, I don't

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.160
It does look like it, yes

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:47.640
Okay

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:49.000
Fully charged, 100%

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:49.800
Okay

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.280
Does have a little

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.520
Their goal is only $35,000?

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.920
Yeah, and they don't have Linux support until 70

01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:56.360
What?

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:59.080
But like, what are they going to do with $35,000?

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:02.440
Are they planning to bang this out in like a month with four people?

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.760
They would have to have already had a bunch of funding, I would think

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.040
So I think, unfortunately, even though it's something we'd all like

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.320
I think we're all saying nope

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:13.240
I think it's kind of a nope

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.920
The goal just doesn't make sense

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:17.720
Yeah, they would be such a critical point of failure

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:19.960
How do you sustain yourself on $35,000?

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:23.560
And how do you, and then, so they show it right here in their diagram

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:27.560
If you are the front end proxy to all of these different services

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:33.080
And the ones they have, they have Box, Pax, OwnCloud, and Drive on here

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:35.880
They actually don't have Dropbox's icon, but they have all the other ones on here

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.600
So two things, like was just mentioned

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:41.080
If they go offline, you can't get access to your data potentially

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:47.720
But aren't you just giving the government the best gift in the entire world?

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:50.360
They just have, instead of having to go to four different providers

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.120
They just go to one provider?

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:54.520
And even if they just got the metadata

01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:57.720
If they just got the time and date and where you upload it to, that'd be something

01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:01.000
I mean, this seems like this is one place to serve a national security letter to

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.200
Instead of four different places

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.320
Even if it's not getting the data

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.640
Even if you're just getting the time and date the user logged in

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.400
The IP they logged in from

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:14.520
And the amount of data they uploaded to and the services they went to

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.520
That's valuable information

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:19.320
Well, is Sangy actually storing anything on their end?

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:22.360
Or is it just a software solution that combines all your cloud accounts?

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:23.800
Well, I'm not saying they're storing the data

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:27.080
But they probably have logs of when you connected and logged in and transferred

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:27.640
I've been asking them

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.200
They should tell us these things, perhaps

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:33.960
There's a lot of implementation questions

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:36.280
What are you doing this?

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:37.320
I like how they're growing that

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:40.200
We created a foundation for a new standard of security and transparency

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.080
They keep going after this

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:44.360
But then they're not very transparent about how this works at all

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.080
They say that they're going to put their code up on GitHub

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.760
But that doesn't make it transparent

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.320
No, not really

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:52.680
That's like the first thing that you do on the transparency

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.520
Doesn't tell us what you're doing on the server side, though

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.720
Doesn't tell us how you're logging it

01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.320
Oh, where the phones go

01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:58.360
This is good

01:37:58.360 --> 01:37:59.960
They're making it secure for Linux

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.160
Because you're not able to use it

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:02.360
Right

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.880
Oh, excellent point

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:05.160
You have a thing that says where the phone

01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:05.640
Oh, where?

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.720
Yeah, scroll down on their Indiegogo page

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:09.720
And there's like bars and these graphs

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.920
And it's like 50% of the stuff goes to development and admin

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.040
And then there's like marketing

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.000
Oh, that's what that is

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.680
That's known as a chart, Chris

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:19.560
Oh, there it is

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.040
There it is

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.320
That's at $100,000

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:26.520
$17,000 goes to development for your base goal?

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:30.600
For what it's supposed to be like a world premiere secure product?

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.120
Yeah, it has to integrate with like eight different services out of the box

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:40.200
Yeah, who's like, are they like going to take on the burden of maintaining all of those API wrappers all the time?

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.040
Yeah, boy, that just right there could be a job

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:43.160
Yikes

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:50.040
Not to mention, I'm sure that Dropbox and Google is not super keen to having a third party between them and their customers

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.240
Because from Google's standpoint, Google wants to do their utmost

01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:55.560
Supposedly to protect your privacy and data

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.160
So they're not going to like this

01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:59.400
This reminds me of like when you used to be able to use a

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:06.760
If there was a fuse layer so that you could store files in your gmail storage by like split it up and do a lot of different emails

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:09.480
I think somebody, I think a company should take LibreVault

01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:13.560
Or something like SyncThing and productize it and just say use

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:19.400
Use and sell it as combining all of your computer's hard drives into one online secure storage

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:19.960
Right

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:24.520
No online cloud account, no service, no account required

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:29.800
Just uses all of your devices storage and pools them together in a super secure encrypted way

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.240
Why is that not a product that people are selling on Indiegogo or Kickstarter?

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.120
That seems pretty obvious

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:35.080
Because grandma couldn't use it

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:35.960
It's all about grandma

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:39.960
And also they wouldn't be able to do a subscription service

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:53.720
Oh you got it, yeah that's true
