00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Well, Chris, I almost lost my wallet this weekend.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.680
Oh no, like out and about in town, downtown Seattle?

00:06.680 --> 00:07.680
No, thankfully not.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.400
Actually, this was out in the woods of Issaquah.

00:10.400 --> 00:10.960
Are you kidding me?

00:10.960 --> 00:12.240
I've been out in the woods this weekend.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.240
So we're both out in the woods.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.000
What happened?

00:14.000 --> 00:14.640
Yeah, right.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.200
It's a lovely Pacific Northwest day,

00:17.200 --> 00:18.960
although actually it was kind of soggy,

00:18.960 --> 00:20.920
but misty in the woods in the rain.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.920
And all right, the dogs had suckered me

00:22.920 --> 00:24.880
into taking them out for an adventure in the woods.

00:24.880 --> 00:28.320
Here I am having a great time, getting very damp,

00:28.320 --> 00:29.480
taking some pictures too.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.360
And that's where things went awry.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.600
I get back to the car.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.600
I was going to go to the store, pick up a few things,

00:34.600 --> 00:37.000
do some errands on the way back home after the walk.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.380
And I notice I don't have my wallet.

00:39.380 --> 00:40.720
So of course, I checked the car.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.600
Maybe I left it in there, although I tried

00:42.600 --> 00:44.080
to take it with me on hikes.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.520
And I think to myself, well, I wasn't planning to do this.

00:46.520 --> 00:47.840
Really, I looked at the small dog,

00:47.840 --> 00:49.920
and she gilded me with those cute eyes.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.360
And I thought, all right, all right, I better

00:51.360 --> 00:52.720
take him to the woods today.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.160
So it was plausible that maybe I just left the wallet at home.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.280
I'd never brought it at all.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.600
Right, so you realize before you make it home

00:59.600 --> 01:01.240
that you've lost the wallet, but you've

01:01.240 --> 01:02.480
left the woods at this point.

01:02.480 --> 01:02.840
Oh, yeah.

01:02.840 --> 01:03.600
No, I mean, totally.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.800
I'm like, well, what do I do?

01:04.800 --> 01:05.520
I don't have my wallet.

01:05.520 --> 01:06.760
I don't know that I lost it.

01:06.760 --> 01:07.760
So I drive home.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.400
I search the car again.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.880
Then I search the apartment.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.680
Not there.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.200
Oh, no.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.760
By this time, it's like Sunday, getting to be evening.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.120
We're at quite the latitude up here.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.640
So it's getting dark early.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.200
I basically have just enough time, I think to myself,

01:23.200 --> 01:23.880
is this really worth it?

01:23.880 --> 01:24.880
Is this what I'm going to do?

01:24.880 --> 01:25.920
But I get back in the car.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.800
I drive back to the trailhead.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.600
And then I jog the entire route that I

01:30.600 --> 01:33.360
went on with the dogs looking for this wallet.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.400
And I find it.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.920
So actually, I go right past it.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.100
I go right past it.

01:37.100 --> 01:37.920
I'm getting kind of depressed.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.480
I'm like, what am I going to do when I get back to the car?

01:39.480 --> 01:40.600
Like, I need to buy stuff.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.360
I don't have that much gas left in my car

01:42.360 --> 01:44.080
since I just drove back to the trail.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.320
Oh, man.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.080
And I remember that I took a picture at this spot.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.760
And I think to myself, I had my wallet and my cell phone

01:51.760 --> 01:53.360
in the same pocket.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.320
And I back up to where I think I snapped the picture,

01:56.320 --> 01:57.000
look to the right.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.320
And just there, under some ferns and some leaves,

02:00.320 --> 02:03.000
is my slightly soggier wallet.

02:03.000 --> 02:03.760
Wow.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.800
And it must have been just as it was getting,

02:05.800 --> 02:07.680
I mean, you must have been close to running out of daylight.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.000
Oh, yeah.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.120
I mean, this was probably like 10 minutes to sunset.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.040
My story is not as awesome.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.060
But I got this new mobile router, this new fancy schmancy

02:16.060 --> 02:17.120
mobile router.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.120
And I brought it down to the studio.

02:19.120 --> 02:19.920
And I got it set up.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.200
And I got it all updated.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.120
And I packed it all up.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.840
And I took it back to the RV, which

02:23.840 --> 02:26.520
I had strategically stashed out in the woods

02:26.520 --> 02:27.760
on the edge of signal.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.360
And I'm so proud of myself because I've

02:29.360 --> 02:30.180
got this whole thing.

02:30.180 --> 02:31.300
And I'm going to plug it in.

02:31.300 --> 02:33.720
And I'm going to have a totally usable cell signal out

02:33.720 --> 02:34.200
in the woods.

02:34.200 --> 02:34.800
And look at me.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.120
I'm such a fancy boy.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.520
And I get it out.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.840
I run the ethernet cable to it.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.140
I get ready to shut down my Raspberry Pi that had been

02:42.140 --> 02:43.680
doing the job of this thing.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.360
And I realized I had left the power cord at the studio.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.720
Oh.

02:48.720 --> 02:52.640
And so I seriously, and it's more than an hour drive away.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.400
And I seriously sat there for a solid 45 minutes

02:55.400 --> 02:58.280
debating if I was going to drive my butt back to the studio

02:58.280 --> 02:59.640
just for that power cord.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.800
But ultimately, I decided just to call it a night

03:02.800 --> 03:04.400
and have a chill night in the woods.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.080
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

03:15.080 --> 03:15.980
My name is Chris.

03:15.980 --> 03:17.120
My name is Wes.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.520
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru, the leader

03:19.520 --> 03:20.720
in hands-on learning.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.100
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

03:23.100 --> 03:26.080
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs for Cloud Linux

03:26.080 --> 03:27.240
servers and much more.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.000
Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.960
Welcome into 3.77.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.880
We have a great show.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.160
Fedora 33 is out this week.

03:36.160 --> 03:39.440
And Wes and I have been really putting it through its paces.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.080
So we'll tell you our thoughts on that.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.680
But we also have some really good community news.

03:43.680 --> 03:44.600
Just some stuff.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.800
Well, maybe not all of it's so good.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.560
But stuff we're definitely going to chew on.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.000
So there's a whole batch of stuff.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.160
I apologize if it smells like pine trees and skunk.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.640
Wes and I have been out in the woods.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.680
Also, Wes, I apologize I set up the Soda Stream in your spot.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.400
But it was on sale for Prime Day.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.560
I had to get a Soda Stream.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.440
And I just can't compete with that carbonation.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.040
No.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.200
No, I like seven squirts, Wes.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.680
I like it really bubbly.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.920
So that's why it's right there.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.440
So if I have any burps, I apologize.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.840
But before we get into that community news and those burps,

04:13.840 --> 04:16.520
I want to say time-appropriate greetings to that mumble room.

04:16.520 --> 04:17.720
Hello, Virtual Lug.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.320
Hello.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.520
Hello.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.400
Hello, everybody.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.360
It's really great to have you in there.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.440
Rockin' 22.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.760
We've been averaging a little higher some weeks,

04:26.760 --> 04:28.440
around 22 some weeks.

04:28.440 --> 04:29.960
And it ebbs and flows.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.640
People have stuff going on in their life.

04:31.640 --> 04:35.800
It's been getting cold out in the woods, way below freezing.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.240
So yeah, let me tell you, it's nice to be down here

04:38.240 --> 04:39.840
in the studio where it's warm and cozy.

04:39.840 --> 04:43.320
And let's start by talking about Linux 5.10.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.520
No, it's not out yet, but it's shaping up

04:46.520 --> 04:49.360
to be a pretty impressive release.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.560
There's a couple of things that are worth noting.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.120
And why we're talking about it today

04:53.120 --> 04:56.400
is it's been confirmed by Greg Kh

04:56.400 --> 04:58.960
that this will be the next LTS kernel, which speculation had

04:58.960 --> 05:01.000
been that it would be Linux 5.9.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.400
But no, my friends, it is going to be 5.10,

05:03.400 --> 05:04.800
which may be a nice thing.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.160
Yeah, right?

05:06.160 --> 05:08.840
Greg Kh announced this at the Linux Foundation's Open Source

05:08.840 --> 05:10.680
Summit Europe.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.120
And I guess, really, we're talking about it because,

05:13.120 --> 05:16.960
once it's released stably, perhaps around mid-December,

05:16.960 --> 05:19.480
it's going to be a kernel that hangs around for a long time

05:19.480 --> 05:20.600
with that LTS support.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.160
So you, I, all of us will probably

05:23.160 --> 05:24.440
be running it for years to come.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.900
Yeah, and Android devices in particular.

05:26.900 --> 05:30.120
And sometimes, when it is a kernel adopted by Android,

05:30.120 --> 05:33.920
it wouldn't be uncommon to see that support extended out

05:33.920 --> 05:36.200
further than just a few years.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.240
I think the other notable thing about 5.10

05:38.240 --> 05:42.400
has to be the Bluetooth bug that we've recently heard about.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.880
It sounds like the complete fix for that vulnerability

05:45.880 --> 05:49.080
is going to be when you have both a BlueZ update

05:49.080 --> 05:51.840
and a kernel update that corresponds with that.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.880
And that particular fix is in 5.10.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.000
So it's going to have that.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.160
But there's also just a plethora of new hardware features

05:59.160 --> 06:02.080
and improvement support that's in 5.10 as well.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.800
The current LTS release, just if you're curious, is Linux 5.4.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.360
And that is expected to be maintained

06:07.360 --> 06:10.280
through the end of 2025.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.080
So when you have 5.10 out there, you're

06:13.080 --> 06:17.120
probably going to at least see it maintained until the end of 2026.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.920
So go build your servers, your LTS distros,

06:19.920 --> 06:22.340
and your enterprise distros, and your Android phones.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.680
Hey, that means we can look forward

06:23.680 --> 06:27.280
to 5.10 on our little Garage Arch server sometime soon.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.360
Yeah, that's right.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.080
Hopefully that takes a little while.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.480
That'll be a dicey upgrade.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.600
Stay tuned, audience.

06:32.600 --> 06:37.520
Also in 5.10, just a side note, XFS is making the long play.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.680
In 5.10, XFS has been updated with what

06:40.680 --> 06:45.480
they call big timestamps, which means it will now support

06:45.480 --> 06:49.520
timestamps out until 2486.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.360
So they're going to be around for a long time.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.640
Oh, yeah.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.400
OK, so previously we were counting things

06:55.400 --> 06:58.560
in seconds since 1970, as maybe you well know.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.200
That runs out in 2038.

07:00.200 --> 07:04.520
Seems like a long time, but 18 years, maybe not really.

07:04.520 --> 07:08.200
But now we've got huge 64-bit nanosecond counters.

07:08.200 --> 07:08.760
Oh, yeah.

07:08.760 --> 07:09.960
Finally, finally.

07:09.960 --> 07:14.520
So there's your long-term storage, or ZFS, or ButterFest.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.360
Just not NTFS.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.640
Do me a favor.

07:16.640 --> 07:20.240
System76 in the news this week also with Pop!

07:20.240 --> 07:21.080
OS 2010.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.120
It came out at the end of last week.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.960
There seems to be a lot of improvements

07:24.960 --> 07:27.920
that take advantage of, like the GNOME Shell 3.38

07:27.920 --> 07:30.960
and the underlying updates in Ubuntu 2010.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.840
But there's also something landing in Pop! Shell

07:32.840 --> 07:35.320
that caught my eye, and it's called stacking.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.120
Similar to tabs in a web browser,

07:37.120 --> 07:40.240
you can stack tiled windows on top of one another.

07:40.240 --> 07:47.400
So you can imagine maybe a multi-tiled window.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.240
And maybe you have a long vertical pane

07:49.240 --> 07:50.240
on the left-hand side.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.520
You could have your web browser there, your notes.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.020
You could have multiple applications there.

07:54.020 --> 07:55.520
And then you can toggle through them

07:55.520 --> 07:57.640
with VIM shortcuts or whatnot.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.880
It sure just keeps getting better and better.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.640
Another one that caught my eye are floating window exceptions,

08:02.640 --> 08:05.280
because sometimes you just have those little weird dialog boxes

08:05.280 --> 08:08.160
that are just too small to really tile efficiently.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.320
And now you can just add that to the exceptions list,

08:10.320 --> 08:12.160
and they're totally exempt from tiling.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.960
You don't have to fuss with turning it off and on.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.080
My use case for that, so it'll be interesting to see

08:16.080 --> 08:19.440
if I can do this, is bookmarklets for tagging

08:19.440 --> 08:21.600
things for various shows.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.240
Those windows always get tiled, and it scrunches everything up

08:24.240 --> 08:26.400
for just this tiny little pop-up where I tag something

08:26.400 --> 08:28.000
and give it a title and hit Enter.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.960
I wonder if there's a bit, but it's spawned by the web browser.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.680
So I wonder if I'll be able to do that.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.280
I wonder if I'll be able to accept that.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.320
We'll see.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.080
Oh, if I didn't mention to the chat room,

08:37.080 --> 08:39.760
as we're going along, do bang, suggest, and title our show,

08:39.760 --> 08:42.380
because that's how we're going to title this thing if you

08:42.380 --> 08:42.880
don't do it.

08:42.880 --> 08:43.840
We can't be trusted.

08:43.840 --> 08:44.480
No.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.160
No, so please do help us title it.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.780
But I want to talk about a story that is really unfortunate.

08:49.780 --> 08:53.120
And we covered it in LAN, a lot of the details about this.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.400
And it is the DMCA takedown of YouTube

08:56.400 --> 09:00.360
DL, which has been removed from GitHub after a DMCA notice.

09:00.360 --> 09:04.320
There's been some developments since Linux Action News,

09:04.320 --> 09:08.360
including some alternative repos and an interview

09:08.360 --> 09:10.840
with one of the original creators.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.760
So I wanted to stop for a moment.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.760
If you're not familiar with the story,

09:14.760 --> 09:18.200
the Recording Association of America, Recording Industry

09:18.200 --> 09:21.120
Association of America, the RIAA,

09:21.120 --> 09:25.560
issued a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown

09:25.560 --> 09:28.040
on YouTube DL under the grounds that it could

09:28.040 --> 09:32.140
be used to pirate music videos off of YouTube.

09:32.140 --> 09:36.440
And it's a bit of a spacious argument,

09:36.440 --> 09:39.160
but I'll tell you where they're coming from on their point,

09:39.160 --> 09:42.200
because we want to give you the both sides of it here.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.800
So in most cases, the DMCA notices

09:44.800 --> 09:47.260
are regarding an unauthorized distribution

09:47.260 --> 09:48.520
of a piece of media.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.480
That's typically how a DMCA takedown is done.

09:51.480 --> 09:56.920
You're distributing copyrighted music or copyrighted video.

09:56.920 --> 10:00.880
And then they will use the DMCA takedown requests

10:00.880 --> 10:02.640
that these platforms support.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.760
It's like a tool often that YouTube or Build or GitHub

10:05.760 --> 10:06.480
builds.

10:06.480 --> 10:09.360
They'll use that mechanism to use the DMCA as the grounds

10:09.360 --> 10:11.440
to take down that copyright.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.880
But this notice for YouTube DL is different,

10:14.880 --> 10:19.640
because it's targeting a tool that can be used to reproduce

10:19.640 --> 10:21.080
copyrighted media.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.760
YouTube DL is licensed under the unlicensed license, which

10:24.760 --> 10:27.040
is an anti-copyright license that

10:27.040 --> 10:29.920
promises ownership of the software to the public domain.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.320
And it is usually considered lawful to freely distribute

10:33.320 --> 10:35.600
the software itself because of that license.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.600
Their notice claimed that YouTube DL software

10:37.600 --> 10:41.840
was being used to copy a couple of songs that they cited,

10:41.840 --> 10:44.320
particularly songs that were like a Taylor Swift song

10:44.320 --> 10:46.440
and whatnot that were in the documentation.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.680
Yeah, some of the examples are Taylor Swift, Icona Pop,

10:49.680 --> 10:52.240
and of course Justin Timberlake.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.760
Maybe those aren't the best examples to have.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.680
But at the same time, you're right.

10:56.680 --> 11:00.880
Are we now policing if you violate some other services,

11:00.880 --> 11:01.560
terms of service?

11:01.560 --> 11:03.760
If you violate the JB website terms of service,

11:03.760 --> 11:05.720
not that we have those, I don't think

11:05.720 --> 11:07.800
we could get GitHub to take your code down.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.640
Right, take the entire project down.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.040
And of course, it's still widely available.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.600
It's still widely used.

11:15.600 --> 11:19.800
Last year, the RIAA was able to get five YouTube Ripper sites,

11:19.800 --> 11:22.360
you could put the little URL in there,

11:22.360 --> 11:24.760
got them removed from the Google search engine.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.760
So one of the new developments with this story

11:27.760 --> 11:31.600
since Linux Action News came out is Perchant News interviewed

11:31.600 --> 11:37.480
Philip, I'm going to say, Hajemeister, Hajester.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.160
He's the previous maintainer, Philip is.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.720
And this is an interesting bit in the interview

11:42.720 --> 11:44.320
that I want to call our attention to is I

11:44.320 --> 11:47.720
think there's a broader action that's happening here.

11:47.720 --> 11:51.000
And the RIAA takedown may only be

11:51.000 --> 11:52.800
a function of that broader action.

11:52.800 --> 11:56.120
Because Philip says he received a seize and desist letter

11:56.120 --> 11:59.080
from German lawyers just a couple of weeks ago,

11:59.080 --> 12:01.360
but notes that there's a ton of technical inaccuracies

12:01.360 --> 12:02.480
in the letter.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.600
They don't seem to understand that, for one,

12:04.600 --> 12:06.720
he's no longer the maintainer.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.480
But he can't say a lot about it because it's an ongoing issue.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.080
Perchant News also asked, despite not being the maintainer

12:13.080 --> 12:17.080
anymore, would he change those examples?

12:17.080 --> 12:18.960
I would remove the test cases, he writes.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.560
These videos were never fully downloaded anyways.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.040
They're just automated test cases

12:23.040 --> 12:25.880
where the test downloaded the first 10 kilobytes, which

12:25.880 --> 12:28.040
amounts to a couple of seconds at most.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.040
And this is certainly fair use, but the project

12:31.040 --> 12:33.280
is fully functional without those test cases.

12:33.280 --> 12:33.920
How about that?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.920
It was only downloading the first 10 kilobytes.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.960
I think that's a bit that's been overlooked.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.080
And these are just test case examples.

12:40.080 --> 12:43.440
They're not advocating it, but it

12:43.440 --> 12:46.200
would have been so much better to point to some Creative

12:46.200 --> 12:50.160
Commons content on YouTube instead of a music video.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.960
That just, in retrospect, seems ridiculous.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.960
But I want to say this because I think this issue has been

12:54.960 --> 12:57.360
a little misunderstood, particularly in some

12:57.360 --> 13:01.000
of the Linux journalism slash media space.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.480
But YouTube DL is a tool that maybe is not properly named.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.840
YouTube is one of many sites that this tool supports

13:08.840 --> 13:11.200
downloading from, hundreds of hundreds of sites.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.120
And it is a tool that this podcast

13:14.120 --> 13:16.760
uses to give voice to open source developers

13:16.760 --> 13:19.960
to tens of thousands of listeners.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.880
All these events that get posted online that we clip up,

13:22.880 --> 13:25.680
that process starts with YouTube DL.

13:25.680 --> 13:30.080
And that is absolutely 100% fair use under the DMCA.

13:30.080 --> 13:34.680
I use YouTube DL to back up news clips for fair use

13:34.680 --> 13:38.960
in my unfiltered podcast every single day, every day.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.680
And I pay YouTube a monthly subscription for premium

13:42.680 --> 13:44.520
to just have the privilege of not seeing ads.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.400
So ads aren't really a factor for me.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.560
But I don't think this conversation should be about

13:48.560 --> 13:51.520
the tool's ability to copy a Taylor Swift song

13:51.520 --> 13:53.720
or the tool's ability to download YouTube videos

13:53.720 --> 13:55.040
without seeing ads.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.840
Because that conversation about ad blockers

13:56.840 --> 13:58.040
is a much larger discussion.

13:58.040 --> 14:01.040
And YouTube DL is really not alone in this space.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.960
And that's a broader conversation.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.440
And the ability to download videos from YouTube,

14:05.440 --> 14:08.840
functionality-wise, I think it's an important tool

14:08.840 --> 14:11.760
to back up a very relevant medium right now that

14:11.760 --> 14:14.480
is culturally more relevant than I think we've seen

14:14.480 --> 14:16.840
any cable platform or television platform

14:16.840 --> 14:19.240
because it is a publishing platform for the people.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.360
And the ability to back that up, especially in an era

14:22.360 --> 14:24.560
when more and more is being controlled

14:24.560 --> 14:26.760
in what you're allowed to watch and not allowed to watch

14:26.760 --> 14:28.400
or the fact that things can be taken down

14:28.400 --> 14:30.200
by the creators themselves after the fact,

14:30.200 --> 14:32.560
having a tool that allows you to archive that

14:32.560 --> 14:33.600
is pretty important.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.920
And we have to remember this is free software.

14:35.920 --> 14:39.000
So you can't just squash this one group of people

14:39.000 --> 14:42.960
and claim victory because a dozen more will fork and sprout.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.320
So we have to think about it in a broader way, too.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.920
You know, it also makes me think it's

14:46.920 --> 14:50.080
an important sort of statement about browser lock-in.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.360
If you're acknowledging that you can go to YouTube

14:52.360 --> 14:54.680
and watch this video freely, well,

14:54.680 --> 14:56.880
why can't I use the very same sort of API calls

14:56.880 --> 14:58.960
to interact in the same way, right?

14:58.960 --> 15:00.400
I don't want to get to this future

15:00.400 --> 15:02.800
where YouTube is totally locked in DRM

15:02.800 --> 15:05.120
and you can only access it on your iPhone app.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.760
This is a tricky thing here.

15:06.760 --> 15:10.360
Because I don't know if this is a fair analogy to make,

15:10.360 --> 15:12.600
but I can see a future where there

15:12.600 --> 15:16.100
is US federally mandated encryption backdoors that

15:16.100 --> 15:18.840
are built into products that are capable of encryption.

15:18.840 --> 15:23.800
And I could see a similar process where application Y,

15:23.800 --> 15:26.960
messenger application Y, doesn't support backdoor.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.680
And so therefore, it's a security risk.

15:28.680 --> 15:32.400
And there's some process where they issue a takedown on GitHub

15:32.400 --> 15:34.800
because it doesn't comply with US law.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.000
It becomes a real gray area real quick.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.840
Because what we have here is a recording industry association

15:41.840 --> 15:45.000
that is using music copyright law

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
to take down open source code on a platform owned by Microsoft.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.840
That's the real big picture here.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.640
And I think this is a horrible precedent that we're seeing.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.680
The takedown functionality, it seems like it's useful.

15:58.680 --> 16:02.280
We looked into it, and there's legitimate known open source

16:02.280 --> 16:05.560
projects on GitHub that issue takedowns under DMCA

16:05.560 --> 16:08.360
against projects that are maybe copying brand or something

16:08.360 --> 16:08.880
like that.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.000
So the takedown process itself seems

16:11.000 --> 16:12.520
like it has some legitimacy.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.960
But how the RIAA is using it here

16:14.960 --> 16:17.400
really reminds me of how they've abused YouTube as well.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.240
But now it's source code, and it matters a hell of a lot more

16:20.240 --> 16:21.300
than cat videos.

16:21.300 --> 16:21.800
Well, yeah.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.080
I need to download and archive those cat videos, Chris.

16:24.080 --> 16:24.600
Yeah.

16:24.600 --> 16:27.160
You know?

16:27.160 --> 16:30.120
See, as someone who's just out in the woods, man,

16:30.120 --> 16:31.920
everything I watched recently was offline.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.460
And for me, it's kind of a nice thing

16:33.460 --> 16:35.520
because I can kind of download and curate

16:35.520 --> 16:38.600
several videos from the creators that I really enjoy.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.400
And I kind of set them aside.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.720
And we make dinner.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.480
And I have them all loaded locally.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.720
And it's a thing.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.840
And it deeply connects me to those content creators.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.320
And the fact that I could use YouTube

16:50.320 --> 16:53.280
to be able to facilitate that is critical in my relationship

16:53.280 --> 16:57.280
and my continued consumption of that content creator's media.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.280
Or maybe you're using a low power device that just

16:59.280 --> 17:01.520
doesn't play well, this full screen video in your browser,

17:01.520 --> 17:02.960
and you want to just play it on the command line

17:02.960 --> 17:04.920
with something that has hardware acceleration.

17:04.920 --> 17:07.120
I'm curious if the Mumble Room has any thoughts

17:07.120 --> 17:09.840
on this particular takedown.

17:09.840 --> 17:12.280
I think probably nobody would disagree that they should

17:12.280 --> 17:13.640
probably consider a name change.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.280
It just seems, and you can see it

17:15.280 --> 17:19.040
in the project's social media communications.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.500
They initially assumed it was Google

17:20.500 --> 17:22.500
that knocked them offline because they just live

17:22.500 --> 17:24.200
in fear of Google constantly.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.000
And then they realized after they read it

17:26.000 --> 17:29.040
that it was the RIAA.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.040
You wouldn't expect it.

17:30.040 --> 17:30.720
Co-what?

17:30.720 --> 17:31.880
You guys are still around?

17:31.880 --> 17:33.080
Yeah, right?

17:33.080 --> 17:35.240
What is this, Napster you're enforcing here?

17:35.240 --> 17:38.480
And Microsoft, I think, should try to own this.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.240
They can distance themselves by saying this is GitHub.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.800
But the reality is that when you bought GitHub,

17:44.800 --> 17:47.200
you get both ends of that relationship.

17:47.200 --> 17:47.920
Yes, right.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.760
And that's kind of the funny part here, too,

17:49.760 --> 17:53.320
is there's been a lot of jokes or mocking or sarcasm

17:53.320 --> 17:56.120
around the, well, it's on GitHub, but it's also Git.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.840
So in one sense, you can't kill it because, well, it's Git.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.840
It's distributed inherently.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.560
But the other side is that there's still

18:02.560 --> 18:03.920
this problem of the defaults.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.600
And right now, GitHub is king.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.400
That's the place where development takes place.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.800
That's the place where issues, discussions, documentation,

18:09.800 --> 18:11.800
the place people go.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.560
And it's a little tricky when it's a giant, layered-up

18:14.560 --> 18:17.640
industry association versus a little, humble, open-source

18:17.640 --> 18:18.360
project.

18:18.360 --> 18:18.880
Really?

18:18.880 --> 18:20.680
ByteBitton, you have thoughts about this.

18:20.680 --> 18:24.760
So I had to laugh about DMCA, about someone made a pull

18:24.760 --> 18:28.120
request towards it, an empty one.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.360
And he did it in such a way where

18:31.360 --> 18:35.040
he made it an empty one that, via that pull request,

18:35.040 --> 18:39.440
you can eventually still pull the entire YouTube downloader

18:39.440 --> 18:43.040
project because it's available through Git.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.000
That's great.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.880
Yeah, I mean, they have their own local copies, too.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.600
The developers are saying, we have recent local copies.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.800
We can obviously host it in other places.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.720
And I can't tell if there is a similar thing we're

18:53.720 --> 18:56.920
seeing happening here where you have,

18:56.920 --> 18:59.480
I feel like we have this issue where it's almost

18:59.480 --> 19:01.680
going to become a matter of survival

19:01.680 --> 19:04.720
that you're on your own self-hosted infrastructure

19:04.720 --> 19:08.520
if you're a project that is skirting the legalities here.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.840
If you're in the gray area, and maybe you're not

19:10.840 --> 19:12.400
going to enforce an encryption backdoor,

19:12.400 --> 19:16.080
or if you are a project like YouTube DL,

19:16.080 --> 19:21.720
you have to maybe consider that you're better off from day one

19:21.720 --> 19:24.520
on your own infrastructure and just training your user base.

19:24.520 --> 19:26.840
That's where you go to find us.

19:26.840 --> 19:31.120
And I know you suffer a little bit from the social network

19:31.120 --> 19:32.600
effect of GitHub.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.360
And you also have to be comfortable enough with Git,

19:35.360 --> 19:37.800
the admin side of things, have the time and the resources

19:37.800 --> 19:39.360
to be able to stand that infrastructure up

19:39.360 --> 19:40.200
and maintain it.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.400
Yeah, and maybe that's an area, as a community,

19:42.400 --> 19:43.360
we can keep improving.

19:43.360 --> 19:45.640
I mean, it is getting easier and easier than ever

19:45.640 --> 19:46.800
to stand up infrastructure.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.840
So there is that aspect of it.

19:48.840 --> 19:52.640
It's so much simpler today than it was a long time ago

19:52.640 --> 19:54.360
that maybe that's changing.

19:54.360 --> 19:59.920
But I wonder, I've never really taken Mastodon seriously

19:59.920 --> 20:00.600
until recently.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.120
And I kind of go, OK, I kind of get it.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.320
Long term, maybe it is better to invest

20:05.320 --> 20:08.120
in owning the infrastructure like that.

20:08.120 --> 20:11.680
And for an open source project, something like GitHub

20:11.680 --> 20:14.200
is just an absolute vital part of the infrastructure

20:14.200 --> 20:14.940
for the project.

20:14.940 --> 20:16.240
And when you think of it holistically,

20:16.240 --> 20:19.120
you think maybe we should really be in charge of that,

20:19.120 --> 20:21.440
even if that means asking for some funding or something

20:21.440 --> 20:22.640
to make it possible.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.120
And I know there's people out in the community.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.480
I know it, that there's people out

20:26.480 --> 20:29.080
in the community that would volunteer to help them build

20:29.080 --> 20:30.040
that infrastructure.

20:30.040 --> 20:30.840
I know that's true.

20:30.840 --> 20:34.520
Because anytime we have an ask about infrastructure,

20:34.520 --> 20:36.200
the community steps up immediately.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.540
And I know YouTube deals probably

20:39.540 --> 20:41.240
got a lot of very passionate fans out there

20:41.240 --> 20:42.860
that would be willing to help it.

20:42.860 --> 20:43.440
So we'll see.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.320
I think this is something, I feel

20:45.320 --> 20:48.080
like there's a bigger trend happening here.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.880
I'm curious, Bitmux, on what your thoughts

20:49.880 --> 20:52.340
are on the network effect versus self-hosting

20:52.340 --> 20:54.920
and having the freedom of being in control

20:54.920 --> 20:56.120
of your own platform.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.480
That's exactly that.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.240
You have to make a choice.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.240
If you're going to take advantage of the network

21:01.240 --> 21:03.120
effect, which is probably one of the strongest

21:03.120 --> 21:08.640
forces in today's world in development and creation

21:08.640 --> 21:11.600
of anything, you're going to gravitate

21:11.600 --> 21:15.320
towards one of the major corporate supported platforms.

21:15.320 --> 21:16.960
And right now, it's interesting.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.560
You have a lot of binary systems.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.240
You have Microsoft or Apple.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.320
You have Amazon or Google.

21:23.320 --> 21:27.960
When it comes to GitHub, you have GitHub or what?

21:27.960 --> 21:29.300
You end up choosing.

21:29.300 --> 21:31.440
Do you want the freedom of self-hosting it

21:31.440 --> 21:35.240
and all of the responsibility that comes along with that?

21:35.240 --> 21:37.400
Or do you want the advantages and the network effect

21:37.400 --> 21:40.200
and not having the responsibility of self-hosting

21:40.200 --> 21:44.400
of just throw it on GitHub and invite all your developer

21:44.400 --> 21:46.160
friends to have a go at it?

21:46.160 --> 21:48.540
Yeah, and you maybe even get more contributors potentially,

21:48.540 --> 21:51.460
which also has a lot of net benefits for the project.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.880
So that has to be a calculus, too.

21:52.880 --> 21:56.220
Neil, you and I have done an extra on GitHub alternatives.

21:56.220 --> 21:57.960
I'm sure you must have thoughts on this.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.680
There are avenues around this.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.200
And I think some of the things going on with the Fediverse

22:02.200 --> 22:06.360
with Forge Fed, which is a protocol in development

22:06.360 --> 22:10.920
to support cross-server interactions and subscriptions

22:10.920 --> 22:13.000
and things like that to essentially build

22:13.000 --> 22:17.320
a decentralized, federated network across Git servers.

22:17.320 --> 22:19.440
That sort of thing, I think, will help.

22:19.440 --> 22:24.120
And Pagar, as I talked about with you in an extra show

22:24.120 --> 22:27.000
several months ago, there's a contributor

22:27.000 --> 22:31.960
who's got funded effort to build an extension for Pagar

22:31.960 --> 22:34.160
specifically to support that model.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.000
And Pagar itself has features built in to support things

22:37.000 --> 22:39.600
like people are forking the project

22:39.600 --> 22:42.200
or maintaining their own clones in their own Git servers.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.320
They can still make branches and send pull requests

22:44.320 --> 22:47.360
to the master repo on another Pagar server.

22:47.360 --> 22:49.480
And Pagar itself doesn't even require the other server

22:49.480 --> 22:50.800
to be using Pagar.

22:50.800 --> 22:55.160
It could just be a plain Git repo on HTTPS or CGit

22:55.160 --> 22:56.200
or whatever.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.120
And as long as the Git URL works and you can clone with it

22:59.120 --> 23:01.640
and the branch is accessible, it can pull it.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.440
And then you can make a remote pull request with that.

23:04.440 --> 23:08.080
And so what I think we need to move towards for projects

23:08.080 --> 23:11.120
is to consider that we shouldn't repeat the mistake that we,

23:11.120 --> 23:13.480
well, we did repeat the mistake we made with SourceForge

23:13.480 --> 23:14.520
with GitHub.

23:14.520 --> 23:18.520
We should try to learn from that and start diversifying.

23:18.520 --> 23:22.080
I kind of feel like it's not just source code hosting.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.800
It's communications with the options of Matrix and Discord

23:25.800 --> 23:28.680
and Slack and Mattermost, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.960
It's social media platforms with Mastodon versus Twitter.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.000
It's PeerTube versus YouTube.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.680
And I don't, maybe versus isn't the right way to put it,

23:37.680 --> 23:41.560
but there is a common theme here amongst all of it.

23:41.560 --> 23:46.560
And it is, and I find myself as time goes on,

23:46.560 --> 23:49.480
again and again, like with, as I have perspective on things,

23:49.480 --> 23:51.480
I look back and go, yeah, it's clear,

23:52.800 --> 23:55.560
that platform was, it was like a limited ride.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.600
And eventually you knew that ride was gonna come to an end.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.600
And I see YouTube is very much that

24:00.600 --> 24:02.160
and social media is very much that.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.880
And long-term to be serious about it,

24:04.880 --> 24:06.720
you should probably own that infrastructure yourself.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.360
And that was really what inspired me

24:08.360 --> 24:10.600
to go hard into Matrix.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.120
But the onboarding has been an issue

24:12.120 --> 24:14.320
where the commercial apps like Discord

24:14.320 --> 24:15.640
have really nailed that.

24:15.640 --> 24:16.480
And it's just a challenge.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.080
It's again, the network effect.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.600
But I also think about this.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.400
The reason why the onboarding is so poor

24:21.400 --> 24:24.920
is because there isn't the drive and interest,

24:24.920 --> 24:28.720
the network effect to push people into improving this.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.600
Like the only reason that these solutions

24:31.600 --> 24:33.600
tend to have weaker user experiences

24:33.600 --> 24:35.480
is that they have weaker levels of investment.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.800
And that's because there's a weaker network effect

24:37.800 --> 24:41.840
because there are people preferring solutions

24:41.840 --> 24:44.640
that already are there and things like that.

24:44.640 --> 24:48.520
And again, it's not necessarily always a bad thing

24:48.520 --> 24:49.360
to do that.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.160
Like I am on Twitter and Mastodon.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.800
I prefer Twitter for the discoverability.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.360
But on the flip side, if it's something

24:55.360 --> 25:00.320
that I essentially care for and have to really depend on,

25:00.320 --> 25:03.760
I really strongly consider the self-hosting avenue

25:03.760 --> 25:06.520
simply so that I have confidence

25:06.520 --> 25:07.920
that I don't lose my data.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.840
I lost all of the stuff I did for Google Plus years ago.

25:11.840 --> 25:15.360
And I recently spun up a personal Pagar

25:15.360 --> 25:17.680
instance for my own usage.

25:17.680 --> 25:20.280
I locked it down so nobody else can log in or do anything.

25:20.280 --> 25:24.000
But it's useful for me for doing issue tracking, workflow

25:24.000 --> 25:28.040
management, and storing mirrors of repos and things like that.

25:28.040 --> 25:31.160
And so I'm doing that for my own personal usage.

25:31.160 --> 25:37.240
And things like Pagar or even like Getty or whatever,

25:37.240 --> 25:38.440
they're easy to set up.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.280
They have easy documentation.

25:40.280 --> 25:41.840
The requirements are low.

25:41.840 --> 25:45.320
I'm running my Pagar instance on one vCPU

25:45.320 --> 25:49.600
and with one gigabyte of RAM and OpenSUSE Elite 15.2

25:49.600 --> 25:53.600
on Linode for basically nothing.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.320
And it's fine.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.960
It performs very well.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.880
And that's the sort of thing that you should consider.

25:58.880 --> 26:02.360
Because I think people think that the administrative efforts

26:02.360 --> 26:04.560
are not worth it or oversized compared

26:04.560 --> 26:07.560
to what they actually might be relative to all the other work

26:07.560 --> 26:08.680
that they have to do.

26:08.680 --> 26:10.920
And it's true that there's the security stuff.

26:10.920 --> 26:14.000
But at some point, you've got to pull the trigger

26:14.000 --> 26:17.280
and start really thinking about your project in a manner

26:17.280 --> 26:19.880
where it's long-term accessible.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.320
Yeah, I agree.

26:21.320 --> 26:23.960
So we'll be keeping an eye on what happens with YouTube DL.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.960
And I'll be thinking, I think we all

26:25.960 --> 26:27.160
will think about this more.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.280
And if the audience has additional thoughts

26:29.280 --> 26:30.880
on this overall trend that we seem

26:30.880 --> 26:33.120
to be seeing across a lot of different mediums,

26:33.120 --> 26:35.280
I'd love to hear it, linuxunplugged.com

26:35.280 --> 26:36.360
slash contact.

26:36.360 --> 26:40.880
This seems like a great moment to thank Linode

26:40.880 --> 26:43.560
for sponsoring the program, linode.com slash unplugged.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.820
Receive a $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

26:46.820 --> 26:49.120
I've been using them for just over two years.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.400
And I was really impressed with how straightforward

26:51.400 --> 26:52.800
it is to spin up infrastructure.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.280
And we were talking about how projects have

26:55.280 --> 26:56.560
easier and easier access to this.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.840
Linode is a great example of this.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.560
I started using it for myself personally.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.760
But then when it was time for Jupiter broadcasting

27:02.760 --> 27:05.520
to go independent, we just built out our infrastructure

27:05.520 --> 27:06.360
on Linode.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.040
But they started in 2003.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.600
They were one of the first companies

27:09.600 --> 27:11.520
in cloud computing, three years before AWS.

27:11.520 --> 27:13.760
And they're independently owned, so you know I love that.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.440
And they're founded on a love for Linux.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.360
And it shows.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.600
And I've got a great example for you.

27:18.600 --> 27:21.080
They already have Fedora 33 up and ready to go.

27:21.080 --> 27:24.320
It released just like a day ago.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.340
It's already up on Linode.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.840
How great is that?

27:27.840 --> 27:28.760
And it really shows.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.960
They embrace a lot of great open source technologies

27:30.960 --> 27:34.320
to make their really awesome cloud dashboard possible.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.840
They also support Linux and open source initiatives.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.640
They're supporters of the Kubuntu project.

27:38.640 --> 27:41.440
They've backed Linux Fest Northwest,

27:41.440 --> 27:43.640
which I am super grateful for.

27:43.640 --> 27:46.040
And now they're backing this show as we go independent.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.320
I mean, you get it, right?

27:47.320 --> 27:49.120
They're really into the community.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.840
You combine that with the fact that Linode's really

27:51.840 --> 27:54.340
just going to make it possible for anything

27:54.340 --> 27:57.000
you want to run on Linux to just run really great in the cloud.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.200
And if you need something for your personal website,

27:59.200 --> 28:01.440
so you can host a portfolio, or maybe you

28:01.440 --> 28:03.240
want a static website that's crazy fast

28:03.240 --> 28:05.880
and you just take advantage of Linode's object storage,

28:05.880 --> 28:07.960
they're going to make that really approachable for you.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.440
I mean, really, if you don't have

28:09.440 --> 28:11.440
a site for your name and a portfolio,

28:11.440 --> 28:13.800
so when people search you, it's probably worth it.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.200
Because otherwise, something else will take that space.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.160
So that's something to consider.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.080
If you're looking for a job, I think

28:19.080 --> 28:21.040
that's probably something you should definitely do.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.840
They start at like $5 a month.

28:22.840 --> 28:23.880
And you can build something on there

28:23.880 --> 28:24.880
that's just crazy fast.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.000
And people are looking at you for a technical job.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.640
That reflects really well on you.

28:28.640 --> 28:31.560
I have absolutely 100% checked out

28:31.560 --> 28:33.880
how candidates have built their website before when

28:33.880 --> 28:35.120
I'm checking them out.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.000
So that's something to consider as well.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.400
So go to linode.com slash unplugged.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.360
Sign up with a $100 60-day credit towards a new account.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.820
That's a really great deal.

28:43.820 --> 28:46.240
If it's meant to run on Linux, you can run it on Linode.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.160
And you can run it really good.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.860
And every single plan comes with their amazing human-powered

28:49.860 --> 28:51.200
customer support.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.440
It's really legit.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.320
So check them out.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.960
Linode.com slash unplugged.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.600
Thank you to everybody who goes there just

28:56.600 --> 28:58.920
to support the show, to let them know you heard about it here

28:58.920 --> 29:01.360
or takes advantage of that offer, a $100 60-day credit

29:01.360 --> 29:02.160
on a new account.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.840
Linode.com slash unplugged.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.660
A couple of more items for us to address.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.240
I thought this was really fascinating

29:11.240 --> 29:15.280
that one password is now out in beta for Linux.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.520
And there's a lot of options in this space

29:17.520 --> 29:18.800
already for Linux users.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.440
Bitwarden's a popular one, of course.

29:20.440 --> 29:21.880
We've covered it plenty on the show.

29:21.880 --> 29:26.280
LastPass is a longtime contender on the Linux desktop.

29:26.280 --> 29:28.460
And one password kind of comes along

29:28.460 --> 29:31.100
at a time where there's already a lot of options.

29:31.100 --> 29:35.240
But they seem to be really going in with full steam.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.240
They've built an app that's written

29:37.240 --> 29:41.080
with a back end in Rust, which we love.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.880
They're proud to use also the, as they say,

29:50.880 --> 29:53.120
incredible ring crypto library to power

29:53.120 --> 29:56.080
end-to-end encryption to keep your data safe.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.520
It looks pretty legit.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.640
Now, before you get too excited, it's

29:59.640 --> 30:02.640
important to remember that this is still a beta.

30:02.640 --> 30:05.640
So expect some sharp turns and sudden drops

30:05.640 --> 30:07.880
as you test this out.

30:07.880 --> 30:10.320
Really, this should be used for testing and validation.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.840
And if you want a, quote unquote,

30:11.840 --> 30:14.040
stable experience on Linux, for now,

30:14.040 --> 30:16.800
you should use the browser version, which I'll tell you,

30:16.800 --> 30:18.520
Chris, that's what I've been doing.

30:18.520 --> 30:22.440
My new day job, well, turns out they're using 1Password.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.900
I'd only experienced the web stuff.

30:23.900 --> 30:25.660
I had no idea this was being planned.

30:25.660 --> 30:26.960
So I'm pretty happy about this.

30:26.960 --> 30:29.020
And I've already got the beta installed this morning.

30:29.020 --> 30:31.600
I think 1Password should be a sponsor on this podcast.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.980
I'm going to say it right up front,

30:32.980 --> 30:34.680
because I really like 1Password.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.800
I think they have the best UI.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.880
And this is what the company makes, right?

30:38.880 --> 30:40.960
They're not part of a larger conglomerate.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.480
This is what they do.

30:42.480 --> 30:46.300
And they have a bunch of corporate users,

30:46.300 --> 30:48.360
because over the last year or two,

30:48.360 --> 30:51.320
they've done a ton of deals with businesses

30:51.320 --> 30:54.920
where businesses just roll out 1Password for all their users.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.480
I've been there, I've done that.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.440
And the other thing they're doing

30:57.440 --> 30:58.640
is kind of an introduction, which

30:58.640 --> 31:00.920
I think shows maybe some insight into the community.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.880
They say, if you work on an open source team that

31:02.880 --> 31:06.560
needs a password manager, open a pull request in our 1Password

31:06.560 --> 31:09.000
open source project repo, and we'll give you

31:09.000 --> 31:12.320
and everyone on your team a free account.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.200
I think they get it.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.080
Well, maybe another sign of that is they're

31:15.080 --> 31:18.040
maintaining signed apt and RPM package repositories

31:18.040 --> 31:21.920
for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise

31:21.920 --> 31:24.200
Linux, as well as the Snap Store.

31:24.200 --> 31:27.240
Plus, if that's not enough for you, there's an app image.

31:27.240 --> 31:29.440
Although, so far, nothing on the Flat Hub.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.800
Now for yourself at home, listener at home,

31:31.800 --> 31:32.780
I think you could really consider

31:32.780 --> 31:34.440
looking at something like Bitwarden, especially

31:34.440 --> 31:37.200
the Bitwarden Rust server that you can run yourself.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.360
I think that's something you should definitely consider.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.020
There's key paths as well that people

31:41.020 --> 31:42.840
like for local password management.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.300
But the reason why I think this is

31:44.300 --> 31:46.960
noteworthy and why we elected to include it in the show

31:46.960 --> 31:51.560
is this kind of is reminiscent of Active Directory getting

31:51.560 --> 31:54.400
added to Ubuntu and having it in Fedora.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.840
It's a way for Linux to plug in with Enterprise.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.440
Or the teams coming to Linux, right?

31:59.440 --> 32:00.400
Kind of the same thing.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.560
You don't get to pick these tools.

32:02.560 --> 32:03.480
They're chosen for you.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.320
And that's kind of what decides if you can use your favorite

32:06.320 --> 32:07.280
desktop or not.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.920
Yeah, oh, and don't worry, Wes.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.840
Yes, it is in the AUR.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.120
I was worried.

32:13.120 --> 32:15.680
Yeah, I know you were concerned about that.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.440
I haven't given it a go myself.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.600
But I guess so.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.680
You've tried it, Wes?

32:20.680 --> 32:21.220
Yeah.

32:21.220 --> 32:22.600
Is it like an Electron app sitting

32:22.600 --> 32:23.960
on top of a Rust back end?

32:23.960 --> 32:26.400
Or is it actually a true native desktop Linux app?

32:26.400 --> 32:27.640
Oh, you know, I didn't get that far.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.480
I just actually tried it out for its features

32:29.480 --> 32:31.780
and was trying to sync up with my existing vaults.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.240
That's a good question.

32:33.240 --> 32:35.080
It's hard to tell from the screenshot.

32:35.080 --> 32:35.640
I can't really.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.280
And I suppose it's fine, as long as it's not

32:37.280 --> 32:38.600
too resource intensive.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.880
You didn't seem to have any performance concerns,

32:40.880 --> 32:41.720
it sounds like.

32:41.720 --> 32:44.800
No, it started up real fast, and away we went.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.720
They say it's this new look they're working on.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.320
It has automatic dark mode selection

32:49.320 --> 32:51.360
based on your GTK theme.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.520
It also supports opening network locations,

32:53.520 --> 32:57.200
like SSH and SMB and FTP locations.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.240
And it will unlock your Linux user account,

33:00.240 --> 33:02.360
including biometrics.

33:02.360 --> 33:03.760
No way.

33:03.760 --> 33:04.800
That's amazing.

33:04.800 --> 33:05.560
What?

33:05.560 --> 33:06.680
No, I got to look into that.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.480
All right, I got to try this.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.640
I got to try this.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.400
That is one thing I think that's exciting,

33:11.400 --> 33:14.440
is just looking at various password managers

33:14.440 --> 33:16.400
over the years, it seems like people really

33:16.400 --> 33:19.240
like one password just for their sort of response.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.920
Very actively developed features, bug fixes,

33:21.920 --> 33:23.840
all go out in a timely manner.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.040
And here, yeah, it seems like they're not

33:26.040 --> 33:27.560
trying to half-ass this Linux support.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.040
It's not just throwing us a bone.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.600
It seems like they really want to make it a platform

33:30.600 --> 33:32.520
that they're willing to support.

33:32.520 --> 33:34.880
X11 clipboard integration and clearing,

33:34.880 --> 33:37.560
also a feature in there for auto-filling passwords.

33:37.560 --> 33:38.560
I got to try this.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.180
If you try this and you like it and you buy something,

33:40.180 --> 33:41.480
you tell them Linux Unplugged sent you

33:41.480 --> 33:43.400
and that they should sponsor this show.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.640
I think this is great.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.960
I really do like seeing big, well, not big,

33:46.960 --> 33:49.520
but independent commercial apps like this

33:49.520 --> 33:52.080
that have really found a niche and gone after it.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.840
I really do like that about them.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.120
So there you go.

33:55.120 --> 33:59.560
I guess I was on the fence, but reading that they claim

33:59.560 --> 34:01.700
you can unlock with your Linux user account,

34:01.700 --> 34:04.440
including biometrics, I got to see that integration.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.920
And then the X11 clipboard integration,

34:06.920 --> 34:10.360
I'm on Wayland presently, but I got to try that too.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.920
That sounds like some sort of Mac fancy magic right there.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.120
I'm just not believing it until I see it.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.360
Does look like there's some Electron happening here.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.440
So surely some of this is written in Rust

34:19.440 --> 34:22.220
and then they're leveraging all the handy UI elements

34:22.220 --> 34:24.860
that Electron provides, but easy install.

34:24.860 --> 34:27.060
I just added the app repo to give that a shot,

34:27.060 --> 34:28.680
but I like that they have an app image.

34:28.680 --> 34:30.160
That seems nice, especially for a machine

34:30.160 --> 34:32.080
that maybe I'm just using for work.

34:32.080 --> 34:35.280
Wonder what the memory usage is on that there app.

34:35.280 --> 34:39.200
You got any data on how much that sucker's taken down?

34:39.200 --> 34:40.660
I mean, I kind of like that the important bits

34:40.660 --> 34:42.100
are written in Rust and then the UI bits

34:42.100 --> 34:43.160
are written in Electron.

34:43.160 --> 34:44.440
I can understand why they're doing that

34:44.440 --> 34:47.840
with multi-platform support, but yeah, not too surprising.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.480
No, nothing much.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.240
Not really showing up on my radar here.

34:51.240 --> 34:52.080
All right, very good.

34:52.080 --> 34:55.720
Well then, Wes, we have a few items.

34:55.720 --> 34:57.840
I know people have been skipping the housekeeping

34:57.840 --> 34:59.120
because I just saw someone in the chat room

34:59.120 --> 35:00.720
who didn't know Unfilter was back.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.360
So don't be skipping the housekeeping.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.320
You know, it's politicals here in the States.

35:04.320 --> 35:05.760
It's politicals right now.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.540
And I'm going to be live streaming the election,

35:07.540 --> 35:11.800
which is like coming at us like a freight train

35:11.800 --> 35:16.800
off the rails like next week at unfilter.show slash live

35:17.480 --> 35:18.920
if you want to watch that train wreck.

35:18.920 --> 35:21.240
I mean, you'll just be streaming nonstop, right?

35:21.240 --> 35:22.520
That's what I assumed.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.460
Yeah, probably for weeks.

35:23.460 --> 35:25.880
No, I'm just going to be there for the night.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.480
I'll make a few predictions on the stream.

35:27.480 --> 35:28.760
You know, we'll do that kind of stuff.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.320
We'll do live commentary.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.860
It's really about having a social outlet

35:32.860 --> 35:34.560
to commiserate this together.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.760
I'll be there with you.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.720
But you know, maybe you'd rather do the Linux thing.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.940
I want to remind you that we do have the Luplug

35:39.940 --> 35:43.800
every Sunday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.120
You can see it on our calendar.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.320
Just get the mumble client installed.

35:46.320 --> 35:48.040
We have info for that on our website.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.720
And then you connect to the lobby.

35:49.720 --> 35:52.640
And I think we have kind of a special plan again,

35:52.640 --> 35:55.040
another theme for the Luplug.

35:55.040 --> 35:55.960
Indeed we do.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.280
So you might remember that we had two weeks ago,

35:58.280 --> 35:59.780
we had a talk about browsers

35:59.780 --> 36:02.860
and that was pretty interesting discussion.

36:02.860 --> 36:06.400
So the idea is now to continue with some kind of topic

36:06.400 --> 36:09.000
every two or three weeks.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.880
And next Sunday will be a topic about keyboard shortcuts,

36:13.880 --> 36:16.720
mouse gestures, mouse button configuration

36:16.720 --> 36:18.280
and stuff like that.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.640
I will prepare a little talk

36:20.640 --> 36:23.240
about how I configure my input devices.

36:23.240 --> 36:26.640
And maybe some of you want to tell us

36:26.640 --> 36:30.400
how they configured their keyboard and mouse.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.520
So if you are interested into that topic,

36:32.520 --> 36:36.760
we would love to see you in the lobby in mumble

36:36.760 --> 36:38.480
for our Luplug next Sunday.

36:38.480 --> 36:40.520
And there is something really special.

36:40.520 --> 36:43.840
We might try to record that session too.

36:43.840 --> 36:46.640
Ah, look at you guys getting fancy.

36:46.640 --> 36:47.920
Very good.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.360
Also a reminder, if you want to be a pro JB listener,

36:50.360 --> 36:52.160
we do have the all shows feed.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.360
You can upgrade to the all Jupiter broadcasting shows feed

36:54.360 --> 36:55.960
by searching in your pod catcher of choice

36:55.960 --> 36:58.600
or there's a link at Jupiterbroadcasting.com

36:58.600 --> 37:01.360
and be sure to stay to the post show

37:01.360 --> 37:03.940
because we will get a weather update with Brent

37:03.940 --> 37:04.780
in the post show.

37:04.780 --> 37:05.880
So you want to stick around for that,

37:05.880 --> 37:10.880
but moving right along, extremely excited to say

37:11.320 --> 37:14.840
that Fedora 33 is officially here.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.480
It's Linux distro release week.

37:17.480 --> 37:20.560
Like last week we had Ubuntu 2010.

37:20.560 --> 37:21.760
This week we got Fedora 33.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.880
It's like release week parties, like all around.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.480
It's the release season.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.520
I'm almost distro hung over at this point,

37:27.520 --> 37:29.840
but there's enough in 33 here

37:29.840 --> 37:32.240
that it kind of makes me excited to talk about it.

37:32.240 --> 37:36.040
Wes and I went clean slate after last week's episode.

37:36.040 --> 37:41.040
We went hard into 33 and I kind of just went all deep.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.240
I think we'll start with what's new

37:44.240 --> 37:46.640
because there's some major standout things in this release

37:46.640 --> 37:47.680
that we've been looking forward to

37:47.680 --> 37:50.260
and talking about for weeks.

37:50.260 --> 37:54.000
Obviously, number one headline here is

37:54.000 --> 37:57.600
this is the Fedora that ships to ButterFS as default.

37:57.600 --> 38:02.160
When you install it, the default file system now is ButterFS.

38:02.160 --> 38:06.760
And perhaps a reason to consider reinstalling this time

38:06.760 --> 38:08.460
if you're so interested.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.120
But seeing ButterFS finally ship

38:10.120 --> 38:12.960
in a major Linux distribution,

38:12.960 --> 38:14.680
I think is extremely exciting.

38:14.680 --> 38:15.840
I think it's gotten to the point

38:15.840 --> 38:18.040
where it's a really solid workstation

38:18.040 --> 38:21.240
and VPS and laptop file system.

38:21.240 --> 38:22.880
And that's exactly what they've done here

38:22.880 --> 38:25.880
in the workstation versions of Fedora, it's ButterFS.

38:25.880 --> 38:26.880
Yeah, I mean, we've kind of had

38:26.880 --> 38:29.460
our own little ButterFS journey of late.

38:29.460 --> 38:31.700
And okay, maybe things get more complicated

38:31.700 --> 38:34.180
if you're building out your giant next NAS solution.

38:34.180 --> 38:35.740
But I think you hit it right on the head there.

38:35.740 --> 38:39.220
Do you want a modern file system that's maintained,

38:39.220 --> 38:42.180
that works well and has a lot of nice features?

38:42.180 --> 38:43.940
Well, ButterFS is it.

38:43.940 --> 38:47.780
And having it used by Fedora, used by the folks,

38:47.780 --> 38:49.540
the great people using Fedora,

38:49.540 --> 38:51.940
all of the folks that that means,

38:51.940 --> 38:53.300
that's just more people testing it

38:53.300 --> 38:57.780
in all kinds of configurations and settings and environments.

38:57.780 --> 38:59.580
It's just going to make everything better.

38:59.580 --> 39:03.620
Yeah, and the reality is more and more people are on SSDs.

39:03.620 --> 39:05.060
Well, ButterFS is the file system

39:05.060 --> 39:07.100
that has optimizations for that.

39:07.100 --> 39:10.220
Data compression with modern disk and modern CPUs

39:10.220 --> 39:12.980
can provide lots of not just storage benefits,

39:12.980 --> 39:15.580
but performance benefits, data integrity,

39:15.580 --> 39:17.820
copy on write, snapshots,

39:17.820 --> 39:21.180
being able to send a file system over the network.

39:21.180 --> 39:23.540
It really is a competitive file system.

39:23.540 --> 39:26.380
And I think it's great to see it land in Fedora

39:26.380 --> 39:27.220
as the default.

39:27.220 --> 39:28.940
I think it's a very bold move.

39:28.940 --> 39:31.460
I think it's equally as bold in many ways

39:31.460 --> 39:33.660
as Canonical deciding to ship ZFS.

39:33.660 --> 39:36.740
But while that is fantastic,

39:36.740 --> 39:38.420
what is really exciting about this

39:38.420 --> 39:40.980
is not only is it the default on your root,

39:41.860 --> 39:43.980
but this is a free file system.

39:43.980 --> 39:45.340
I mean, this is clear and free,

39:45.340 --> 39:47.300
totally integrated into the Linux kernel.

39:47.300 --> 39:50.500
So it is truly just a baked in file system

39:50.500 --> 39:52.460
that feels like it's part of Linux.

39:52.460 --> 39:53.300
Yes, right.

39:53.300 --> 39:55.180
No weirdness with module loading

39:55.180 --> 39:57.300
or strange situations you have to debug

39:57.300 --> 39:59.300
because it just doesn't feel like it's part of the system.

39:59.300 --> 40:01.460
No DKMS concerns, right?

40:01.460 --> 40:03.700
It's just in there and you get all those features.

40:03.700 --> 40:06.220
And I've just really, really found it

40:06.220 --> 40:09.620
to be a great file system for my home file servers.

40:09.620 --> 40:11.700
But I'll tell you a little quick story.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.420
I recently went over to Angela's house

40:13.420 --> 40:15.260
to help her with her file server,

40:15.260 --> 40:17.420
which is a Synology, I think.

40:17.420 --> 40:20.620
Synology disk station, if I'm getting my, I'm not sure.

40:20.620 --> 40:23.660
But it's the one that uses ButterFS on the file system.

40:23.660 --> 40:25.980
And she's having some problems connecting to it.

40:25.980 --> 40:30.380
And I figured, well, this thing is six, seven years old.

40:30.380 --> 40:34.020
It's a really old NAS that's ran out in a garage, right?

40:34.020 --> 40:35.700
It's not kept inside in like a perfectly

40:35.700 --> 40:37.020
air conditioned room either.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.660
It's kept out in a garage.

40:38.660 --> 40:41.100
And it's been out in that garage for seven years

40:41.100 --> 40:42.780
with spinning disks.

40:42.780 --> 40:45.580
And I thought, oh boy, I thought I was coming over

40:45.580 --> 40:46.900
to deliver her the bad news

40:46.900 --> 40:48.380
that this thing is finally eating itself

40:48.380 --> 40:50.380
because it's a version of ButterFS

40:50.380 --> 40:53.980
that is from maybe, it's before the five series kernels.

40:53.980 --> 40:55.180
I mean, it's from a very long time ago.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.740
It's really old.

40:56.740 --> 40:59.420
I've done like one or two updates to the OS

40:59.420 --> 41:00.260
in its lifetime.

41:00.260 --> 41:02.620
So it's got a couple of updates on there,

41:02.620 --> 41:04.740
but it's a pretty old version of ButterFS.

41:04.740 --> 41:05.900
A couple of updates.

41:05.900 --> 41:06.740
Yeah.

41:06.740 --> 41:09.100
And so I thought I was gonna have to prepare her

41:09.100 --> 41:11.340
for the bad news that she had lost her data.

41:11.340 --> 41:13.580
And she's not really big on cloud storage.

41:13.580 --> 41:14.980
She likes it all local.

41:14.980 --> 41:17.740
And I was prepared to like, I was bracing

41:17.740 --> 41:19.340
and nothing of the sort.

41:19.340 --> 41:21.420
It was just simply an interface issue.

41:21.420 --> 41:23.380
There was a rogue DHCP server on the network

41:23.380 --> 41:26.660
and the NAS for some reason had grabbed an IP from that

41:26.660 --> 41:28.100
and didn't get its reserved address

41:28.100 --> 41:29.900
from the proper DHCP server.

41:29.900 --> 41:31.900
And it was a really, it was,

41:31.900 --> 41:34.020
when I got back on that NAS and I logged into it,

41:34.020 --> 41:36.500
I looked at the file system and every disk was online

41:36.500 --> 41:39.060
and everything read as healthy.

41:39.060 --> 41:40.580
I had a little bit more appreciation

41:40.580 --> 41:41.700
for ButterFS right there,

41:41.700 --> 41:43.940
because that's seven years of kind of neglect,

41:43.940 --> 41:47.420
but just reliable use and keeping that data safe.

41:47.420 --> 41:51.780
And you combine that with GNOME 3.38.

41:51.780 --> 41:55.580
And I think what we have here is a magic version of Fedora.

41:55.580 --> 41:58.820
33, that's a magic number.

41:58.820 --> 42:02.060
It's pretty impressive with just these two things alone.

42:02.060 --> 42:04.140
Nothing else really combined in the mix.

42:04.140 --> 42:06.660
It is a close to upstream version

42:06.660 --> 42:09.340
with a couple of small Fedora takes on it.

42:09.340 --> 42:12.140
Maybe my favorite is they've done a clever thing

42:12.140 --> 42:13.940
with the background where I'll kind of transition

42:13.940 --> 42:17.940
several times during the day to a different lightning

42:17.940 --> 42:18.780
and color.

42:18.780 --> 42:20.980
I actually don't particularly like any

42:20.980 --> 42:22.860
of the default Fedora experience,

42:22.860 --> 42:26.020
the theming, the background, any of that.

42:26.020 --> 42:29.420
So I can't really sit here and tell you that it is,

42:29.420 --> 42:33.380
it's gonna be the slickest best GNOME Shell implementation

42:33.380 --> 42:35.940
you're gonna find, but it is one of the purest,

42:35.940 --> 42:38.860
which you can very quickly build on top of.

42:38.860 --> 42:41.620
And if you are the type of Linux user

42:41.620 --> 42:44.980
who is okay doing a little bit of that work,

42:44.980 --> 42:47.220
a little legwork, not a lot,

42:47.220 --> 42:48.740
probably two hours of legwork,

42:48.740 --> 42:51.500
if you're familiar with the processes, maybe not even,

42:52.420 --> 42:53.620
you can really hone it in.

42:53.620 --> 42:58.620
Because I kind of like starting with a close to blank slate

42:58.780 --> 43:02.300
and just tweaking the things in GNOME Shell that I want.

43:02.300 --> 43:04.340
Minimal extension experience, you know?

43:04.340 --> 43:05.620
Well, it gives you a nice sort of idea

43:05.620 --> 43:06.980
of what it is like fresh.

43:06.980 --> 43:08.180
You know, if you install a distro

43:08.180 --> 43:10.460
that has a lot of customization, that might be great,

43:10.460 --> 43:11.900
but you're never getting to try

43:11.900 --> 43:14.140
what that stock experience might be.

43:14.140 --> 43:15.300
I mean, you're just lower down the tree.

43:15.300 --> 43:16.460
There's less branching off places

43:16.460 --> 43:18.260
to try radically different things.

43:18.260 --> 43:20.100
Well, and when you are installing extensions,

43:20.100 --> 43:23.020
it's not a bad idea to kind of do them one at a time

43:23.020 --> 43:24.700
and kind of get a sense for it.

43:24.700 --> 43:29.340
Here's what Fedora does that I think is tops.

43:29.340 --> 43:31.420
So I go to the GNOME extension site,

43:31.420 --> 43:33.120
and of course I'm getting this crap

43:33.120 --> 43:35.660
about needing the OS connector installed

43:35.660 --> 43:36.500
for the extensions to work.

43:36.500 --> 43:39.300
And I started thinking to myself, well, for God's sakes,

43:39.300 --> 43:40.460
Fedora doesn't have that installed,

43:40.460 --> 43:43.140
so I go to DNF, install it, and it says it's already installed.

43:43.140 --> 43:44.980
And I sit here and I scratch my chin for a second,

43:44.980 --> 43:46.580
and I go, hang on.

43:47.620 --> 43:49.900
I seem to recall that they put these in the repo,

43:49.900 --> 43:51.580
in some sense, whatever that is.

43:51.580 --> 43:54.500
And many of the GNOME Shell extensions that I use

43:54.500 --> 43:56.260
are in the repo.

43:56.260 --> 43:58.260
So I don't actually have to go to the extension site,

43:58.260 --> 44:01.940
and they get updated via DNF with my other packages,

44:01.940 --> 44:03.420
which is brilliant.

44:03.420 --> 44:06.700
And it's totally the way to manage GNOME Shell extensions

44:06.700 --> 44:09.120
in a way that I think works really well and reliably.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.740
And again, makes GNOME Shell

44:10.740 --> 44:12.420
a little bit more workstation grade,

44:12.420 --> 44:14.900
because the two are generally getting updated together,

44:14.900 --> 44:15.900
if you're lucky.

44:15.900 --> 44:18.500
And I think that's way better than going to a website

44:18.500 --> 44:20.700
and having to remember to go update your extensions

44:20.700 --> 44:21.580
from time to time.

44:21.580 --> 44:22.980
Because it turns out I never do that.

44:22.980 --> 44:23.820
No.

44:23.820 --> 44:26.100
So I'm curious to know what your kind of early impressions

44:26.100 --> 44:29.300
were of Fedora 33 and where you ended up with it.

44:29.300 --> 44:32.380
Oh, I've actually been having a lot of fun.

44:32.380 --> 44:35.900
I'd been enjoying GNOME 3.38 already,

44:35.900 --> 44:37.660
just having played with it the past couple of weeks

44:37.660 --> 44:39.500
since it's been out.

44:39.500 --> 44:40.740
But you're right, there's something really fresh

44:40.740 --> 44:41.580
about Fedora.

44:41.580 --> 44:42.700
It was nice to spend a little time

44:42.700 --> 44:44.340
before I really got the system invested

44:44.340 --> 44:47.180
with all of my default applications,

44:47.180 --> 44:51.300
and just sort of using Firefox, using default GNOME,

44:51.300 --> 44:52.260
exploring the system.

44:52.260 --> 44:56.080
I'm still enjoying, I installed it rather a few times,

44:56.080 --> 44:57.660
which I'll get into later.

44:57.660 --> 44:58.820
But it was really nice to just go through

44:58.820 --> 45:01.740
the GNOME welcome experience.

45:01.740 --> 45:03.620
And I'm just kind of impressed with how,

45:03.620 --> 45:05.660
for a distribution that tests and integrates

45:05.660 --> 45:08.820
all this great upstream open source software,

45:08.820 --> 45:10.180
I'm getting to be really impressed

45:10.180 --> 45:13.140
with how integrated and its own Fedora feels.

45:13.140 --> 45:14.820
It doesn't feel like just a grab bag

45:14.820 --> 45:16.380
of good open source projects.

45:16.380 --> 45:19.580
It feels like a thoughtful, crafted distribution.

45:19.580 --> 45:21.260
Yeah, I really agree with that.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.320
It really does.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.020
From the way the software updates are handled

45:24.020 --> 45:26.500
and the firmware updates, to installing the extensions,

45:26.500 --> 45:27.640
to all of that.

45:27.640 --> 45:30.820
But additionally, it's not so buttoned down

45:30.820 --> 45:32.300
that you can't make it your own pretty quickly

45:32.300 --> 45:33.480
if that's your thing.

45:33.480 --> 45:37.020
I admittedly just went and got the POP theme.

45:37.020 --> 45:39.460
I got the POP icons, I got the POP GTK theme,

45:39.460 --> 45:42.860
I got the auto-tiling extension.

45:42.860 --> 45:43.700
Oh, did you?

45:43.700 --> 45:45.220
I was thinking about that.

45:45.220 --> 45:46.380
What was the experience like?

45:46.380 --> 45:48.020
Because I didn't get down that road all the way.

45:48.020 --> 45:48.840
I mean, it's great.

45:48.840 --> 45:50.780
System76 just puts it all up on GitHub.

45:50.780 --> 45:55.620
So, and now, and now Carl has made it even easier

45:55.620 --> 45:57.340
to install in Fedora 33.

45:57.340 --> 45:58.180
Yes, sir.

45:58.180 --> 46:00.500
I packaged up the POP Shell extension.

46:00.500 --> 46:03.360
It's available as GNOME Shell extension POP Shell

46:03.360 --> 46:04.380
with hyphens in between.

46:04.380 --> 46:06.520
And you can just DNF install it and start using it.

46:06.520 --> 46:09.100
Yeah, so I pulled it off GitHub and built it

46:09.100 --> 46:10.260
because they put the instructions

46:10.260 --> 46:11.420
and it's really easy to do that.

46:11.420 --> 46:14.140
But there was some TypeScript updates that had to be done.

46:14.140 --> 46:15.240
I mean, there was some shenanigans.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.340
So Carl just packaged it all up, makes it even easier.

46:17.340 --> 46:20.060
And I'm a big fan of the look.

46:20.060 --> 46:23.840
I think it makes a really great theme on Fedora 33.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.700
Not to mention with that extension,

46:25.700 --> 46:27.620
there's quite a few of their shortcuts

46:27.620 --> 46:29.420
that conflict with default GNOME shortcuts.

46:29.420 --> 46:31.820
And I had that all handled with G Schema overrides

46:31.820 --> 46:33.940
in the package that you'd have to figure out

46:33.940 --> 46:36.700
those conflicts yourself if you were manually installing it.

46:36.700 --> 46:37.860
That's great.

46:37.860 --> 46:38.700
That's so great.

46:38.700 --> 46:40.020
So I did, you know, I had to do it the hard way,

46:40.020 --> 46:42.340
but now you could do it the easy way.

46:42.340 --> 46:45.980
And that sort of started to complete my experience.

46:45.980 --> 46:48.900
I was impressed too that the flat packs I installed,

46:48.900 --> 46:51.420
they seem to launch fast and adopt the theme that I'm using,

46:51.420 --> 46:52.920
which I'm really grateful for.

46:52.920 --> 46:54.940
So all that just worked really well.

46:54.940 --> 46:57.460
And I was on a Pure Wayland session

46:57.460 --> 46:59.100
because I'm doing this all on Intel hardware

46:59.100 --> 47:00.980
and I found performance to be exceptional.

47:00.980 --> 47:03.620
And it's noticeable now that I can do things

47:03.620 --> 47:04.940
that I couldn't do in Wayland.

47:04.940 --> 47:07.460
My monitor management is sticking,

47:07.460 --> 47:10.340
which is a huge win for me.

47:10.340 --> 47:12.300
If you guys have listened to this show for a while,

47:12.300 --> 47:14.740
you know I've really struggled with my two verticals

47:14.740 --> 47:17.060
and a center monitor setup.

47:17.060 --> 47:20.340
It hasn't been a non-issue using a Thunderbolt dock

47:20.340 --> 47:23.320
hooked up to a laptop running Fedora 33 on Wayland.

47:23.320 --> 47:25.540
It has worked, hallelujah.

47:25.540 --> 47:29.300
And additionally, I have found that performance

47:29.300 --> 47:31.860
has been even better than I got on X.

47:31.860 --> 47:34.060
Videos don't tear, games are playing just fine,

47:34.060 --> 47:35.460
even though they're X Wayland.

47:35.460 --> 47:37.380
It's really good, even with multi-monitors,

47:37.380 --> 47:38.920
which I was concerned about.

47:38.920 --> 47:40.160
I was concerned about a performance hit

47:40.160 --> 47:41.260
with Wayland and multiple monitors,

47:41.260 --> 47:43.620
but it is not so far bared out.

47:43.620 --> 47:46.400
And I'll say lastly, I can tell the functionality's

47:46.400 --> 47:47.240
really gotten there.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.620
I can take screenshots of various applications

47:49.620 --> 47:52.660
and then I can copy and paste them into other applications

47:52.660 --> 47:54.400
and all of that is working.

47:54.400 --> 47:55.400
There's a couple like Shudder,

47:55.400 --> 47:56.800
there's a couple apps that I used to use

47:56.800 --> 47:57.740
that don't work with Wayland,

47:57.740 --> 47:59.580
but for the most part, if you use the built-in tools,

47:59.580 --> 48:01.820
it's brilliant now, Wes, and they all look really good.

48:01.820 --> 48:04.220
It's almost to the point, I mean, okay, yes,

48:04.220 --> 48:05.860
there's all kinds of weird little niche cases

48:05.860 --> 48:06.700
if you're pushing things,

48:06.700 --> 48:09.580
but it feels like it's to the point where I kind of forgot

48:09.580 --> 48:12.440
that I was using Wayland and not X,

48:12.440 --> 48:15.860
at least for my, especially for like my use case

48:15.860 --> 48:18.020
of just using it for work as an actual workstation,

48:18.020 --> 48:20.300
not as a streaming or a test machine.

48:20.300 --> 48:23.500
Yeah, I'll add this into the mix too.

48:23.500 --> 48:27.860
Fedora 33 is the first distro to pioneer Nano

48:27.860 --> 48:30.180
as one of the default text editors as far as I'm aware,

48:30.180 --> 48:31.940
and I think that's a groundbreaking feature, right?

48:31.940 --> 48:33.060
Oh, you would.

48:33.060 --> 48:35.460
And so Nano, by doing so,

48:35.460 --> 48:38.300
makes Fedora accessible to humans,

48:38.300 --> 48:40.100
and now clearly is an easy distribution

48:40.100 --> 48:42.260
to recommend to beginners because Nano.

48:42.260 --> 48:45.100
Also, those of you on the plasma side of Fedora

48:45.100 --> 48:47.420
will be getting early out of memory manager

48:47.420 --> 48:49.800
that was shipped last version,

48:49.800 --> 48:51.620
but was on the GNOME side of the thing,

48:51.620 --> 48:53.700
of the distro, I guess,

48:53.700 --> 48:55.340
and now it's on the plasma side of the distro

48:55.340 --> 48:56.700
if you get the plasma spin.

48:56.700 --> 48:57.540
So that's kind of nice,

48:57.540 --> 49:00.400
and you also get swap on ZRAM by default now,

49:00.400 --> 49:01.940
which should help with performance as well.

49:01.940 --> 49:02.780
Yeah, I noticed that.

49:02.780 --> 49:03.600
Isn't that fancy?

49:03.600 --> 49:04.440
Yeah.

49:04.440 --> 49:07.060
There's one notable other addition

49:07.060 --> 49:08.680
to the Fedora family now in 33, right?

49:08.680 --> 49:12.340
And that's Fedora IoT is now an official edition.

49:12.340 --> 49:14.580
So that's kind of fun if you're out there

49:14.580 --> 49:15.780
potentially building something

49:15.780 --> 49:18.240
that could be in this ecosystem.

49:18.240 --> 49:20.460
It's now a actual official edition,

49:20.460 --> 49:22.060
which I think is just fantastic.

49:22.060 --> 49:25.620
But here's my final sell on Fedora 33.

49:25.620 --> 49:29.920
And this is where I think it is really nailing it right now.

49:29.920 --> 49:33.300
If you are using Arch, by the way,

49:33.300 --> 49:34.860
if you're an Arch user,

49:34.860 --> 49:37.980
and maybe it hasn't been just quite perfect,

49:37.980 --> 49:40.500
if you're a happy Arch user and you're loving it

49:40.500 --> 49:43.020
and you have no concerns at all,

49:43.020 --> 49:44.260
I'm not talking to you.

49:44.260 --> 49:45.300
But if you're an Arch user

49:45.300 --> 49:47.000
and maybe you got bit once or twice,

49:47.000 --> 49:48.860
or you're concerned about it,

49:48.860 --> 49:51.100
a little more rocky than rolling.

49:51.100 --> 49:56.100
Yeah, perhaps you should give Fedora a serious thought

49:56.340 --> 49:58.920
because it sits in this real nice nexus

49:58.920 --> 50:02.100
of close to upstream like Arch is,

50:02.100 --> 50:03.260
really fresh packages,

50:03.260 --> 50:05.100
like you're gonna get new kernel versions

50:05.100 --> 50:07.560
during the lifespan of Fedora.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.220
It's really easy to jump over

50:09.220 --> 50:10.620
to even the raw hide version if you like,

50:10.620 --> 50:12.260
but just with the current version,

50:12.260 --> 50:14.120
you're gonna stay pretty fresh.

50:14.120 --> 50:16.060
But major user land changes,

50:16.060 --> 50:20.540
like changing your version of Plasma or GNOME Shell,

50:20.540 --> 50:24.620
those are done at official versions, like 33.

50:24.620 --> 50:26.100
And you can plan for that.

50:26.100 --> 50:28.300
And you can essentially rely,

50:28.300 --> 50:31.020
in a world where your extensions come from your repo,

50:31.020 --> 50:32.660
and a lot of your applications

50:32.660 --> 50:35.140
are coming from Flat Hub and Flatpaks,

50:35.140 --> 50:37.740
you would be surprised at the success rate you'll have

50:37.740 --> 50:41.700
at doing upgrades, even relatively soon around release.

50:41.700 --> 50:43.340
It really is rock solid.

50:43.340 --> 50:46.660
And so what you have here is a distribution maintained

50:46.660 --> 50:49.580
by a major player in the space.

50:49.580 --> 50:52.620
You have a fairly frequently updated base

50:52.620 --> 50:55.300
with a stable user land that gets updated

50:55.300 --> 50:58.100
to the latest and greatest at every major release

50:58.100 --> 50:59.780
with a package management system

50:59.780 --> 51:02.980
that makes it really practical to actually do all of this.

51:02.980 --> 51:04.260
It's not hard to maintain.

51:04.260 --> 51:08.340
You don't have to be on this rocky rollercoaster of a ride,

51:08.340 --> 51:10.620
but you still get that really sweet nexus

51:10.620 --> 51:13.460
of fresh software, well-supported upstream,

51:13.460 --> 51:16.740
and a wide variety of packages to choose from,

51:16.740 --> 51:19.820
industry support, and also a growing community.

51:19.820 --> 51:21.700
I mean, there's a lot of positives here.

51:21.700 --> 51:22.820
I'm not trying to convince anybody

51:22.820 --> 51:24.500
to switch off of their beloved distro,

51:24.500 --> 51:26.700
but if this sounds like this appeals to you,

51:26.700 --> 51:29.940
I think Fedora 33 could be a serious contender for you.

51:29.940 --> 51:32.780
I can still have my Colonel Hipster dreams.

51:34.340 --> 51:37.980
Fedora 33 gets the stamp of approval from Linux Unplugged.

51:37.980 --> 51:39.660
I'm really loving it.

51:39.660 --> 51:42.420
I had to make it my own to get it there,

51:43.300 --> 51:45.100
but I have no problem doing that.

51:45.100 --> 51:47.380
But it's worth that little bit of investment, I think.

51:47.380 --> 51:49.900
Yeah, okay, maybe it comes a little raw,

51:49.900 --> 51:52.900
unconfigured, perhaps, but it's just built

51:52.900 --> 51:54.340
on such a solid foundation.

51:54.340 --> 51:56.220
And you're right, you're no longer waiting

51:56.220 --> 51:57.940
for software to become available.

51:57.940 --> 51:59.100
Pretty much everything just works.

51:59.100 --> 52:01.140
You can go grab whatever you need.

52:01.140 --> 52:03.140
Feels like you can get, finally,

52:03.140 --> 52:05.540
and this has been true for the past few releases, really,

52:05.540 --> 52:07.420
but it's this happy marriage of, okay,

52:07.420 --> 52:09.380
well, there's probably an RPM that works if you need that,

52:09.380 --> 52:11.860
and of course, a million other ways to get your software.

52:11.860 --> 52:14.660
And you get all the great systems and architecture work

52:14.660 --> 52:16.420
that the Fedora team brings in

52:16.420 --> 52:18.940
and makes the new future of Linux.

52:18.940 --> 52:21.460
I think one of the things that's really changed for Fedora,

52:21.460 --> 52:23.660
from Chris' reviews of the past

52:23.660 --> 52:25.020
where I really struggled with Fedora,

52:25.020 --> 52:28.940
like in the teens, in their early 20s of Fedora releases,

52:28.940 --> 52:33.740
is you didn't have mechanisms like Copper and FlatHub.

52:33.740 --> 52:37.020
And so when you add in the rather expansive now repositories

52:37.020 --> 52:38.380
of Fedora to begin with,

52:38.380 --> 52:41.180
then you add in FlatHub and you add in Copper,

52:41.180 --> 52:42.940
you can pretty much get anything you want.

52:42.940 --> 52:45.300
And AppImage, of course, and Snap's available as well.

52:45.300 --> 52:46.980
You could just install Snap on Fedora.

52:46.980 --> 52:48.340
There's nothing stopping you.

52:48.340 --> 52:51.100
So there's really the software availability

52:51.100 --> 52:52.980
has kind of gone by the wayside.

52:52.980 --> 52:56.220
And the kernel maturity and the desktop environment maturity

52:56.220 --> 52:58.700
is just always a default win for Fedora.

52:58.700 --> 52:59.780
So, you know, while we get here,

52:59.780 --> 53:00.940
when Ubuntu comes out first,

53:00.940 --> 53:03.420
we'll often go through the list of features in 5.8,

53:03.420 --> 53:05.500
and we'll go through the list of features in Gnome Shell.

53:05.500 --> 53:07.220
Of course, Fedora has all those as well.

53:07.220 --> 53:08.860
So it's a very compelling release.

53:08.860 --> 53:12.660
And I think it's, for now, an easy recommend.

53:12.660 --> 53:14.900
And you also get a chance to play with ButterFS,

53:14.900 --> 53:17.980
which, Wes, you put in the doc, and I missed it earlier.

53:17.980 --> 53:21.100
You have a crazy way to run ButterFS from RAM.

53:21.100 --> 53:22.460
Yeah, well, so this is nice.

53:22.460 --> 53:25.380
You know, I like to test out distros sometimes,

53:25.380 --> 53:28.060
run them straight from RAM, and Kexec in there,

53:28.060 --> 53:29.580
just as I get to play with, you know,

53:29.580 --> 53:31.300
it's like the benefits of a virtual machine

53:31.300 --> 53:32.340
where it has a whole disk.

53:32.340 --> 53:34.340
I can try out the default automatic partitioning

53:34.340 --> 53:35.860
and see what happens there.

53:35.860 --> 53:37.980
But I can also just blow it away and try again

53:37.980 --> 53:40.420
if I want to do things differently.

53:40.420 --> 53:43.140
What's nice about having ButterFS installed there

53:43.140 --> 53:45.740
is I can kind of make it work a little nicer

53:45.740 --> 53:46.740
in a hybrid approach,

53:46.740 --> 53:48.260
because I've got everything on ButterFS,

53:48.260 --> 53:49.740
and I actually just sort of changed my setup

53:49.740 --> 53:51.900
to put boot on ButterFS too,

53:51.900 --> 53:54.260
because I'm a madman like that.

53:54.260 --> 53:57.580
But what that meant is, here's my OS running in RAM.

53:57.580 --> 54:00.900
ButterFS has these awesome copy-on-write snapshots, though.

54:00.900 --> 54:02.140
So I take a snapshot,

54:02.140 --> 54:05.140
send that snapshot back to disk as a backup, right?

54:05.140 --> 54:07.100
So in case my computer breaks,

54:07.100 --> 54:08.700
or, you know, of course, these things that I run on RAM,

54:08.700 --> 54:10.260
they're on a UPS, all those normal things.

54:10.260 --> 54:12.180
But in the event of a power failure

54:12.180 --> 54:14.660
or a kernel panic or whatever, think that off.

54:14.660 --> 54:17.540
And then anytime I do updates or system changes

54:17.540 --> 54:19.380
on the system partition,

54:19.380 --> 54:21.540
all I have to do is take advantage of that snapshot diff

54:21.540 --> 54:22.780
and only send the diff,

54:22.780 --> 54:25.140
and I can keep a nice on-disk backup

54:25.140 --> 54:26.700
that I don't ever actually run.

54:26.700 --> 54:28.460
But if I need to, I can take that,

54:28.460 --> 54:29.700
restore it back into memory,

54:29.700 --> 54:32.100
and have a full, fast RAM disk on my computer

54:32.100 --> 54:33.460
system ready to go.

54:33.460 --> 54:35.740
You know, you are just a few short tricks away

54:35.740 --> 54:38.700
from like a bulletproof segment here of,

54:38.700 --> 54:39.900
I'm already seeing it now,

54:39.900 --> 54:43.660
Wes Payne's run your whole system from RAM safely segment.

54:43.660 --> 54:46.220
And then for just extra fun,

54:46.220 --> 54:49.180
we'll say do it as root the entire time as well.

54:49.180 --> 54:50.020
Because why not?

54:50.020 --> 54:53.100
Coming up on a future episode of Linux Unplugged,

54:53.100 --> 54:54.540
Wes loses all his files.

54:56.540 --> 54:57.380
I want to say thank you

54:57.380 --> 55:01.060
to our Unplugged Core contributors, unpluggedcore.com.

55:01.060 --> 55:03.060
You're helping keep Linux Unplugged independent.

55:03.060 --> 55:04.860
And that is appreciated,

55:04.860 --> 55:06.620
not just by your humble hosts here,

55:06.620 --> 55:09.020
but by the listeners of this podcast.

55:09.020 --> 55:11.660
It's a crew of you out there that make that possible.

55:11.660 --> 55:13.700
And you also help reduce the ad load needed.

55:13.700 --> 55:15.700
And we can be a little pickier

55:15.700 --> 55:18.620
about who we choose to make the show profitable.

55:18.620 --> 55:20.020
You also get some perks.

55:20.020 --> 55:21.420
When you become a core contributor,

55:21.420 --> 55:23.300
you get access to two feeds, your choice.

55:23.300 --> 55:24.980
Well, I shouldn't say that

55:24.980 --> 55:27.580
because you could actually do both if you're a maniac,

55:27.580 --> 55:30.700
but feed one is a limited ad version of the show.

55:30.700 --> 55:32.980
Same full production, Joe's touches on there,

55:32.980 --> 55:34.580
just limited ads.

55:34.580 --> 55:36.260
The ones that we contractually obligated are in there,

55:36.260 --> 55:38.580
but going forward with sponsors,

55:38.580 --> 55:41.260
we set them up and we kind of divvy it all up

55:41.260 --> 55:45.220
so that way the shows can be limited in ads for that feed.

55:45.220 --> 55:48.500
And that means if you're not a big fan of the ads,

55:49.460 --> 55:51.100
you get the same great production quality

55:51.100 --> 55:53.500
just without those.

55:53.500 --> 55:55.140
But they're his feed two.

55:55.140 --> 55:55.980
Oh boy.

55:55.980 --> 55:57.500
Now this is nothing like feed one.

55:57.500 --> 55:59.700
Feed two is a mess.

55:59.700 --> 56:00.540
It's horrible.

56:00.540 --> 56:01.580
You wouldn't listen to it.

56:01.580 --> 56:05.260
I encourage you never download feed two.

56:05.260 --> 56:06.860
I kid, but it's the full live stream,

56:06.860 --> 56:08.980
which means anytime we have a screw up

56:08.980 --> 56:13.180
or a pause in the show or anything that's a blemish,

56:13.180 --> 56:15.060
it's still in there.

56:15.060 --> 56:18.500
If we caught something that we would technically have pulled

56:18.500 --> 56:20.460
because maybe we said something that's inaccurate,

56:20.460 --> 56:21.340
we would cut it.

56:21.340 --> 56:22.540
But that, it's all in there.

56:22.540 --> 56:24.140
All the screw ups, full transparency,

56:24.140 --> 56:27.140
but you also get with that a lot more show.

56:27.140 --> 56:29.220
You get all the stuff that maybe gets cut

56:29.220 --> 56:30.500
because we didn't have time,

56:30.500 --> 56:31.860
but you get the pre-show,

56:31.860 --> 56:33.260
which is generally quite a bit of show.

56:33.260 --> 56:36.060
And you get the post-show that is a lot more

56:36.060 --> 56:38.260
than whatever gets released in the public version.

56:38.260 --> 56:40.020
So it's, there's some perks to feed two.

56:40.020 --> 56:42.460
And if you got a long commute, it's pretty great for you.

56:42.460 --> 56:43.940
And it's just a way of saying thank you

56:43.940 --> 56:44.980
for supporting the show.

56:44.980 --> 56:46.260
Unpluggedcore.com.

56:46.260 --> 56:48.940
You can become a core contributor of this here podcast.

56:48.940 --> 56:50.660
Keep us going, keep us independent,

56:50.660 --> 56:51.860
and you get a few perks.

56:51.860 --> 56:56.900
Emails coming into the show.

56:56.900 --> 56:57.740
Francis writes,

56:57.740 --> 57:00.140
hi, in the last episode of Linux Unplugged 376,

57:00.140 --> 57:01.940
you had someone on from System76

57:01.940 --> 57:05.660
to talk about the Thaleo Mega.

57:05.660 --> 57:09.620
As much as I'm a fan of both System76 and Linux Unplugged,

57:09.620 --> 57:11.580
I have issues with not disclosing the fact

57:11.580 --> 57:14.740
that System76 sponsors one of your other shows,

57:14.740 --> 57:16.020
which is Linux Action News.

57:16.020 --> 57:17.620
He says, I know that you have interviewed people

57:17.620 --> 57:19.380
from System76 previously,

57:19.380 --> 57:21.220
and I don't think those interviews were appropriate,

57:21.220 --> 57:22.420
but I feel that there's at least

57:22.420 --> 57:24.020
a perceived conflict of interest.

57:24.020 --> 57:26.380
It just made me uncomfortable listening to the interview

57:26.380 --> 57:27.700
with you not first putting a disclaimer

57:27.700 --> 57:30.380
about your business relationship with System76.

57:30.380 --> 57:31.220
Thanks for your understanding.

57:31.220 --> 57:32.060
Love the shows.

57:32.060 --> 57:33.260
Francis.

57:33.260 --> 57:35.260
Yeah, I knew when I talked about Pop2 is like,

57:35.260 --> 57:38.060
it's awkward because they do sponsor LAN.

57:38.060 --> 57:39.580
They don't sponsor this show,

57:39.580 --> 57:42.020
and I haven't offered this show to System76

57:42.020 --> 57:45.620
because, well, I am not really concerned

57:45.620 --> 57:48.540
about it impacting what I would comment on.

57:48.540 --> 57:51.740
I am concerned about the perception of it.

57:51.740 --> 57:54.220
And so if we talk about something in this show,

57:54.220 --> 57:55.820
it's because we wanna talk about it.

57:55.820 --> 57:57.940
Nobody asks us to talk about it.

57:57.940 --> 58:00.780
It's our choice and our decision.

58:00.780 --> 58:04.580
And I have had a, you guys, if you listen to the show,

58:04.580 --> 58:06.940
I mean, I've had no problem holding back.

58:06.940 --> 58:10.420
Like I went all in on criticism for Pop when it came out.

58:10.420 --> 58:13.700
And the thing about System76 and I,

58:13.700 --> 58:15.220
and really NetJB as a whole,

58:15.220 --> 58:20.220
is our relationship spans like 13 years now, almost.

58:21.140 --> 58:23.900
I was literally one of their first public customers.

58:23.900 --> 58:28.900
So it's kind of beyond, it's beyond like one ad deal.

58:30.140 --> 58:32.220
So one ad deal doesn't really influence

58:32.220 --> 58:34.140
what I say or don't say.

58:34.140 --> 58:35.940
It doesn't hold back my criticism.

58:35.940 --> 58:37.140
That's just how I roll.

58:37.140 --> 58:39.100
That's one of the benefits of me being independent.

58:39.100 --> 58:41.020
But I totally get the perception

58:41.020 --> 58:42.460
and the concern of conflict there.

58:42.460 --> 58:45.780
And so what I always do is if they're an actual sponsor

58:45.780 --> 58:47.060
in that show, I disclose it.

58:47.060 --> 58:49.660
If it's something like that would be like,

58:49.660 --> 58:51.940
say there was some sort of paid promotion,

58:51.940 --> 58:55.740
a paid thing like that, I would 100% always disclose it.

58:55.740 --> 58:57.300
If you don't hear me disclose it,

58:57.300 --> 58:59.900
my general default is just because we chose to do it.

58:59.900 --> 59:02.460
I asked to have her on, I wanted to know about it.

59:02.460 --> 59:05.460
I think System76 is extremely interesting

59:05.460 --> 59:07.100
from a Linux ecosystem perspective

59:07.100 --> 59:08.620
because they have been around for so long.

59:08.620 --> 59:10.660
They've been through the Unity years,

59:10.660 --> 59:11.860
the transition to GNOME,

59:11.860 --> 59:13.740
now they're making their own products more and more.

59:13.740 --> 59:16.580
And I think it's a really interesting,

59:16.580 --> 59:19.500
just bellwether in general for the Linux desktop,

59:19.500 --> 59:21.860
for Linux in business, Linux in education.

59:21.860 --> 59:24.500
So to me, they're a fascinating subject

59:24.500 --> 59:26.620
to follow on that level.

59:26.620 --> 59:28.500
But because they are so relevant,

59:28.500 --> 59:30.820
I also feel like they do make for a great sponsor

59:30.820 --> 59:33.300
because they fit in that nexus of interest

59:33.300 --> 59:36.300
with our audience, a company I know well and believe in,

59:36.300 --> 59:38.660
which means I've vetted them extremely thoroughly.

59:38.660 --> 59:41.580
And they have a legitimate message to get out

59:41.580 --> 59:43.900
that I think is, it's a good product.

59:43.900 --> 59:46.860
So they really, they sit in that kind of sweet spot there.

59:46.860 --> 59:50.260
But we will, as we begin picking on sponsors

59:50.260 --> 59:52.860
and stuff like that, this is kind of new again for us,

59:52.860 --> 59:55.100
we will try to be really receptive to this kind of feedback

59:55.100 --> 59:58.340
because it's, I want to get it right for you guys

59:58.340 --> 01:00:01.540
and I've got no reason not to be fully upfront with you.

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.980
So this is something we will try to learn from

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.780
and try to make sure we get right.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:07.700
And if somebody has some sort of like business relationship

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:10.500
with us that could be perceived as influence,

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.780
we'll try to disclose it.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.180
I kind of started playing with that

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.260
when we talked about POP,

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:15.340
because I knew there was like,

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.940
there's something there about it,

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.820
but I don't really have like the words for it yet.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.900
It's like, yeah, they sponsor Linux Action News,

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.980
but my thoughts about POP are still my own,

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.180
but I don't know how to cover it,

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.420
but it's something we're thinking about.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.820
And Francis, I appreciate that kind of feedback.

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.620
Wes, do you have like thoughts on, I don't know,

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.340
lessons learned, what we could do differently?

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.260
No, I mean, I think you're right.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.100
It is a little bit of a strange bundle

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.900
in that they are a little closer

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.180
than maybe some other sponsors or relationships

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.020
and that you've been a customer,

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.140
we've gone to events with them, we see them a lot

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:49.940
and know a lot of the folks personally,

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.780
but you are right that I think we try

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.940
to keep things separate.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.900
And Francis has a great point that

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.900
even if we feel these ways internally,

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.260
it can only help to make that more transparent

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:01.740
or as transparent as we can be that yes,

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.100
we know these folks,

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.300
kind of goes with a lot of the projects

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:05.940
where especially over the years,

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.660
you reporting on them, following them,

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.140
sending emails asking for,

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:10.660
hey, can you clarify these things?

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.100
You just develop these relationships

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:15.460
and it's important to make sure the audience knows that

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.700
yes, you have those, but you're still gonna say

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.540
whatever you want.

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.220
Yeah, and I think I really,

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.180
I gained more respect for them too

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.300
when I really shit on Pop OS.

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.220
And they, you know, they didn't like,

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.340
I'm sure they didn't like it.

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.020
Constructive criticism?

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.500
Yeah, like, yeah.

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.700
And I admit that I was wrong.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:34.820
I think it's actually pretty great.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.740
And here I am running the pop theme now on Fedora.

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:40.380
Kat writes in, hi, Chris and Wes.

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.780
Why don't we as a community acknowledge

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.180
the freaking amazing level of technical support we get

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.820
with our software for free?

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.020
This week I had a great displeasure

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.780
to contact a certain commercial vendor

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.900
about a technical issue in their product,

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.420
which we paid a lot of money to use.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.980
I couldn't get in touch with any qualified personnel

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.660
who could actually understand the problem we were having,

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.700
let alone fix it, and had to give up

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.420
and debug the issue myself.

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.820
Oh, I guess we're not spending enough millions

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.460
to be able to have direct lifeline

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.060
to whoever is actually writing the product.

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.820
This got me thinking about the level of support

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.300
we've seen on the Linux kernel mailing list

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.700
and so many other places so many times.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.980
It's very easy to get in touch directly with the developers

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.700
and who are generally relatively eager to help.

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.300
And he has an example, he says,

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.780
some guy posted about a hard drive which crapped itself

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:35.180
and totally broke and broke his ButterFest file system.

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.020
Okay.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.620
And he says that the ButterFest developer

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:42.180
and a SUSE employee actually responded in a few hours

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.860
by writing a custom recovery tool

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:48.260
specifically for this individual's problem.

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.300
Isn't that just great, he says.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.860
If this were a commercial project,

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.780
you'd have to shell out millions each year

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.220
to be able to have that kind of support.

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:59.060
And it's more of the norm than it is the exception.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.660
He says, by the way, you have listeners

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:02.340
even in remote places like Central Asia,

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.820
love the show, keep it up.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:05.620
That is such a great point

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.620
and one that I think can also contribute

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.860
to developer burnout,

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:12.580
but it is such a level of transparency.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.300
It's one of the reasons I think Wes and I

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:15.940
like covering this space

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.940
is because you can actually go to the mailing list.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.060
And a lot of times for a lot of the things we talk about,

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:23.380
especially with Linux Action News, we just email them.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.660
Yeah, right, there's no secrets.

01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.060
The development's happening out in the open.

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:28.180
The discussion is often out in the open.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:32.460
And yeah, once you're pushing these commits out there,

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.300
it's not that big of a leap

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.220
to actually just start conversing with folks.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.420
Oh man, Marty writes in with some feedback

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.180
that I was just thinking about on the drive in

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:41.500
from the woods today about how I wanna set up

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.420
a local AD Active Directory server

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.820
and I wanna try getting an Ubuntu box

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.820
and a Fedora 33 box to both plug into it.

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.980
I think that'd be pretty cool.

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:53.220
So Marty writes, I was listening to episode 376

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.180
and you mentioned Active Directory support

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:58.180
in Ubuntu 2010 and the forthcoming Fedora 33.

01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.620
I'm a small time Fedora developer,

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.180
but I run several different Linux distros,

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:04.700
have for a long time and I run free IPA in my home lab.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.820
And it's remarkably easy to set up.

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:09.500
The best thing about it is that it's available

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.100
for my clients and there's clients

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.620
in all the major Linux distros as well.

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.540
Single sign on reality is here.

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:18.900
Free IPA uses the underlying bits of 389 for LDAP,

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:23.020
MITKRB5 for Kerberos and dog tag for certs.

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.180
It's ridiculously simple to get up and running

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.460
and get clients joined to it.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:27.900
It's very convenient.

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:31.060
It also bundles in an LDAP enabled bind,

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.260
which allows clients and servers

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:35.140
to both get their own Kerberos secured DNS updates

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.140
and do dynamic addressing.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:38.980
That's pretty great.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.980
He says, I even do domain replication

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.740
pretty easily in free IPA.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.260
I run a multi-master on my home lab.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.780
I think it'd be really worthwhile for you to check it out.

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:48.620
Well, hot dang Marty.

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.860
I think that seals the deal.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:52.980
I think that puts it on the project list right there.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.780
Thank you everybody for writing in.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.460
Love the feedback, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.460
Anything we've talked about

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.460
or anything you think we should talk about.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.940
You wanna get something in front of us,

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:02.980
that's where you go.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.980
And last but not least this week,

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:10.220
we have a pic for you that's rather topical.

01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.860
And it's called Annie,

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:15.540
the fast and simple and clean video downloader.

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.340
And you gave it a go this morning, Wes.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:18.180
I sure did.

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.500
You know, it's written in go.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.140
Pluses and minuses, depending on what you think there.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:23.700
But it did mean that there was a simple little static binary

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.060
I could go download and run.

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.100
Hey, that's pretty convenient

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.780
if you don't wanna go install things somehow else.

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:30.500
Although there are downsides.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.980
But it was super easy to get started.

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:35.100
And honestly, it had some really nice output.

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.180
You know, it used the terminal display really well.

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.980
Great integrated progress bars.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.700
And as much as I love me some YouTube DL,

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:42.820
there's kind of a lot going on

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.100
when it's printing all this information.

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.980
And Annie felt a little bit cleaner.

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:47.820
Yep.

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.580
I think the flip side here is Annie's definitely younger

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.380
and not nearly as full featured as YouTube DL.

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.420
I mean, if you've ever looked at the YouTube DL man page

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.940
or just the long help options,

01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:59.980
can do just about everything.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.300
Annie, it's a little more bare bones.

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.100
Yeah, I agree with you though.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.420
I gave it a spin.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.900
I do like the output.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:08.620
It's gonna require you have FFmpeg installed,

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.380
but I'm guessing you already have that.

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.220
And it's quick.

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.860
I think it launches and downloads faster.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.820
Yeah, you know, also it integrates with the tool

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:20.380
I tend to use sometimes for downloading things, ARIA 2.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.220
Now, if you go that route,

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:24.380
you do have to merge the resulting multi-part files yourself.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.500
But hey, FFmpeg's there anyway.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.620
That's right.

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.460
Yep, it's a thing of beauty.

01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:32.380
So if you're jonesing for a YouTube DL alternative

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.820
and YouTube is the primary use case,

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.300
which actually isn't for me, check out Annie.

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.540
We'll have a link in the show notes.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.620
It's hosted up on GitHub for now.

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.460
Geez.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:47.860
Also, I encourage you to join us live next week.

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.420
Join our mumble room, join our chat room,

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:52.260
or just stream along over at jblive.tv.

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:56.460
We do this noon, Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:57.300
See you next week.

01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:00.020
Same bad time, same bad station.

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:01.700
And of course, there is that virtual lug

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:02.540
happening on Sunday.

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:03.860
You get your mumble client set up for that

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.340
and then you might as well come by Tuesday.

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.180
Don't miss it.

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.300
And now go try out Fedora 33.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.020
Let us know how it went.

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.900
Don't forget, you can also join our Telegram group

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.420
if you want to join the conversation after the show.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:17.300
That's at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.500
People are chatting in there 24 seven

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.260
and it gets pretty geeky.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.300
So go get that.

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.620
The show is at Linux Unplugged,

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:27.460
at Linux Unplugged on Twitter, the network's at JupiterSignal.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.220
I'm at Chris LAS.

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:32.700
And check out Wes Payne now on Linux Action News.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.980
Woo, woo, yeah, woo.

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.300
Coming up in your feeds.

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.140
See you back here next Tuesday.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:08:06.140
I'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:27.740
All right, Brent is here with the report.

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.740
Brent, is it snowing in Canada?

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:31.900
Yes, today in the weather it might be cold

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.740
for some of us outside, but it's always warm here

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.220
in the Jupiter Broadcasting Mumble Room.

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:38.260
There you go.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:39.060
There you go.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.500
If you do get cold, you can snuggle up close to Brent.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.180
Works great.

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:43.380
Thank you for the update.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:44.340
You're welcome.

01:08:44.340 --> 01:09:09.580
I'll be back to you.
