WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
All right, I know we're getting a little too excited about NixOS these days,

00:03.400 --> 00:06.900
but I'm really thinking we should switch to Linux from scratch.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.800
Whoa, like build a ground up, like really learn something kind of thing?

00:09.800 --> 00:11.000
Yeah, you know.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.500
That's going to take a lot of time, Wes.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.300
Oh, no, I've got something for you.

00:14.300 --> 00:14.700
Oh, yeah?

00:14.700 --> 00:21.700
Yeah, on our Linux just today, a giant pass script to build Linux from scratch automatically.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.000
You know, it reminds me of that old saying, Wes.

00:24.000 --> 00:33.600
It's my petition. It's how you use it.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.400
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.200
My name is Chris.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.200
My name is Wes.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.300
And my name is Brent.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.000
Hello, gentlemen.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.500
Well, coming up on the show today,

00:43.500 --> 00:47.000
we're going to tell you about how we nearly blew up our matrix server.

00:47.000 --> 00:47.900
Don't worry.

00:47.900 --> 00:51.700
We saved it at the very last minute right before the big stream last week.

00:51.700 --> 00:54.600
We'll share what we messed up, what we learned,

00:54.600 --> 00:58.700
and how we're going to try to build it back better than ever this time.

00:58.700 --> 01:03.800
You know, it's kind of one of those IT War Story shows where we admit that maybe we made a mistake,

01:03.800 --> 01:07.800
plus an unexpected circumstance comes along and it blows up our whole setup.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.900
But we really do kind of have an idea of how to fix it.

01:09.900 --> 01:13.800
And then after we tell you about all that, we'll kick off the next challenge.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.100
Then we'll round out the show with some boosts and picks and a lot more.

01:17.100 --> 01:21.300
So before I get any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to that virtual lug.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.900
Hello, Mumble Room.

01:22.900 --> 01:24.500
Hello, everyone.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.400
How are you?

01:25.400 --> 01:26.300
Hello.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.000
Hello, hello, hello.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.200
Some old friends in there.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.900
We have a whole good group in there.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.800
So, powerful Sunday crew.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.200
Thank you for being here on a Sunday.

01:35.200 --> 01:39.300
Now, I do want to mention we are so close.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.800
This is like your last minute notice.

01:41.800 --> 01:49.400
The April 9th, 2022 Raleigh, North Carolina Meetup is happening next weekend as we record this.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.300
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting refers to the deets.

01:52.300 --> 01:54.300
Cancel your plans, book your flights.

01:54.300 --> 01:58.200
And come with an empty belly because there's a barbecue place.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.100
There is also a brewery.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.900
And do let us know if you're coming so we can warn the restaurant.

02:02.900 --> 02:05.900
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, it gets real close.

02:05.900 --> 02:08.400
And then you won't hear us talking about it anymore.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.800
It's going to be like this era of when we were talking about the East Coast Meetups.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.400
Oh, I'm just getting kind of emotional about it.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.700
But yeah, I think I fly out like Wednesday midday.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.800
Land and record a self-hosted.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.800
Have you packed yet?

02:21.800 --> 02:24.500
No, I did find the luggage though.

02:24.500 --> 02:28.800
But I'm currently doing that whole like, could we get away with one carry on for both of us?

02:28.800 --> 02:34.100
Because the lifestyle, you know, and she's kind of an over packer.

02:34.100 --> 02:35.800
Don't tell her I said that.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.400
She's one of those, you know, we might need.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.400
Well, we might need.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.600
You know what I'm saying?

02:39.600 --> 02:42.500
So, we end up with like a bag of stuff that we might need.

02:42.500 --> 02:47.300
And yeah, I don't think it's going to be one bag, but we'll see.

02:47.300 --> 02:52.200
I'm just thinking like today is going to be a great show because we've got some good community news.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.500
We're going to kick off the next challenge.

02:54.500 --> 03:01.000
We got kind of a come to Jesus moment with our matrix server and no matter how bad we screw up today.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.400
We got a double slow cooked pork shoulder going in the oven right now.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.200
Wes brought like this amazing piece of prize meat.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.000
Did you win that like in a fight or something?

03:10.000 --> 03:14.600
Well, yeah, that's that's also what explains the black guy, but I didn't I didn't really want to tell that story.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.800
Okay, that's fair. That's fair. But I'm looking forward to snacking down on that.

03:17.800 --> 03:18.700
That's going to be really great.

03:18.700 --> 03:21.200
Plus, Wes brought us some ciders.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.600
So we're going to just it's going to be doesn't really doesn't really matter how the show goes, but we'll do our best.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.700
Anyway, I suppose I suppose.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.400
Well, you promised. All right.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.400
All right. Well, let's kick off the community news.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.900
Danny for it joins us from elementary with an update.

03:35.900 --> 03:39.000
Of course, we've kind of been wondering what's going on over there, Danny.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.100
So what is the latest? Yeah, thanks for having me on.

03:43.100 --> 03:48.200
So just kind of in a nutshell, there's been some change ups at elementary, Inc.,

03:48.200 --> 03:52.900
which is the company that kind of supports and funds the elementary open source community.

03:52.900 --> 03:57.000
So these days, it's just me now.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.800
I'm the only employee and owner of the company.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.500
So things are changing a little bit there.

04:04.500 --> 04:11.500
It's been a little bit chaotic, but we just want to make sure everybody knows that like I'm here and things are okay.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.700
And development is still going on.

04:13.700 --> 04:20.000
I have kind of more of a like a lengthy dive into what's going on and what's coming on our YouTube channel,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.700
which is linked from our website, elementary.io for people who are curious to find out more.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.900
Excellent. We will also link to that in the show notes.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.800
Wes and I got to catch a bit of that.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.300
And, you know, I think you just you said a lot of stuff there.

04:32.300 --> 04:36.300
So I think a lot of the details are are kind of pretty well covered.

04:36.300 --> 04:40.800
I was really impressed. You really kind of just laid it all out there and you were really honest about it all.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.900
So why don't we talk about like, you know, where things go now?

04:43.900 --> 04:52.000
Because I think that's what we're all kind of interested in is what the future is and kind of what you might see as short term changes and maybe some long term stuff like what's next?

04:52.000 --> 04:56.800
Yeah, absolutely. I definitely want to focus on the future and what can be done better.

04:56.800 --> 05:06.400
And I think like something that's been huge for me is kind of reevaluating like what is the purpose of the company and its relationship to the community and not only just the elementary community,

05:06.400 --> 05:18.300
but the wider open source community. And something that I really want to get back to that I feel like we used to do a lot more of was more donating to upstream projects and more like funding for developers in the community.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.200
Like, I think GitHub sponsors is a really big opportunity.

05:21.200 --> 05:27.900
So I think like that's kind of the role that I want the company to take is more like a support role.

05:27.900 --> 05:33.200
That's going to be quite the process, right? Because there's probably not like a ton of funds to go around, I would imagine.

05:33.200 --> 05:43.800
So how are you thinking that's going to work? Like, is there going to be some of the income that comes into elementary that's then going to go out to different members that are working on projects that benefit the distribution?

05:43.800 --> 05:46.900
Yeah, I haven't figured out exactly how to split things up yet.

05:46.900 --> 05:54.800
And I definitely want to talk it over with our developer community and find out like what they feel is important to fund and how things should be split up.

05:54.800 --> 06:03.600
But I really want to make giving a bigger part of what the company does and kind of with the downsizing that's happened.

06:03.600 --> 06:17.700
I think that we do have a bit more of an opportunity to make it more so that we're pushing money out into the community and not so much like just funneling money into a for-profit company, you know?

06:17.700 --> 06:21.300
Yeah, I follow you. I do. I think that's a really good goal.

06:21.300 --> 06:28.200
I wonder, is your life expenses going to be covered by that? Because you have to eat, too.

06:28.200 --> 06:37.100
Yeah, I don't think really that I'm going to have to change anything about my employment status or anything with the company.

06:37.100 --> 06:42.800
We kind of already made some budget cuts and stuff towards the end of the year as a response to COVID.

06:42.800 --> 06:50.400
So I think where I'm at right now, I'm comfortable and I'm good. And I think that there's room to do more.

06:50.400 --> 06:55.900
Great. That's exciting. So keep us posted, right? Keep us informed on what's going on.

06:55.900 --> 07:00.600
Keep us up to date on what the new developments are and come on here and share with us when things are moving and shaking.

07:00.600 --> 07:06.900
Yeah, absolutely. And if people want to follow along and like more real time, like elementary.io is always the place to go.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.900
We got a link to our blog there and social media accounts.

07:09.900 --> 07:14.400
Very good. Well, thank you, Danny. Thanks for taking a bit of time to update us and good luck on everything.

07:14.400 --> 07:19.500
We'll be checking in from time to time and trying out new releases as they land and all that kind of stuff.

07:19.500 --> 07:24.400
And looking forward to the future. Thanks. All right.

07:24.400 --> 07:29.900
We will have links in the show notes at Linux Unplugged dot com slash four five two.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.500
Why don't we stay in the ecosystem just for a minute?

07:32.500 --> 07:36.100
I noticed that Chris Davis did a blog post, Chris Davis, a.k.a.

07:36.100 --> 07:44.100
Brain Blasted in the community. Chris calls himself a gnome developer who wants to improve the gnome ecosystem as much as possible.

07:44.100 --> 07:48.200
Kind of appreciate that. Yeah. Currently works on fractal matrix app for gnome,

07:48.200 --> 07:52.100
which I only laugh because we've been talking about it behind the scenes a lot recently.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.000
But I don't know if any of us have tried it.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.300
Yeah. Yeah. It's like next on our list and a few other great apps to like, you know,

07:59.300 --> 08:01.800
whether a couple others you've probably heard of.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.700
But Chris did a post about plans for GNOME 43 and beyond.

08:05.700 --> 08:08.700
And I really like some of the stuff that they're talking about here.

08:08.700 --> 08:13.100
So we've seen the arrival of Libidwaita. I'm sorry, Libidwaita.

08:13.100 --> 08:17.000
We've got to make sure I get that right. And that really created a platform like, you know,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.900
a library that developers could use to create gnome looking applications.

08:20.900 --> 08:25.800
But it also makes it simple to implement some stuff we've been wanting for a long time,

08:25.800 --> 08:32.400
like customizable accent colors, right? Global accent colors that can be opt in for app developers.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.400
Yeah, this is looking really good. They have some screenshots here.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.900
And I think, Wes, the change here is and you probably you could probably tell me if I'm wrong,

08:39.900 --> 08:44.300
but I think the real shift here with this is like this stuff that was being done before

08:44.300 --> 08:48.400
with CSS changes is now getting done via an API.

08:48.400 --> 08:54.500
Yeah, I guess developers using the recoloring API will be able to programmatically change colors

08:54.500 --> 08:58.700
in applications and then have dependent colors update automatically.

08:58.700 --> 09:05.200
So you can create presets which can be used for, say, to recolor the window based on text views color scheme

09:05.200 --> 09:09.800
that you're using somewhere else, right? So the whole window can match whatever you're choosing for your text view.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.100
And I've also seen some suggestions like maybe something's in an administrative state.

09:13.100 --> 09:19.300
So you make the window red. And this API gives you I think it gives you I don't know about more control.

09:19.300 --> 09:23.900
I can't really speak to that, but I think it gives a better end result.

09:23.900 --> 09:29.100
And Chris Davis himself has been working on Loop, which is get ready for this, Wes.

09:29.100 --> 09:33.400
It's an image viewer, but it's written in Rust.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.400
That's right. And GTK4 using LibitWidow.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.700
I don't want that dirty C code to touch my precious JPEGs.

09:39.700 --> 09:45.900
Oh, of course not. No, you need to run to those JPEGs as fast as possible and with as much memory safety as possible.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.400
You know what, though?

09:47.400 --> 09:53.900
We only bring this up because doesn't it feel like we're seeing more and more stuff for GNOME written in Rust?

09:53.900 --> 09:55.800
I mean, it's almost like a meme at this point.

09:55.800 --> 10:01.400
Yeah, I guess there's some some getting to be a battle tested Rust GTK sort of friendship, I guess.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.600
Yeah. Yeah. I like the direction of this stuff.

10:04.600 --> 10:11.500
I have to say one of the things that Chris also wants to work on is the XTG desktop portal file pickers.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.300
Like, how do I say it? So you got a Flatpak application.

10:14.300 --> 10:20.800
It's Sandbox. It's limited right now in how many files it can open that are associated with a file that you want to open.

10:20.800 --> 10:29.200
Another way to say that is let's say you saved out an HTML archive and you've got an HTML file with some images and CSS and stuff like that.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.800
And you open that with a Flatpak application.

10:31.800 --> 10:38.700
Well, you'll maybe be able to open the core document, but all of the associated files like the CSS file and the images folder,

10:38.700 --> 10:42.400
none of that is going to be accessible by that Flatpak application right now.

10:42.400 --> 10:49.500
Right. Or, you know, often you have stuff that has like a project file and then all the resources for that project are kept next to it in the same folder or something.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.800
Right. I'm sure that's super common for IDEs, right?

10:52.800 --> 10:57.900
So Chris wants to fix that. He wants to kind of just change the way that works and make it possible.

10:57.900 --> 11:02.900
Just tweak the portal so that way it's possible for that to actually not be the case.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.500
He also calls out some accessibility fixes.

11:05.500 --> 11:15.500
And the reason why I'm mentioning this is I feel like we have an opportunity here as a community to help Chris because he is currently looking for work.

11:15.500 --> 11:21.700
If you know someone out there that maybe is looking for an employee that would fit these skills, I will have a link in the show notes.

11:21.700 --> 11:31.400
Additionally, Chris has a link to Patreon, GitHub sponsors and PayPal, and there he's just looking for some help to set time aside for these issues.

11:31.400 --> 11:41.600
And what Mr. Davis has done here is essentially zeroed in on what I think are issues that affect real people that use the GNOME desktop.

11:41.600 --> 11:49.700
These are sometimes things that we criticize GNOME about is focusing on things that don't apply to the actual users that are using the desktop

11:49.700 --> 11:55.800
and maybe they're targeting that elusive new user or they're targeting that elusive mobile Linux user.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.800
And I think, you know, you see some of that with Chris is talking about.

11:58.800 --> 12:03.400
He definitely wants to improve some stuff to work better on mobile, but I really don't have issue with that.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.900
Make it work great on both. OK, I'm on board with that. Yeah, right. That's a good compromise.

12:07.900 --> 12:15.400
So I just wanted to call attention to this work. It's a reminder to us that the GNOME community is made up of a lot of viewpoints.

12:15.400 --> 12:20.000
And, you know, I think as we covered this limit way to stuff additionally,

12:20.000 --> 12:25.100
we learned that a lot of times you'll see individuals speak on GNOME's behalf,

12:25.100 --> 12:28.600
but it's actually made up of a lot of individuals with different opinions.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.800
And so we're starting to see a diversity in those opinions now. And I just think that's a great thing.

12:31.800 --> 12:38.500
And I like this goal set here. I'm getting kind of low key excited about the slow progression GNOME is going in.

12:38.500 --> 12:45.900
There's always a couple of trade offs we make, but ultimately after they change something and then they iterate on it,

12:45.900 --> 12:50.900
I think the users end up for the better. I mean, we've gotten to a pretty nice place and I'm excited to see where it goes.

12:50.900 --> 12:54.800
And it's just interesting here to hear someone who clearly is making some changes that we like,

12:54.800 --> 13:00.800
who has shown, you know, skills in doing this work that's saying, if you can offer me some more support community,

13:00.800 --> 13:06.400
I'm willing to keep doing this and to, you know, to do more of it. And so it's a time to reflect on that and what we want.

13:06.400 --> 13:12.400
And Danny, before we jump off of all of this, do you have any thoughts on Lib Adwaita, how it may affect elementary OS and that stuff?

13:12.400 --> 13:17.900
Because that's sort of your neck of the woods to the whole GTK area. Even though you guys don't have GNOME Shell,

13:17.900 --> 13:22.700
you're pretty reliant on the GTK stack. And I got to figure you're looking at this.

13:22.700 --> 13:29.400
Yeah, I mean, so far in porting to GTK4, the changes that were made here have been extremely positive.

13:29.400 --> 13:36.500
Like it's a lot of GNOME design language stuff is no longer in GTK4 and it's in Lib Adwaita.

13:36.500 --> 13:42.600
So this is a huge win for desktops like us or for XFCE that have our own design language.

13:42.600 --> 13:47.700
And we don't have to kind of be pulled along behind the GNOME boat. But for the GNOME community,

13:47.700 --> 13:55.600
I think this is also a huge win for their app developers because GNOME has never really had an official supported theming API.

13:55.600 --> 14:00.600
And with Lib Adwaita, now it does. Yeah, I think it's an adjustment, right? It's not a downgrade.

14:00.600 --> 14:06.600
It's not a bad thing. And I think initially maybe was seen as that. It was seen as the end of theming.

14:06.600 --> 14:12.200
And it's just a change in how theming is done. And I feel like it is a new chapter in the GNOME desktop.

14:12.200 --> 14:17.000
That's we're just arriving there. Like it's the very beginning. It's the very first chapter.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.400
But we're just there. We've just turned the page. It's exciting. 42 is a great release.

14:21.400 --> 14:29.200
43 is going to be a great release. And I'm excited to see how it had distributions like elementary OS and others that are using all those tools.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.400
Embrace it.

14:32.400 --> 14:39.700
Linode.com slash unplug go there partner and get yourself $100 in 60 day credit on your new account and you support this here show.

14:39.700 --> 14:45.000
I don't know. Thank you. I don't know. I don't know. But maybe maybe that guy could do the ad reads from now on, right?

14:45.000 --> 14:49.700
He seems pretty excited. I'll tell you why he's excited about Linode. He's been using it for a while.

14:49.700 --> 14:55.300
You know, he runs his business infrastructure on there. And so he knows you can trust your business infrastructure on there.

14:55.300 --> 15:00.200
But he's also got his kids game servers on there. So like you want to set yourself up like a safe Minecraft server.

15:00.200 --> 15:04.100
Or maybe you want to get yourself, you know, I don't know, a little CSGO action.

15:04.100 --> 15:07.700
I don't know what you do. I don't know. I'm not going to pass judgment.

15:07.700 --> 15:13.200
I'm just saying go to Linode.com slash unplugged, get $100 in credit and support the show.

15:13.200 --> 15:18.000
And they got 11 data centers around the world. And I'll tell you, I don't always pick the right data centers.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.900
And I'm going to own up to that in a little bit. But you can. You can learn from my mistake.

15:22.900 --> 15:29.500
I'm going to use Linode the wrong way so you don't have to. Also, Linode is constantly upgrading their infrastructure.

15:29.500 --> 15:35.300
They got these super fast connections. It's embarrassingly fast coming in 40 gigabit connections coming into their machines.

15:35.300 --> 15:39.500
And they are their own ISP. Then they got new MVME PCIe storage.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.800
And I just learned recently, Wes, a couple of our machines, we get free upgrades.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.300
I thought we're going to have to pay more. Wait, free?

15:45.300 --> 15:51.000
We just go in there. And if you could, if you qualify, you look at your disk and they just got a little button.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.300
You press that button and you just get it. Wow. Maybe I shouldn't be saying this. Maybe it's not true.

15:55.300 --> 15:58.500
I don't know. But it is online. And I'm pushing that button. Let me tell you.

15:58.500 --> 16:02.400
The button says upgrade. Yeah, I'm pushing that button, Wes. I love that button.

16:02.400 --> 16:06.800
And I love their object storage. This is my new, like, I don't know what I'm going to do with all this stuff,

16:06.800 --> 16:11.700
but I don't want to store it on this particular machine. So I put it in object storage and it's been working so good.

16:11.700 --> 16:17.900
Everything gets its own addressable URL. It works super easy with their uploader or their CLI client that I use to upload it.

16:17.900 --> 16:21.900
Because their CLI client is easy, too. The whole thing is ridiculously simple.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.200
You don't even have to be like a server expert to figure this stuff out.

16:24.200 --> 16:28.200
But if you are, you're going to be impressed with the power that they let you get to if you need to.

16:28.200 --> 16:33.900
I'm talking like they'll even give you guides to, like, take one of their rigs, wipe off their image and put NixOS on there.

16:33.900 --> 16:40.000
If you're that kind of maniac, they'll do it with you. I've done it before. Don't threaten me. I'll do it again.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.800
I'll do it. Don't challenge me on this. I'll tell you what, go try it for yourself and see what we're talking about.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.400
Go see why Wes spins up his stuff over there. He's spinning up servers all the time.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.000
You'd think he's like some sort of DJ spinning the tracks.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.300
Yeah. I don't listen to music. I just listen to that web UI.

16:54.300 --> 16:59.900
That's right. That's right. And that awesome... What do you have, keyboard? The Coder keyboard or whatever it is?

16:59.900 --> 17:01.200
Yeah. Code keyboard?

17:01.200 --> 17:07.700
Code keyboard. Yeah, that's right. Sitting there on calls with Wes, clack clack clack clack clack as he's setting up the Linux.

17:07.700 --> 17:12.700
It's like how I know he's doing something actually. But, you know, it's a great thing is we all can use it, right?

17:12.700 --> 17:14.800
Wes can over there, you know, he's fine. He's using it, right?

17:14.800 --> 17:19.100
But, you know, I can stumble my way through it too and act like I'm an expert as well because it's pretty straightforward.

17:19.100 --> 17:23.500
And they got great documentation and just the best damn customer service in the world.

17:23.500 --> 17:27.300
That's what I hear all the time from the audience. So go try it out with a hundred dollars and support the show.

17:27.300 --> 17:34.400
linode.com slash unplugged. That's linode.com slash unplugged.

17:34.400 --> 17:48.700
Just about two years ago, we launched the Jupiter Colony Matrix server as something of a living experiment, let's say, here on the show.

17:48.700 --> 17:59.000
And since we spent the last week pulling that same server back from the brink, we thought it best to share what we screwed up.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.800
What we've learned and there's a lot and how we're going to try to build things back a little better.

18:04.800 --> 18:10.900
That's right. We did mess up. We messed up bad. I acknowledge it. Sometimes we get these wild ideas.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.700
Yeah, a little maybe a little over our head.

18:12.700 --> 18:22.900
We think what could go wrong? And then we realize we've stumbled into something that is old school complicated, not new school complicated, old school complicated.

18:22.900 --> 18:26.800
That's all right. That's my power zone. I can deal with that.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.200
I didn't realize I was signing up to manage an exchange server, but that's what I'm doing.

18:30.200 --> 18:33.600
Basically, if you know, if you're an old IT guy, you know what managing an exchange server is like.

18:33.600 --> 18:38.200
That's what managing a Synapse server is. So maybe some terminology just that way.

18:38.200 --> 18:45.600
We're all on the same page keys right now. Matrix is actually the protocol like HTTP is right.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.700
So you've got Matrix, which is a protocol element.

18:48.700 --> 18:51.900
The chat client is like a front end. It's like your web browser.

18:51.900 --> 18:57.100
There's multiple front ends, elements probably the most feature rich. And then there's Synapse.

18:57.100 --> 19:02.000
Synapse is the back end matrix server that we're using. Dendrites is another one.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
Is there other? I don't know. But Synapse is the one that's deployed any kind of scale.

19:06.000 --> 19:12.500
Yeah, you know, and that's kind of been the one that the team behind Matrix have been using as like the sort of primary implementation development stuff.

19:12.500 --> 19:16.500
And, you know, Dendrites is a new implementation but hasn't necessarily caught up on all the features,

19:16.500 --> 19:22.600
which kind of right now, after they go through that, you know, the RFC kind of process, then they're kind of usually first implemented in Synapse.

19:22.600 --> 19:27.200
And I guess the sales pitch, the short sales pitch for Matrix, if you're not really familiar with it,

19:27.200 --> 19:35.300
is it's a decentralized federated chat system that supports direct encrypted communications and public chat rooms.

19:35.300 --> 19:42.000
And it features a lot of the same kind of nice to haves that your Mattermost, your Slacks, your Discords have.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.100
You can have a server with multiple channels. You can paste a GIF or a GIF.

19:47.100 --> 19:50.500
I don't care what you call it. You can paste it in there. It'll display it.

19:50.500 --> 19:55.800
You know, image previews, kind of the rich like chat features you get from a modern chat system.

19:55.800 --> 20:00.700
They're all in Matrix, a lot like how Discord does it, but one that you can self-host

20:00.700 --> 20:07.500
and one where you could say create an account on Matrix.org and then join our Matrix server where you'd find all our rooms and stuff. It's great.

20:07.500 --> 20:12.600
Yeah, you know, I mean, instead of a sort of proprietary implementation or even just a particular implementation here,

20:12.600 --> 20:18.400
you've got something that has a generic protocol and has a spec and then can have a plethora of clients.

20:18.400 --> 20:24.600
And yeah, you've got that old school internet feeling like with email where you don't have to go through some, you know, some gatekeeper.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.300
You can just say, yeah, I want to have a home server.

20:27.300 --> 20:31.500
And then you can start participating with our home server, with the main one, with any of them.

20:31.500 --> 20:37.600
Yeah, and I want to make it clear what we are about to tell you would not be a problem if it's you

20:37.600 --> 20:40.500
and like a handful of people using the Matrix server.

20:40.500 --> 20:44.600
You could probably run it on a Raspberry Pi and you'd be happy, right?

20:44.600 --> 20:50.600
What we're about to tell you is a journey you go through when you start with like a hundred users

20:50.600 --> 20:57.600
and then you got nearly 3000 users and just like all of the things that change when that happens.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.800
That's what we're going to talk about today.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.700
So our initial deployment was a bit anemic.

21:01.700 --> 21:02.400
It was basic.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.700
You know, we were just really wanting to get some hands-on experience.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.800
So that way we could talk somewhat intelligently about it on the show.

21:08.800 --> 21:15.400
I thought we had so much to learn, but we initially deployed a four-core Linode box with eight gigs of RAM

21:15.400 --> 21:20.400
and like, you know, a fair amount of, I don't know, 150 gigs of local SSD.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.300
It wasn't a lot.

21:21.300 --> 21:22.100
Yeah, again, right?

21:22.100 --> 21:24.700
Like when we just did it kind of simply because we'd been talking about Matrix.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.700
We obviously thought it was cool and it felt like, okay, well, if one of the things is about that, you know,

21:28.700 --> 21:32.000
that we highlight about this is that it's open source and you can run it yourself,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.400
we better run it ourselves to just try it.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.600
So we just went with like a super simple Docker compose setup, which was just two containers, right?

21:38.600 --> 21:42.600
Like we got Postgres for the database and we've got the Synapse container,

21:42.600 --> 21:46.900
just the, you know, the one right from stock upstream running the main Python application.

21:46.900 --> 21:49.100
This is the good and bad about things in containers, too.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.200
It's not about the technology.

21:50.200 --> 21:53.900
It's like it does enable you to quickly get up and get running,

21:53.900 --> 21:59.900
but it's not necessarily configuring the most optimal situation for a high-demand production use.

21:59.900 --> 22:02.200
And you just have to kind of be aware of that.

22:02.200 --> 22:08.200
And, you know, this was fine two years ago when we maybe, you know, after a year had 300 people on there.

22:08.200 --> 22:14.400
It was getting a little bit slow, but as long as West logged in from time to time and made sure the disk wasn't filling up,

22:14.400 --> 22:15.400
we were okay.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.100
Yeah, you know, did our updates.

22:18.100 --> 22:21.600
I got to say that really like the upgrading process has always been nice.

22:21.600 --> 22:25.900
They've got great, you know, release notes that kind of call out if there are things that they're making breaking changes.

22:25.900 --> 22:28.800
And other than that, you just update the tag on the Docker image and away you go.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.200
So that's that part's been nice.

22:30.200 --> 22:35.900
Yeah, and solid updates like they're almost always introducing something that Weston are like, oh, that's worth an upgrade.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.700
Yeah, they've been really good about that.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.400
And dendrites moving along really well, too.

22:39.400 --> 22:45.100
But Synapse legitimately has been making solid improvements nearly every time we want to do an update.

22:45.100 --> 22:47.000
So they really hadn't been too bad.

22:47.000 --> 22:53.900
But over the last 10 months or so, the matrix colony has grown.

22:53.900 --> 22:57.800
In fact, I would say even kind of like at the beginning of the year or so, I wasn't really sure.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.000
Like, are we going to keep running this matrix thing?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.700
It's kind of becoming a pain in the butt.

23:02.700 --> 23:05.900
I think I grassed about it on air once, you know, you know, maybe.

23:05.900 --> 23:14.200
Yeah, well, we were just that was the first steps of us realizing that we either need to decide to like commit to this or rethink our involvement with it

23:14.200 --> 23:19.300
because it is with the size that it had become, it did take some resources.

23:19.300 --> 23:25.600
I do like to take a think about it because we kind of haphazardly just implemented Discord a few years ago.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.700
And I think we're still kind of dealing with the consequences of that.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.800
So I thought, you know, we'll take it slow with matrix.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.100
We'll see where this goes.

23:32.100 --> 23:36.800
And then when it started to get to this pain in the ass stage, I thought, I really haven't made up my mind.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.100
I really haven't committed to this yet.

23:39.100 --> 23:44.100
You know what I actually think things really kind of changed, to tell you the truth, is when the whole free node thing went down.

23:44.100 --> 23:51.000
Hmm. And then all of a sudden, a lot of the projects that we like to communicate with started popping up on matrix.

23:51.000 --> 23:58.200
And I think that particular instance also made people realize how nice it was to have something that could be decentralized.

23:58.200 --> 24:03.600
So projects can run their own instance, but still participate in the overall network.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.300
You know, I'm on a Red Hat instance. I'm on a GNOME instance.

24:06.300 --> 24:12.700
I'm on a bunch of other projects servers, but I do it from the JB server.

24:12.700 --> 24:16.200
And then it just kind of started accelerating in about three months or so.

24:16.200 --> 24:21.300
It just really kind of started growing a lot. It picked up and that's awesome.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.600
And there's a really cool decentralized community growing on there.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.000
And as a result, I've been spending a lot more time on there.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.200
And I realized this is there's a lot of really good conversations.

24:30.200 --> 24:35.600
People are kind because it's still in that kind of phase where it's not huge, you know,

24:35.600 --> 24:39.200
but it's also big enough that there's always some conversation going on.

24:39.200 --> 24:43.000
And then that room aspect of it kind of breaks things up.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
Yeah, yeah, you know, we've got there's different communities that can all kind of flourish there,

24:47.000 --> 24:51.100
but it still has that you have to opt in kind of functionality because, you know,

24:51.100 --> 24:54.500
you already you might already have slack or telegram because of your friends or for work or something.

24:54.500 --> 24:58.400
But if you don't do an open source things, you probably don't yet have elements.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.000
So you have to you don't want to be there.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.300
And it's, you know, not a great process to get on board,

25:04.300 --> 25:07.100
especially if you want to on board directly to our server.

25:07.100 --> 25:10.000
You have to like change defaults on the on the login screen.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.800
It's just not like as great.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.400
And I know it's a little confusing, right?

25:13.400 --> 25:16.400
Like if you're not familiar, you have to figure out what a home server is

25:16.400 --> 25:20.400
and then figure out which one might be right for you or where it makes sense to go do that.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.600
Right, right.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.100
Yeah. Do you want to host your own thing?

25:23.100 --> 25:24.400
You want to just join matrix.org?

25:24.400 --> 25:27.600
You want to set up an account on the JB system, right?

25:27.600 --> 25:30.300
No, it's it's kind of like when you start with Linux,

25:30.300 --> 25:33.900
you got to pick a distro and sometimes people just get stuck there.

25:33.900 --> 25:37.200
But over the last few months, it seemed like people are moving over.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.700
They were trying it out.

25:38.700 --> 25:43.600
And then within the last literally like the last since the last time we did the show,

25:43.600 --> 25:46.700
we realized the load was getting way too damn high.

25:46.700 --> 25:50.800
And then one morning I woke up to a telegram message that said,

25:50.800 --> 25:52.400
I think the matrix server is down.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.200
I'm not sure if the matrix server is up.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.300
Can you check on that?

25:56.300 --> 25:58.100
And sure enough, it was.

25:58.100 --> 26:03.400
And I realized pretty quickly that we had used up all of the available disk on that system.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.400
Sure had.

26:05.400 --> 26:14.000
That basically kicked off a series of nights of Wes burning the midnight oil to try to rescue the matrix server.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.100
And him and I doing like emergency preparations to like maybe migrate a server

26:19.100 --> 26:23.100
or like spin something up entirely and all this kinds of stuff that we had to do.

26:23.100 --> 26:26.700
Some of it was fun. Some of it was a bit hectic.

26:26.700 --> 26:30.500
But we realized, I think probably what by day two,

26:30.500 --> 26:33.900
we're probably going to have to just totally rebuild the way we've implemented this

26:33.900 --> 26:38.200
if we really want to scale it to like maybe 10,000 plus users.

26:38.200 --> 26:43.900
Yeah, we'd been kind of interested in utilizing the new worker system that Synapse has added

26:43.900 --> 26:47.900
so that you can kind of deconstruct it from just this one monolith Python application

26:47.900 --> 26:51.200
to have that work shared across different processes.

26:51.200 --> 26:55.200
But that takes some plumbing because now you're taking that system apart

26:55.200 --> 26:58.600
and it needs abilities to be able to coordinate between the workers

26:58.600 --> 27:01.400
and you have to add Redis to the system, none of which is super hard,

27:01.400 --> 27:05.700
but it just, you know, it has its own particular setup and we're not developing this

27:05.700 --> 27:07.100
and we haven't gone down that path before.

27:07.100 --> 27:10.100
So it was just a new, you know, several new docs pages to reads

27:10.100 --> 27:14.800
and get familiar with while having it on a live system that we were hoping to,

27:14.800 --> 27:18.200
you know, not totally break after we just got it back online.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.400
And of course, this all starts happening.

27:20.400 --> 27:23.700
We really realized Tuesday, this is really screwed.

27:23.700 --> 27:26.100
The system's really screwed up now.

27:26.100 --> 27:29.300
The problem was like it was down for a while.

27:29.300 --> 27:33.700
And then when we brought it back up to sync with the rest of the Federation,

27:33.700 --> 27:35.800
essentially matched the server out.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.600
And then the other problem we discovered was that when a user would log in

27:38.600 --> 27:42.500
and sync all of the rooms, a single login session of a single user

27:42.500 --> 27:48.000
on a 2,000 user system would peg the system to 100%.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.600
We also realized pretty quickly that while we had thrown more hardware at this

27:52.600 --> 27:55.200
because we thought that's going to solve the problem.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.900
We'll just throw hardware at it.

27:56.900 --> 27:59.100
So we upped it from four cores to six cores.

27:59.100 --> 28:03.900
We went from eight gigs to 16 gigs and we sliced off another set of storage.

28:03.900 --> 28:07.300
It's like the third time we'd sliced off more storage at this point.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.600
And we figured that'll fix it.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.900
But we discovered by default Synapse is kind of,

28:12.900 --> 28:14.900
well, it's sort of silly single threaded.

28:14.900 --> 28:17.200
It's kind of amazing how single threaded it is.

28:17.200 --> 28:21.200
And so you can throw six cores at it, but that doesn't matter

28:21.200 --> 28:25.600
because it's using one core unless you do this worker thing.

28:25.600 --> 28:29.200
So that was really our realization is okay.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.100
All right, let's get this thing to a stage.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.800
That way it survives the live event on Thursday.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.000
Yeah, because of course, we just started to push people

28:36.000 --> 28:37.700
towards using the matrix server, right?

28:37.700 --> 28:39.000
That was part of the live stream.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.600
Let's get people to sign up for matrix.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.000
And now here the matrix server has fallen over.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.200
So you banged out like a couple of generic workers is I think what they're called.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.400
Yeah, you know, they can kind of just do anything

28:49.400 --> 28:52.000
and then there's some more support you can split things out further.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.100
We haven't yet walked down that path, probably something we want to try.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.900
Still more reading to do really, but this was just an attempt to like,

28:57.900 --> 29:00.300
okay, well, yeah, maybe we can split off some of the stuff.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.800
You can do some of the, you know, responding to the Federation events

29:02.800 --> 29:04.400
and syncing there and then we can have some other things

29:04.400 --> 29:06.000
that are handling interacting with the clients.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.400
Just try to keep those a little more responsive.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.400
And it seems like it's worked.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.800
It's not, it's still not great.

29:10.800 --> 29:13.800
It's not where I think any of us want the server to be in terms of responsiveness,

29:13.800 --> 29:16.300
but I think it's been usable at least.

29:16.300 --> 29:19.100
Yeah, it's still a little, it's still a little slow, but it's usable.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.600
And we want to work on that.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.900
We have and we what we realized too is sort of our hodgepodge approach

29:23.900 --> 29:28.100
of adding disk sort of randomly at the machine various like local disk

29:28.100 --> 29:32.100
and network disk and object store all these random mixes of disks.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.400
Well, we were constrained by the lowest common denominator.

29:34.400 --> 29:38.100
So our disk throughput was essentially completely pegged.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.200
We were maxing out our disk IO.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.300
We were single threaded on the core and because we had been down for a while

29:44.300 --> 29:47.300
because we had used up all the disk from storage.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.300
It was a nightmare while that thing synced back up.

29:49.300 --> 29:53.200
It just completely slammed the box as people were trying to sign on all of that.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.700
So we realized we got to do this worker thing.

29:55.700 --> 29:58.300
We got to readdress the disk situation.

29:58.300 --> 30:00.700
We kind of started making a list of stuff.

30:00.700 --> 30:04.300
And also I'm told Wes that version three of the sync protocol

30:04.300 --> 30:07.400
is going to be lighter weight and faster and it's close.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.700
So we're going to get a little assist.

30:08.700 --> 30:11.100
That's the nice thing to hear is they are making improvements

30:11.100 --> 30:12.900
as we try to make improvements.

30:12.900 --> 30:15.000
To their credit they really have like I remember, you know,

30:15.000 --> 30:18.100
maybe six months or a year ago we would often have issues

30:18.100 --> 30:19.300
with the memory use of Synapse.

30:19.300 --> 30:22.900
Just over time it would slowly between it and the way it was kind of using Postgres

30:22.900 --> 30:25.300
like the system would just really eat RAM.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.600
That doesn't happen anymore.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.700
Yeah, that's true.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.600
That has gotten better.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.100
So that's nice to see.

30:31.100 --> 30:36.300
Also, I got to admit because this was a test that we were doing for the show.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.700
We deployed this system in California.

30:38.700 --> 30:42.500
It's quite close to us, but maybe not the rest of y'all.

30:42.500 --> 30:46.200
Not for an international audience, not the best location for it.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.900
Maybe not the worst, but not the best.

30:47.900 --> 30:50.300
So I think, you know, one of the things we would do differently now

30:50.300 --> 30:54.600
is we would deploy to a centralized data center

30:54.600 --> 30:57.800
and we would kind of look at some of our options here.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.900
And I think when you consider all the improvements we could make

31:00.900 --> 31:05.700
for a large-scale implementation, one would be better utilize the workers,

31:05.700 --> 31:07.500
go even further with that.

31:07.500 --> 31:12.400
Each major like functionality aspect of the backend Synapse server

31:12.400 --> 31:13.400
can be handled by a worker.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.900
And some of them, it's like one worker to handle like presence.

31:15.900 --> 31:17.300
That's a worker, right?

31:17.300 --> 31:20.800
But something like Federation Sync, that's like 10 different workers

31:20.800 --> 31:24.500
you can set up each with their own individual config file

31:24.500 --> 31:26.700
and NGINX rules you may or may not have to set up.

31:26.700 --> 31:27.200
Yeah, right.

31:27.200 --> 31:30.300
Because you might want to start setting up NGINX load balancing

31:30.300 --> 31:33.100
or you use Regex to direct some traffic to the worker

31:33.100 --> 31:34.300
that's going to handle that traffic.

31:34.300 --> 31:37.900
So there's just a little lots of moving pieces to reconfigure.

31:37.900 --> 31:39.500
This is about the time I realized, you know,

31:39.500 --> 31:41.900
I should have just contacted the folks at EMS and just said,

31:41.900 --> 31:44.300
hey, would you like to sponsor a few episodes and in trade,

31:44.300 --> 31:46.000
just host our Matrix community?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.800
Because I'd like this to be faster for people.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.000
I'd like it to be a nice experience with Matrix.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
And we are not experienced Matrix admins or Synapse admins by any stretch.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.300
We've just kind of realized we need to take it more seriously.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.900
And so we've thought, well, how would we build this better

31:58.900 --> 32:00.200
if we were going to redeploy it?

32:00.200 --> 32:03.500
And I think one of the things we're going to do is experiment

32:03.500 --> 32:07.400
with the NixOS build, kind of in theme right now,

32:07.400 --> 32:11.200
as a way to kind of learn the edges of this thing,

32:11.200 --> 32:14.000
to see if we could build something with multiple workers out of the box

32:14.000 --> 32:19.800
and something that uses a centralized data center with MVME storage, right?

32:19.800 --> 32:22.800
Just one pool of big MVME storage.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.400
And maybe something that collects metrics out of the box,

32:25.400 --> 32:28.300
because you discovered there's actually quite a bit of information

32:28.300 --> 32:31.400
we could be getting from the system to better understand what it's doing.

32:31.400 --> 32:35.000
Yeah, you can have Synapse submit Prometheus metrics, which is great.

32:35.000 --> 32:35.800
So we've turned that on.

32:35.800 --> 32:39.000
We just need to start sucking it up and throw it in some dashboards.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.100
Yeah, so that's something we want to play around with.

32:41.100 --> 32:46.900
And maybe inevitably we decide, OK, NixOS, this isn't the way to go.

32:46.900 --> 32:49.900
Let's go with this community ansible solution, because that's pretty popular.

32:49.900 --> 32:50.600
Yeah, definitely.

32:50.600 --> 32:54.100
And I think even regardless if you use it or use pieces of it,

32:54.100 --> 32:59.300
it's an awesome store of community knowledge around how to admin a Synapse box.

32:59.300 --> 33:03.600
And it's got pointers to tools, like there's an admin web UI you can use.

33:03.600 --> 33:07.100
It's got notes on database maintenance, which is another area I think

33:07.100 --> 33:10.700
we need to spend some time either deciding how much history we're going to keep

33:10.700 --> 33:15.200
for some of these rooms or spending some time compressing past state events.

33:15.200 --> 33:18.700
There's just one of the things we run into was our database was getting larger

33:18.700 --> 33:24.500
than we expected, and Synapse really needs it to be pretty fast if you want good latency.

33:24.500 --> 33:25.900
Yeah, that's tricky.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.100
That is something we'll have to figure out, too.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.900
And we want everyone's input on all of this.

33:29.900 --> 33:31.200
We're going to collect your feedback.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.800
We do have a matrix ideas room on our matrix server,

33:33.800 --> 33:35.600
which will be linked in the show notes.

33:35.600 --> 33:40.500
But if you go on the colony.jupyterbroadcasting.com matrix server, you'll find it.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.400
I'm picturing maybe a future build.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.900
Maybe it's NixOS based.

33:43.900 --> 33:45.500
Maybe it's not.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.600
It's NVMe storage.

33:46.600 --> 33:47.900
It's centralized data center.

33:47.900 --> 33:52.600
And maybe it uses object storage for like the image files and video files

33:52.600 --> 33:54.600
that people upload to the matrix chat.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.700
Yeah, that seems pretty reasonable.

33:55.700 --> 33:56.500
I could see something like that.

33:56.500 --> 33:59.500
Just something that we could build that we know could run for a while.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.800
I think six cores and 16 gigs of RAM so far has been sufficient.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.900
I feel like once we optimize the Synapse configuration,

34:05.900 --> 34:07.800
that's plenty of hardware to throw at this.

34:07.800 --> 34:08.800
Yeah, that was the other part, too.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.200
You know, we got the default working Synapse.

34:11.200 --> 34:12.600
Like, oh, hey, look, it works.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.300
It's doing federation rate.

34:14.300 --> 34:14.800
Cool.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.100
And then we had not done performance tuning.

34:17.100 --> 34:18.700
So we've also turned off presence.

34:18.700 --> 34:19.900
Maybe we should never have had it on.

34:19.900 --> 34:20.700
I don't know.

34:20.700 --> 34:22.200
People have thoughts about that, too, maybe.

34:22.200 --> 34:23.900
Yeah, matrix ideas room.

34:23.900 --> 34:25.600
That'll be linked in the show notes.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.900
Go over there and let us know what you think.

34:26.900 --> 34:29.000
Because we're kind of putting all this together right now.

34:29.000 --> 34:29.700
The system's up.

34:29.700 --> 34:30.600
It's running.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.700
It just doesn't perform at the level we

34:32.700 --> 34:35.000
would like, but we're tweaking it.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.400
And then we're going to eventually probably migrate it

34:37.400 --> 34:41.000
to some new ultimate matrix server.

34:41.000 --> 34:41.800
Right?

34:41.800 --> 34:42.900
Doesn't that seem like the plan?

34:42.900 --> 34:43.900
Yeah, I think so.

34:43.900 --> 34:46.800
And just another reason, maybe the other part

34:46.800 --> 34:49.000
we're kind of experimenting with here is maybe

34:49.000 --> 34:50.900
you want your own home server, if you're

34:50.900 --> 34:53.500
into that kind of thing, rather than signing up for ours.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.200
That's true.

34:54.200 --> 34:55.800
And you won't run into any of these problems

34:55.800 --> 34:58.300
if it's just you and a couple of friends or just yourself.

34:58.300 --> 35:02.000
Like, you really would not have any of these issues.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.700
It's just when you have thousands of users

35:03.700 --> 35:05.300
and they're always on there 24-7.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.900
And then, like a jackass, you hold a live stream

35:07.900 --> 35:09.500
where you tell everyone to go sign up

35:09.500 --> 35:11.000
for your matrix server the very week

35:11.000 --> 35:13.200
that it's collapsing under its own weight.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.100
And then, of course, make us all have to work super overtime

35:16.100 --> 35:18.500
so that way we can at least get it working and functional

35:18.500 --> 35:22.200
so that way the live stream isn't a total disaster.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.500
Which it still was touch and go.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.200
There were moments the server barely made it.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.200
Yeah.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.200
It was definitely a lag in there for a while.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.000
But, hey, conversations happened.

35:31.000 --> 35:31.900
And sats were given.

35:31.900 --> 35:32.800
And sats were given.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.100
Speaking of that, that live stream

35:38.100 --> 35:42.300
is posted at xers.show slash 84.

35:42.300 --> 35:46.600
Brent did the yeoman's work of trying to quickly collect up

35:46.600 --> 35:48.300
everyone's Lightning payment addresses

35:48.300 --> 35:49.500
and paste them in the doc.

35:49.500 --> 35:50.400
Nice work, sir.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.500
I think we did OK.

35:51.500 --> 35:52.500
I think we hit everybody.

35:52.500 --> 35:56.000
But hopefully, we're crossing fingers.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.500
And then Wes had to turn it into a battle

35:58.500 --> 36:01.700
when he tried to boost people before I could boost people.

36:01.700 --> 36:02.200
Yeah.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.400
So the sats were flying.

36:04.400 --> 36:05.000
I love this.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.300
We gave away 60 unique Lightning donations,

36:08.300 --> 36:11.100
usually around 1,000 or 2,000 sats each.

36:11.100 --> 36:14.200
And we gave them to 42 different individuals on the live stream.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.100
32 new people, at least by our count,

36:16.100 --> 36:17.400
signed up for our matrix chat.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.900
Although the great thing is those numbers continue

36:19.900 --> 36:21.200
to roll over the weekend.

36:21.200 --> 36:22.400
They've gone up.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.500
We featured an interview with the Fountain FM developer,

36:25.500 --> 36:26.000
Oscar.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.400
That's in the live stream.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.800
We also covered some JB projects that the three of us

36:29.800 --> 36:30.500
are working on.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.600
That's all in there.

36:31.600 --> 36:36.000
Extras.show slash 84, if you'd like to participate in that.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
And if you'd like to send us one of them boosts

36:38.000 --> 36:40.900
that we talk about all the time, go grab a new podcast app

36:40.900 --> 36:43.100
at newpodcastapps.com.

36:43.100 --> 36:44.800
Then get yourself set up with something

36:44.800 --> 36:46.600
like Blue Wallet or Strike.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.800
Grab a few sats.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.500
Stuff them in your Lightning wallet.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.500
Boost away.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.700
That's how you do it.

36:51.700 --> 36:52.500
newpodcastapps.com.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.600
All right, guys.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.900
I think we waited long enough.

36:58.900 --> 37:00.600
People want to know about this NixOS challenge.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.400
We're going to put the details in the show notes.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.900
So if you miss any of this, hopefully

37:03.900 --> 37:05.700
we'll have it listed there.

37:05.700 --> 37:09.200
But it is time to officially kick off the Nix challenge

37:09.200 --> 37:10.300
with some goals.

37:10.300 --> 37:13.000
Number one, study the Nix expression language.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.300
Number two, set up at least one Nix or NixOS system,

37:17.300 --> 37:19.200
because Nix is also a package manager available

37:19.200 --> 37:20.800
for your current distro.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.700
Install HTOP using Nix.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.100
And then join our Nix Nerds Matrix channel.

37:26.100 --> 37:26.700
Come in there.

37:26.700 --> 37:27.800
Tell us how it's going.

37:27.800 --> 37:28.800
Tell us how you're doing.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.500
Share all that kind of stuff.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.000
And then last but not least, post a screenshot

37:33.000 --> 37:36.300
of either HTOP or, for extra nerd points,

37:36.300 --> 37:39.700
a full working graphical desktop over on our GitHub, which we

37:39.700 --> 37:42.000
will have linked in the show notes.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.400
The idea is, the challenge is to complete all of that

37:45.400 --> 37:47.500
by the end of April.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.500
At the end of the month, we'll do a review

37:49.500 --> 37:51.900
of how it went for everybody, the moments that stand out

37:51.900 --> 37:55.900
to us, and what our plans are as a team to keep using Nix

37:55.900 --> 37:59.100
or not, and what we're going to deploy with all of that.

37:59.100 --> 38:00.500
I challenge thee.

38:03.700 --> 38:05.700
So you've been officially challenged,

38:05.700 --> 38:07.200
and Brent's already all in.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.700
You've created a GitHub for people

38:08.700 --> 38:10.400
to use where they can post screenshots and stuff.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.500
Tell us a bit about that.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.900
Yeah, we kind of put together some ideas

38:13.900 --> 38:15.800
to post a bunch of screenshots there,

38:15.800 --> 38:17.600
instead of necessarily the matrix room,

38:17.600 --> 38:18.900
because then we could just review them all.

38:18.900 --> 38:20.600
It's actually really fun, and there

38:20.600 --> 38:23.600
are discussions happening with each screenshot

38:23.600 --> 38:25.400
as well, which I find really great.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.000
So we set up the GitHub's discussions,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
which is actually super useful for this.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.500
But bonus, and I might not have told you guys this,

38:32.500 --> 38:35.700
I also set up a section to share some config files

38:35.700 --> 38:37.000
and discuss them as well.

38:37.000 --> 38:37.600
Great idea.

38:37.600 --> 38:38.500
Excellent.

38:38.500 --> 38:41.000
And also some resources that people

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
are finding really handy.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.800
So there's some activity happening there.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.500
I think if you're familiar with GitHub,

38:46.500 --> 38:48.700
that's a really natural place to have these discussions.

38:48.700 --> 38:51.200
If you're not familiar with GitHub, like me,

38:51.200 --> 38:52.200
great way to learn.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.000
This is just like the perfect opportunity

38:54.000 --> 38:57.100
if you've ever been tempted by the idea of trying out Nix.

38:57.100 --> 38:58.800
We're doing it here with you.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.000
The goal is pretty doable.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.300
You just got to get Htop going.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.800
And we've got the matrix community and the GitHub

39:03.800 --> 39:05.200
as resources.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.900
And the people in the matrix community

39:06.900 --> 39:09.000
have been so awesome about answering questions

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
and helping people figure out and get their heads

39:11.000 --> 39:11.800
wrapped around this.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.000
Yeah, I've been really impressed by that.

39:13.000 --> 39:13.800
So good.

39:13.800 --> 39:14.800
It's a real nice thing.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.600
And if you're not sure if you want to try out Nix,

39:16.600 --> 39:19.200
just ask yourself, would you like a totally deterministic

39:19.200 --> 39:20.300
Linux box?

39:20.300 --> 39:21.300
It's always this way.

39:21.300 --> 39:22.200
It's a static thing.

39:22.200 --> 39:25.400
When an update changes, it rebuilds, and it tests.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.400
And you can roll back if things don't work.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.500
Think about how powerful that could

39:28.500 --> 39:29.900
be in a production environment.

39:29.900 --> 39:33.700
I'm picturing studio machines running Nix OS that's rock

39:33.700 --> 39:34.200
solid.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.600
If some update comes along and it screws something up

39:36.600 --> 39:40.000
before a damn show, we can just roll back and just kick it

39:40.000 --> 39:41.600
and do the show and not worry about it

39:41.600 --> 39:43.200
and fix the problem afterwards.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.300
I like that you're still not willing not to do updates

39:45.300 --> 39:46.200
right before the show.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.200
You're just trying to play it around that.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.800
No, I'm doing updates.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.800
There's a red dot in the system tray.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.100
I got to do the update.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.200
It's got a number on it.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.400
So there's a bunch of them, Wes.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.000
I cannot do the update.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.200
What am I, an animal?

39:59.200 --> 40:01.700
And so from time to time, we're going to do the check-in.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.600
It is a month-long challenge.

40:03.600 --> 40:04.800
So really, I mean, come on.

40:04.800 --> 40:05.800
You can spin up a VM.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.700
You can go get a Leno going.

40:07.700 --> 40:08.400
Just try it out.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.000
Try it out.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.600
And then let us know how it goes.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.900
And we'll kind of check in from time to time

40:11.900 --> 40:14.200
because we're going to be traveling next weekend.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.600
I mean, we'll probably be still talking about Nix.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.400
So we all collect links throughout the week

40:19.400 --> 40:20.000
for this show.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.800
And literally, the only thing we collected this week

40:22.800 --> 40:25.900
was Nix links and some matrix links, obviously,

40:25.900 --> 40:27.000
because we were dealing with matrix.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.800
But it's like, we are just obviously going

40:28.800 --> 40:30.900
to be thinking about this and talking about this.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.300
But we'll check in.

40:32.300 --> 40:34.100
And just to point out, too, if you

40:34.100 --> 40:35.700
don't want to go the full Nix OS yet,

40:35.700 --> 40:36.900
you don't have a spare system.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.300
You don't have a VPS or a VM around,

40:39.300 --> 40:41.400
you can install Nix on any old Linux box you got.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.900
Just start with that, and you can install Htop from there.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.000
Could just be a great way to manage software

40:46.000 --> 40:48.100
on distribution that you already use.

40:48.100 --> 40:50.300
Maybe a new way to solve that problem.

40:50.300 --> 40:54.700
So the Nix challenge has officially begun.

40:54.700 --> 40:57.000
Get the details in the show notes.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.700
We do have a bit of feedback, though.

40:58.700 --> 41:00.200
Mr. Brent, do you want to kick us off?

41:00.200 --> 41:00.600
Sure.

41:00.600 --> 41:04.000
I figured we could talk about Nix OS feedback that we got.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.800
I've been sort of watching the chats go by, especially

41:06.800 --> 41:08.300
in our matrix channel.

41:08.300 --> 41:12.000
And I thought I would grab a few that were interesting.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.600
So Nivoyu suggested, honestly, it's

41:15.600 --> 41:17.900
everything I hoped Nix OS would feel like.

41:17.900 --> 41:20.500
This is exactly how I want my systems configured,

41:20.500 --> 41:23.500
because it feels like one of those Arch bootstrap scripts.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.600
But I actually know exactly what's going on here.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.800
I thought that was pretty funny and very, very, very

41:28.800 --> 41:29.700
good feedback.

41:29.700 --> 41:32.400
It feels like Arch in a lot of ways.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.600
But then when you tell the Nix package manager

41:34.600 --> 41:36.400
to go do its thing, and you're like,

41:36.400 --> 41:37.600
I really haven't told it much.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.200
I just told it, I want a system.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.800
And then it just goes, and it builds a system.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.900
Or even with Nix OS, you just say, yeah, right?

41:43.900 --> 41:45.600
I need this service to be running.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.000
Here's a little config for the service.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.100
And then it figures out, oh, well, you're

41:48.100 --> 41:48.900
going to need that package.

41:48.900 --> 41:50.700
We're going to need a startup system to you.

41:50.700 --> 41:54.700
Dear Nix OS, or Dear Nix package manager, I want containers.

41:54.700 --> 41:56.600
And then you tell it to go, and you end up

41:56.600 --> 41:58.900
with a system that can run Docker and Podman.

41:58.900 --> 42:01.000
Or you could do just a Docker or a Podman system.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.100
I also found with the package caching

42:03.100 --> 42:06.100
that it's really speedy whenever you make any changes,

42:06.100 --> 42:07.400
even quite large changes.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.400
So I thought that was a nice experience, too.

42:09.400 --> 42:10.200
I see Josh wrote in.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.700
You want to take that one, Mr. Payne?

42:11.700 --> 42:14.000
Yeah, Josh writes in, quote, I've already

42:14.000 --> 42:16.300
been hacking on this config and learning the ways of Nix,

42:16.300 --> 42:20.300
because I've determined this is my dream distribution.

42:20.300 --> 42:20.900
Whoa.

42:20.900 --> 42:21.800
Strong words, Josh.

42:21.800 --> 42:22.300
I like it.

42:22.300 --> 42:25.200
We are in the new distro energy phase right now.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.900
Like, it is strong right now.

42:26.900 --> 42:28.100
Like, wow.

42:28.100 --> 42:30.300
Although, I got to say, we're like three weeks into it.

42:30.300 --> 42:32.300
So it's like sticking around.

42:32.300 --> 42:34.100
And part of the goal here, too, is

42:34.100 --> 42:36.700
to figure out where the limitations are, too, right?

42:36.700 --> 42:37.200
We get it.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.100
Like, when you adopt a weird system that's

42:39.100 --> 42:41.500
out of the mainstream that does things differently, that

42:41.500 --> 42:44.100
needs some workarounds to make some things work,

42:44.100 --> 42:45.800
that's going to be part of the experience.

42:45.800 --> 42:48.900
And I'm interested in where that falls and how much that is

42:48.900 --> 42:52.500
and how hard it is to kind of figure out those workarounds.

42:52.500 --> 42:56.400
How does it feel in practice day to day?

42:56.400 --> 43:03.300
And now, as the French say, it is time for Le Boost.

43:03.300 --> 43:05.000
Merci a tout le monde pour Le Boost.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.800
This week, we got user 406, who got in early.

43:09.800 --> 43:13.300
5,000 sats says, I can't make it live on Sundays,

43:13.300 --> 43:15.200
but wanted to send you a boost.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.100
So you know I was out here.

43:17.100 --> 43:19.000
Had to get into Bitcoin for this.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.600
Here's hoping to see you next Sunday one day.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.700
Thank you for getting into Bitcoin.

43:25.700 --> 43:28.900
What I feel like is there's going

43:28.900 --> 43:31.400
to be a lot of people who are just trying this out

43:31.400 --> 43:33.100
for the first time to send us a boost.

43:33.100 --> 43:34.760
And I'm all about it, because I think

43:34.760 --> 43:37.300
we're leaving people with more options down the road.

43:37.300 --> 43:40.500
And I still recommend, if you're in the States

43:40.500 --> 43:43.700
or a couple of other countries, just grab the Strike app.

43:43.700 --> 43:47.300
Super easy to get started, really painless.

43:47.300 --> 43:49.500
And you know what, user 406?

43:49.500 --> 43:51.500
Whenever you do get that Sunday day off,

43:51.500 --> 43:52.700
we'll be here waiting for you.

43:52.700 --> 43:54.400
That's right, every Sunday.

43:54.400 --> 43:58.600
Well, Toxel boosted in with 800 sats,

43:58.600 --> 44:01.500
writing in about love 451.

44:01.500 --> 44:04.500
I'm a fan of JB Show since mid-2012.

44:04.500 --> 44:05.800
Wow.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.100
I've never written any feedback,

44:07.100 --> 44:09.200
but Chris's speech in the last episode

44:09.200 --> 44:11.400
inspired me to try out the Fountain app

44:11.400 --> 44:13.700
and write up a boost.

44:13.700 --> 44:17.300
Thank you for 10 years of the best tech podcast content

44:17.300 --> 44:18.500
out there.

44:18.500 --> 44:20.400
And by the way, these sats I'm sending you

44:20.400 --> 44:23.500
are from the osmbtc.org donation fund.

44:23.500 --> 44:24.900
It's a nice way to earn some sats

44:24.900 --> 44:27.700
while contributing to the OpenStreetMap project.

44:27.700 --> 44:29.100
Wow, wow.

44:29.100 --> 44:30.900
That is fascinating.

44:30.900 --> 44:32.000
Thanks, Toxel.

44:32.000 --> 44:32.800
That's so great.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.500
You know, it's one of the fun things about these boosts,

44:34.500 --> 44:36.900
too, is I feel like we've been hearing from folks

44:36.900 --> 44:38.200
that we've never heard from.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.900
And we definitely hear from people we have heard from, too.

44:39.900 --> 44:41.400
It's an interesting new channel that way.

44:41.400 --> 44:45.900
Crashmaster18 sent in 1,000 sats yesterday for love 451.

44:45.900 --> 44:48.800
Thanks for the Fountain FM recommendation.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.400
I got the Bitcoin lightning set up.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.600
I like the boost idea.

44:51.600 --> 44:54.000
I used the Cash app to fund my Fountain wallet.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.700
I also joined the Matrix using Element Easy Peasy.

44:57.700 --> 44:58.300
Thank you.

44:58.300 --> 44:59.400
Aw, nice.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.200
I feel like that needs a bell.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.100
All right, you know what?

45:03.100 --> 45:04.600
One bell.

45:04.600 --> 45:06.700
Something shifted in my head at really the beginning

45:06.700 --> 45:08.700
of the year, and I really started

45:08.700 --> 45:10.800
thinking more about pushing decentralized stuff

45:10.800 --> 45:13.800
and stop just no longer really trying

45:13.800 --> 45:16.200
to push centralized services onto the community.

45:16.200 --> 45:18.000
And I think that's what I like in part about the lightning

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
stuff, and that's part what I like about Matrix.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.300
It's decentralized.

45:21.300 --> 45:23.100
It's self-hostable.

45:23.100 --> 45:24.600
I think it's the future.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.800
Cardanerd wrote in with 1,000 sats,

45:26.800 --> 45:29.800
been using NixOS as my main workstation for about six

45:29.800 --> 45:34.000
months now, so longer than we have.

45:34.000 --> 45:34.700
Yeah.

45:34.700 --> 45:36.000
I'll never look back.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.600
I really look forward to seeing how you all feel about it.

45:38.600 --> 45:42.000
Also, Raspberry Pi plus Nix works like a charm.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.800
I will say, I think, ultimately, I

45:44.800 --> 45:46.800
am very, very excited about trying that

45:46.800 --> 45:48.000
for my home network setup.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.800
Now that I'm thinking about redoing the home setup

45:49.800 --> 45:51.600
and we're getting into Nix, I'm just

45:51.600 --> 45:54.400
thinking, how great could that be for the home setup?

45:54.400 --> 45:54.900
Right?

45:54.900 --> 45:56.300
You know, Alex divulged to me that he

45:56.300 --> 45:58.700
has a few pies laying around that he's not using right now,

45:58.700 --> 46:00.600
so maybe we can do a bit of testing

46:00.600 --> 46:02.100
when we're out there next week.

46:02.100 --> 46:07.800
NoName, with 500 sats, boosting in yesterday on LUP 451.

46:07.800 --> 46:09.500
Podfather recommended your show.

46:09.500 --> 46:12.600
And yeah, best Linux show I've heard.

46:12.600 --> 46:13.300
There you go.

46:13.300 --> 46:15.600
We got a recommendation from the Podfather.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.700
That's got to be serious.

46:16.700 --> 46:18.100
Check that off the list.

46:18.100 --> 46:19.600
Shout out to Adam Curry.

46:19.600 --> 46:20.700
Respect to the Podfather.

46:20.700 --> 46:23.000
And check out his podcast with Dave Jones,

46:23.000 --> 46:24.300
who we've had on the show before.

46:24.300 --> 46:25.400
It's podcasting 2.0.

46:25.400 --> 46:26.300
That's the name of it.

46:26.300 --> 46:28.200
You can find it over at podcast.index.

46:28.200 --> 46:30.400
It's a great podcast if you are interested in maybe

46:30.400 --> 46:32.400
where podcasting could be going.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.100
They do a weekly show.

46:34.100 --> 46:36.600
The tools that they are building, the open source

46:36.600 --> 46:38.400
tooling that they're building, and how

46:38.400 --> 46:40.900
they want to keep podcasting decentralized and maybe

46:40.900 --> 46:42.700
a little weird, that's all in their show.

46:42.700 --> 46:44.900
It's a good show.

46:44.900 --> 46:51.400
Limiting Factor wrote in with 13,500 sats yesterday.

46:51.400 --> 46:55.800
He says, what a pain in the ass this was to set up, lol.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.600
But much like everything we do in our community,

46:58.600 --> 47:02.100
it's overly complicated for its own various reasons,

47:02.100 --> 47:04.200
and yet totally worth it.

47:04.200 --> 47:04.700
Amen.

47:04.700 --> 47:05.600
I do appreciate it.

47:05.600 --> 47:07.000
That's kind of our style.

47:07.000 --> 47:07.700
It is early.

47:07.700 --> 47:09.100
Like, this is one of the things we

47:09.100 --> 47:10.900
thought about with Matrix and the boosts.

47:10.900 --> 47:13.200
And you know, even when we launched the shows, guys,

47:13.200 --> 47:16.100
seriously, even when we started doing the shows 15 years ago,

47:16.100 --> 47:18.300
it was like, we're kind of appealing

47:18.300 --> 47:19.600
to a lot of early adopters.

47:19.600 --> 47:21.200
We want to make shows for everybody,

47:21.200 --> 47:22.600
but we want to make sure we're also

47:22.600 --> 47:25.300
making content for early adopters, because that's us.

47:25.300 --> 47:27.200
And we want content that's made for us, too.

47:27.200 --> 47:28.900
And we don't want just like willy-nilly,

47:28.900 --> 47:30.900
like hype men, early adopters.

47:30.900 --> 47:32.900
We want people that think about this stuff deeply,

47:32.900 --> 47:35.000
that try this stuff, that build this stuff, that

47:35.000 --> 47:36.300
work with this stuff.

47:36.300 --> 47:38.200
That's why we're running our own node.

47:38.200 --> 47:40.300
That's why we're running our own Matrix server, right?

47:40.300 --> 47:42.700
Because we want to get hands-on experience with this stuff

47:42.700 --> 47:44.300
and truly take advantage of the fact

47:44.300 --> 47:46.000
that it can be self-hosted.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.800
Because if people like us won't do it, who will?

47:49.800 --> 47:50.500
Really, no one?

47:50.500 --> 47:51.400
Yeah.

47:51.400 --> 47:54.200
There's got to be an audience to use this self-hosted stuff,

47:54.200 --> 47:56.200
or else they're just going to stop building it for folks.

47:56.200 --> 47:57.500
And that's part of my thought.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.200
And if we can encourage people out there

47:59.200 --> 48:01.100
to also have fun with the technology,

48:01.100 --> 48:03.200
because it is a lot of fun, and also create

48:03.200 --> 48:05.700
a bit of a demand for this self-hosted technology,

48:05.700 --> 48:07.200
for this peer-to-peer technology,

48:07.200 --> 48:08.700
for this decentralized technology,

48:08.700 --> 48:10.700
for open source technology.

48:10.700 --> 48:12.500
And the more of us that are doing it,

48:12.500 --> 48:14.600
as we've seen just with the next challenge,

48:14.600 --> 48:16.700
with the self-hosted show, just the more of us

48:16.700 --> 48:18.300
that are interested in it, the better

48:18.300 --> 48:21.400
we can all help each other.

48:21.400 --> 48:23.700
I have a fun pick for us before we get out of here.

48:23.700 --> 48:25.400
What sneaky last-minute pick.

48:25.400 --> 48:26.400
This is Wildman.

48:26.400 --> 48:28.900
So I'm going through my notes, because I heard

48:28.900 --> 48:31.300
from the developer of Userland.

48:31.300 --> 48:33.900
It is an app that's available for Android

48:33.900 --> 48:37.800
that lets you run Linux on Android,

48:37.800 --> 48:39.900
like Ubuntu, or Debian, or Kali Linux.

48:39.900 --> 48:42.100
You don't have to root your device.

48:42.100 --> 48:45.100
You just essentially get a fast, local VNC connection

48:45.100 --> 48:49.500
to the Linux that's running in a self-contained app VM.

48:49.500 --> 48:50.100
It's so cool.

48:50.100 --> 48:52.600
And I actually tagged this for us

48:52.600 --> 48:55.700
to feature this as a pick three years ago.

48:55.700 --> 48:56.500
Wow.

48:56.500 --> 48:57.300
And then I never.

48:57.300 --> 48:58.100
It's still going.

48:58.100 --> 48:58.900
Yeah.

48:58.900 --> 49:00.300
That's a great sign, right?

49:00.300 --> 49:01.300
I went to check on it.

49:01.300 --> 49:03.200
I'm like, well, surely it's dead now.

49:03.200 --> 49:04.100
No.

49:04.100 --> 49:05.000
No, it's still going.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.500
And I had a chance to talk with the developer.

49:06.500 --> 49:07.300
It's open source.

49:07.300 --> 49:08.200
It's GPL.

49:08.200 --> 49:09.200
It's up on GitHub.

49:09.200 --> 49:10.000
We'll have that link.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.500
It's available in F-Droid as well, which we do like seeing that,

49:13.500 --> 49:15.800
because there's just not enough stuff in F-Droid.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.300
There's good stuff in there, but not enough.

49:17.300 --> 49:18.800
And so it's really nice to see that.

49:18.800 --> 49:21.100
You can just install this like a regular app,

49:21.100 --> 49:23.000
and then you can run a full Linux distro on top

49:23.000 --> 49:24.900
of an Android device.

49:24.900 --> 49:27.600
They also, if you check, once you go to that link,

49:27.600 --> 49:31.100
if you look at their Play Store apps, this isn't really a pic,

49:31.100 --> 49:33.100
but this guy's like a bonus pic.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.600
They kind of use the same trick for two other things.

49:35.600 --> 49:38.400
So they have the whole user land for Linux distros,

49:38.400 --> 49:41.900
but then they have Foxbox, which is a desktop Firefox.

49:41.900 --> 49:45.200
Oh, like the desktop version of Firefox on your phone.

49:45.200 --> 49:48.100
Yeah, so you're like, when you go to Reddit or other sites,

49:48.100 --> 49:50.500
you're like, would you like to see the mobile version?

49:50.500 --> 49:51.200
No, I don't.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.900
You don't get that when you use the desktop version of Firefox,

49:53.900 --> 49:54.400
right?

49:54.400 --> 49:56.700
Plus you get all the Firefox extensions and stuff.

49:56.700 --> 49:57.700
Yeah, sure.

49:57.700 --> 49:59.700
But then the other one that actually

49:59.700 --> 50:04.100
feels like maybe this should be a million dollar product

50:04.100 --> 50:05.900
is called Craftbox.

50:05.900 --> 50:10.500
And it's a VM that fires up a Linux machine

50:10.500 --> 50:14.700
and just runs a hosted Minecraft server on an Android machine.

50:14.700 --> 50:16.400
So maybe you've got a fancy phone.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.500
You've got a tablet you're not doing anything with.

50:18.500 --> 50:21.300
You could actually turn that into a local Java edition

50:21.300 --> 50:23.100
Minecraft server using this.

50:23.100 --> 50:24.600
And all of this is GPL3.

50:24.600 --> 50:27.400
So wanted to give a shout out to that.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.500
My Android phone can finally be useful.

50:29.500 --> 50:30.100
Great.

50:30.100 --> 50:32.300
Chris, it's so interesting that you brought this up

50:32.300 --> 50:33.700
and didn't tell Wes or I about it,

50:33.700 --> 50:36.100
because literally yesterday I was

50:36.100 --> 50:37.660
playing with an application.

50:37.660 --> 50:40.500
I guess there's another bonus pick called Termux

50:40.500 --> 50:42.500
that you can install via F-Droid.

50:42.500 --> 50:46.900
And I wanted to simply do some R-Sync backups to my phone

50:46.900 --> 50:49.900
and play around with what I could do with some old phones.

50:49.900 --> 50:53.100
And this is so the same line of thinking,

50:53.100 --> 50:55.300
it makes me smile that somehow we always

50:55.300 --> 50:57.300
seem to get to the same place at the same time.

50:57.300 --> 50:58.400
So thanks for that.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.000
That's great.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.500
Of course, link over at linuxunplug.com slash 452.

51:03.500 --> 51:04.300
All right, gentlemen.

51:04.300 --> 51:05.700
I think that's everything, yeah?

51:05.700 --> 51:07.200
I think we came to do what we wanted.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.100
And we got ourselves a pork shoulder waiting for us.

51:09.100 --> 51:11.000
And Nick's expressions to write, I think.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.900
We have some Nick's work to do.

51:12.900 --> 51:15.700
We've got a whole matrix system to rebuild and rebuild it

51:15.700 --> 51:16.900
better.

51:16.900 --> 51:19.500
We're going to call it the million dollar matrix system.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.100
Like the million dollar, you get the reference.

51:21.100 --> 51:21.500
Of course.

51:21.500 --> 51:21.900
Yeah, of course.

51:21.900 --> 51:23.000
We have the technology.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.900
If you'd like to join us live and participate

51:24.900 --> 51:26.400
in our Mumble Room, our chat room,

51:26.400 --> 51:29.300
or just listen live because it is a different show,

51:29.300 --> 51:30.600
well, you can do that on Sunday.

51:30.600 --> 51:33.500
We do it at noon Pacific over at jblive.tv.

51:33.500 --> 51:35.800
And we do have the calendar linked

51:35.800 --> 51:37.900
at jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar

51:37.900 --> 51:39.600
where you can get it in your local time.

51:39.600 --> 51:40.900
See you next week.

51:40.900 --> 51:43.500
Same bad time, same bad station.

51:43.500 --> 51:45.800
Of course, don't miss Linux action news.

51:45.800 --> 51:50.300
We did a roundup of a lot of things coming to Linux 5.18.

51:50.300 --> 51:53.500
Plus, we talked about the new rolling Rhino, Ubuntu release,

51:53.500 --> 51:55.500
mix, remix, unofficial.

51:55.500 --> 51:59.300
We got the details and more over at litixactionnews.com.

51:59.300 --> 52:01.000
Be sure you go grab that.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.700
Of course, our members feed, you get the full live production

52:03.700 --> 52:04.600
or an ad free.

52:04.600 --> 52:06.100
It's your choice.

52:06.100 --> 52:08.500
You can support the show at unpluggedcore.com

52:08.500 --> 52:11.300
or support all the shows on the network at jupiter.party

52:11.300 --> 52:13.700
and get all of the bonus content.

52:13.700 --> 52:14.800
That's how you do it.

52:14.800 --> 52:16.700
And links to everything we talked about on our website,

52:16.700 --> 52:19.000

52:19.000 --> 52:21.100
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

52:21.100 --> 52:49.500
We'll see you next week.

52:49.500 --> 53:02.500
So I'm trying to find a spot to like take my son camping

53:02.500 --> 53:03.900
for like his 13th birthday.

53:03.900 --> 53:06.500
I'm out of ideas like we've been everywhere

53:06.500 --> 53:07.500
and I'm not saying that to bring.

53:07.500 --> 53:09.900
It's like I really can't think of anywhere to go

53:09.900 --> 53:11.300
and I promised him like a trip

53:11.300 --> 53:13.100
and now I'm just coming up blank.

53:13.100 --> 53:14.500
Has he been out to the Olympics?

53:14.500 --> 53:15.500
That was what I thought.

53:15.500 --> 53:17.200
I suggested the Olympics to him and he's like,

53:17.200 --> 53:18.200
oh, I don't know.

53:18.200 --> 53:20.100
I kind of like to be somewhere in the woods.

53:20.100 --> 53:22.000
That's like, that's a rainforest.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.200
That's like the most woods you can get.

53:24.200 --> 53:26.400
I need to find like a great spot and suggest it to him

53:26.400 --> 53:27.400
is what I got to do.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.000
I've been thinking about like,

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
where would I want to go if I were his age?

53:31.000 --> 53:33.300
It would probably be like swimming, hot tubs,

53:33.300 --> 53:34.400
you know, hiking.

53:34.400 --> 53:35.500
He loves all that kind of stuff.

53:35.500 --> 53:41.000
Hey, he can have breakfast in a hot tub here if he wants.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
I want breakfast in a hot tub.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.500
A journey to visit Uncle Brent.

53:43.500 --> 53:45.300
There you go.

53:45.300 --> 53:46.100
I've got woods.

53:46.100 --> 53:48.300
And we show up and he's got breakfast ready for us.

53:48.300 --> 53:49.800
I mean, while you guys are going out East,

53:49.800 --> 53:52.000
you might want to swing down to Florida and catch a launch.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.400
There's quite a few these days.

53:53.400 --> 53:56.700
I really, our initial plan,

53:56.700 --> 53:58.700
we were planning to swing down to Florida.

53:58.700 --> 54:00.600
That was initially the plan.

54:00.600 --> 54:04.300
I just couldn't make it work from like a budget standpoint,

54:04.300 --> 54:07.000
but the first draft did have us going to Florida for a bit

54:07.000 --> 54:10.100
because I've never been other than just like staying over

54:10.100 --> 54:13.300
at an airport or a hotel for a night to then fly out somewhere else.

54:13.300 --> 54:15.000
Like that's my extent of Florida travel.

54:15.000 --> 54:20.500
Yeah, but in super secret, huge Disney guy over there.

54:20.500 --> 54:45.500
Yeah, it's a Magic Kingdom after all.
