1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
I decided the whole trip I would avoid eating fish,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,720
because why eat fish when you're away

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,280
from the Pacific Northwest, right?

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,860
So guess what I've been eating since I've been back?

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,560
Pretty much nothing but fish.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,520
Yeah, but I will say the fish we did have impromptu

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,680
in the parking lot was pretty amazing.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,720
Parking lot fish, not sketchy at all.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,880
Let's be clear, too.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,320
Poe Dunk gas station parking lot in Jerome, Idaho.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,800
And it was amazing.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,320
We made the best of that situation.

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:37,640
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,520
My name is Chris.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,600
My name is Wes.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
And my name is Brent.

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,040
Hello, gentlemen.

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,960
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru,

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,200
the leader in learning for the Cloud,

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,240
Linux, and other modern tech skills.

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,680
Right now, everyone can get cloud learning for a discount.

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,180
That's right, hundreds of courses,

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,000
thousands of hands-on labs, free cloud sandboxes, all more

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,880
at cloudguru.com.

25
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,280
Well, coming up on the show today,

26
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,440
we're mixing our vanilla with our chocolate,

27
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,080
like one of those tasty cones that I never actually get.

28
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,720
But then when my kids order them, I look at them

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,560
and think, I should have got one of those.

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,060
We're going to start out with some really important desktop

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,480
developments this week.

32
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,840
And then we'll wrap up that with a conversation

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,480
around some new features landing in Matrix, where we think

34
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Matrix is going, and some changes and improvements

35
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,720
we're making to both our Matrix community

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,240
and the actual Matrix server itself.

37
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,560
So there's a lot there that we're going to get into.

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,520
But before we do that, before we do the community news,

39
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,160
any of that kind of stuff, we have

40
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,560
to say time-appropriate greetings

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,520
to our virtual lug.

42
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,760
Hello, Mumble Room.

43
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,840
Namaskaram.

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,880
Hello.

45
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,400
Hello.

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,560
Hello.

47
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
Hello.

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,760
Hello, everybody.

49
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,360
Man, is it nice to be back in the studio

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,360
and nice to actually see your faces.

51
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,500
I'll talk more about that in a bit, but yes, I am back.

52
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,360
It is good.

53
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,480
We did get the server up.

54
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,160
We have a complete update next week

55
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,680
in Linux Unplugged on what was wrong with our server,

56
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,160
the fact that it crashed again, and what we did to fix that,

57
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,560
and what our long-term plans are.

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,240
But before we can get to that, we actually just

59
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,320
have to take care of some business.

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,840
That's right.

61
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,320
It's time to do a server update, Wes.

62
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,320
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

63
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,120
Because it's been a long, long time since we

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,320
did an Arch server update.

65
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,640
Yeah, that's why we have 187 packages

66
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,120
to download and update, including

67
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,520
a new version of the kernel.

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,320
And that's not even accounting for the fact

69
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,080
that there's a new ZFS version in the AUR as well.

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
What could go wrong?

71
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,360
It's just our kernel and our file system of choice.

72
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,560
We do these Arch updates, so you don't have to, though.

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
We'll do them.

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,480
And you know, I mean, we will be using almost 300 megs less

75
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,760
disk space if we succeed.

76
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,440
So there's a small benefit there, too.

77
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,200
That's how you know it's a good Arch update.

78
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,600
You install it, and it actually ends up using less disk space.

79
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,280
So all right, Wes, here's what we're going to do.

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,800
You get those packages downloading,

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,240
because it's going to take a while to download, like,

82
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
nearly 700 megs worth of packages.

83
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,520
And then we will check back in the post-show

84
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,040
and do the final install and see how everything goes.

85
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,800
All right?

86
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,520
That's the plan.

87
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,040
Wish me luck, everyone.

88
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:12,040
But first, we do have some community news.

89
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,360
Josh Strobel joins us.

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
It's been forever, Josh, since you've been on the show.

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,040
And we love having you here, because I

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,000
love getting updates on Solus, your baby,

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,720
and what's going on there.

94
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,000
And you drew a lot of attention this last week

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,160
when you published a post, quote,

96
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,720
building an alternative ecosystem,

97
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,280
where you called out some problems

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
that you feel like you're having in the downstream position

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,720
with GNOME.

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,520
And Josh, I want to thank you for coming on

101
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,680
and giving voice to this, because other distribution

102
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,600
makers are having some frustrations right now,

103
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,440
it seems.

104
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,440
And unlike what we typically have where users get upset,

105
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,640
in this case, it seems like the people

106
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,000
who make our distributions are starting to get upset.

107
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,120
So can you explain what's going on for people who

108
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,600
are totally new to this topic?

109
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Yeah, well, first off, thank you for having me on.

110
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,320
I really appreciate having the opportunity

111
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,160
to actually discuss quite a controversial post I certainly

112
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,800
made, not without some of its faults.

113
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,600
But in essence, the concerns I raised

114
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,040
are kind of two pronged in my building alternative ecosystem

115
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,080
blog post.

116
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,720
So the first one is about kind of the GNOME community

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,440
and some of the behavior and attitude

118
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,200
exhibited by GNOME developers, whether they're

119
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,280
GDK developers or otherwise.

120
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,320
And we've seen some of this before

121
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,640
with Tobias' controversial post that he

122
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,280
made about traditional desktops being dead

123
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,720
and that kind of thing, but also just some of the behavior

124
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,480
that they've exhibited fairly recently in response

125
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,240
to some concerns actually originally raised

126
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,760
by the System76 developer Jeremy, who, as we all know,

127
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,160
works on the Cosmic slash Pop OS desktop environments

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,200
and all that.

129
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,400
So we have some of that, but also there's

130
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
some concerns that we have related

131
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,920
to the fragmentation of how theming

132
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,240
is going to be working going forward in GNOME 42 and GDK5

133
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,880
and how that's going to look and play out

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,480
across a variety of GDK-based desktop environments,

135
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,880
applications, across different operating systems

136
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,800
like elementary and Pop OS and Solus and Ferran OS

137
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,400
and so on and so forth.

138
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,640
So I wrote a big blog post on my personal website kind

139
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,800
of detailing these concerns about their changing of how

140
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,520
dark theme is going to work and shifting that to libidwaita

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,680
and removing some of the APIs and key values

142
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,040
that we need as downstreams in GDK5 with the assumption

143
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,600
that we're all going to be building these platform

144
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,800
libraries to handle our styling and all that differently.

145
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,520
And so the transition is essentially distribution makers

146
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,480
who are downstream clients of GNOME.

147
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,960
They like to brand the desktop environment currently,

148
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,640
if I understand this correctly, by essentially modifying

149
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,840
the CSS around the GNOME, either Adwadi itself

150
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,560
or a different theme, and they can kind of color things

151
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,880
and brand things that way.

152
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
And that's going away.

153
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,560
And any customization that will be allowed

154
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
is going to be via libidwaita, starting with GNOME 42.

155
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
And in there, it's going to be more things

156
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,440
like accent colors that can be tweaked and stuff.

157
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,160
Is that a correct assessment?

158
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,800
Right now, what we have is a key value called GDK-Theme,

159
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,840
where what you can do is say, I want platidark or platinoir

160
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,240
or I want materia dark or that sort of theme.

161
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,920
And that is used and respected by GDK and across all those GDK

162
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,440
applications.

163
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,960
So that's what we have at the moment.

164
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,520
What we're going to be having going forward

165
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,920
is a situation where libidwaita will

166
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,120
have a recoloring API, which will be for application

167
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,400
developers, but not end users.

168
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,680
So this will be up to application developers

169
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,280
to expose its recoloring functionality to end users

170
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,080
if they want.

171
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,040
Of course, we understand that there's

172
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,440
some individuals that have cosigned to the don't theme

173
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,880
my app that might have a different view on application

174
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,920
theming.

175
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,720
However, effectively, what we're going to have to do

176
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,800
if you want to have theming with a GDK application

177
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,200
is you would have to build out your own library that

178
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,240
handles the loading of a specific style sheet.

179
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,840
So in libidwaita's case, it's edwaita,

180
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,880
which is edwaita-light or edwaita-dark.

181
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,840
For elementary, it would be with their libgranite.

182
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,160
And effectively, what GNOME is saying

183
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,400
is, OK, Sol is system 76.

184
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,560
You guys have to develop your own thing.

185
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,280
And now, when you ship applications that are, say,

186
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,000
based on their core GNOME applications,

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,960
but you also ship your own, you run

188
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,720
the risk of those looking different, functioning

189
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,920
different, depending on if you implement their dark theme

190
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,800
standard that's been proposed and all of that.

191
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,320
So it ends up being a real mess compared

192
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,480
to the current situation, which is you change a single key,

193
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,840
and it applies universally across all your GNOME

194
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,360
applications.

195
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,800
Josh, it seems like a barrier here

196
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,680
is I think the GNOME camp would argue what we have today

197
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,480
is a mess, and that something like libidwaita

198
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,880
is designed to solve that and give developers more control

199
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,760
over how their applications look.

200
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,160
Do you grant that some of that's true?

201
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,600
I can see that side of the argument there.

202
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,400
Yeah, I mean, I certainly understand their perspective

203
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,280
of there might be situations where you apply a theme,

204
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,560
and that theme unexpectedly breaks

205
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,960
the layout and styling of a GNOME application.

206
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,640
And obviously, their concern is trying

207
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,120
to ensure that doesn't happen.

208
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,640
But I feel like most of that ends up coming down

209
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,080
to fixing the theme, not necessarily preventing

210
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,560
the end user from making those changes to begin with.

211
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,980
So I feel like it's a difference in perspective.

212
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,960
And my perspective is coming from the whole idea

213
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,280
of the ability under Linux to be able to make

214
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,240
all these sort of customizations that you want

215
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,440
is kind of being taken away or shoved or made harder

216
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,840
versus their perspective.

217
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,080
So it's a very interesting problem.

218
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,640
It is.

219
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,920
And it seems like the conversation has soured a bit.

220
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,040
It seems like maybe some personality conflicts

221
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,800
are involved, and it kind of has shut down.

222
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,640
And it seems like their intended path going forward

223
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,380
is Libidwadia, which they plan to have 1.0 in GNOME 42.

224
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,880
They think that they'll have some recoloring functionality

225
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,380
in there.

226
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,240
Proper dark style settings will be available by then.

227
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,600
But system-wide accent colors and that kind of stuff

228
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,220
probably not going to land by then.

229
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,680
And there definitely won't be any kind of theming API.

230
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,600
That's correct, yeah.

231
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,260
And I think their contention is, well,

232
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,720
if you want a theming API, build it.

233
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,880
Do you think that would actually work?

234
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,340
Could you show up with some code and say, OK, here you go,

235
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:53,840
GNOME.

236
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,440
We've created a theming API.

237
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,560
Do you think they'd actually accept it?

238
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm not entirely sure they would,

239
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,960
because if you look at even some of the work

240
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,640
that Matthias has tried doing, and Matthias

241
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,680
is one of the GDK developers, with some of the theming

242
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,660
even in GDK 4, the end decision was to actually punt that over

243
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,840
to Libidwadia, because there is this constant conflict

244
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,160
between GDK developers, GDK application developers,

245
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,400
distributions, end users.

246
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
There doesn't seem to be a good middle ground

247
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,440
at the moment between all of this.

248
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,880
So it seems like the path, instead

249
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,360
of trying to find a middle ground,

250
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
has been to just fracture things.

251
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,160
And it seems like for Solus, it doesn't

252
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,960
look like this is a direction that you all want to go into.

253
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,920
And so you're looking at utilizing the Enlightenment

254
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
libraries for future development.

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,800
Yeah, so to just clarify, I made a statement regarding Qt.

256
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,040
So basically, I laid out all of our alternatives,

257
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,880
which were like EFL, which is Enlightenment,

258
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,080
Foundation libraries, Qt, and Iced.

259
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,760
I had stated that there is a commercial licensing related

260
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,400
to Qt. I want to clarify that the issues that we have

261
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,680
in relation to Qt and the KDE project and all of that

262
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,880
is related to the fact that we don't

263
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,960
want to have to be put into a position where we're

264
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,200
maintaining a patch set, like KDE

265
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,080
has to do with the 5.15 series, with all

266
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,680
the comprehensive libraries that Qt provides.

267
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,640
So we would rather just avoid that path

268
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,680
entirely and not have to be concerned with Qt's

269
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,120
commercialization of Qt.

270
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,120
So that basically brings us to EFL and Iced.

271
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,480
So for those that aren't familiar,

272
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,440
Iced is a toolkit that is designed for Rust.

273
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,120
So obviously, that's been a point of contention internally

274
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,080
because some of us like Rust, some of us

275
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,880
prefer C and all that.

276
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,600
But at the end of the day, that's just not quite ready

277
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
because it misses some of the APIs that we would need,

278
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,720
like layering to build basic stuff like pop-ups.

279
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,480
So what that means is basically EFL is there.

280
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,240
As effectively, the only option we really

281
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,880
have aside from building our own toolkit, which just

282
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,440
isn't sustainable, I mean, we've been kicking Budgie 11

283
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,680
down the curb and waiting for GDK4

284
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,320
being a state where it was released as stable,

285
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,040
not to mention in a state that we're happy with.

286
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,280
So it's just we got to pull the trigger and just go with EFL

287
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,040
and start working on Solace applications and Budgie 11

288
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,120
in EFL.

289
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,840
Wow.

290
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,960
That seems like a huge job.

291
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,440
But in a way, I'm kind of glad you're doing it

292
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,560
because Solace has always really been great at kind of doing

293
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
some research and development in an area

294
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,360
that maybe other distributions aren't looking at and landing

295
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
on something clever.

296
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,600
So I think in a way, it's going to work out pretty well

297
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,360
because it takes some pressure off the GNOME project as well.

298
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,320
They can kind of do their thing.

299
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,240
And you guys can do your thing.

300
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,720
And maybe if it starts to look like a direction people

301
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,760
are interested in, some other projects will jump in with you.

302
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,200
Have you gotten any bites on other people

303
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
joining you in this effort?

304
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,720
I haven't had anybody from like System76 reach out directly.

305
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,240
Maybe they would wait until I write the Rust bindings

306
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,800
for EFL, which is something I want

307
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,840
to do to make it more approachable to more people.

308
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,000
However, I've had some EFL developers reach out actually

309
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
and ask what they could do to actually help

310
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,880
or what ways they could get involved

311
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,000
in bringing EFL-based applications to Solace.

312
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,720
So I've been extremely pleased with the reception

313
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,560
that the EFL community has had related to that.

314
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,000
And we already have people in the Solace community

315
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,040
that are application developers that are already

316
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,320
looking towards building applications.

317
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,680
Like for instance, Sarabit, he's the developer

318
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,320
of an application called Wraith Master, which

319
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,880
does RGB controls for your Wraith Spire

320
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,040
coolers and all that.

321
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,400
He's working on an EFL implementation as well.

322
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,600
So that's good to hear.

323
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,840
That's really good to hear.

324
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,080
This feels almost like an impossible problem

325
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,200
to solve to everyone's satisfaction.

326
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,160
Reading through the GNOME camp's position,

327
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,920
it seems very much like they're of the opinion

328
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,080
like they have a few things they want to accomplish,

329
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,200
like say, dark mode and high contrast

330
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,280
mode for accessibility.

331
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,040
And to do that, they have to make some fundamental changes.

332
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,800
And they kind of have some other problems

333
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,840
to solve at the same time.

334
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,720
And so this seems like the direction they're going to go.

335
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,800
Is Libidwadia, that's where the customization is going to be.

336
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,040
If you want to customize, you're going

337
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,960
to have to modify that.

338
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,080
And application developers are going

339
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,840
to have some say now if their application can

340
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,040
be themed or not.

341
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,560
This is not just a problem unique to GNOME.

342
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,280
And so, Neil, could you give us some insights

343
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,280
into how the Plasma Desktop struggles with this?

344
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,320
The Plasma Desktop, as most people know,

345
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,480
uses the Qt toolkit underneath.

346
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,240
I mean, Josh mentioned it briefly earlier

347
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,160
that we depend on Qt from the Qt company.

348
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,360
And there's been kerfuffles about it.

349
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,520
It hasn't been a huge deal that KDE

350
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,800
is maintaining a patch set on top of Qt 5.15

351
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,920
because they're all backports of things

352
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,840
that they send up to Qt 6.

353
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,920
And the goal is to move to Qt 6 anyway.

354
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,720
And Qt 6 doesn't have the same impairment

355
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,960
that Qt 5.15 has right now.

356
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,000
But to get to the heart of the matter with GTK and GNOME

357
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,120
and their decision with Libidwadia,

358
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,040
the problem with Libidwadia is if you run an application that

359
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,560
forces Adwadia on Plasma, it is entirely alien in convention,

360
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,560
in style, in arrangement, in accessibility, in theming,

361
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,520
in UX patterns, the whole works.

362
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,840
Plasma historically has bent over backwards

363
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,520
to incorporate GNOME and GTK applications into the fold.

364
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,720
Like there are adapters and drivers and style sheets

365
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,520
and configuration and overrides and all kinds of things

366
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,520
that we do to make it so that a GTK GNOME application

367
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,520
actually fits in Plasma with what GNOME is doing here.

368
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,160
They've basically said, we don't think that having

369
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,680
an application fit within the environment

370
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,080
that the user is working in is a valuable property.

371
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,960
What I suspect is actually gonna happen mid to long term

372
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,960
is that as Libidwadia stabilizes its ABI,

373
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,160
when the 1.0 release, the ABI and API

374
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,920
will be mostly stable, it'll get forked.

375
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,520
And that library will get forked into a drop-in replacement

376
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,760
that will revert to the old behavior

377
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,960
of allowing the system themes to propagate through

378
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,200
to all the applications.

379
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,440
That's exactly what I expect will happen too.

380
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,600
Yeah, I mean, that's been something

381
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,160
that we've been considering internally for Souls as well.

382
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,780
We provide a lot of patches on top of these applications

383
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,200
to revert some of the behavior that GNOME does.

384
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,120
And unfortunately, it might be the case

385
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,640
where we have to do that for Libidwadia as well.

386
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,880
Is it Adwaita or Adwadia?

387
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,720
I don't know.

388
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,560
I don't know.

389
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,000
I mean, is it GNOME or is it GNOME, right?

390
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,320
You two don't know.

391
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
Who does?

392
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,760
Well, so I've been calling it Adwaita

393
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,240
until Chris started calling it Adwadia today.

394
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,200
And I was like, all right.

395
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,760
I do both to cover my bases.

396
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,800
Okay. Yeah.

397
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,520
For Libidwadia, I fully expect that we'll see something

398
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,340
like lib system theme or something like that.

399
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,080
And it'll produce a dummy library of Libidwadia

400
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,440
and lib granite and bind those APIs back in

401
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,720
into something that any desktop can plug into.

402
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,240
And it may be something that's a joint effort

403
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,360
across the different alternative desktops

404
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,000
that basically don't fit with what GNOME is doing now.

405
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So like Matei.

406
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,480
But might that ultimately not be a better solution?

407
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,060
No, no, no, no, no.

408
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,500
So a lot of people don't know this,

409
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,120
but this is actually how everything worked with GTK2.

410
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,240
So in GTK2 land, to kind of recap,

411
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,000
you had a concept of a theming engine

412
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,040
and you plugged that in,

413
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,320
and then it would propagate back into the applications.

414
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,620
And do all the things.

415
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,120
The problem with this model

416
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,400
was that you were essentially required

417
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,880
to make sure you were binding on both sides correctly

418
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,700
the whole time.

419
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,680
So every time a new release of the platform,

420
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,000
GTK2, libgnome, desktop, all the other things around it,

421
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,020
that linked into GTK and like used it to render stuff,

422
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,680
you needed to make sure you covered

423
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,520
all the widgets and stuff.

424
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,400
And one of the reasons GTK3 doesn't have this

425
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,280
was that the idea was if we went to style sheets,

426
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,660
CSS, JavaScript with GJS, and use that instead,

427
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,600
we'd get to a world where we would be able

428
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,680
to do a declarative simple model.

429
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,860
I mean, it's not really declarative.

430
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,880
CSS is Turing complete.

431
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,280
But declarative simple model

432
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,880
of being able to easily implement

433
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,880
styling of applications in a way that is clear,

434
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,720
testable, and usable, and portable.

435
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,280
And they immediately ripped out

436
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,560
the three theming engine stuff in GTK3

437
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,820
when they finished implementing the style sheet stuff.

438
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,860
So in GTK4, we're getting the worst of all worlds.

439
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,160
We're getting the theming engine plus the CSS style sheet.

440
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,960
Nobody actually likes working with CSS,

441
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,880
but the upshot of the CSS stuff with GTK3

442
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,960
was that you didn't have to write

443
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,080
a whole bloody theming engine to work with it.

444
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,920
You were able to use-

445
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,840
Democratize the customization of GTK-based applications.

446
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,680
Exactly.

447
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,680
And if you look at Breeze GTK2 and Breeze GTK3,

448
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,640
Breeze GTK2 is horrible compared to Breeze GTK3

449
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,400
because Breeze GTK3 looks like Breeze on Qt

450
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,960
because both Qt5 and GTK3 operate

451
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,720
on the same basic principles on how they do styling.

452
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,560
So with GTK4, we now go back to having theming engines

453
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,760
and we have the style sheets.

454
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,920
And so now we're in the worst of all worlds.

455
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,960
You know, it's not great to hear that,

456
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,980
but I can still sort of see

457
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,280
why they're going this direction.

458
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,100
And I understand that it's frustrating.

459
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,140
And I think it's disappointing how the conversation

460
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,700
has devolved into kind of personality conflicts,

461
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,800
essentially just kind of preventing

462
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,480
proper organization on this.

463
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,980
But what fascinates me about this conversation

464
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,220
is it hasn't hit end users yet.

465
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,400
They'll notice this with GNOME 42,

466
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,540
but right now it's distro makers

467
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,600
and desktop environment developers

468
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,200
who are raising a red flag.

469
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,360
It's one of these problems that's bubbling

470
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,040
in the development community

471
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,200
and it's created some turf wars there,

472
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,860
but it actually hasn't really hit end users yet,

473
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,700
but it's coming.

474
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,920
Yeah, I mean, in the case of Solus,

475
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,120
it's why we're actually going to be moving

476
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,360
our default applications that ship

477
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,240
to not leverage ones that we anticipate

478
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,040
are going to be using Libidoida.

479
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,800
So that way, obviously it's not going to affect

480
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,680
those that already have Solus installed,

481
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,800
but those that will have Solus installed

482
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,220
or intend on installing it or have a fresh installation,

483
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,240
when GNOME 42 finally rolls out,

484
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,520
they're not gonna really notice any difference.

485
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,080
Or at least that's the end goal.

486
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,220
Hopefully, right?

487
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,160
Yeah, well said.

488
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,340
I think it's tricky because GNOME sees themselves

489
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,740
as creating a platform that is consumed by end users,

490
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,760
by actual users.

491
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,160
And that's why when they do surveys,

492
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,280
they go out and they find commercial operating system users

493
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,540
and they survey how they use them

494
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,920
and use that to inform future decisions or whatever.

495
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,860
But there is a very common use case of GNOME

496
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,280
that is, I don't think in that conception of theirs,

497
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,260
in my opinion, I don't know for sure,

498
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,320
but in that is the downstream distro makers.

499
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,140
I don't think GNOME really thinks of themselves

500
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,360
as an upstream vendor that is producing code

501
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,200
for downstream consumers who are then repackaging it

502
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,820
for their end users,

503
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,760
where shipping it with an extension enabled,

504
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,280
even if it's Fedora, is commonplace.

505
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,960
And shipping it with a theme applied is commonplace.

506
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,840
Like these are very common things.

507
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,800
Fedora does the least amount of tweaks,

508
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,500
but even Fedora has a little logo extension

509
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,520
they ship with.

510
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,180
So literally every downstream vendor of GNOME

511
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,440
is using extensions,

512
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,520
but yet the project says,

513
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,840
eh, extensions are niche, nobody uses them.

514
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,980
Because they're thinking about it

515
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,680
from people who are consuming the product

516
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,720
they create directly.

517
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,560
Yeah.

518
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,920
Which I can tell you really isn't the case

519
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,480
because even like for Solus GNOME edition,

520
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,680
historically we shipped with Dash to Dock.

521
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,280
Obviously, you know, there's been some issues

522
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,120
with getting that moved over to GNOME 40

523
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,480
to the point where they've been like,

524
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,640
eh, we're just gonna wait until 41 is out

525
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,220
before we even really bother

526
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,960
with releasing a new version of it.

527
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,320
Where like people actually use stuff like Dash to Dock

528
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,720
or Dash to Panel.

529
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,480
Like if you check screenshots,

530
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,180
most of the time of GNOME,

531
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,960
they're not using the default UI.

532
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,060
They are extended up the wazoo

533
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,100
with like system trays,

534
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,760
with impatience to reduce animation speeds

535
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
with Dash to Dock or Dash to Panel

536
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
with like app menu stuff.

537
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,040
And this whole idea that their niche

538
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,740
is just a fundamental disconnect

539
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,280
between the GNOME shell and GNOME developers

540
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,840
and their end users, I think.

541
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,700
Well, and another aspect of this is that,

542
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,920
so Chris, you mentioned that Fedora ships an extension

543
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,720
for the, you know, the watermark at the bottom right.

544
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,680
The reason why we do that is because GNOME

545
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,080
refuses to implement distro branding anywhere.

546
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,800
There's actually no support for distro branding

547
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,160
in the entire source tree of the entire desktop.

548
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,000
Yep.

549
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,840
You can't do it.

550
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,880
So you have to patch it.

551
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,800
Like we have a patch for GDM.

552
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,640
We have an override to offer an extension on GNOME shell.

553
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,040
We have to compile in extra logic

554
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,120
into GNOME initial setup.

555
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,800
We have to patch in the GNOME settings panel

556
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,520
or GNOME control center is what it's called.

557
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,960
Yeah, so it just has to do that too, just for a logo.

558
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,080
Yeah, it's just so that it will pick a logo

559
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,600
and do the right thing there.

560
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
Like the way I would describe it

561
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,400
is that GNOME considers themselves the project

562
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,200
that delivers the experience to the users.

563
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,360
And this is despite them not having

564
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,640
a direct deliverable of any kind.

565
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,920
Right, exactly.

566
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,180
And despite some people wanting to turn it into that,

567
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,040
it's definitely not intended to do that

568
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,460
because people would not be very happy

569
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,000
with the end result of that experience.

570
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,440
Yes, that is the ironic thing.

571
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,280
I mean, there's GNOME OS,

572
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
but even they admit it's not for production.

573
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,680
I mean, I think that's one of the reasons

574
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,480
why I really enjoy new releases of Fedora.

575
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,240
And so to say something positive here,

576
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,520
I tried out Fedora 35 over the weekend

577
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,040
and kept it up to date and it's got GNOME 41 in there.

578
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,740
And there is some nice things to see,

579
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,680
like something I used to have to use an extension for,

580
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,560
integrating power profiles is now just built into GNOME.

581
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,120
I love seeing that.

582
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,760
And the other thing is they have

583
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,120
a new multitask settings pane

584
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,360
that you can go into the GNOME control center

585
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,840
and go to multitasking and you can kind of configure

586
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,880
some of your options like window snapping and whatnot.

587
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,520
It's well done.

588
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,160
And on the Fedora side,

589
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,960
they've worked to enable parts of Flat Hub

590
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,440
if you enable the third party repo.

591
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,560
So now you have Flat Hub in your GNOME software search.

592
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,300
I mean, like there's really good stuff happening here.

593
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,520
Not to mention on the backend,

594
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,000
Fedora 35 is gonna ship with extremely improved

595
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,760
Nvidia and Wayland support,

596
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,840
proprietary Nvidia driver and Wayland support.

597
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,720
Huge stuff, right?

598
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,600
And so like the development is still continuing

599
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,860
and good stuff is being created,

600
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,760
but they are extremely confident in their opinion

601
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,640
on how it's being consumed

602
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,480
and what direction they need to go.

603
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,000
And I'll link to a blog post that says the truth.

604
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,960
They're not telling you about themes

605
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,080
and it's worth a read.

606
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,540
You know, so you can hear their response

607
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,600
and you can hear their side of it.

608
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,840
I'll have that linked in the show notes

609
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,420
at linuxunplug.com slash 424.

610
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,040
Thanks for joining us, Josh.

611
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,840
I'm glad that there are people like you out there

612
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,000
shaping the software and the distros

613
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,480
that the rest of us end users out there

614
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,600
are just getting to enjoy.

615
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
And there's a lot of hard and controversial decisions

616
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,880
that go into that.

617
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,040
Linode.com slash unplugged.

618
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,720
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account

619
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,760
and you go there to support the show.

620
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,240
Linode is our hosting provider.

621
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,800
You know, they started in 2003

622
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,040
and have focused on just making really great cloud hosting.

623
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,120
And now 18 years later, here they are,

624
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,780
independent and proud

625
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,960
and continuing to make awesome services

626
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,040
and now they've just grown.

627
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,640
They've got 11 data centers, nearly a million customers.

628
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,800
They've became their own ISP.

629
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,720
You know, we're about to talk about our matrix server

630
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,940
in the show and we've decided to go the route

631
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,320
of actually setting up a dedicated Linode to host matrix.

632
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,040
Typically, we'll do like a powerful Linode box

633
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,520
and then we'll run a dozen containers on there

634
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,560
or something like that,

635
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,880
hook it up to their S3 compatible object storage

636
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,440
for the backend storage.

637
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,480
And it is really super simple,

638
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,040
straightforward infrastructure to manage.

639
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,120
Man, I tell you what,

640
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,360
it is nothing like it used to be back in the day

641
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,840
and they've just nailed the interface to manage all of this.

642
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,100
So we're gonna tell you more about it,

643
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,480
but we decided to do some upgrades to our matrix server.

644
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,300
And I just love, love, love, love how simple it is

645
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,060
to increase existing volume storage

646
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,000
and then to quickly add new disks.

647
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,080
And then you click a few buttons and boom,

648
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,320
there's just this new amazing amount of disk

649
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,400
available to your Linode.

650
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,040
And it's just so straightforward.

651
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,080
And if you ever have any like spots where like,

652
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,040
I'm not actually sure what the command is now

653
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,640
to mount that new disk.

654
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,760
Well, they've just got like a little button

655
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,600
and you push that button.

656
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,520
It's like, hey, this is the command you need to run.

657
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,540
It's really straightforward.

658
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,920
Plus they have a very powerful DNS manager,

659
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,480
which we use all the time when we're moving services around

660
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,000
or testing something out.

661
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,800
They're also now offering bare metal servers.

662
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,980
That could be pretty wild

663
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,340
because they have super fast systems.

664
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,140
They have screamers of boxes.

665
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,720
So I can imagine a bare metal, I mean, I don't even know.

666
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,920
I don't know what you're doing,

667
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,760
but that's a pretty cool option to have out there.

668
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,300
And then you combine that with their super fast SSDs

669
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,840
and their super fast networking.

670
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,080
I mean, it's obvious why we just host everything there.

671
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,920
And I will admit to you that there is a bit of,

672
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,220
well, they're also part of the Linux community.

673
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,480
They're the real Linux people that really love this stuff.

674
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,680
And they have just got into this

675
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,180
for the love of the technology.

676
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,320
And I can really connect with that.

677
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,960
And I can really connect with wanting to stay independent.

678
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,520
And those are the aspects of Linode

679
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,480
that I think are not really listed on a webpage

680
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,140
or part of their dashboard UI,

681
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,800
but part of what made me comfortable leaving town

682
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,080
and knowing that my infrastructure was running on Linode.

683
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,200
And I'm really grateful that I took the time

684
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,480
to just set up a Linode to back up our on-premises server

685
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,400
that did eventually go down while I was traveling.

686
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,720
And it kept us going.

687
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,600
When the prices are 30 to 50% cheaper

688
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,480
than the major cloud hyperscaler duopolies out there,

689
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,960
like you can afford to do something like that,

690
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,080
especially if you're taking advantage of our $100 offer.

691
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,400
So go to linode.com slash unplugged,

692
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,720
get $100 a 60-day credit on a new account

693
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
and see what I've been talking about,

694
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,480
but also you support this independent production.

695
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,740
And that's pretty great.

696
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,400
You're using a service provider that loves Linux

697
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,360
to support a Linux podcast.

698
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,240
That's the kind of thing I'm talking about.

699
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,620
Linode.com slash unplugged.

700
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,620
Well, we just have a couple of more community news items.

701
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,760
I do want to give a plug for Seagull,

702
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,520
which is coming up soon and is virtual again this year,

703
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,360
which means it's not just going to be in the Seattle area.

704
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,840
Anyone can attend.

705
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,160
It's Friday and Saturday, November 5th and 6th.

706
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,840
So you have a little bit of time.

707
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,000
It's now available worldwide.

708
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You can go over to their website and get all the details.

709
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,520
It's at Seagull.org, and it started back in 2013.

710
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,800
And now it's grown to have over 50 presentations, four keynotes.

711
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,120
It's got a career workshop.

712
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,640
I want to double mention that, actually,

713
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,560
because I've heard good things about that from our audience.

714
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,040
And they also have the Cascadia Community Builder Award.

715
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,800
And it's in its ninth year now.

716
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,080
And it's one of those, it's like Linux Fest Northwest.

717
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,640
It's a grassroots, free, labor, open-source culture event.

718
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,640
Meaning, if you're just kind of getting into the system

719
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,240
or you want to learn more about the free software world,

720
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,840
it's a great way to get started.

721
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,360
The free software world, it's a great event for that.

722
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,920
And because it's virtual, it's something you can try out.

723
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,080
Try it before you buy now.

724
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,440
Yeah, it really is just a friendly, welcoming spot.

725
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,320
It does kind of, in some ways, feel like the early days.

726
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,520
It's still growing.

727
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,320
It's still a rather small community.

728
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,000
It's just a great place to get some Linux and free culture

729
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,840
content.

730
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,520
There's another.

731
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,840
Isn't the open-source summit coming up really soon, too,

732
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,560
in our area?

733
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,680
It is, yeah.

734
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,720
At the end of this month, is it this week?

735
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,840
Well, I got back just at the right time, didn't I?

736
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,720
Like, these events are kicking off now.

737
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,260
And I think that one's actually going

738
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,120
to be an in-person and virtual mix event.

739
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,520
So that could be worth checking out.

740
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,560
It's September 27 through Thursday, September 30.

741
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,520
We have a friend coming in town that I'm hoping we,

742
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,000
I need to email.

743
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,880
And you and I can maybe take out to dinner.

744
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,840
So that could be great.

745
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,360
It is nice to be back.

746
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,960
You know, we made it back last Thursday.

747
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,560
You survived the brutal heat of the West.

748
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,200
Oh, man.

749
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,440
What a summer to go on a summer road trip.

750
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,640
That was a mistake.

751
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,880
Talk about mistake number one, going during the summer that's

752
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,080
like the hottest summer of my life.

753
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,000
That was dumb.

754
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,120
But of course, it really came down

755
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,760
to when the kids were out of school, right?

756
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,000
Which is during the summer, so.

757
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,040
You had a lot of factors.

758
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,220
You had a damaged slide.

759
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,640
I mean, what's a man to do?

760
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:37,960
Right.

761
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,760
And we ended up with the broken suspension.

762
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,920
So last week's episode, wow, was it just last week

763
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,560
where I was stranded in Tucson?

764
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:44,920
Whoa.

765
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,520
Yes, it was.

766
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,800
That's wild.

767
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,200
Jeez, a lot has happened in the last week.

768
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,080
So we made it to a suspension shop the day after the show

769
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,160
last week.

770
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,160
They mostly fixed us up and got us down the road.

771
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,760
We made just a beeline for the California coast, which

772
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,240
meant we had to go through like some of the hottest

773
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,700
areas for a while.

774
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,240
It was brutal for a couple of days.

775
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,960
I don't think there was a day for the first couple of days

776
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,720
we left Tucson.

777
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,880
The first two days, I don't think

778
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,120
it went below 90 at night.

779
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,920
And I don't think it was below 102 during the day.

780
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,040
And for extra fun, the dash AC went caputs again on Lady Joop.

781
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,720
So I had just hot air blown on me.

782
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
It was brutal.

783
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,400
But we pulled through.

784
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,900
We made it.

785
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,880
And we made a beeline for Highway 101.

786
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,160
We kind of bypassed San Francisco.

787
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,240
And we bypassed Los Angeles and went on a new route

788
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,560
that we'd never taken before and got to Highway 101, where

789
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,420
it was glorious.

790
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,940
It was like 60 degrees.

791
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,480
And it was nice to see the Pacific Ocean again.

792
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,760
That was really, that felt pretty special.

793
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,800
And we ended up winding our way up the coast

794
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,480
with a half-broken suspension system

795
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,880
when we got to our shop in Southern Oregon.

796
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,780
And they did discover the mistake

797
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,480
that they had made when they installed it the first time.

798
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,780
So they fixed it under warranty.

799
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,280
And while we were there, we had a couple of extra suspension

800
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,520
parts upgraded.

801
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,360
So in a way, Joops is better than ever now.

802
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,720
I wish I could have done that work before the road trip.

803
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,680
But we didn't need to get done.

804
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,880
So that's what it is.

805
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,760
And now we're back.

806
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,280
I've been reflecting on the meetups.

807
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,200
They were awesome.

808
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,600
Brent, you made it to both of them.

809
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,360
Wes, you made it to the Denver meetup.

810
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,440
I mean, I think they were both just fantastic.

811
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,520
The Denver meetup was one of our best ever, I think.

812
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,280
I think they were more than awesome.

813
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,320
It totally outpaced my expectations.

814
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,680
It was incredible to be surrounded by what?

815
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,600
It was like someone counted like 90 people in Denver

816
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,520
or something like that.

817
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,320
It was amazing.

818
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,840
Yeah, something like that.

819
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,040
Something close to 100.

820
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
I don't know exactly, because people were coming and going.

821
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,720
And people from all over the world, too,

822
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,600
which was incredible.

823
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,520
I didn't expect that at all.

824
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,760
I thought it was going to just be sort of local folks,

825
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,520
but all over the place.

826
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,680
You think you're already impressed with the audience,

827
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,400
and then something like Denver.

828
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,440
I know, really.

829
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,560
Salt Lake City was great.

830
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,160
The micro meetups were great.

831
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,880
But Denver was such a unique experience,

832
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,680
because there were so many people there.

833
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,200
And there was just such good conversations.

834
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,880
There is a nice thing about getting

835
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,600
to reconnect with people in real life

836
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,640
and having a common set of interests,

837
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,040
like open source and the shows.

838
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,480
So we have immediately a whole just incredible wealth

839
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,120
of things to talk about.

840
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,200
And that's really cool.

841
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,440
You don't generally just meet a stranger

842
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,320
and have two hours worth of conversation material.

843
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,680
It's a special experience.

844
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,320
I found that actually difficult, because I didn't get a chance

845
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,240
to talk to very many people, because there were so

846
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,600
many great conversations happening.

847
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,800
I got a list of 10 people that I was like, god, next time.

848
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,200
But I feel like it was exactly what we needed.

849
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,400
And then for me personally, we got to have a family road trip.

850
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,480
We got to have Brent come along for a bit.

851
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:39,980
Uncle Brent.

852
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,840
There was all those elements, right?

853
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,560
Uncle Brent came along for a little while,

854
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,320
and that was nice.

855
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,160
I got the badge.

856
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,880
Yeah, you did.

857
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,320
It was exactly what we needed.

858
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,600
And I think also it was nice for our team, the Jupiter

859
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,940
broadcasting team, to reconnect.

860
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,520
As many of us who could make it, we

861
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,920
got to hang out at the Airbnb and just chill for a bit

862
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,020
with each other and see each other in our pajamas,

863
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,840
all that kind of stuff, and our bed hair.

864
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,280
Yeah, the kind of just staying familiar and chatting

865
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,800
about non-show stuff that you don't always get to in a busy

866
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,760
show-filled week.

867
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,320
Right.

868
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,840
Yeah.

869
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,080
It was really our first chance to get together

870
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,720
since going independent a year ago,

871
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,520
because it's been lockdowns and stuff.

872
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,120
We haven't had a chance to really get together and kind

873
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,400
of acknowledge that here we are now as this meta team working

874
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,640
together still after a lot of things have changed.

875
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,140
And it's not all of us, and not all of us could make it,

876
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,320
but it's still a core of us.

877
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,640
And that was really nice to see.

878
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,080
Keeps the fire alive.

879
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,240
Yeah, so that was great.

880
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,680
But we're home, and I am packing up my home base this week

881
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,160
because we're moving out.

882
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,280
I don't know where to yet.

883
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,820
So I'm going to be figuring that out over the next few weeks.

884
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,440
But it's good to be back in the area.

885
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,440
It's so nice to be back in the studio.

886
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,400
I heard you were thinking Tucson.

887
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,480
Never, never, never.

888
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,600
All right, let's do a little matrix update.

889
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,920
IRC is great.

890
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,640
I mean, don't take this the wrong way.

891
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,600
I'm not taking away from your preferred chat platform.

892
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,680
How dare you?

893
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,240
I know, we still have a IRC chat room, really.

894
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,520
But I'm just getting more and more of a sense

895
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,000
that the free software community is adopting Matrix

896
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,080
at a faster and faster clip.

897
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,960
We've talked about Matrix before on the show,

898
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,420
and they recently had an announcement

899
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,640
about a transition they're making from communities

900
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,080
to spaces.

901
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,300
And I just wasn't really ready to talk about it on the show

902
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,480
because I have been unable to wrap my head around what it

903
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,360
really is.

904
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,480
And I went to the Matrix blog this morning

905
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,440
to try to reread their announcement.

906
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,640
And honestly, it just doesn't make any sense for me

907
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,560
because it sounds like you can have

908
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,400
spaces, which are essentially community pages that

909
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,840
can link to other channels.

910
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,360
And it's called a space.

911
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,600
And so you can have a space that is a Matrix spaces.

912
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,500
And then you can have multiple spaces,

913
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,320
like we could have a Linux unplugged space,

914
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,320
and we could have a self-hosted space,

915
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,000
and we could have a Jupiter broadcasting metaspace.

916
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,520
And those would all be spaces that link to spaces,

917
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,180
but they're individually called space.

918
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,520
And I find the entire thing absolutely confusing.

919
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,720
So we were chatting in a Luplug with Gamma about Matrix.

920
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,380
And I said, hold on, hold on, hold on.

921
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,680
Let's record it for the show.

922
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,040
So spoiler, this is actually happening on a Sunday,

923
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,800
this part, this recording.

924
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,720
Gamma, can you give me a high-level understanding

925
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,280
of what Matrix spaces are and when

926
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,320
I would want to create a space?

927
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,520
So Matrix spaces are basically glorified folders.

928
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,400
They let you group rooms, either that you own

929
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,560
or maybe that someone else owns.

930
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,760
Just collect them together into a single folder

931
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,840
in your element UI or another client's UI.

932
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,680
Wow.

933
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,040
OK.

934
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
So you can start, right?

935
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,840
It looks like there's both private and public spaces.

936
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,240
But you can kind of start with just making a private space

937
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,160
where you might collect, like if you're

938
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,520
in multiple communities in mod, you

939
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,580
could collect all your mod channels right there

940
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,300
in one space.

941
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,100
Or if you had different feedback for each of the shows

942
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,440
or something, you could have one feedback space, maybe.

943
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,080
Oh.

944
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,520
Yeah, so I thought maybe you should

945
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,000
try making a space for yourself.

946
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,720
I'll do it right now.

947
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,280
All right.

948
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,880
So I am on the beta version of Element to get this working.

949
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,720
The web UI.

950
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,600
Yeah, on the web UI.

951
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,680
But it's really easy to get going there.

952
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,760
And you can also go to, what is it, develop.element.io

953
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,620
if you want to check it out, or develop.element.io.

954
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,240
So first, I'm going to create a space.

955
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,640
So I can create a public space or a private space.

956
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,560
What do you think?

957
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,000
You can probably just start with a private one

958
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,200
since you don't know what you're doing.

959
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
I like your idea of making a feedback space.

960
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,440
So maybe I'll do feedback.

961
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,640
And this could be like the different feedback

962
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,320
channels we have.

963
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,820
Right.

964
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,280
Oh, this is OK.

965
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,640
I'm getting this.

966
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,960
And so it needs a description.

967
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,120
So I'll call it where people tend to yell at me.

968
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,800
OK.

969
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,100
Go ahead and put that in there.

970
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,480
Oh, I got a couple extra yells I need to put in that one.

971
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,360
Yell.

972
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,920
Don't forget the exclamation point.

973
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,360
Oh, yeah, you're right.

974
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,160
Yeah, there we go.

975
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,000
OK, so I create that.

976
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,520
And I can upload a picture too.

977
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,040
Looks like you can even upload a GIF.

978
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,680
Oh, my.

979
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,040
So who are you working with?

980
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,320
So make sure the right people have access to feedback.

981
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,280
Huh.

982
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,880
I can do just me, which is a private space.

983
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,520
I can do me and my teammates a private space for you

984
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,320
and your teammates.

985
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,240
I'm going to do that.

986
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,000
There's also some version maybe we end up

987
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,640
with a Jupiter broadcasting sort of back end matrix space

988
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,020
or set up or channels.

989
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,640
Yeah.

990
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,200
Oh, well, that seems like the way I'd want it is I'd want it

991
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,000
for everybody then.

992
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,040
So you're saying if I made it, oh, so I don't understand.

993
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,000
Isn't this going to be essentially server side

994
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,240
if I invite everybody to it?

995
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,040
Yeah, I suppose so.

996
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,560
All right, OK.

997
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,080
I don't know.

998
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,680
I've only made one space so far.

999
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,640
What's interesting, though, is I wanted to invite you.

1000
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,440
But now it wants me to put in your email address.

1001
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,200
But I don't know off the top of my head what email address.

1002
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,520
I mean, I have a good guess.

1003
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,560
But I don't know off the top of my head

1004
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,680
what email address you used with your matrix account.

1005
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,280
I don't either.

1006
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,080
And I wouldn't know that for anybody, right?

1007
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,200
I know their matrix username.

1008
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,440
Is it asking for their email?

1009
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,160
Yeah.

1010
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,480
Looks like at the bottom there's an invite by username.

1011
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,640
Oh, Wes is right.

1012
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,120
Great.

1013
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,040
Out at the bottom I can invite.

1014
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,720
OK, great.

1015
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,840
So I'm going to bring I can bring Wes in there.

1016
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,360
Great.

1017
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,160
I'll bring some of the other guys in.

1018
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
That should probably be flipped.

1019
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,720
It should be invite by user by default.

1020
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,200
Yeah, but either way, I figured it out, right?

1021
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,560
You're right.

1022
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,120
I got caught up on it because I was looking at the default.

1023
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,320
But you can go dig around.

1024
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,200
So I just invited you.

1025
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,680
OK.

1026
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,880
And then I'll say skip for now, because otherwise I

1027
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,960
can't move on.

1028
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,720
Yep, I've got a feedback invitation.

1029
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,800
I can reject or accept.

1030
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
It tells me it's a private space.

1031
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,720
So now I can create a room.

1032
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,320
And then you can also add rooms.

1033
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,240
So maybe we'll do like, what should we call it?

1034
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,560
We'll call this general share room name random.

1035
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,040
OK, fine.

1036
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,480
Creating the room.

1037
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,400
And now I can see suggested rooms.

1038
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,600
We have general and random, and I can.

1039
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,600
I still don't really understand what I'm looking at here.

1040
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,040
So now it's created rooms for us that are part of this space.

1041
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,040
So it's like subnested rooms is what we've just made.

1042
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,960
So what is the difference between a community,

1043
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,240
which is what it used to be in matrix, to now what

1044
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,320
is called a space?

1045
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,920
Like, are they essentially serving the same purpose

1046
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,040
where it's a landing page that you can now

1047
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,040
create for yourself or room admins can set up for the room?

1048
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,360
Help me understand this, Gamma.

1049
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,680
They're effectively the same.

1050
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,840
The main reason why they went away from the old community

1051
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,080
style was that the matrix devs found that they were

1052
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,360
re-implementing the same types of rules,

1053
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,760
the same types of administration, protocol,

1054
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,920
et cetera, just redoing everything for communities

1055
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,040
that they had already done for their rooms.

1056
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
So what they decided was, you know what?

1057
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,000
We're just going to trash communities,

1058
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,600
and we'll just make a special type of room.

1059
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,920
It just works like a normal room,

1060
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,120
but it just has these special flags in it

1061
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,600
that say, hey, I'm actually a folder and not a room.

1062
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,120
Ah, and I see here, so I was looking in the room settings,

1063
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,520
and by default here, it's set with anyone in a space

1064
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,320
can find and join.

1065
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,760
So spaces with access feedback.

1066
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
So for the moment, it is just private.

1067
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,080
It kind of works how you'd expect.

1068
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,380
OK, I'm starting to get it now.

1069
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:47,520
So it shows up in my sidebar as a separate instance, almost.

1070
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,880
Like, I have our main chat here, and then I have a,

1071
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,440
now I have a dedicated entry for this feedback space

1072
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,320
that we created.

1073
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,120
And I'm starting to see the benefit of that

1074
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,000
is if you had people on multiple servers

1075
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,920
that didn't normally coalesce in some of those rooms,

1076
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,120
we could bring them into this space

1077
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,240
and just have this set of rooms that they would see.

1078
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,040
It's like cross-server collaboration space as well.

1079
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,360
Yeah, and you can add spaces.

1080
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,840
You can add rooms.

1081
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,120
I think what's interesting to my mind,

1082
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,080
reading through that, I can try to think of it

1083
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,200
from the developer side, and it's

1084
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,840
almost like you've exposed yourself

1085
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,240
to all the underpinnings you would need to build something

1086
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,760
like Discord right with Matrix.

1087
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,840
And so to some extent, that shifts where that boundary is.

1088
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,680
And I think part of the problem is you

1089
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,240
can build your own private Discord server in a space.

1090
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:31,960
Yeah, exactly.

1091
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,600
And that means that we're kind of taking

1092
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,760
on some of the admin layer of how,

1093
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,480
because this is so flexible and it's not necessarily clear

1094
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,760
as you've discovered what exactly you can do,

1095
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,440
part of that is because you can build it

1096
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,280
in so many different ways depending on what

1097
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,440
you actually want to do.

1098
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,720
Yeah, OK.

1099
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,360
I'm starting to wrap my head around it.

1100
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,040
So Gamma, I'm wondering if you have any opinions, at least

1101
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,640
your personal opinion, on maybe how

1102
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,240
Jupyter Broadcasting could utilize a matrix space

1103
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,840
or multiple spaces, I suppose?

1104
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
Certainly, you can take the lessons

1105
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,560
you've learned from the self-hosted Discord server.

1106
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,240
In Discord, you have various channels

1107
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,680
which are used to discuss general chat, off-topic chat,

1108
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,760
talk about the show itself.

1109
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,120
The equivalent in Matrix is a room.

1110
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,880
So you could create multiple rooms,

1111
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,640
put them all within a Linux-unplugged space

1112
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,400
if they're all related to that show,

1113
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,200
and then put the Linux-unplugged space within this bigger

1114
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,160
net of Jupyter Broadcasting.

1115
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,920
That is a fantastic idea, because you

1116
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,400
get all the benefits of it's nice with, say,

1117
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,560
the self-hosted Discord.

1118
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,680
The reason why I think it's been kind of successful

1119
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,000
is because that kind of topic, self-hosting,

1120
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,760
there's a ton of different channels

1121
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,440
that seem appropriate for that particular topic.

1122
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,040
And it would just sort of blast Matrix

1123
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,480
to just create everything in one Jupyter Broadcasting area.

1124
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,880
But creating individual spaces for the shows

1125
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,400
kind of lets you get that benefit

1126
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,240
while still taking advantage of everything

1127
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,040
being connected, because it's part of a larger space.

1128
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,920
I'm getting it.

1129
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,200
I think the terminology is complicated.

1130
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,160
And I think that matters more than we give it credit

1131
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,120
in our technical community.

1132
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,720
And I think that kind of complicated language

1133
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,440
is a friction point that turns people off.

1134
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,240
But our community doesn't seem to mind it.

1135
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,040
And I see a lot of your laughing over there.

1136
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,120
No, no, I mean, I can't argue with that.

1137
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,600
It seems like, slowly, the paths through the UX and the UI

1138
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,440
are improving and getting a refined layer at the top.

1139
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,840
But you still see a lot of the plumbing.

1140
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,960
Well, we touched on permissions with spaces a little bit

1141
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,760
there, but, Gamma, it sounds like there

1142
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,600
might be some future improvements making

1143
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,960
this work a little bit smoother.

1144
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,280
Yes, it's very true.

1145
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,480
Currently, a room can either be public or private.

1146
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,320
But private rooms mean that you have to get an invite

1147
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,560
in order to join.

1148
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,240
But if you're already a member of a space

1149
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,160
and you want to join a private room inside of it,

1150
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,040
there's actually a proposal that will just let that happen

1151
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,600
for free without an invite.

1152
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,440
Yeah, I can see how that might be useful.

1153
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,840
Otherwise, you have to sort of manually add everyone

1154
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,440
at the onboarding time or someone

1155
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,520
has to handle making sure all those permissions transfer.

1156
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,120
But if you are maintaining something

1157
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,680
like a trusted space already and you just

1158
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,400
want to have a bunch of private rooms in it,

1159
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,720
that might work a lot better.

1160
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,760
I would imagine there's probably going

1161
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,220
to be a lot of areas of improvement

1162
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,240
as more and more people adopt this feature.

1163
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,440
It still seems like it's not really even fully rolled out

1164
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:13,920
yet.

1165
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,280
So we probably even really haven't seen the bulk of feedback

1166
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,440
that the team's going to get once more people start using

1167
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,080
Spaces.

1168
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,780
Yes, and it seems like, as always,

1169
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,400
the biggest problem right here is

1170
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,200
a little bit of communication and a little bit of UX.

1171
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,640
Well, Gamma, thank you for helping us do at least

1172
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,640
a little bit of an update on what's going on with Matrix.

1173
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,080
But there is a ton of stuff going on all the time.

1174
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,640
And you've got a couple of resources

1175
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,120
people could follow up on if they

1176
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,120
want to dive deeper into the going ons with Matrix.

1177
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,000
Of course.

1178
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,800
I highly recommend checking out This Week in Matrix.

1179
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,600
It's a feed of all the fun projects, all the neat stuff

1180
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,960
that people are doing in Matrix, clients, servers, bridges,

1181
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,720
bots, everything.

1182
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,780
Also, there is Matrix Live, which

1183
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:01,400
is a weekly show with the team on Matrix or Synapse

1184
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,600
or Elements doing deep dives into various topics.

1185
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,800
And finally, just a personal interest,

1186
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,760
there is a channel that was mentioned

1187
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,240
during one of the This Weeks in Matrix called Beyond Chat,

1188
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,680
which talks about various uses for Matrix beyond chat.

1189
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,880
Thank you to Gamma for taking a little bit of time

1190
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,280
on his Sunday.

1191
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,000
MiniMech was there with us, too.

1192
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,660
And what were your first impressions

1193
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,240
of setting up spaces, MiniMech?

1194
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,680
Yeah, so after the conversation you had with Gamma,

1195
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,600
I enabled in the element client I used,

1196
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,520
I enabled the beta channel, which

1197
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,320
allows me to have these spaces.

1198
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,720
So that is pretty easy.

1199
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,800
So Gamma was kindly linking his space in the Loblog channel.

1200
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,600
So once you click on that, you get a pop-up window

1201
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,160
that allows you to enable the beta channel

1202
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,720
to have the spaces.

1203
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,680
Once I did this, then it was like seeing is understanding.

1204
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,800
So what you get is an additional panel with a home icon,

1205
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,520
where you'll find all the rooms and private conversations

1206
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,540
you had before.

1207
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,480
And underneath, I got that Gamma channel or Gamma space,

1208
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,760
how to say, where I got all the proposition that Gamma

1209
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,040
put in in that space.

1210
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,200
So for me, that element client is a little bit cluttered.

1211
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,600
But with this, it was very interesting to see.

1212
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,880
It was quite easy to navigate.

1213
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,360
And then I started to understand that.

1214
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,640
And then so I went further.

1215
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,120
So I created my own space, private space.

1216
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,760
And I put in all the JPMetrix channels in it.

1217
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,160
And what I saw is that they disappear from the home channel.

1218
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,920
And they appear in that private space

1219
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,880
I did for Jupiter broadcasting, although there

1220
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:48,720
is a feature that you can make them pop up again in the home.

1221
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,040
And so I was able to group all these channels.

1222
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,520
And that was really easy.

1223
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,120
So I get all the notifications now.

1224
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,000
I get them in the JB space.

1225
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,400
And I can click on that and have all the channels grouped there.

1226
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,840
That's nice when you're part of many communities.

1227
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,000
Yeah, that's really true.

1228
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,280
Just one thing I want to add, once you

1229
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,880
start to play with these private channels

1230
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,600
and once you decide to remove or delete that space again,

1231
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,560
there's one thing you might give a little bit of attention to.

1232
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,880
If you just leave the space, you get a pop-up.

1233
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,040
And if you don't really make attention,

1234
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,880
you're leaving all the rooms that are in that space.

1235
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,520
So a good thing is you go to your private space,

1236
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,720
and then you detach all the rooms

1237
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,680
you had in your private space.

1238
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,360
They will reappear in home.

1239
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,440
And then in the end, you leave the space.

1240
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,080
I see.

1241
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:41,680
Otherwise.

1242
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,240
That's good to know.

1243
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah, it's good to know.

1244
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,040
Otherwise, it might happen that all of a sudden,

1245
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,960
you leave a room where you have administration or moderator

1246
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,040
rights in, right?

1247
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,040
I agree with you, though.

1248
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,360
I felt like it did help organize it a little bit better.

1249
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,960
And in a way, it offered some decluttering of the UI

1250
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,200
and made it easier to sort out the different matrix

1251
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,280
communities that I'm part of.

1252
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,880
Yeah, I really agree with you.

1253
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,240
So all in all, I can say it's a really good thing.

1254
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,400
Even though it is more that you see on your client,

1255
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,120
it makes it easier to navigate.

1256
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,840
So I'm a big fan.

1257
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,920
And I see I'm waiting for an official Jupyter broadcasting

1258
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,920
space to have all my channels grouped.

1259
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,600
Well, that brings us to the next topic.

1260
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,920
So Kernel has volunteered to take

1261
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,760
on the project of setting up JB spaces.

1262
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,080
And I'm sure, Kernel, you must have a few ideas.

1263
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,520
But we probably could stand for some suggestions, too.

1264
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,640
Yeah, so if anyone has any input on how

1265
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,000
they would like those spaces set up, architected,

1266
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,240
any kind of feedback regarding JB spaces,

1267
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,360
go ahead and just drop that into the LUP feedback channel

1268
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,760
on Matrix.

1269
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,400
Or I'm sure you can email the show.

1270
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,280
And Chris will pass that along to me as well.

1271
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,440
Yep, linuxunplugged.com slash contact for that.

1272
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,160
And it's nice to see our Matrix community slowly and steadily

1273
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,240
grow, even though we don't talk about it a ton on the show.

1274
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,000
We do have our Matrix server info at linuxunplugged.com

1275
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,480
slash Matrix if you would like to get on board.

1276
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,080
And it's a nice way to get your toes wet with Matrix

1277
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,040
if you haven't yet, because we have a very friendly community

1278
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,520
that's focused around the content of these shows.

1279
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,480
So it's a nice way to dip your toes.

1280
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,480
So Kernel will be monitoring that LUP Lug chat room.

1281
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,840
And that's one of the channels on our Matrix server

1282
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,680
over there.

1283
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,140
And thank you, Kernel, for doing that.

1284
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,280
But speaking of Matrix and our server,

1285
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,320
I just wanted to give a quick update.

1286
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,640
Like I've mentioned before, we do run it on a dedicated Linode

1287
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,120
box.

1288
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,760
And we did that because the Synapse server is kind of new.

1289
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,800
But Wes, you did a little sleuthing

1290
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,720
and discovered that our Synapse server, that's

1291
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,160
the server side of Matrix, is taking up a considerable chunk

1292
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160
of storage right now.

1293
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,440
Yeah, it is.

1294
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,320
You might think out of the gate that, oh,

1295
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,480
is there just a lot of fun GIFs or other things posted

1296
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,760
on the server?

1297
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,680
I mean, there's a few.

1298
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,920
But only six gigs was Synapse user data,

1299
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,160
media files, both for local and remote stuff in the cache.

1300
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,000
That's not bad.

1301
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,360
The main bit of disk space use was about 56 gigs worth

1302
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,040
in Synapse's Postgres database.

1303
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,440
Oh, 56 gigs worth of database, huh?

1304
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,440
Jeez.

1305
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,760
What is that, just like chat log and stuff?

1306
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,920
Well, you tell me.

1307
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,040
I'll give you the schema.

1308
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,440
No, I mean, there's a lot of stuff

1309
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,880
to keep track of in Matrix.

1310
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,760
And because it's federated, we get a lot of information,

1311
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,200
some of the biggest sort of lists of state groups

1312
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,760
and the state group state is one of the tables in there

1313
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,560
that has a lot of that data.

1314
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,040
A lot of the rows in there are for the main matrix.org home

1315
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,320
server, for instance.

1316
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,360
There are some tools out there that I could find to help,

1317
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,240
like a Rust tool, in fact, that can help you compress

1318
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,440
some of that data down and make it a little simpler

1319
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,280
to navigate through.

1320
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,560
But that's not exactly quick.

1321
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,440
So I've done it for a couple of the tables.

1322
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,080
Really, we probably need to script it up

1323
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,400
to run against the whole database

1324
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,680
or the majority of the tables taking up the most space

1325
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,080
to get there.

1326
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,480
Really, the point of this is that, you know,

1327
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,480
if you're setting up synapse with a fair number of users,

1328
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,600
you're going to have to take care of it.

1329
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,800
Yeah, no kidding.

1330
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,800
Yeah, as we've discovered, it's a serious thing

1331
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,800
to run it in production.

1332
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,720
It's no joke at all.

1333
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,240
And so we've thought about, like,

1334
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,280
what can we do to address this growing problem?

1335
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,880
And we did, honestly, you guys know us,

1336
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,520
we toyed around with the idea of just moving it to like an S3

1337
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,000
Fuse file system and just throw it at object storage.

1338
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,080
But neither one of us have seen a lot of success stories

1339
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,960
about Postgres running its database off of S3 object

1340
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,920
storage on a Fuse file system.

1341
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,640
So we weren't like really super ready to jump on that one yet.

1342
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,640
Maybe if we hear good things.

1343
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,680
So what we decided to do was just

1344
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,800
go the route of adding a larger disk to the Linode.

1345
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,080
We just gave it more disk.

1346
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,840
Yeah, really saved by Linode and making it easy for us

1347
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,680
to do that, right?

1348
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,360
So yeah, kind of just moved over the volume

1349
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,880
from where it was on the original disk

1350
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,360
and now Postgres is happily running with more stuff

1351
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,320
to spare, which will make it easier as we go to try

1352
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,960
to compress the database a little bit more,

1353
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,880
do some maintenance on it as well.

1354
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,440
And I should just say, I'm no matrix admin,

1355
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,960
no synapse admin for sure, we're learning as we're going.

1356
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,080
And so if there's some essential tips out there

1357
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,520
that we've missed for how to keep our database clean

1358
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,760
and tidy, we're all ears.

1359
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,920
Yeah, let us know.

1360
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,160
I think it makes sense to put that database though

1361
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,920
on its own disk so it's not taking up space

1362
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,280
that the root file system is also sharing.

1363
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,680
It's better to have that moved over.

1364
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,440
And it also gave us a chance to do all the system updates

1365
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,880
and update synapse to the latest version

1366
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,360
and get all of that kind of maintenance stuff done.

1367
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,960
We're gonna vacuum the database a little bit.

1368
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,400
You gotta keep it tidy, re-index things here and there.

1369
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,600
And I will say, I mean, there are some,

1370
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,240
it does take up some energy,

1371
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,520
especially with more users on there.

1372
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,040
It does do some work and use Postgres to the max.

1373
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,440
But other than that, it really isn't a big deal to run.

1374
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,440
I've been very pleased.

1375
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,560
All of our updates have been pretty much seamless.

1376
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,520
We just go and find the latest release

1377
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,480
on their GitHub channel, pull down the new image for that.

1378
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,160
And it's been perfect.

1379
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,120
Yeah, next week we're gonna say some bad things

1380
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,080
about NetData, but this week I'll add

1381
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,880
from a positive thing, I'm foreshadowing,

1382
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,080
but for this week, I'm gonna say,

1383
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,000
NetData has been a nice tool here.

1384
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Linode has some built-in alerts, which are nice.

1385
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,800
And then NetData has some built-in alerts,

1386
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,240
which have been nice to let us know

1387
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,320
when we're using a lot of memory,

1388
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,480
a synapse is known to do,

1389
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,120
or when we've needed to address these issues

1390
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,000
and stay on top of it.

1391
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,480
And so all in all, even though it's a little memory hungry,

1392
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,400
it even was a little memory leaky sometimes,

1393
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,880
and it's been very disc hungry.

1394
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,600
It's been fairly reliable, I think,

1395
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,560
just by throwing some of these tools at it.

1396
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,560
And like Wes said, neither one of us are synapse admins,

1397
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,840
but we've managed to muddle our way through so far.

1398
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,920
And we do love your pro tips.

1399
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,640
But you know what, Wes,

1400
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,280
speaking of doing a little bit of vacuuming,

1401
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,800
let's do some housekeeping here in the show.

1402
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,280
I think it's time to clean up a little bit.

1403
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,640
First of all, I wanna say thank you to all of our members

1404
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,720
over at unpluggedcore.com.

1405
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,720
I wanted to mention there is a live stream feed option

1406
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,080
for our members.

1407
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,000
And some weeks, like some recent weeks,

1408
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,840
I felt like some of our best content has been

1409
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,600
on the live stream before we've hit record.

1410
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,960
Like this episode, I feel like we blew

1411
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,360
two really solid pre-shows.

1412
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,040
And we haven't even done the post-show yet.

1413
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,400
So there's basically an entire additional show's

1414
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,000
worth of content for our members at unpluggedcore.com.

1415
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,040
We also have the limited ad feed over there.

1416
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,480
But in that, you get a tighter version of the show.

1417
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,480
So I like to point people to the limited ad feed

1418
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,040
if you've got limited time.

1419
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,160
Just a little tighter show.

1420
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,120
You know, you still get all of Joe's edits

1421
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,800
and touch-ups to audio.

1422
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,920
Just a tighter production.

1423
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,880
The live feed version's like the opposite of that.

1424
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,880
It's all of our screw-ups, everything we cut, and more.

1425
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,080
And there are plenty.

1426
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,880
So you can get that and hear it all

1427
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,200
just by going to unpluggedcore.com and becoming a member.

1428
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,600
And then you get the warm fuzzies for supporting the show.

1429
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,800
You also heard us mention it earlier,

1430
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,480
but the Luplug rolls every Sunday.

1431
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,200
You can get in our mumble room, hang out in the lobby,

1432
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,480
and chat with like-minded folks,

1433
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,400
and get details at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble.

1434
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,040
It's noon Pacific, and we have the details

1435
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,640
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

1436
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,720
in your local time zone.

1437
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,960
So you can go over there and get it converted

1438
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,120
and then join the Luplug and hang out.

1439
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,680
Wes and I are gonna try to pop in there

1440
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,160
before land from time to time.

1441
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,320
We can't do it every week, but we are gonna try.

1442
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,680
Just because it's a lot of fun, honestly.

1443
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,320
I mean, if we didn't have a show to record,

1444
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,520
that's what we would be doing.

1445
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,360
Absolutely.

1446
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,440
That's well put.

1447
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,000
And it's nice to chat with people and share ideas

1448
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,800
and see what people are thinking on and working on.

1449
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,680
And that's all every Sunday.

1450
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,440
linuxunplugged.com slash mumble for that.

1451
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,400
And then once you get it set up,

1452
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,520
you can also join the show on Tuesdays when we're live.

1453
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,600
So think about that.

1454
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,880
Become an internet star.

1455
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,480
Before we get out of here this week,

1456
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,000
I do have a different kind of pick.

1457
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,720
I decided to put this in the pick segment

1458
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,080
and not an actual review,

1459
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:41,080
because I only got half a day with this particular pick.

1460
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,680
And so I felt like it's more of a,

1461
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,440
hey, check this out, but not like a review.

1462
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,120
It's got, hey, this has potential,

1463
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,960
but I appreciate you sharing the limitations

1464
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,160
of what you're about to say and try to convince us of.

1465
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,400
Every now and then, Prospector Chris comes out.

1466
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,600
Back in my day, there was something called compiz.

1467
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,120
And I loved compiz and barrel

1468
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,280
and having my windows burn up and-

1469
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,640
Wobble to the max.

1470
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,960
Wobble to the max, the desktop cube.

1471
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,560
I could turn a lot of that on these days in Plasma,

1472
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,880
but I don't.

1473
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,040
And there was a feel to using compiz, a smoothness,

1474
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,160
just this total kind of like

1475
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,520
always felt responsive kind of aspect.

1476
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,720
And so I wanted to point you over to a project

1477
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,040
that's recapturing a lot of that.

1478
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,240
It's called Wayfire.

1479
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,360
It's a compositor based on WL roots.

1480
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,840
And its aim is to create a customizable, extensible,

1481
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,800
and lightweight environment without sacrificing appearance.

1482
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,320
Oh.

1483
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,720
And really it's inspired by compiz.

1484
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,400
And it has a lot of that kind of stuff,

1485
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,000
especially if you go the easy route like I did,

1486
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,800
and you go get Garuda Linux Wayfire edition.

1487
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,400
We talked about Garuda Linux recently.

1488
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,560
Well, one of the versions they have

1489
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,840
is one that uses Wayfire right out of the box.

1490
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:02,640
And they turn it up to 11 as Garuda is to do.

1491
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,360
And so like you've got the brain windows

1492
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,040
and the spinning desktop cube,

1493
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,120
just all that fun stuff.

1494
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,080
It's just a lot of fun to play around for a day.

1495
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,200
I don't know if you'd want to live there,

1496
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,920
but it's a great place to visit.

1497
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,400
And so you could go grab Wayfire,

1498
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,920
or if you just want to take the easy route,

1499
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,320
go get the Garuda Wayfire edition,

1500
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,880
which we'll have linked in the show notes.

1501
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,760
Dang it, I'm going to have to install this.

1502
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,440
Yeah, it just feels like a high performance

1503
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,480
desktop environment.

1504
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,440
And I think to myself, you know, when this hits 1.0,

1505
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,440
maybe I should come real estate shopping.

1506
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,000
If you do the Twitter thing,

1507
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,920
you can follow this show at Linux Unplugged.

1508
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,920
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

1509
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,000
And of course we have an entire fantastic podcast network

1510
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,960
at Jupiterbroadcasting.com with shows like Self Hosted,

1511
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,440
Linux Action News, Coder Radio, This Here Program,

1512
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,200
and who knows, maybe even more.

1513
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,080
And make sure you're catching Linux Action News

1514
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,880
because there's stuff going on in the world of Linux

1515
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,720
every single week.

1516
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,400
And Wes and I break it down for you.

1517
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,440
And we put it right there in nice concise packaging

1518
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,800
in that Linux Action show.

1519
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,840
And then last but not least, I always like to say,

1520
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,320
please do consider joining us live

1521
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,520
if you ever got a Tuesday where you can stop by

1522
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,520
around 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1523
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,800
See you next week.

1524
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,320
Same bat time, same bat station.

1525
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,000
You don't always have to make it to the mumble.

1526
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
We got a live stream going.

1527
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,920
Some people just sit back and watch the stream.

1528
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,520
They don't even get in the chat room.

1529
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,120
It happens.

1530
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,120
It happens.

1531
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,120
But of course we do have that mumble room going.

1532
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,480
And you're always welcome to participate

1533
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,840
and get your voice on any of the topics right here

1534
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,160
in the show.

1535
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,160
And to everyone who downloads,

1536
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,760
we just want to say thank you very much.

1537
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,960
We appreciate you.

1538
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,800
And a big shout out to our members.

1539
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,560
Thank you so much for making the show possible.

1540
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,320
We really do appreciate everyone's support.

1541
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,240
And thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode

1542
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,360
of the Unplugged program.

1543
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,960
Links to everything we talked about today

1544
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,440
at linuxunplugged.com slash 424.

1545
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,360
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1546
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:56,840
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1547
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:21,840
Thank you so much for tuning into Unplugged.

1548
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:36,560
All right, Wes Payne, step up to the plate.

1549
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,800
Here I am.

1550
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,520
It's another round of can we update our server live on the air

1551
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:58,560
with our crazy arch update contest.

1552
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,800
I think these clips have gone to your head.

1553
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,520
All right, Wes Payne.

1554
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,520
How are we doing?

1555
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,760
I know we've got kernel updates.

1556
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,760
We've got CFS updates.

1557
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,320
This is a big one.

1558
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:12,000
We are through, we've got a new LTS kernel installed.

1559
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And we just finished the DKMS rebuild for CFS 2.1.0.

1560
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,400
I was secretly hoping you'd already got it installed and rebooted.

1561
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,120
I wanted to wait to reboot.

1562
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,120
You're saving it for the show.

1563
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,880
Plus I want you to be to take the blame when I say can I hit reboot?

1564
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,160
The reboot is the worst part of this.

1565
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,640
You know, I was just hoping it was over with.

1566
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,940
All right, I'm getting my ping set up.

1567
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,440
Are you ready to reboot?

1568
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,440
Yeah.

1569
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,440
Okay.

1570
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,440
Let's do it.

1571
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,000
It's been closed by remote host.

1572
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,440
So long, pigness.

1573
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,440
So long.

1574
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,440
It's all right.

1575
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,440
It's going to be fine.

1576
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,440
It's still pinging.

1577
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,440
It's still pinging.

1578
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,440
Reboot already.

1579
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,440
Come on, machine.

1580
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,440
Still going.

1581
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,440
Huh.

1582
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,440
You know, it's got to stop all the containers.

1583
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,440
Yeah.

1584
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,440
Mm-hmm.

1585
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,440
Oh, that one took a...

1586
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,200
It's taking a little bit longer.

1587
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,000
It's slightly going up in response time.

1588
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Oh.

1589
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,400
Is that the last of it?

1590
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,400
I think so.

1591
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,400
Uh-oh.

1592
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,400
Oh, no.

1593
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,000
Okay, here we go.

1594
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,560
Now this is where we just wait patiently and I don't panic.

1595
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,680
That's right.

1596
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,800
Who has some good news for Chris?

1597
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,800
Everybody go to jbtitles.com.

1598
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,760
Get us a good title just in case this doesn't work because we just got this damn server

1599
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,760
working again.

1600
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,800
What are we doing, Wes?

1601
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,800
Why do we even update at all?

1602
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,520
I mean, I know why.

1603
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,080
It's our commitment that we're going to do this rolling thing in public.

1604
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,080
And if it goes wrong, it goes wrong in front of everybody and we own it.

1605
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:37,160
Behind the scenes, he's begging me to just let him install Stream on there, but I say

1606
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,160
no.

1607
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,160
We promise the audience.

1608
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:43,620
Actually, next week, we are going to let you vote on our future server OS.

1609
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:47,360
So do tune in to next week's episode because we're going to have a poll on what OS we should

1610
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,360
use on our next server.

1611
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,300
But that's not yet.

1612
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,920
Why would you use anything besides Fedora server though?

1613
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,920
It's true, right?

1614
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,240
I mean, you never know.

1615
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,520
That thing has been rock solid for me for years.

1616
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:04,120
It's insane how smooth their update path is for between operating system releases.

1617
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,120
It's still down.

1618
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,120
But then we'd never be able to talk about it on the show if it's too good.

1619
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,120
That's the trick.

1620
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,120
Yeah.

1621
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:14,080
You got to have every now and then like the genuine tension here is this really could

1622
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,240
go sideways and we really do use this in production.

1623
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,960
So it really creates a genuine tension.

1624
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,400
And if it never goes sideways, there's no tension.

1625
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,400
Oh, God.

1626
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,600
And you know, this thing's been so unreliable recently, too.

1627
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,160
It's just like, I really feel like we're on the dice.

1628
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,560
The machine is like a decade and a half old.

1629
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,560
I know.

1630
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,560
We're really trying to get our money out of it.

1631
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,160
I think you're way past getting your money back on this.

1632
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,640
Oh, I think we got a solid plan.

1633
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,200
We're going to we're going to unveil the plan next week and we got some good news in that

1634
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,920
department and we'll have the poll.

1635
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,760
But I just need this server to make it a few more weeks because we're not there yet.

1636
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,760
Is this when we're going to finally do open SUSE on there?

1637
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,640
I mean, you could go vote when I've released the poll.

1638
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,120
It's not not an option.

1639
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,120
I will.

1640
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,120
I will reveal this.

1641
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,240
That is an option on the poll.

1642
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,240
I will reveal.

1643
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:04,120
I won't say what other distros, but that is on there.

1644
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,140
So we'll see how people vote.

1645
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:09,440
This is at the point where I I legitimately start to think it's not coming back.

1646
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,440
I know.

1647
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,540
It's always hard because it takes it takes a long time.

1648
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,740
But you think you've waited.

1649
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,600
You know what I'm realizing?

1650
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,800
I'm realizing right now this would be another use case for an IPK.

1651
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,800
Yeah.

1652
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:25,240
If I could pull it up and see that it was doing something or a mic wired out in the

1653
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,240
garage.

1654
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,640
Let's hear the fans spinning up.

1655
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,040
Oh, oh, I've got pings.

1656
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,040
Oh, I do, too.

1657
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,040
Oh, I do, too.

1658
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,040
OK.

1659
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,760
Now, the next step for me is going to be, yeah, does the wire guard tunnel come back

1660
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,760
up?

1661
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,760
Right.

1662
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,760
Now, I've got a different back door.

1663
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,760
That's how I'm pinging it.

1664
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,760
But right.

1665
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,440
Thanks, Nebula.

1666
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:45,880
My applications are not up at the moment.

1667
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,360
So we don't have we don't have container applications yet, which is kind of a bad sign because those

1668
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,360
usually come up pretty quick.

1669
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,360
Oh.

1670
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,360
Oh.

1671
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,360
Oh.

1672
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,360
Oh.

1673
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,040
I don't think this is good.

1674
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,600
Just give it a minute.

1675
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,600
Come on.

1676
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,600
Yeah, just wait.

1677
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,600
OK, I'm going to have to say, are you S.S.H.ing in, Wes?

1678
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,600
Yeah, let's get out.

1679
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,600
Wait, Wes is now panicking.

1680
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,600
Oh, hey, I got S.S.H.

1681
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,600
I got S.S.H.

1682
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,600
That means wire guard's up.

1683
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,600
OK, I do, too.

1684
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,600
Yeah, I do, too.

1685
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,400
But wire guard is in the container app.

1686
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,480
OK, I see Docker firing up.

1687
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,480
Oh, yeah.

1688
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,480
Is your storage up?

1689
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,480
OK.

1690
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,480
Hold on.

1691
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,680
I think I think we have the containers can start up without storage.

1692
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,680
True.

1693
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,680
Yes.

1694
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,320
We do have storage.

1695
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:31,040
All we're waiting for now is for an application to start and actually load.

1696
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:37,160
Oh, shoot, Wes, look at that.

1697
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,280
Very nice, sir.

1698
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,820
It's done.

1699
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:43,020
Another round of successful Arch updates.

1700
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:58,560
We have a big server update next week, so be sure to tune in for that.
