1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
What do you guys think Nokia jumps in with an Android tablet are you surprised also I hear the optics on the camera quite nice

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,900
No key is that if they didn't put their Nokia's ed launcher thingy on there

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,080
I'd find it more appealing hmm 200. He's all about the hardware. I mean it's Android so yeah, it's Android Android

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,840
Yeah, yeah, well, and you could always stall it you can always put a different launcher on there

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,440
Mm-hmm Wow that does look like a look at the hardware. It does look like a great tablet doesn't it yeah

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,120
I'm looking at the n1 250. Yeah 250 is what it says on a gadget. Oh really yeah

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,680
That could be pretty compelling I was trying to find that information about the camera though because I heard people talking about it

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,960
But I don't see the details on that on their page there

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,280
Two hundred fifty dollars seven point nine inch and one tablet it'll be on sale in China first for the Chinese New Year which is February 19th

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,480
So it's gonna be a little bit

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,480
So we won't see it here in the u.s.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,360
probably

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Isn't this interesting

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,180
Boy, they break up with Microsoft just for a little bit. It's gonna have a 2048 by 1536 resolution

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,940
I predicted this when they when they sold off the mobile business to

16
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,100
It's a Microsoft because there was a clause in the contract that said that they could start reusing the Nokia brand

17
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:31,380
In 2015 like yep, they'll definitely have something ready for them. Did you catch that? It's also using that new type-c USB connector

18
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,380
Which is that new you?

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,460
Reversible connector that's not out in the market yet the very first USB can't do that doesn't suck

20
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,100
Yeah

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:47,180
2.4 gigahertz quad-core Intel Atom Z 3580 processor 2 gigabytes of RAM and a 32 gigabytes storage

22
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,700
8 megapixel rear shooter and a 5 megapixel on the front not bad. Hey, we got a little video

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,420
Should we watch the video this this looks pretty awesome. Oh

24
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,900
Yeah, it's already cool. Go Nokia go oh

25
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,040
Yeah, look at them holes there I guess that stereo speakers possibly

26
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,080
Yeah, if you hold it wow it looks a lot like an iPad doesn't it it does yeah, I

27
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,960
Didn't really see it until I saw it in the video, and oh, I like it though. I like that a lot

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,600
That is I think an extremely compelling tablet. Oh

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,640
Man, yeah, it does have that z1 launcher Android 5.0. Hey, oh it's coming with L. There's another check in the box

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,280
damn

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Well, I think they nailed it didn't they?

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,480
Good for Nokia boy. That's great. I I love Nokia hardware really love Nokia hardware, so that's yeah

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,560
I like the it clearly shows that they really aren't in bed all that much in with Microsoft

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,600
Because different part of the company's a different company. No I understand that but that whole philosophy is sticking with Windows related stuff

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,360
I'm ready for my me go based on Nokia tablet. Hey, did you guys see that yeah, okay? People are warning that

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,880
Doing something new tomorrow what they're announcing something tomorrow as well. Oh, okay, hold on all right screw the BitTorrent thing

37
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,040
Tell me about this go to yolo.com yolo.com

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,680
Yes, I'm really hoping for a yolo too, but I mean I heard about this. That's right

39
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,760
I saw you know what I saw this. I think before last started, but I forgot to put it in the show that's right

40
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,280
This is a

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,280
So you think it's a tablet poppy I'm coming hmm if you go to review yola

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,120
Blogspot.com they actually have a good write-up on it where they show

43
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,520
the corner that yola shows compared to a like a tablet a generic tablet and

44
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,400
the

45
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,720
Ui is almost similar wow so there's people who are like oh

46
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,360
I see a corner of the device. I have the picture up on the video stream if you're watching

47
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,720
Yeah, interesting you guys we could have some cool hardware coming soon some cool hardware

48
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm really happy with my yola one except for the camera and screen, but

49
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,120
Wow

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,120
I'm right. You know what I'm really hoping that we get something interesting out of them boy. Oh, man

51
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
I don't know what I'm hoping for

52
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,160
I'm right. You know what I'm really hoping that we get something interesting out of them boy. Oh, maybe they'd have in time shipping for Christmas

53
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
I could put it on Santa's list

54
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:29,360
So I was gonna say there was there was a story about these hackers claiming. I don't quote-unquote hackers

55
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,280
Claiming that bit torrent sync should not be trusted for sensitive data. I haven't read through the story has anybody read through this yet

56
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,560
Well, it shouldn't be trusted anyway, and we've been telling you that right ages right because it's proprietary. It's negative in the freedom

57
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,520
Exactly that's something that negative in the freedom right dimension. That's something that our friend

58
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,480
Over our friends over at pulse definitely have going for them is that it's open source now

59
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,960
We've also discussed many times the benefits of bit torrent sync so I think a lot of people understand

60
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,960
There's pros and cons to both

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,240
but I think it's pretty obvious at this point if it's not open source don't trust it with your data, and you know it's

62
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
funny is I don't necessarily because

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,000
Spider oak isn't fully open source. I think the client is I think I think a lot of the protocols document

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,840
I don't remember that where the line is with spider oak, but I have more trust there

65
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,440
So if you can't use pulse, and you don't want to use bit torrent sync you got to use something check out spider oak

66
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating its cheat day. My name is Chris. And my name is Matt.

67
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Hey Matt, so it's been a few weeks almost a month that I just have been kind of going like really light on the breads and stuff

68
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Not like a hundred percent cut it out, but really light. You know just really going back to that getting back to that

69
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,440
And it's always been great Matt. It's been great, but today before the show

70
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,440
We're working on something huge for tomorrow, and I don't you know it's like in this it's like in this last stage where it's the most work

71
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,440
And you don't know if you're gonna make it in time, but we have something really big for the Jupiter broadcasting network tomorrow that we're working on today

72
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,440
But I'm like starving and like okay. I gotta order a Jimmy John's sandwich

73
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
I got I can't leave

74
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
You've been listening to the radio

75
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
I know I gotta get the gift. I gotta get the gift

76
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
I gotta get the gift

77
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,440
I gotta get this work done, and then I gotta go do the unplugged show. I gotta go do the unplugged show

78
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,440
So I figure I'll order Jimmy John's, but I'm gonna be a good boy lettuce wrap that sandwich

79
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
I'm gonna get a lettuce wrap right yeah, yeah

80
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Sure, so I order Rekai sandwich cuz you know he's working on this project with me

81
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,440
And I order myself a nice big lettuce wrap double up on that meat Matt

82
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,440
I get double up on that meat, and it shows up at the front door

83
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,440
I grab the bag I go upstairs. We get all situated in our offices

84
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
We sit down and we start working again, and you know what?

85
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,440
They put it on bread and at that point Matt. I was so hungry. I and I've been wanting a sandwich so bad man

86
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,440
I've been wanting a sandwich so bad. I ate the whole sandwich Matt, and I got a little bit

87
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
I think if I went to the doctor right now

88
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,440
They would say Chris you are clinically diagnosed with food coma you are currently in a state of food coma and so

89
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,440
We're gonna get through today's episode. It's gonna be kind of a thick episode

90
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
There's a lot of things going on with the Debian project

91
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,440
You've probably seen some of it, and I want to I want to walk away from today's episode after we talk about what's happened

92
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,440
And and I want to walk away with a clear action plan that Jupiter broadcasting can take to help

93
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,440
Change the tone of the discussion in the discourse and encourage merit-based discussion again

94
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,440
And a sort of back away from sort of the tribal war even though it's a natural tendency

95
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
What we're trying to do is we're trying to make sure that we're trying to make sure that we're making sure that we're

96
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Sort of back away from sort of the tribal war even though it's a natural tendency. What can we do?

97
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,440
What could Jupiter broadcasting foster to promote that like more like a you know at a base level and I think there's a few possibilities there

98
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,440
So we're gonna recap what's been going on with Debian then transition into that

99
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,440
We've also got a few other interesting follow-up things we had a big system D survey done producer q5 sis put that together

100
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
We had almost 5,000 respondents

101
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,440
And we're gonna go over some of those responses in regards to system D in today's episode

102
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,440
And then when we have a chance we're gonna get to

103
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Something that might sound like it's pondering a negative in reality

104
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,440
I think we're gonna find a few strengths of desktop Linux that we can promote to future switchers

105
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,440
So we're gonna have a lot to accomplish plus the feedback in today's episode

106
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Let me so let me bring on our panel of experts our mumble room a time-appropriate greetings mumble room

107
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Hello hello hello

108
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,440
I'm excited because I think we're gonna accomplish something big today

109
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,440
We're gonna. We're gonna. I feel like if we can pull off what even a little bit of what I want to discuss

110
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm gonna be really proud of the unplugged show

111
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,440
But before we get to that we got a follow-up on probably what everybody else actually cares about

112
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,440
That was the whole chromium Firefox thing we got a couple of emails Colton wrote sent one in about the chromium challenge

113
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,440
He decided after last week's show. He's a Firefox user. He says you know what?

114
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,440
I'm gonna take that chromium challenge. I'm gonna take that chromium challenge so after watching your Firefox challenge

115
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,440
I decided to take it. I'm now on chromium, and I'm really amazed at what a difference there is between the two bugs

116
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
I once attributed to Linux. I now attribute to Firefox for instance

117
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,440
I had some weird full-screen flash video issues in Firefox that are completely gone now that I'm using chromium

118
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,440
No special config required it also makes much more sense to use chromium since I have a chromecast however

119
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,440
I didn't realize that I don't know

120
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,440
It clicks with me now anyways. Thanks for the great show Colton now. We've got some emails that said oh, yeah

121
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,440
I had a few problems, but Lionhead here in the Mamba room actually took the chromium challenge and

122
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,440
His story isn't quite as positive as Colton's Lionhead. How was your chromium challenge week?

123
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Well for me it was

124
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Thrilled with several minor annoyances that when repeated a thousand times will make you go mad

125
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Like what what happened man? What happened because I felt that way about Firefox, so that's interesting

126
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Well one of the things I do is that I dark theme everything and that is a serious thing for me

127
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,440
And when I browse reddit, which I do quite frequently

128
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,440
It loads the white page right before it goes dark and when you do that a lot of times

129
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
It flashes

130
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Yeah

131
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,440
So one of your one of your favorite little modifications

132
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Didn't work under chromium probably in a difference in the way they render the web page

133
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Probably another thing I also like to have is the way that Firefox handles pin tabs

134
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Which was just adding an extension, but again the whole thing

135
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,440
But why should I use something that needs an extension when it's built into your other browser?

136
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
The problem I had was for some reason

137
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,440
In the last three days. I had the random tab crashes all the time

138
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Oh, do you think it was a plug-in or just something else?

139
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,440
I have no idea, but even empty tabs just said oh snap crashed

140
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Didn't you feel great that aw snap air though?

141
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Yes, but still

142
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,440
No, that's fair. That's fair. So you're switching back obviously you have you already switched back to Firefox?

143
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm back on Firefox now

144
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
You made it the week though

145
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Yep

146
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Wow I'm impressed

147
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Well, yeah that goes to show you different strokes for different browsers

148
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I don't think I have that quite right man. We need to refine that what do you

149
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,440
You and I think we come up with a slogan there though

150
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Something something

151
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
I don't know we'll have to work it out

152
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Alright so

153
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Different trousers for different browsers

154
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Okay that's good

155
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Oh I like that

156
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
That really hits home

157
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,440
I would love to do something if there was something that could work in a gecko

158
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,440
You know for the for the gecko render like different different. I got nothing though. I'm not that quick

159
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,440
I need I need you know some time and then then I got it

160
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Hey so

161
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Are we talking gecko the lizard or Gordon gecko?

162
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,440
I was thinking gecko no I was thinking gecko the rendering engine

163
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Oh okay cool

164
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,440
So a producer q5 sis ran this what he calls a quote-unquote simple systemd survey

165
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,440
And he's now he's now published the results and so he had four thousand seven hundred and fifty five individuals who responded

166
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,440
The survey responses show that forty seven of the respondents are in favor of systemd

167
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
But I want to dig into this because I have some questions about this survey

168
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,440
And what it shows about desktop usage versus server usage and all these kinds of things I think are a little fascinating

169
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,440
So before we do that why don't I thank our first sponsor and that's DigitalOcean

170
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Head over to DigitalOcean right now and start checking them out while I talk about it

171
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,440
DigitalOcean.com it's worth a visit I think you're gonna be pretty impressed

172
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
So what is DigitalOcean?

173
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
It's a simple cloud hosting provider

174
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,440
And they're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up your own cloud server

175
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,440
And if you go over there right now DigitalOcean.com check them out you can create an account in just seconds

176
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
It's pretty impressive

177
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,440
And we also have a promo code that you can use unplug November to get a ten dollar credit

178
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,440
You apply that to the balance of your account no credit card required

179
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,440
You can get started with a droplet for two months for free

180
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Because DigitalOcean droplet started only five dollars a month

181
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,440
And you can get a droplet spun up in seconds

182
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Pricing plans at five dollars means you could easily afford your own own cloud instance or a WordPress install or a GitLab

183
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Or several different things or BitTorrent Sync, Pulse, maybe you want an offsite Pulse server

184
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
A DigitalOcean droplet could be a great way to do it

185
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,440
And you'll get a 512 megabyte RAM rig

186
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,440
You'll get a 20 gigabyte SSD all SSD

187
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,440
You'll get one blazing fast CPU on that droplet

188
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,440
And a terabyte of dedicated transfer just to you

189
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,440
And they have DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam and London

190
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,440
I had an email from someone on Coder Radio on Monday

191
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Who said that he was taking part of a competition

192
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
And it was a programming competition where your response had to come in in under a minute

193
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
And that meant you coded the response

194
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,440
You actually wrote up the code for the response

195
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,440
And then had to deploy it and that would be your answer

196
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,440
And he kept kind of just under, just like barely missing the minute mark

197
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Just like a minute five seconds, a minute three seconds

198
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,440
You know all these, like what am I doing, a minute one second

199
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,440
And then he realized the server was located in France

200
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,440
So he deployed a DigitalOcean droplet over in Amsterdam

201
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Cut down that latency time and now he's in the top leaderboards

202
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Nice

203
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
And DigitalOcean, you've seen the power right here on Linux Unplugged

204
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Last week when Wimpy deployed the brand new version of Ubuntu Mate edition live on the show

205
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
He used DigitalOcean's resources to do that

206
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,440
And their interface to do all of it is crazy simple and intuitive

207
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
And they have an API where you can get started on your own and write some code

208
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
And interact with this stuff automatically

209
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Or integrate it in with your management infrastructure

210
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,440
Or take advantage of some of the things the community has already written

211
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
It's really slick

212
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
And they're paying for tutorials

213
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Because they're trying to get that up to a really high level

214
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
So if you've got some experience with something

215
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Go work with DigitalOcean, we have a link in our show notes

216
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,440
And write up a tutorial, they might pay up to $200 for that

217
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
And that might be worth your time

218
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,440
They've also got a position open right now for an editor

219
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
So that could be an opportunity as well

220
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,440
DigitalOcean.com, Unplugged November

221
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Go create a droplet, try it out

222
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Maybe play with CoreOS for a little bit and see what all the buzz is about

223
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Experience Docker, try out GitLab

224
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,440
You might be able to tie in your own local machine configs

225
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,440
To a GitLab deployment in a DigitalOcean droplet that you have full root control over

226
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,440
That'd be pretty cool, I'd love to hear about it if you do something like that

227
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
DigitalOcean.com, Unplugged November

228
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show

229
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Okay, so Q5 broke out the stats in a pretty digestible way

230
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,440
But he also published the raw data if you want to play with this yourself

231
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,440
And I know some of you do, I've seen some of the comments

232
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,440
So first he asked, do you consider yourself in favor or against SystemD?

233
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,440
47%, 2,247 people responded in favor

234
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,440
22% responded against, 30% undecided

235
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,440
In the age range, 52% are 20-30 or 20-29

236
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
And 28% are 30-39, 7% 40-49

237
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Which is interesting, that particular number there doesn't really reflect other demographics I've seen

238
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
But who really knows

239
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
How many years have you used Linux?

240
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,440
40% responded 6-10 years, 23 responded 11-15 years

241
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,440
And 16-20 years said 10%

242
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
And 27% said 0-5

243
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
What was your first Linux distro?

244
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,440
OpenSUSE came in at 6%, Debian 41%, Fedora 18%, Arch Linux 3%

245
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Current distro, Arch Linux 37%, Fedora Red Hat 11%, Debian 28%

246
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Which I assume also includes Ubuntu

247
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,440
And where do you live? 46% North America, 42% Europe and the others fall in

248
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:41,440
Primary use, web server 44%, desktop 90% of the people that took the survey are using it as a desktop, Linux

249
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,440
What's more important, stability or bleeding edge?

250
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,440
32% said stability, 20% said bleeding edge, 47% said flexibility

251
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,440
So flexibility was 47% of the response

252
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,440
And who would win in a face-off, Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, Leonard Potter, or Captain Jean-Luc Picard?

253
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Captain Jean-Luc Picard won with 39% of the vote

254
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,440
So there you go, and the raw data is in the notes

255
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,440
One thing I wanted to ask you guys about

256
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,440
What do you think about this number here, System D in favor, 47%

257
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Rotten Corps, is that in line with what you'd expect from the survey?

258
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Actually yes, pretty much

259
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
I thought it might be, and why is that?

260
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:32,440
I like System D, and I don't see, most of the technical issues that people have problems with System D are fixable

261
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
And have already been fixed, most of them

262
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
Roger that, yeah, I could see that too

263
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,440
And it seems like maybe the people that are in favor of desktops might be more in favor of System D too

264
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,440
And there's a lot of desktop users in the survey, that's kind of what jumped out at me

265
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,440
The desktop thing is the most interesting, and I think it's also

266
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Because of the different districts that have jumped to System D as the default

267
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Is probably a big aspect to that

268
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,440
It's worth noting too, that once Ubuntu makes their full switch to System D

269
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,440
That number's going to be significantly higher as well

270
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
Yeah, and that could happen in 1504

271
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,440
That could be the next big release

272
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,440
And I know that this is just one survey, and you can't make all of your consumptions off of this

273
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,440
So we're going to get into this Debian stuff, right Matt?

274
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,440
And I'm looking at this and I'm thinking, geez, when you get these surveys it seems like the majority are actually okay with what's going on with System D

275
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,440
So as we get into this, are we talking about people that are say, harassing maintainers and stuff?

276
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Are these people on the fringe?

277
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
I don't think it's necessarily that they're on the fringe

278
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,440
I think it's that they're so passionate about their belief that

279
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,440
And a lot of times when you're not in the largest of numbers

280
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,440
You tend to be a little louder to make your voice heard

281
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,440
And sometimes that's done with eloquence, and sometimes that's done like a raging chimp

282
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,440
It really depends on the person

283
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
And I've seen both from all sides

284
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,440
I've seen raging chumps on all sides, and I've seen some really eloquent blog posts from all groups as well

285
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,440
So it's kind of hit and miss

286
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
That's a good point

287
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,440
And I encourage you, if you have any questions or anything like that

288
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,440
I have a link in the show notes to Q5Sys' blog post

289
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,440
You can download the, he put it in an ODT file or something

290
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,440
One of them open formats, I believe it was not text, however

291
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
It was not text

292
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
It was one of them other formats

293
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,440
And you can download that and you can plug it into your spreadsheet of choice

294
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,440
So Andreas writes in, and he has a question for our panel

295
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
And I'd like to hear what you guys think about this

296
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,440
He says, hello Chris and Matt, I have a thought that

297
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,440
I have a question that I think all of you could maybe discuss

298
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
And have maybe a good round table

299
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,440
He says, what could we do as a community to improve Linux?

300
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,440
What is it, like if you could have a magic wand today

301
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,440
And just improve it to make it more approachable to the mainstream

302
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Would it be something like an app store?

303
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
More integration between distributions?

304
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Industry support, etc, etc

305
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
What could be done to Linux just to kind of spruce it up a little bit

306
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
And make it more palatable?

307
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,440
And Matt, I wanted to go to you first because I think this is along the line you write about a lot

308
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,440
And the space you think about is make it more approachable to users

309
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,440
If you could give somebody a Linux box and remove just a couple of immediate pain points

310
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
What would those points be?

311
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Ooh, I think the first thing I would do is make sure that if it's not necessary

312
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Or it's likely to just create new problems

313
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
I would do my best to hide it

314
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,440
With the asterisk that I would like to show them how to use it properly later on

315
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,440
But I think giving them immediate access to like say

316
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,440
A more advanced package manager versus a simple one

317
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,440
Do you think like an amazing app store is necessary or is that just a nice to have?

318
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Well, you know, I think it is only from the sense of discovery

319
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
I think once, if you know the application you're going to get

320
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
And you're willing to do whatever you want to do to get it

321
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
I don't think it's critical

322
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
But I do think for just Joe average

323
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
It definitely is a bigger selling point

324
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,440
It's a little bit like the spinning cube stuff we were talking about

325
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
You know, a little bit of wow goes a long way

326
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
Yeah, good point

327
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,440
And it grabs their attention

328
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,440
In fact, our next note's coming up

329
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,440
And then you can kind of settle them down and get them grounded as you go

330
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
But you know

331
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,440
Josh, in the mumble room there, how much is a really key hardware OEM a part of this?

332
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,440
Like somebody that would have like a storefront filled with Linux machines

333
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Is this an important piece? Is that a pain point you would resolve?

334
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Yeah, definitely

335
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,440
I mean, a key issue with Linux is

336
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Well, I'll put this way

337
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,440
A key issue for end users is hardware compatibility

338
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Because they want to be able to boot up their computer and know everything works

339
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,440
They don't have to go on Ask a Boon 2 and see

340
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,440
Oh, I have to download some weird drivers in order to get something to work

341
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,440
If we point users to OEMs like System76

342
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,440
Then they know immediately things are going to work out of the box

343
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
And that's pretty powerful

344
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Inagogo, you think what we need is some good advertising

345
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,440
Yeah, because Windows has a ton more advertising than Linux

346
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
And what we need is advertising

347
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
So people can hear about it

348
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,440
But it also needs a bit of fixing in some circumstances

349
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,440
So, Daredevil, do you think it's a problem with software quality?

350
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
No

351
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
Okay

352
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
I'm thinking more of a problem

353
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
I'm sorry

354
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,440
I'm thinking more it's a problem of actually making developers happy on the platform

355
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,440
I mean, we have all the tools and all the languages

356
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,440
But distributions, like Ubuntu right now is doing a great effort on that department

357
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,440
But it's pretty much almost the only one doing it

358
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,440
We need standardized protocol to develop an app and ship it

359
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
Once we have that, we have developers

360
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,440
Developers that are approaching the platform being Linux for the first time say

361
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,440
Alright, what SDK do I download to start making applications for this?

362
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
And then the answer is

363
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
Yeah

364
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,440
And usually it all wraps around what tool we want to use

365
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
And we don't support one tool really well

366
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,440
And the problem is if developers are making the app that users want

367
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,440
OEMs look at that and they say

368
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
There's no reason to support the platform

369
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
I mean, there's no one writing apps for it

370
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,440
Rotten Corps, do you want to expand on that a little bit?

371
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Yeah, I think the actual developer thing is more than just the SDK

372
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,440
It's also the repos

373
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,440
As the community of Linux, people just talk about

374
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Use your official repo because that's the safest

375
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,440
And it is true, but it's also the most annoying part for developers

376
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Because every single repo is going to have a different version of your project

377
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,440
And then you have to contact these people

378
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,440
You beg them to update, beg the next one to update

379
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
And it just continues and continues

380
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
And you have no control

381
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Frank from OEMcloud when we were at the Ohio Linux Fest said

382
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
We have this very problem

383
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,440
The issue is, is that in Debian, stable today

384
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,440
A very, very old version of OEMcloud ships

385
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
That is no longer supported by the OEMcloud project

386
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,440
And it is a poor representation of what their project is about today

387
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
It doesn't represent their quality of code

388
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
It doesn't represent anything about them

389
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,440
But yet if you apt-get install OEMcloud, you get this

390
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,440
And to them it's a major problem and it is a disincentive for them

391
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Now, their options are to, and I think very wisely

392
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
They have utilized the openSUSE build service

393
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
And they generate repositories

394
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,440
If you just did a, you know, a monocule of research on the OEMcloud website

395
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
You'd know that would be the more appropriate way to install it

396
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
But not everybody does that

397
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Because you expect that functionality from your distribution

398
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
And you should be able to

399
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,440
So I think the rotten corpse, I think the point about repositories is a very good one

400
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
It's like, it's one of the best strengths

401
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,440
But it can also be a disincentive to some developers

402
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,440
The other thing is, is they lose some download stats

403
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,440
So it's hard for them to quantify how many Linux users they have

404
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,440
Like the, you know, we all hear this about the LibreOffice project

405
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
They're not exactly sure how many Linux users they have

406
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Because most people get LibreOffice from their distro

407
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
They don't download it from the website

408
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,440
But most Windows users and Mac users do download it from the website

409
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
So they get most of those counts

410
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,440
So that, you know, when you look at that data right there

411
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,440
The Linux users are massively underrepresented

412
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,440
And it's, in a business sometimes, hard to really wrap their brains around that

413
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,440
Yeah, I think it's, the download stuff is very important

414
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Because there's basically no way to find out

415
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
The repos don't provide the information

416
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
Like the different package managers don't do anything

417
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,440
You can't find out anything on any distro

418
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,440
You just have to hope that people use it

419
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Right, and some applications, you know, they work around this by

420
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
And this is not necessarily a good thing

421
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
By pinging home

422
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Maybe it's to check for an update

423
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
Or, you know, just whatever to the servers

424
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Just send one ping off, one ping only

425
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
And then, hey, bang suggest chatroom by the way

426
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Don't forget to bang suggest today

427
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
One ping only, and you go out there and you ping the server

428
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,440
And yeah, okay, now we know we have LibreOffice user 1151157892 on a Linux box

429
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
I don't know

430
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
But then you get people who hate you for doing that

431
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
And then it just creates a bigger issue that you don't want to deal with

432
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
So you don't do it

433
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,440
And there's really no practical way

434
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,440
It's just, you have to rely on the distros to give you information

435
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
And they don't do it

436
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,440
So those would be some areas I think we'd probably improve

437
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,440
And this is one of the things that are

438
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,440
It's the kind of the good end result of some standardization on SystemD

439
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Is it does normalize some of that middle section of Linux across all the distributions

440
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,440
It is something that developers will be able to wrap their heads around

441
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,440
That is a cross distribution commonality

442
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,440
That is a positive thing for software coming to Linux

443
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
SystemD controversy aside

444
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
And so as we get closer to this discussion

445
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
That's one thing to kind of keep in mind

446
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,440
But before we go there, MJC6370

447
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Rolls right off the tongue

448
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Submitted to the subreddit 23 hours ago

449
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
He says he gave a presentation

450
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
And this is so cool

451
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
He says everyone in the group uses Macbooks

452
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
Except for me

453
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,440
I've got a Lenovo Ultrabook and I run Linux

454
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
What was a little nerve-wracking about it though

455
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Is I had to go hook up the HDMI to the projector

456
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,440
He was a little worried because those Mac users are walking up

457
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,440
They're plugging in their Macbooks with them HDMI ports

458
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
And they're getting up on the projector

459
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
He's like okay here I go

460
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
I've got to show up these Mac users

461
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
He goes up there with the Lenovo

462
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
He plugs it in

463
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Works, no problem

464
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,440
After the presentation

465
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Four of the thirteen people came up to say

466
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Hey, what are you running on your PC?

467
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
It looks amazing

468
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,440
One even asked what version of Windows it was

469
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
Anyways, it makes me smile

470
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,440
And he says the Numix icons seem to be catching people's eye

471
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,440
I thought that was neat in light of our interview with the Numix guys

472
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,440
That it seems to be

473
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,440
And we always talk about oh yeah like Compiz grabs eyes and things like that

474
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,440
But them Numix icons are grabbing some eyes too

475
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
They're not for everybody

476
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
But I thought that was a great story

477
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
It's pretty cool

478
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
And as a fanboy

479
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,440
I would point out that in his article he mentioned that

480
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,440
A big point of getting people's eye is GNOME

481
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
Yeah, I think it's pretty smexy

482
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
I think it is really smexy

483
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
Cinnamon is good looking too

484
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
But GNOME has that

485
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
It has that modern look to it

486
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
It looks like something a little bit different

487
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,440
But you immediately know what it is

488
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
Of course my GNOME is different than most people's GNOME

489
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
I think his too

490
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,440
I think a lot of times people have docs on the side

491
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,440
And in my case I have a full screen doc that kind of makes it look like Unity

492
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,440
Or I mean a full sidebar doc

493
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
Hey, okay, alright

494
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
So we've got to get to this Debian stuff

495
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
We've been talking about it on and off

496
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
Before we do that

497
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,440
Let me give a mention here for Linux Academy

498
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Linux Academy is a great service

499
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
And it's a great opportunity if you haven't checked it out

500
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Start by going over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

501
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,440
And take a look at what they have to offer

502
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
What I love about Linux Academy

503
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,440
Is unlike some of the general online learning courses and sites that are out there

504
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
And there seems to be more and more all the time

505
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
People seem to figure out some sort of CMS

506
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
They throw up a bunch of content on there

507
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
Maybe they throw some things on YouTube

508
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,440
Or maybe they have something really high end

509
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Where they just have so many videos that sit there and rot

510
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
You know there's a whole range of services

511
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,440
But none of them are built by Linux enthusiasts and advocates

512
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,440
They've teamed up with friends that are educators and developers

513
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,440
And they've created Linux Academy for you

514
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
For Linux users

515
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
By Linux users

516
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
And they cover the whole spectrum of stuff

517
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,440
And when you go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

518
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,440
You're going to get a discount on your tuition

519
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,440
A great discount, it's like 33% discount

520
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,440
It's an amazing resource

521
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
You get step-by-step video courses

522
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,440
When you log into their dashboard

523
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,440
You see all of the courses outlined

524
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
All the different options you have

525
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
And they're adding new stuff all the time

526
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,440
They just added a whole bunch of Puppet stuff

527
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,440
You can go check out Introduction to Puppet

528
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
If you've been thinking about getting into that

529
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
If you have more than a few servers

530
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,440
You should probably think about it

531
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
And they've got courseware on it now

532
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
And they're adding more stuff all the time

533
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
You log in, you say okay I'm going to do this Puppet course

534
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
And then it opens it up

535
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
It shows you all the different sections

536
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,440
How long each section is going to take

537
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
Where you can download audio and PDFs and videos

538
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
It's so nice

539
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
And if you get to a point where now it's time to do some

540
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
Puppet configuration and deployments

541
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,440
They'll automatically spin up a virtual server for you

542
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
On demand

543
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
They give you logins to it

544
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
Now you're working in a production environment

545
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
You're actually using the tools

546
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
Along with the courseware

547
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
Along with the video guides

548
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
And they have live stream events

549
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
Where you can ask the educators questions directly too

550
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,440
They also have communities

551
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,440
Kind of give you that boost when you're feeling a little down

552
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Or bottoming out a little bit

553
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
And need some encouragement

554
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Or need some direction

555
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
That's a great resource

556
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,440
And they've expanded so much on their AWS and OpenStack stuff too

557
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
It's pretty cool

558
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,440
And I think one of the courses I like to recommend from time to time

559
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
Is their R-Sync backup course

560
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,440
So if you want to get a nice solid backup system

561
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
With the holidays coming up

562
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
You've got all these photos you're taking

563
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,440
Why not back them up

564
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
R-Sync is a great tool to do that

565
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,440
Take it from your rig

566
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
It's maybe your desktop or your laptop

567
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Send it off to your NAS

568
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
Or move it just between devices

569
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Or send it over the internet

570
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
Move it up to a droplet

571
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
R-Sync is such an incredible tool

572
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
And they have a great course on it

573
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
It'll really make you an R-Sync expert

574
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
But that's just the beginning

575
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,440
They've got courseware on DevOps

576
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Python, OpenStack, Android, Ruby, AWS

577
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
I mean the list goes on and on

578
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
And new stuff all the time

579
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

580
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,440
Go find out what courseware by Linux users

581
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
For Linux users is actually like

582
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
You know that makes all the difference

583
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
And that's why you want to go there

584
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,440
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

585
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,440
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

586
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,440
The unplugged program

587
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,440
You guys rock

588
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,440
Okay so we don't need to dwell on the Debian stuff that much

589
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,440
It's kind of a bummer

590
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Oh you know I should mention now before

591
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
I'm sorry I keep doing this

592
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,440
A couple of brief bits of business next week

593
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Linux unplugged is going to be an hour earlier

594
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
At 1pm Pacific

595
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
So you can get that in your local time

596
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
At jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

597
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
Please join us

598
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,440
It's the 25th

599
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,440
So that's not a great day

600
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,440
And I apologize about that

601
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,440
But we're going to do it one hour earlier

602
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
So hopefully we can get a decent turnout

603
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
Because after the show

604
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
And this is why we're doing it one hour earlier

605
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,440
We're going to team up with the mumble room

606
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,440
We're going to try to recruit as many people

607
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
In the mumble room as possible

608
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
And we're going to hunt for the best moments

609
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,440
Of Jupiter Broadcasting throughout 2014

610
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Because our idea is

611
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
Our hope is to give all of the hosts

612
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Everyone the week of Christmas off

613
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,440
And the only way to do that

614
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Is if we can generate some best of content now

615
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
And the only way to go through that

616
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Is if we all work together as a team

617
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
We'll sit down

618
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
We'll divide up the work

619
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
We'll communicate

620
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
We'll get a real time doc and form

621
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
That you'll be able to fill out

622
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
So we'll all be collaborating off the same set of notes

623
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
We'll work together as a team

624
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Rekai will be joining us to go through

625
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
So he can be here for editing notes

626
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,440
And we're going to try to go through

627
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
And discover some of the greatest moments

628
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
So if you've got some in your head

629
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
We'll have the form available

630
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
Probably later in the week

631
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,440
I'll try to make it available during

632
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
The Linux Action Show

633
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Or something like that

634
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,440
So keep an eye out for that

635
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,440
I'll probably tweet it out when we have it done

636
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
But it'd be great if you could join us next Tuesday

637
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
At 1pm Pacific

638
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
And help us hunt for all of that stuff

639
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Also, I should probably mention at this point too

640
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
There is a Jupiter Broadcasting Polo

641
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
A lot of you have asked for it

642
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
And this is the one to get

643
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,440
This is something that we worked tirelessly with Teespring

644
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
To make sure it's going to be perfect

645
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
It's an embroidered Jupiter Broadcasting Polo

646
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,440
And you can find it at teespring.com slash jbpolo

647
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,440
There's a couple of different colors

648
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
And they've also added now the Ladies Tea

649
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,440
Which is nice

650
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,440
It's really nice

651
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
So you can check that out

652
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Teespring.com slash jbpolo

653
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Oh, I like that grey a lot

654
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,440
That is slick

655
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
Snazzy

656
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Yes, very snazzy

657
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Oh my gosh, it's going to look so good

658
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,440
With the white embroidered logo

659
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,440
Teespring.com slash jbpolo

660
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
Get your polo on

661
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Or give away some as a gift

662
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,440
We've got more at jupiter.gift

663
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,440
More shirts and stuff too

664
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
But yeah, so a little bit of business

665
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,440
J.B. Polo's out

666
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,440
And also our early next week

667
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
And we're going to need your help

668
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,440
We will be recruiting as many of you as possible

669
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Okay, so now on to the Debian stuff

670
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,440
This week we've seen some more resignations

671
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
From some pretty important folks

672
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
In the Debian project

673
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,440
And this isn't the first round we've seen either

674
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,440
And they all seem to be generally

675
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
And anybody, if you disagree with me, speak up

676
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
No hard feelings

677
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,440
But they all seem to be related to the tone

678
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
Of the System D discussion

679
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,440
But not because of System D

680
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,440
Would everybody kind of agree with that?

681
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
Yeah

682
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,440
Yeah, I think it's mostly the bureaucracy around Debian

683
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Yeah, so we've had resignations

684
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
From the Debian technical committee

685
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,440
We've had resignations from one of the

686
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,440
System D package maintainers

687
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
From the package maintaining team for System D

688
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
We've had a resignation there

689
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Bruce Perins, a former Debian project leader

690
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
Commented on LWN about System D

691
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,440
And about the hostile politics around it

692
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,440
And it's been

693
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
What appears to be in most cases

694
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
People are sort of re-evaluating

695
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Their life priorities

696
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,440
And deciding

697
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,440
I am not putting up with this anymore

698
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,440
They're being harassed

699
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
They're being attacked

700
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,440
Because of their position

701
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Or involvement with either

702
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
Whatever aspect of this process

703
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,440
And it's really kind of a sad thing to see happen

704
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Watching people who are contributing

705
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
Their time and their energy

706
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
To free software

707
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
Be attacked

708
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,440
For working on free software

709
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,440
And I don't know what the levels of attacks are

710
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,440
But it's such a hard thing to watch

711
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,440
And I think it represents

712
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,440
Sort of this really hostile tone

713
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
That our conversations in the community

714
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Have taken over these things

715
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
And it

716
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
I don't know

717
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
I don't think you could blame System D

718
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
System D seems to be the catalyst around it

719
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,440
Matt, are you seeing what I'm seeing?

720
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,440
I'm seeing bits and pieces of it

721
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
It's a little bit like

722
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
When you're walking through a war zone

723
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
And little bits of shrapnel

724
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Are buzzing by your head

725
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,440
So that's been more my experience of it

726
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
I don't know the deep details

727
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
But it does seem like

728
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,440
That it has been escalating

729
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,440
And at the end of the day

730
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,440
I feel badly for these guys

731
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,440
But I think it is going to be a matter of

732
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,440
Finally, they're going to end up

733
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,440
With an echo chamber of like-minded people

734
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
To keep this up

735
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
All the people that disagree

736
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
See things differently

737
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
Alright, Dare Devlin

738
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
So you specifically

739
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Focusing on the Debian aspect

740
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
Of these latest fallouts

741
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
You think it's maybe a symptom

742
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Of getting too big?

743
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Too bureaucratic?

744
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,440
No, I actually think

745
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,440
It's particularly

746
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,440
To the tone

747
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,440
So the bureaucracy

748
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,440
I guess these people were fine with it

749
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
So far they've been able to get

750
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Through situations

751
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
Through this bureaucratic process

752
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
It seems to me that it's rather

753
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
The tone that was passed on

754
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
The bureaucratic systems lately

755
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
Like, you should do this

756
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,440
Which was never the case

757
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,440
It was up to the maintainers

758
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,440
And suddenly there's decisions being made

759
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,440
And the maintainers are just taking

760
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Quote-unquote orders

761
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,440
And in a position of

762
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
If you don't like it

763
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
Just drop it

764
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,440
One of the more poignant comments

765
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,440
That I saw was Bruce's

766
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,440
The former Debian project leader

767
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
And really what he said is

768
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
Internally inside Debian

769
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
They've lost empathy

770
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
Towards the end user

771
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,440
He said that it's sort of like this

772
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
It's sort of become this

773
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,440
Cold, calculated system

774
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
And it doesn't take into account

775
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
The fact that there are certain things

776
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
That end users care about

777
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
And there are certain things

778
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
That end users couldn't care less about

779
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
And I wonder if

780
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
If this is

781
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
And I hate to think about it like this

782
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
But is this the result when

783
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
You sort of have a

784
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
Quote-unquote democracy-type style

785
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
Leadership for a distribution

786
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
So let me explain why I think this

787
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Before I dig myself too deep into a hole

788
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
Arch

789
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
Here's how Arch made the transition

790
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
To System D

791
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Hey guys, we're thinking about doing this

792
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
There was some turmoil

793
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
They said okay, well here's what we'll do

794
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
We'll support both systems

795
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
As long as there's somebody that maintains

796
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
The init scripts and all the stuff

797
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,440
For each system

798
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,440
And then when that ends

799
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Then we'll just transition to one system

800
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
And that's exactly what happened

801
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
People stopped making scripts

802
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
For the old system

803
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
And they transitioned entirely

804
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Over to System D

805
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
And it happened fairly soon

806
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
And in fact, because they did it so orderly

807
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
I don't know the details on this

808
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
But I think

809
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Unless maybe someone in the Mumba Room

810
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Has told me this, I think

811
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
One of the guys at Arch

812
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
Now works on System D

813
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
For his full-time gig

814
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Because they really did such a professional

815
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Job of transitioning over to this

816
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
And I think that might be because

817
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
Arch essentially is controlled

818
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
By a small group of developers

819
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
And they just make a decision

820
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
And they go for it, right?

821
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,440
And other distributions have people

822
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
That just make, you know

823
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
Mark Shuttleworth makes a blog post

824
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
And says alright, yep

825
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Well now we're going to System D

826
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,440
And I'm sure there was

827
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
Internal discussions about it

828
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
But once it's declared

829
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
It's declared

830
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,440
And I know I've raised this point before

831
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
But it seems like every few years

832
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
And this is the worst one

833
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
I think I've ever seen

834
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,440
Debian goes through these many implosions

835
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,440
And I look at this and I think

836
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,440
This has to just be

837
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,440
Because as human beings

838
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
We're just not very good

839
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
At this kind of thing

840
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
Boy, you know

841
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
The more I think about it

842
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
I think really when you compare

843
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
Arch and the Debian communities

844
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
I honestly think back to the

845
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Introduction to Buck Rogers

846
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
The intro that showed

847
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Where it has all the things

848
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Happening through time

849
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
That's how I see Debian

850
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
In a lot of ways

851
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
I feel like that, as you said

852
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
They have many implosions

853
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
But I also think the fact is

854
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
That there's a lot of ego

855
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,440
That floats around in that circle

856
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
Arch users honestly like Arch

857
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Or go away

858
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
They don't care

859
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
You know, I've never really

860
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Got a sense of ego

861
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
From the Arch community

862
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
That I've gotten

863
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
From other distributions

864
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
And so that may play a part too

865
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
To where, you know

866
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
Yes, it was just stated

867
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
This is what we're doing

868
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Like it, lump it, or leave

869
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,440
And the Debian people are like

870
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Well, you know

871
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
We've got to have this big community

872
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Think about it

873
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

874
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
But I do feel like there's a lot

875
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
Of ego stroking

876
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
Going back and forth

877
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
I don't know

878
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,440
Am I wrong?

879
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Well, Derrick Delvin

880
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Do you think it could be

881
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
That it's more of a

882
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Hey, I didn't sign up

883
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
For this kind of mentality?

884
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Yes, I didn't sign up

885
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
For doing the work

886
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
For that particular thing

887
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
And now suddenly

888
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
There is that expectation

889
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
In the past

890
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,440
That's not how it was done

891
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,440
In Debian

892
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
It was up to the maintainers

893
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,440
And now this is being moved up

894
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,440
To the who's ever leading

895
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,440
And the folks are just saying

896
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Okay, I'm going to drop it

897
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
So it is a little

898
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
It's like

899
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
It's egos combined

900
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
With a bureaucratic structure

901
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
Mixed with people

902
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Who are like

903
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,440
Well, this isn't what I signed up for

904
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
I don't want to do this

905
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
And all of these things

906
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
Come together

907
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
And you have a toxic situation

908
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Now here is the

909
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Here's where I want to move

910
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
The discussion towards

911
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
I still maintain

912
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
That I think

913
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
A fanning of the flames

914
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,440
And I think that's putting it

915
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Very generously

916
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
I would almost say

917
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Throwing fuel on the fire

918
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
Is a more inapt analogy

919
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Is the quote, unquote

920
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Open source tech press

921
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Who has fueled these battles

922
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
To drive clicks

923
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
And I still believe

924
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
That it's sort of like

925
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
This secular cycle

926
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,440
Where the news

927
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
The tech, quote, unquote

928
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
Bloggers and press

929
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Write about this

930
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
That almost sort of

931
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
Becomes reality

932
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
And what it does is

933
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
It moves the goal post

934
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Of the conversation

935
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
So it changes the tone

936
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
To be much more dramatic

937
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Much more decisive

938
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,440
Much more amped up

939
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
It makes these community discussions

940
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
Turned into reality

941
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
Television shows

942
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
For the web

943
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,440
Is what it does

944
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,440
And when it does that

945
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
It moves the tone of the dialogue

946
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
In that community

947
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
It moves that forward

948
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
Into a more aggressive tone

949
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
And it begins to reflect

950
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
The very thing

951
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
They are writing about

952
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Have we not all seen this?

953
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
And so once again

954
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Don't we come back to

955
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
The tech press

956
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,440
Has a responsibility here

957
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
To get the story right

958
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
And to stop over blowing

959
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
All of these things

960
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,440
That fan these problems

961
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,440
And now

962
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,440
I think you could attribute

963
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
Some of that

964
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
To causing major strife

965
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Inside a critically important

966
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,440
Linux distribution

967
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
What do you think

968
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
Dear Devlin?

969
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,440
I think that

970
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,440
That does have an influence

971
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
And perhaps we could

972
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,440
I'm not saying like

973
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,440
It's just a suggestion

974
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Try to invite

975
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,440
When we see something

976
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Instead of the first thing

977
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
Be comment about it

978
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
Just actually invite someone

979
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
That is participating

980
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
On the actual process

981
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
Right so

982
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
If they're willing

983
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
To come up with that

984
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
This was my thought

985
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
Is like

986
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
There must be something

987
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
We could just do ourselves

988
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
Something that has to be done

989
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
That could be

990
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Our contribution

991
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Something that we could

992
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Figure out

993
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
To move the tone back

994
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Into a more

995
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Merit-based conversation

996
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,440
Where it's technicalities

997
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
And there is room

998
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,440
For philosophy

999
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,440
But it's not a war

1000
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
It's not a holy war

1001
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
It needs to be a space

1002
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
Where it's perfectly fine

1003
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
That I think plasma TVs

1004
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Are better than LCD TVs

1005
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,440
And you think LCD TVs

1006
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Are better than plasma TVs

1007
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
And that's great

1008
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
And we're both happy

1009
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
With our choices

1010
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
And that's fine

1011
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
Like we need to be able

1012
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,440
To have those kinds

1013
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
Of conversations

1014
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Where when somebody says

1015
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
I think chrome

1016
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Is better than Firefox

1017
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,440
Instead of having a battle

1018
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
And calling somebody

1019
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,440
Uneducated or saying

1020
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
They don't know how

1021
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
To use computers

1022
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,440
It's like oh that's interesting

1023
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Now I find that

1024
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Chrome might be better

1025
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,440
For me because of this

1026
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,440
Kind of like we've started

1027
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Now do you know

1028
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Lionhead today

1029
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
He reported on his

1030
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
Chromium experiment

1031
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,440
We didn't jump on him

1032
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Those of us who think

1033
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,440
Chromium is better

1034
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
We're like okay great

1035
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Glad you gave it a shot

1036
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,440
Thanks man

1037
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,440
Thanks for the feedback

1038
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
And that I think

1039
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,440
Is more valuable discussion

1040
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
So the question is

1041
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Is what can we do

1042
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
To sort of encourage

1043
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,440
That everywhere

1044
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,440
What can we do

1045
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
With the base level

1046
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,440
And my thought was that too

1047
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
Is like maybe we could

1048
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,440
Bring more people on

1049
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
But the thing is

1050
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
That's easier said

1051
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Than done to be honest

1052
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
These are people

1053
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
That are working

1054
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
They're in different time zones

1055
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Sometimes they don't

1056
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Speak English

1057
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,440
There's a lot of problems

1058
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
In that

1059
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,440
But I agree

1060
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,440
That could be one thing

1061
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
We could do

1062
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,440
We could also

1063
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
Actually reporting it

1064
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,440
To get more context

1065
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
Let it run first

1066
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440
Then report it

1067
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
And actually have a comment

1068
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
And I think we do actually

1069
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
Here on this show

1070
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
I think we do do that

1071
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,440
Fairly well

1072
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,440
And so I want to make sure

1073
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
It's like

1074
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,440
What I was thinking

1075
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,440
So I wrote down a couple ideas

1076
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,440
And you guys tell me

1077
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
What you think of this

1078
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,440
Maybe we could utilize

1079
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,440
Something like Hangouts

1080
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
And do round table discussions

1081
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,440
Where we'd bring on

1082
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Several people

1083
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
Like a counter point

1084
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,440
Point counter point discussion

1085
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,440
And you know

1086
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
We try to keep it civil

1087
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,440
I don't know how exactly

1088
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,440
We'd pull that off

1089
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,440
In timing wise

1090
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,440
But it could just be like

1091
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,440
People we could make

1092
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,440
We could send out invitations

1093
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,440
Say hey we'd like to have

1094
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,440
A nice civil discussion

1095
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
About this

1096
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
And then people

1097
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
And then

1098
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,440
What would be the ideal

1099
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
Output of that

1100
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
Would be a video

1101
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
That when the

1102
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,440
When the debate comes up

1103
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,440
On Reddit or on some form

1104
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
Or in an IRC room

1105
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Or wherever these debates happen

1106
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
You could send somebody

1107
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
That YouTube link

1108
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,440
And be like yeah

1109
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
These guys

1110
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,440
Discuss this here

1111
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,440
And you know

1112
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,440
This is a pretty good

1113
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,440
Point counter point discussion

1114
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,440
So that was one idea

1115
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
I had

1116
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
But it

1117
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,440
That is not an easy thing

1118
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,440
To do

1119
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
To schedule these people

1120
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,440
In the different time zones

1121
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
And organize all of that

1122
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
So it's

1123
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,440
It might be a little pie

1124
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
In the sky

1125
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
Go ahead

1126
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,440
What I think

1127
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,440
What's fueling this

1128
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,440
What's it called

1129
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,440
System D debate

1130
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Is prejudiced

1131
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
People

1132
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
People don't think

1133
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,440
System D before actually

1134
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Using it

1135
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
Sure

1136
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
I'm sure there's a little

1137
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
Prejudice and predetermination

1138
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
In it

1139
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
But it's

1140
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
It's a mix of stuff

1141
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,440
And there's

1142
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,440
Because scheduling

1143
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
Sorry I was just going to say

1144
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
Besides scheduling

1145
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Scheduling things live

1146
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
Is very difficult

1147
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,920
Especially with multiple individuals

1148
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,920
Why not have like

1149
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,920
A group email thread

1150
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,180
Where those people can reply

1151
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,200
To each other in a timely fashion

1152
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,520
And that can be summarized

1153
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,240
On say Linux unplugged

1154
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,440
It's pretty boring

1155
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,440
For the end

1156
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,080
For the listener

1157
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,080
But it's definitely

1158
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
Something

1159
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,080
It's already happening

1160
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,080
It's yeah

1161
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,080
Yeah

1162
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,080
And that might be

1163
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,080
Chris has not mentioned something

1164
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,080
Yes

1165
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,080
So

1166
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,920
So I have a different view

1167
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
On the matter

1168
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
Okay

1169
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,920
Actually not everything is

1170
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
Technical

1171
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,920
And of course

1172
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,880
System D is superior

1173
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,440
And it does things better

1174
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,440
And so on

1175
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,440
And we can praise it

1176
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
All day long

1177
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
But it's not only about that

1178
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,440
There's also a philosophical

1179
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,880
Or a belief based

1180
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,880
Right

1181
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,880
Opinion here

1182
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,880
Right

1183
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,880
And this is actually

1184
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,880
This is the same with

1185
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,920
Chrome versus Firefox as well

1186
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,920
This is why

1187
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,920
But

1188
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
Not to interrupt

1189
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
Before you go too much further

1190
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
I just want to say

1191
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,920
This is actually

1192
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
You're making the point

1193
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,920
This is why

1194
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,920
And skookiesbrights also

1195
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,920
Mentioned the chat room

1196
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,920
This is why I was thinking

1197
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,920
Instead of an email thread

1198
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
A hangout or whatever

1199
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
It would be web RTC session

1200
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
Or whatever is better

1201
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,920
Because what we have

1202
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,920
Happen a lot

1203
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,920
Is people start talking

1204
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
Philosophies across

1205
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,920
Each other's faces

1206
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,920
They're not talking

1207
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,920
To each other

1208
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,920
They talk across

1209
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,920
To each other

1210
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,920
About philosophy

1211
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,920
And things like that

1212
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,920
And the conversations

1213
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,920
Go totally on

1214
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
To deaf ears

1215
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,920
And so if they talk

1216
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
Then that would be something

1217
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,920
When people engage directly

1218
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,920
With each other

1219
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,920
They're more civil

1220
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,920
And they listen

1221
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
A little bit better

1222
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,920
Instead of having to

1223
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,920
Read a wall of text

1224
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,920
What do you think?

1225
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,920
Of course

1226
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,920
I absolutely agree with this

1227
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
But my point was actually

1228
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,920
About

1229
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
You know

1230
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,920
Attacking developers

1231
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,920
Due to

1232
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,920
Or developers essentially

1233
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,920
Resigning from their positions

1234
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,920
Because of

1235
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,920
A problem like that

1236
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,920
Of debates going on

1237
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Like that

1238
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:07,920
And what I wanted to mention

1239
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
Was

1240
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,920
It's the same

1241
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,920
You experienced

1242
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,920
That

1243
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,920
When you say you know

1244
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,920
I prefer Chrome

1245
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,920
Because it works

1246
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,920
So much better

1247
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,920
And so on

1248
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,920
You're right

1249
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,920
Chrome does work

1250
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Much better

1251
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,920
In a lot of cases

1252
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,920
A lot more than Firefox

1253
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
And systemd does a lot better

1254
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,920
Than sysv

1255
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
And its scripts

1256
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
But

1257
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,920
There is

1258
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,920
The philosophical side

1259
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,920
When

1260
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,920
I get upset

1261
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,920
When you

1262
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,920
When I see somebody

1263
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,920
Like you

1264
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,920
Who really praises

1265
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,920
Chrome

1266
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,920
That publicly

1267
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,920
And

1268
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,920
Because

1269
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,920
There is

1270
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,920
Something called

1271
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,920
Market share

1272
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,920
And market share is

1273
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,920
Information and power

1274
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,920
And

1275
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,920
We should not be putting

1276
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,920
All of our eggs

1277
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,920
In one basket

1278
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
And

1279
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
So

1280
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
I personally

1281
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,920
I never touch

1282
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,920
Chrome

1283
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,920
Even if Firefox crashes on me

1284
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,920
I just tolerate that

1285
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,920
I try to report bugs

1286
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,920
I do

1287
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,920
Everything I can

1288
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,920
Just

1289
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,920
Not because it's Firefox

1290
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,920
It's not about open web

1291
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,920
It's not about

1292
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
Anything like that

1293
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,920
It's just about

1294
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,920
Preventing a monoculture

1295
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,920
Right

1296
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
You don't want a monoculture

1297
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,920
In web browsers

1298
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,920
Yeah absolutely

1299
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,920
That's why I took the

1300
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,920
So this

1301
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,920
Sort of segues

1302
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,920
To my next thought

1303
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,920
Is maybe

1304
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,920
Instead of

1305
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,920
Trying to

1306
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,920
House discussions

1307
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,920
Maybe what we should

1308
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,920
Try to do

1309
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,920
Is hyper focus on ways

1310
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,920
To get people more involved

1311
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,920
With open source

1312
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,920
So there's more people

1313
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,920
Coming in

1314
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,920
Instead of

1315
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,920
Instead of

1316
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,920
Shouting from the

1317
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,920
Stadium

1318
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,920
At these developers

1319
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,920
Let's get more people

1320
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,920
In there

1321
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,920
Contributing

1322
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,920
And maybe instead of

1323
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,920
Being commentators

1324
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,920
In peanut gallery

1325
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,920
They'll actually have

1326
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,920
Some skin in the game

1327
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,920
And so my thought

1328
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,920
On that was

1329
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,920
Let's take a project

1330
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
And say

1331
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,920
This

1332
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,920
I don't know

1333
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,920
Let's just pick

1334
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,920
Because I love it

1335
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,920
Let's pick the

1336
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,920
Geary project

1337
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,920
This is the Geary

1338
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,920
Email client

1339
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,920
This is how you get

1340
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,920
Involved specifically

1341
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,920
With the Geary project

1342
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
Maybe we bring on

1343
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,920
One of their developers

1344
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,920
And ask them

1345
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,920
What would be the most

1346
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,920
Helpful type of contribution

1347
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,920
What would be the way

1348
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
People can get a hold of you

1349
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,920
How do they start

1350
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,920
Submitting code

1351
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,920
Where should they go to

1352
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,920
Submit patches

1353
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,920
And things like that

1354
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,920
And really give people

1355
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,920
Concrete

1356
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,920
Like if you want to walk

1357
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,920
Away from this episode

1358
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,920
Of the open source project

1359
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,920
And maybe we can sort of

1360
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,920
Get more people involved

1361
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,920
In that aspect of it

1362
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,920
And get people

1363
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,920
Out of the

1364
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,920
Playing

1365
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,920
You know

1366
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,920
Sports commentator

1367
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,920
And actually running the ball

1368
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,920
Huh?

1369
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,920
Look at that analogy

1370
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,920
I see what you did there

1371
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,920
Sports ball

1372
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,920
I don't know

1373
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,920
Sports ball

1374
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,920
But would that

1375
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,920
Actually be appealing though?

1376
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,920
I am already

1377
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,920
Doing it

1378
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,920
It's just

1379
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,920
That thing

1380
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,920
Like bringing

1381
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,920
More people to develop

1382
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,920
You need the

1383
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,920
One stop shop

1384
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,920
That I've been

1385
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,920
Talking about

1386
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,920
Yeah

1387
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,920
If the developers

1388
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,920
Don't have that

1389
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,920
One stop shop

1390
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,920
It's really hard

1391
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,920
To introduce someone

1392
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,920
Because they have to

1393
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,920
Detach from their tools

1394
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,920
Or their ways

1395
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,920
And there's also like

1396
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,920
These

1397
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,920
Floating guidance

1398
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,920
Right

1399
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:49,920
Right

1400
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,920
It's

1401
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,920
There's no channel

1402
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,920
For them just to get in

1403
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,920
And from end to end

1404
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,920
This is how you do it

1405
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,920
This is something

1406
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,920
We've talked about

1407
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,920
On Coda Radio

1408
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,920
Is when Mike was looking

1409
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,920
At writing one of his apps

1410
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,920
You know

1411
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,920
He's like

1412
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,920
Well do I

1413
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,920
Go grab the Ubuntu SDK

1414
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,920
Do I just go start writing

1415
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,920
You know

1416
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,920
And he's looking for

1417
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,920
Sort of a

1418
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,920
This is the path you take

1419
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,920
And it doesn't have to be

1420
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,920
The only path

1421
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,920
But it's sort of like

1422
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,920
Here's a pretty solid path

1423
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,920
That you're probably

1424
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
Going to be able to make

1425
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,920
A pretty decent app using

1426
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,920
And it's not too intimidating

1427
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,920
It's well supported

1428
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,920
And it's going to get you

1429
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,920
On most modern distributions

1430
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,920
Like that's really

1431
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,920
All we need

1432
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,920
We just need something

1433
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,920
Kind of like that

1434
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,920
There's different things out there

1435
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,920
You can absolutely

1436
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,920
Put together yourself

1437
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,920
No doubt about it

1438
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,920
But what the guys

1439
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,920
In the Mumbler are saying

1440
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,920
And what Michael Dominic

1441
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,920
Was saying

1442
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,920
Is they don't even know

1443
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,920
Where to start there

1444
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,920
Because they don't even know

1445
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,920
Those things exist

1446
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,920
Yeah

1447
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,920
I'm actually already

1448
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,920
Doing some work

1449
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,920
I'm not going to

1450
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,920
Advance much about it

1451
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,920
But I'm already

1452
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,920
Doing some work

1453
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,920
And I'm actually

1454
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
Going to propose

1455
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,920
To all the distributions

1456
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,920
See if we can get

1457
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,920
Some consensus

1458
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,920
On getting something going

1459
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,920
See this is

1460
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,920
A major area

1461
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,920
If we could get

1462
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,920
More people contributing

1463
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,920
Instead of just

1464
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,920
Being on the sidelines

1465
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,920
I feel like

1466
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,920
If we got the right

1467
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,920
I don't know

1468
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,920
Like that could be

1469
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,920
A great way to really

1470
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,920
Sort of move things forward

1471
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,920
And hopefully

1472
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
Make a positive impact

1473
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,920
So low level

1474
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,920
That it

1475
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,920
I don't know if it'd be

1476
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,920
Community changing

1477
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,920
But it would at least

1478
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,920
Be putting things

1479
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,920
In the right direction

1480
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,920
I don't know

1481
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,920
It's something I think

1482
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,920
We should think more about

1483
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,920
And I'd like to get

1484
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,920
The audience's thoughts on it

1485
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,920

Mumble room on that topic

Before we move on

1499
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
Yeah I still

1500
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,920
I mentioned

1501
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,920
The

1502
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,920
Firefox and Chrome thing

1503
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,920
And I just wanted to

1504
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,920
Like clarify

1505
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,920
Why I mentioned

1506
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,920
This point

1507
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,920
It's

1508
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,920
Like you can make

1509
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,920
The analogy with

1510
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,920
System D and Debian

1511
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,920
And Debian is about

1512
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,920
You know

1513
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,920
It has a history

1514
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,920
Of being careful

1515
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,920
And doing things slowly

1516
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,920
And taking their time

1517
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,920
And doing things right

1518
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,920
And not screwing up users

1519
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,920
And now that you introduce

1520
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,920
System D

1521
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,920
Which is essentially

1522
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,920
Turning most of Linux

1523
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,920
Into a monoculture

1524
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,920
Because

1525
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,920
Even if you want to do something

1526
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,920
That is not

1527
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,920
System D

1528
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,920
You then have to

1529
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,920
Do a lot of work

1530
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,920
Such as

1531
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,920
You can

1532
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,920
You can do so much

1533
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,920
Work to the extent

1534
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,920
That you're actually

1535
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,920
Forking parts of

1536
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,920
Desktop environments

1537
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,920
Just to make things

1538
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,920
Work without System D

1539
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,920
And

1540
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,920
I think

1541
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,920
People in the

1542
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,920
Debian project

1543
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,920
Are really worried about this

1544
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,920
And I think

1545
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,920
They should be

1546
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,920
Because

1547
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,920
Essentially System D

1548
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,920
Is not a community project

1549
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,920
It's a Red Hat project

1550
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,920
And Red Hat can be

1551
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,920
Exercising political power

1552
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,920
Using technical

1553
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Manipulation

1554
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,920
Alright

1555
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,920
Alright

1556
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,920
Okay

1557
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,920
Let's get on the topic

1558
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,920
Because I don't agree

1559
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,920
With half of what you said

1560
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,920
But I really don't want

1561
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
To debate it anymore

1562
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
And it's not a Red Hat project

1563
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,920
Yes, Red Hat's involved in it

1564
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,920
I think that's one of the reasons

1565
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,920
It's been as successful as it has

1566
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
And yes, I would be also concerned

1567
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
If I was a big competitor

1568
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,920
Of Red Hat

1569
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,920
About that

1570
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,920
But to be truthfully

1571
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
To call it a Red Hat project

1572
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,920
That's sort of disrespectful

1573
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,920
To all of the engineers

1574
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,920
At Intel

1575
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,920
And all of the engineers

1576
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,920
At SUSE

1577
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,920
That are developing on it

1578
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,920
Every single day

1579
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,920
The developers at Arch

1580
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,920
That are writing code on it

1581
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,920
Every single day

1582
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,920
I mean

1583
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,920
That's disrespectful to all

1584
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,920
Of the people outside of Red Hat

1585
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,920
That are contributing to it

1586
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,920
We don't need to be this extreme

1587
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,920
When we talk about it

1588
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,920
Yes, it has its downsides

1589
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,920
The monoculture can be bad

1590
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,920
But we don't

1591
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,920
You don't have to exaggerate it either

1592
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,920
It is what it is

1593
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,920
But I don't want to discuss it

1594
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,920
You're right

1595
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,920
Okay

1596
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,920
We're done

1597
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,920
The system, do you think

1598
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,920
To be honest with you

1599
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,920
Until something more changes

1600
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,920
I feel like

1601
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,920
It's

1602
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,920
I feel like

1603
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,920
As a community

1604
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,920
We've talked it to death

1605
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,920
I mean

1606
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,920
I talk about stuff for a living

1607
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,920
And I'm done talking about it

1608
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,920
It's just

1609
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,920
You know

1610
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,920
I really think

1611
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,920
It's an interesting

1612
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,920
I really think

1613
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,920
It's an interesting topic

1614
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
I do

1615
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,920
I do too

1616
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,920
But I also have to respect

1617
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,920
A lot of the audience

1618
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,920
Doesn't care anymore

1619
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,920
So

1620
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,920
And I really don't understand

1621
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,920
Why we make this more complicated

1622
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,920
Than it needs to be

1623
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,920
It's like look

1624
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,920
Okay

1625
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,920
We get a kiddie swimming pool

1626
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,920
Loaded up with mud

1627
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,920
Maybe a little salsa

1628
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,920
And mud wrestle

1629
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,920
Whoever wins

1630
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
Wins

1631
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,920
You know what

1632
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,920
If we could solve it that way

1633
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,920
I'd be all for it

1634
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
I mean

1635
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,920
Honestly

1636
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,920
I could continue to debate it

1637
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,920
I agree

1638
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,920
And I think it's a fascinating thing

1639
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,920
But at a point

1640
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,920
The conversation starts getting into

1641
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
A lot of

1642
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,920
A lot of different areas

1643
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,920
That I just

1644
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,920
I just don't think

1645
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,920
We've tried it too many times

1646
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
Absolutely

1647
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,920
Maybe

1648
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,920
You know what

1649
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,920
I'm not saying

1650
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,920
I'm not shutting the conversation

1651
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,920
Down forever

1652
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,920
I just want to give it some time

1653
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,920
To breathe

1654
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
And develop more

1655
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,920
Yeah

1656
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,920
Before we obsess on it

1657
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
Put it on the windowsill

1658
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,920
For a bit

1659
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,920
Sure

1660
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,920
Yeah

1661
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,920
All right

1662
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,920
So you know what

1663
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,920
Let's take a break

1664
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,920
To sort of change gears

1665
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,920
And then

1666
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,920
We're going to work on

1667
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,920
This is

1668
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,920
There's sort of a theme

1669
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,920
To today's episode

1670
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,920
And we're going to round it off

1671
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,920
With a final topic

1672
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,920
And I think we'll have

1673
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,920
A lot more to come

1674
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,920
And you'll save $25

1675
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,920
Off your first Ting device

1676
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,920
If you already have

1677
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,920
A Ting compatible device

1678
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,920
You'll get $25

1679
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,920
Of credits

1680
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,920
And because Ting is only

1681
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,920
Paid for what you use

1682
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,920
It's a flat $6 for the line

1683
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,920
And it's just your minutes

1684
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,920
Your messages

1685
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
Your megabytes

1686
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,920
That $25

1687
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,920
Might carry you through

1688
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,920
More than your first month

1689
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,920
It did for me

1690
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,920
And I still haven't forgotten that

1691
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,920
That was my

1692
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,920
That was I think

1693
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,920
A pretty awesome

1694
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,920
First impression of Ting

1695
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,920
Now I'm coming in

1696
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,920
On my second year almost

1697
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,920
I think it will be

1698
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,920
Towards the end of December

1699
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,920
And it's amazing

1700
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,920
I've got the Nexus 5

1701
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,920
The iPhone 5

1702
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,920
$6 each

1703
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,920
Only paying for what I use

1704
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,920
And Ting has no

1705
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,920
Whole customer service

1706
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,920
Which is crazy great

1707
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,920
1855

1708
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,920
Ting FTW

1709
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,920
Any time between 8 AM

1710
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
Or 8 PM

1711
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,920
And a human being

1712
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,920
Answers the phone

1713
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,920
And they solve your problems

1714
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,920
They have a great dashboard

1715
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,920
I mean it really is great

1716
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,920
It's better than any

1717
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,920
Mobile carrier's dashboard

1718
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,920
And I know

1719
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,920
Because I've tried them all

1720
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,920
You can activate

1721
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,920
Deactivate lines

1722
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,920
Transfer devices

1723
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,920
Set nicknames

1724
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,920
Alerts

1725
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,920
Thresholds

1726
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,920
All kinds of really

1727
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,920
Crazy stuff

1728
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,920
You wouldn't believe

1729
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,920
You could even pay for your

1730
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,920
Ting account

1731
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,920
You could even pay for your

1732
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,920
Nexus 6

1733
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,920
You know that big old

1734
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,920
Nexus 6

1735
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,920
Well it's coming real soon

1736
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,920
To Ting

1737
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,920
So now is the time

1738
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,920
To grab your Sim

1739
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,920
If you're looking for

1740
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,920
The Nexus 6

1741
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,920
On Ting

1742
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,920
Which would be an awesome

1743
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,920
Combo

1744
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,920
Nexus 6

1745
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,920
Android L

1746
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,920
Ting

1747
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,920
Only pay for what you use

1748
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,920
No contract

1749
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,920
No early termination fee

1750
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,920
Kind of awesome

1751
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,920
So go order a Ting

1752
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,920
Nexus to Sim card

1753
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,920
Go get that

1754
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,920
Then you grab your Nexus 6

1755
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,920
Pop your Ting card in there

1756
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,920
Then you go over to their website

1757
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,920
Bob's your uncle

1758
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,920
Now you got Ting service

1759
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,920
On your Nexus 6

1760
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,920
Woowee

1761
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,920
Linux.ting.com

1762
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,920
Linux.ting.com

1763
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,920
That lets them know

1764
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,920
You appreciate them supporting

1765
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,920
The Linux Unplugged Show

1766
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,920
Linux.ting.com

1767
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,920
And it gets you that

1768
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,920
$25 credit

1769
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,920
And a big thank you to Ting

1770
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,920
For sponsoring

1771
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,920
The Linux Unplugged Show

1772
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,920
Okay, alright, okay, okay

1773
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,920
Alright, shake it off guys

1774
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,920
Everybody's good

1775
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,920
We're good, we're good

1776
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,920
Cause I don't want this

1777
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,920
To be a negative thing

1778
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,920
Because I've seen this

1779
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,920
Kicked around a couple of times

1780
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,920
And I saw it land

1781
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,920
On Reddit today

1782
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,920
And he said

1783
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,920
Oh I'm sorry

1784
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,920
It was yesterday

1785
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:21,920
He says what are the

1786
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,920
Drawbacks of Linux

1787
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,920
Considering moving

1788
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,920
From Windows

1789
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,920
To Linux

1790
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,920
I use my computer

1791
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:27,920
A lot at work

1792
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,920
And unfortunately

1793
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,920
The business world

1794
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,920
Is riddled with Windows

1795
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,920
I'm currently on a Mac

1796
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,920
Oh, I misread that

1797
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,920
I'm currently on a Mac

1798
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,920
And the good thing with that

1799
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,920
Has been

1800
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,920
There's Office

1801
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,920
For OS X

1802
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,920
I don't like Office

1803
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,920
But it makes life easier

1804
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,920
But more importantly

1805
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
Besides the small things

1806
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,920
Like MS Office

1807
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,920
What other drawbacks

1808
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,920
Should I take into

1809
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,920
Consideration about Linux

1810
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,920
I'm fully aware of how awesome

1811
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,920
Some software is

1812
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,920
But he wants to know

1813
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,920
From the perspective

1814
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,920
Of long time users

1815
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,920
So

1816
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,920
I read some of these comments

1817
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,920
And I thought to myself

1818
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,920
I think coming out of it

1819
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,920
That the most complicated

1820
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,920
Thing about Linux

1821
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,920
Is also the strongest

1822
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,920
And best thing about Linux

1823
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,920
And that is

1824
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,920
There's a lot of diversity

1825
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,920
There's a lot of things

1826
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:05,920
Going on

1827
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,920
There's a lot of different

1828
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,920
Projects

1829
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,920
There's a lot of different

1830
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,920
Efforts underway

1831
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,920
All at once

1832
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,920
And when you step back

1833
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,920
From the big picture

1834
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,920
That's a great thing

1835
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,920
But when you get down

1836
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,920
Into the weeds

1837
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,920
It looks like insanity

1838
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,920
Or maybe that's vice versa

1839
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,920
I'm not so sure

1840
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,920
Okay

1841
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,920
So I know everybody

1842
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,920
Probably has a few ideas

1843
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,920
I saw that

1844
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,920
Wizard Jed

1845
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,920
Tossed his hat in the ring

1846
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,920
So Wizard Jed

1847
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,920
What's your take on this?

1848
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,920
So there's a lot of

1849
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,920
Really really high level

1850
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,920
Software out there right now

1851
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,920
That is extremely complicated

1852
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,920
And things like

1853
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,920
High end parts of Libre Office

1854
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,920
And high end parts of

1855
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,920
Specifically Microsoft

1856
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,920
Style products like SSMS

1857
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,920
It's the pieces of software

1858
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,920
That aren't necessarily

1859
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,920
Really nice

1860
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,920
And it's not that

1861
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,920
They don't have an alternative

1862
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,920
So this is your drawback

1863
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,920
Well these are just

1864
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,920
General things

1865
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,920
They'll just be

1866
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,920
Something that will

1867
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,920
Be there

1868
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,920
And people will say

1869
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,920
You have to use this

1870
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,920
And you're using this

1871
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,920
Because there's no training

1872
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,920
For the other things

1873
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,920
So we're not even

1874
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,920
Going to look at it

1875
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,920
It's not even an option

1876
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,920
Hmm

1877
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,920
Alright

1878
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,920
So my drawback was

1879
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,920
Sort of like

1880
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,920
It can be a mess

1881
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,920
A little bit

1882
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,920
But you can avoid that

1883
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,920
And when you say

1884
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,920
Software support

1885
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,920
You're coming out from

1886
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,920
The things like

1887
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,920
Large management suites

1888
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,920
Like from Microsoft

1889
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:21,920
Maybe the AutoCAD

1890
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,920
That's a popular one

1891
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,920
But I feel like

1892
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,920
Those are like

1893
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,920
Well known drawbacks

1894
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,920
That if you are

1895
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,920
Working maybe

1896
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,920
On a Mac now

1897
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,920
Maybe it's not a problem

1898
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,920
Right

1899
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:31,920
Because you're probably

1900
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,920
Not plugged into an SMS

1901
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,920
Management infrastructure

1902
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,920
Or using AutoCAD

1903
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,920
That's on Windows

1904
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,920
Right

1905
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,920
So that might not be

1906
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,920
As much of an issue

1907
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,920
I'm trying to think of

1908
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,920
Drawbacks that

1909
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,920
Would smack you more

1910
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,920
In the face

1911
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,920
But I could see

1912
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,920
Definitely software

1913
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,920
Availability being one

1914
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,920
That if you didn't

1915
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,920
Research first

1916
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,920
Then another thing

1917
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,920
Would be

1918
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,920
One is just

1919
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,920
The package

1920
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,920
You know

1921
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,920
Just discovering

1922
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,920
The different packages

1923
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,920
And applications

1924
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,920
You can get

1925
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,920
Then also discovering

1926
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,920
Which one works

1927
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,920
For your distro

1928
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,920
And then also

1929
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,920
To find out which version

1930
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,920
That you want to use

1931
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,920
Because you

1932
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,920
You know

1933
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,920
There's a lot of the time

1934
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,920
The stuff that's in

1935
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,920
The official repo

1936
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,920
Is out of date

1937
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,920
And you have no idea

1938
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,920
So people who are

1939
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,920
Coming into Linux

1940
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,920
And are expecting

1941
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,920
To be able to

1942
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,920
Like search Google

1943
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,920
Or something

1944
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,920
They're probably

1945
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,920
Not expecting

1946
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,920
That

1947
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,920
Now what do you think

1948
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,920
How important is that

1949
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,920
Like that local

1950
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,920
Tech support angle

1951
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,920
You know

1952
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,920
If you got

1953
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,920
A Windows or a Mac

1954
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,920
There's a good chance

1955
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,920
You can either go

1956
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,920
Talk to the Geek Squad

1957
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,920
Or there's somebody

1958
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,920
In your local

1959
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,920
Social group

1960
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,920
That probably knows

1961
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,920
How to troubleshoot

1962
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,920
The problem

1963
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
Maybe not the case

1964
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,920
If you got a

1965
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,920
Linux box, right

1966
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,920
Don't you think

1967
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,920
Go ahead

1968
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,920
I know

1969
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,920
All right

1970
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,920
Go ahead

1971
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,920
Matt

1972
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,920
You take it

1973
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,920
Okay

1974
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,920
So that's

1975
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:47,920
That's a big thing

1976
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,920
Because you know

1977
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,920
I used to do

1978
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,920
A lot of home repair

1979
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,920
Way, way back in the day

1980
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,920
And that's one thing

1981
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,920
That I ran into

1982
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,920
Is if I was going to

1983
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,920
Switch someone over to Linux

1984
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,920
I had better not retire

1985
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,920
Because I'm going to be

1986
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,920
The one supporting it

1987
00:58:58,920 --> 00:58:59,920
No one else is

1988
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,920
I think that's definitely

1989
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,920
A problem

1990
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,920
Because for whatever reason

1991
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,920
Local techs just don't

1992
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,920
Seem to think

1993
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,920
That there's any money in it

1994
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,920
Or they're not able to learn

1995
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,920
Or whatever their individual

1996
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,920
Vices may be against it

1997
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,920
But that is definitely

1998
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,920
A problem

1999
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,920
Yeah

2000
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,920
And people get confused

2001
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,920
By choice

2002
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,920
But I feel like

2003
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,920
This is a problem

2004
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,920
That us geeks

2005
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,920
Obsess about

2006
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,920
Way

2007
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,920
See okay

2008
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,920
Here's my final thought on this

2009
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,920
And then mumble and I'll let

2010
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,920
Anybody else that has

2011
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,920
Any closing thoughts

2012
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,920
But here's my final thought

2013
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,920
Is this is a problem

2014
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,920
That us geeks worry about

2015
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,920
Way more than end users

2016
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,920
Worry about

2017
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,920
They don't think about it

2018
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,920
See they don't think

2019
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,920
Software first

2020
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:32,920
They think

2021
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,920
I got to buy a device first

2022
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,920
That's how they go

2023
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,920
And they don't

2024
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,920
You know

2025
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,920
I mean

2026
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,920
So it's

2027
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,920
There's all this choice

2028
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,920
All this complexity

2029
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,920
Or randomness

2030
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,920
Whatever you want to call it

2031
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,920
It doesn't matter to them

2032
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,920
They get somebody

2033
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,920
And they say okay

2034
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,920
I've decided I want to do

2035
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,920
This Windows thing

2036
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,920
And Mac isn't for me

2037
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,920
And they go say

2038
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,920
Grab a

2039
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,920
System 76 Ultra Pro

2040
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,920
They they will never really

2041
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,920
Have to worry

2042
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,920
That there's

2043
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,920
A dozen different desktop

2044
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,920
Environments if they want

2045
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,920
You know

2046
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,920
They don't

2047
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,920
They don't ever have to

2048
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,920
Consider it

2049
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,920
So I think it's a problem

2050
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,920
That really exists

2051
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,920
In the minds of geeks

2052
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,920
And not so much in a problem

2053
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,920
Of end users

2054
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,920
And then of course

2055
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,920
Then you get into

2056
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,920
The gray area where you have

2057
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,920
Your more advanced users

2058
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
That want to be able to go out

2059
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,920
And grab a piece of hardware

2060
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,920
Or something like that

2061
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,920
And the end users

2062
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,920
We're really talking about here

2063
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,920
I don't think it's

2064
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,920
A big of a problem

2065
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,920
Anybody disagree?

2066
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,920
No

2067
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,920
That's particularly right

2068
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,920
No

2069
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,920
Yeah

2070
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,920
If they have

2071
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,920
If they have something like

2072
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,920
Access to something like that

2073
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:25,920
That'd be great

2074
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,920
If they're just trying

2075
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,920
To find Linux

2076
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,920
Because they've heard about it

2077
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,920
Then it's really hard to find

2078
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,920
People to help you

2079
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,920
Like there's lugs

2080
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,920
But they're hard to

2081
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,920
Yeah

2082
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,920
Find themselves

2083
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,920
And sometimes the lugs

2084
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,920
Aren't very organized

2085
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,920
So it's

2086
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,920
You know

2087
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:39,920
They might show up one day

2088
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,920
And then change it the next week

2089
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,920
And you know

2090
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,920
You can't do that

2091
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,920
But yet that survey shows

2092
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,920
That so many of the people

2093
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,920
In that survey were using

2094
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,920
Linux on their desktop

2095
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,920
So it happens

2096
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,920
It doesn't happen very easily

2097
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,920
But it gets out there

2098
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,920
And it's really

2099
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,920
I think

2100
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,920
I don't know

2101
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,920
I think

2102
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,920
I think once you discover it

2103
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,920
If you are technically inclined

2104
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,920
It's pretty attractive

2105
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,920
And I think that's more

2106
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,920
Of our user base

2107
01:00:58,920 --> 01:00:59,920
I think if we're true

2108
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,920
To ourselves

2109
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,920
Because of these barriers

2110
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,920
We've talked about

2111
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,920
In today's episode

2112
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,920
The problem of discovering it

2113
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,920
And the problem of

2114
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,920
You know

2115
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,920
All these little issues

2116
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,920
That we've just talked about

2117
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,920
I think it's more practical

2118
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,920
To expect that it's

2119
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,920
Going to be finding

2120
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,920
And discovering

2121
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,920
And implementing it

2122
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,920
And that's why we're all

2123
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,920
Obsessed about this stuff

2124
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,920
Because that's

2125
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:17,920
That's all who we are

2126
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,920
It's a big echo chamber

2127
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,920
And if you step outside

2128
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,920
The echo chamber

2129
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,920
It's not that big of a deal

2130
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,920
That's my thoughts

2131
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Hey

2132
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:24,920
I'll give a plug

2133
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,920

We want to see

Like a picture of your setup

2139
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,920
Maybe a video of your setup

2140
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,920

2143
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:35,920
In the subject line

2144
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,920
And we'll feature it

2145
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,920
In a future episode

See, I don't know if we're

2212
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,920
Going to get something

2213
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,920
Out of this

2214
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:31,920
It's a mess

2215
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:32,920
What a mess

2216
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,920
JBtitles.com

2217
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,920
Hey, I had a question

2218
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:35,920
I wanted to ask everybody

2219
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,920
Twitch chat room

2220
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,920
Anybody listening

2221
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,920
I'm doing some improvements

2222
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,920
In my Twitter feed

2223
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,920
My Twitter feed

2224
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,920
And I'm wondering

2225
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,920
If there's

2226
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,920
If anybody could toss links

2227
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,920
In the IRC

2228
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,920
For interesting folks

2229
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,920
In the Linux community

2230
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,920
That you follow

2231
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,920
That maybe I should follow

2232
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,920
So put links in the chat room

2233
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,920
All right, JBtitles.com

2234
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,920
Did we get any titles at all?

2235
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,920
Anybody suggesting titles?

2236
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,920
We got a lot

2237
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,920
Yeah, there are some titles

2238
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:55,920
There

2239
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:56,920
Oh, good

2240
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,920
Good

2241
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,920
Oh, yeah, we did

2242
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,920
Okay, all right

2243
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,920
Debbie and Disintegration

2244
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,920
Ouch, that's

2245
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,920
Ouch

Ouch

2249
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,920

Disaster D

2253
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:11,920
Oh, that's not bad

2254
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,920
The System D

2255

01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,920

2258
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,920
No, you know

2259
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,920
I got to tell you

2260
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,920
Yikes

2261
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,920
Yikes

2262
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,920

Gate

2264
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,920
And also

2265
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:23,920
If you happen to be listening

2266
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,920
At home

2267
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,920
And have anybody you follow

2268
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,920
Send it in to the show

2269
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:27,920
And

2270
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,920
Yeah

2271
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,920
Get that Twitter feed

2272
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,920
It's also

2273
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:31,920
Yeah

2274
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,920
I think it's worth remembering

2275
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,920
That it's just you guys

2276
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,920
It's

2277
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,920
In the end of the day

2278
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,920
It's just you guys

2279
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,920
The project's still awesome

2280
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,920
Sure, sure

2281
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,920
JBtitles.com

2282
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:41,920
It's just you guys

2283
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:42,920
That'd make a good title

2284
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,920
Right there

2285
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,920
It's just you guys

2286
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,920
Two guys in a podcast

2287
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,920
The real issues

2288
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,920
I'm biting my tongue

2289
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,920
I'm not saying a word

2290
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:49,920
The real issues of Linux

2291
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,920
How do you like that?

2292
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:51,920
Yeah, well

2293
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,920
The real issues of Linux

2294
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,920
I still like Debbie and Community Divided

2295
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,920
Because it's not inaccurate

2296
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:58,920
Yeah

2297
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,920
Yeah

2298
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,920
It really isn't

2299
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,920
And that's not

2300
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,920
Yeah

2301
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,920
Necessarily negative

2302
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,920
It's just factual

2303
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,920
Yeah

2304
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:06,920
I mean, you say Community Divided

2305
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,920
And that's true

2306
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,920
For all of it

2307
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,920
Yeah, I mean

2308
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:10,920
Really, I mean

2309
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:11,920
What Community isn't

2310
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,920
It has division

2311
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:13,920
At some point

2312
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,920
The drawbacks of Linux

2313
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,920
Because I feel like

2314
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,920
The Debian part

2315
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:17,920
Was more of an overall

2316
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,920
Discussion

2317
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,920
Okay

2318
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,920
I mean, it could be

2319
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,920
Just about Debian

2320
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,920
I mean, that's not bad

2321
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,920
But

2322
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,920
I think that's

2323
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:25,920
I hate to say it

2324
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,920
But there was so much of it

2325
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,920
That was

2326
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,920
Yeah

2327
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,920
That it would feel disingenuous

2328
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,920
To try and like

2329
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,920
Spin some happy little

2330
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,920
Bunny time thing in there

2331
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,920
I don't know

2332
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,920
Yeah

2333
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,920
All right

2334
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:36,920
Well, we'll let democracy decide

2335
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:37,920
JBTitles.com

2336
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,920
JBTitles.com

2337
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:39,920
The vote is on

2338
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,920
Democracy

2339
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,920
Mm-hmm

2340
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,920
Mm-hmm

2341
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,920
Mm-hmm

2342
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:44,920
I think it's wasted effort

2343
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,920
Hmm

2344
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,920
Beating the System D horse

2345
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,920
Debbie and Community Divided

2346
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:49,920
Is still rising

2347
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,920
Two sides

2348
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,920
One System D

2349
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,920
That's not bad

2350
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,920
That's not bad

2351
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,920
It's a little dirty though

2352
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:56,920
Okay

2353
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,920
I think Debbie and

2354
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,920
I think Debbie and Community Divided

2355
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:01,920
Is our winner

2356
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,920
Ladies and gentlemen

2357
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,920
I think we're going to go that way

2358
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,920
All right

2359
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:07,920
So, hour early everybody

2360
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,920
See you next week

2361
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,920
Thanks everybody
