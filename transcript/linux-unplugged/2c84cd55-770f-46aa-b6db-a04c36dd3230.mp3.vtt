This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 8 for October 1st, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.680
Hi everyone, and welcome to Linux Unplugged, the weekly Linux podcast that slow cooks the

00:40.680 --> 00:46.400
Linux topics of the day and then extracts sweet, juicy meat sauce called Linux Unplugged.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.640
My name is Chris.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.640
My name is Matt.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.640
Hey there, Matt.

00:49.640 --> 00:50.640
Welcome to Episode 8.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.640
Hey, thanks for having me.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.600
Now, we're both kind of, we have a Steam hangover because we've been talking and thinking

00:54.600 --> 00:58.640
a lot about Steam, and then of course, even though the federal government shut down today,

00:58.640 --> 01:01.120
the Jupiter Broadcasting crew is here, we're not shut down.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.120
Never.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.120
Never.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.120
Takes more than that to shut us down.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.760
Takes more than an, actually, I guess, inaction of Congress to shut us down, but it could

01:07.760 --> 01:10.320
take an action at Congress, actually, now that I think about it, that could shut us

01:10.320 --> 01:11.320
down.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.320
Yeah, it could.

01:12.320 --> 01:17.200
Well, so we've got some good follow-up from Sunday's Linux action show where we covered

01:17.200 --> 01:21.000
Zone Minder and we also talked a little bit more about Steam, but also, though, we're

01:21.000 --> 01:23.040
going to talk about that cloud today.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.000
It actually just came up on the pre-show unprompted.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.720
People have a little bit of cloud guilt because it's just so convenient.

01:29.720 --> 01:35.760
Dropbox, Google Docs, Spotify, Google Plus images, that happens to be my current weak

01:35.760 --> 01:36.760
spot.

01:36.760 --> 01:37.760
It's almost like a drug of choice.

01:37.760 --> 01:42.600
It's like, I feel like it solved my life problems, but at the same time, there's some fundamentals

01:42.600 --> 01:44.320
that we have to take into consideration.

01:44.320 --> 01:47.680
These are not free systems, these are not open systems, and even if you're a technically

01:47.680 --> 01:51.720
advanced user, you often don't get to know of any of the implementation details, so it

01:51.720 --> 01:55.600
essentially is a magic box, and that is bad for many, many reasons, so we're going to

01:55.600 --> 01:56.920
talk about some of that today, Matt.

01:56.920 --> 01:57.920
What do you think?

01:57.920 --> 01:58.920
I think it's a good plan.

01:58.920 --> 01:59.920
All right.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.920
Well, very good.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.360
There were just a few little less spots I wanted to follow up on.

02:04.360 --> 02:08.480
We got some good threads going, and of course, what is... I don't know, Matt.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.440
It seems to happen more than you'd expect.

02:10.440 --> 02:14.520
A lot of times, one of the things we get the most feedback on is not what we made the main

02:14.520 --> 02:15.520
topic of the show.

02:15.520 --> 02:16.520
Of course.

02:16.520 --> 02:22.960
At any time, the discussion happens to switch over to, oh, I don't know, KDE or GNOME.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.560
That always seems to be a point of feedback.

02:25.560 --> 02:31.040
We always tend to get... When it's me switching back to GNOME, then I always get this piece

02:31.040 --> 02:32.040
of feedback.

02:32.040 --> 02:36.960
He says... This is from Paul Furr on the Zone Minder feedback thread from the Linux

02:36.960 --> 02:37.960
Action Shows episode.

02:37.960 --> 02:44.320
He says, by the way, talking about my switch to KDE, one thing about KDE that always bugged

02:44.320 --> 02:46.360
me is the lack of design... That's the next comment.

02:46.360 --> 02:50.840
He says, much of the low-level things in GNOME are due to input from Red Hat.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.940
There was a post a while ago from Aaron Saigo where he envisioned the GNOME guys focusing

02:53.940 --> 02:59.120
on low stuff and low-level stuff and leaving the user experience layer to the QT technologies.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.400
To me, the GNOME UI still makes no logical sense wherever.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.600
Now, here's where he goes in for the killing blow, Matt.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.600
Stand by.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.600
Okay.

03:06.600 --> 03:10.240
Chris also managed to make his KDE setup look rather hideous, so no wonder no one would

03:10.240 --> 03:11.880
want to look at that for much longer.

03:11.880 --> 03:12.880
Oh!

03:12.880 --> 03:13.880
Oh, wow.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.860
I see him also blaming KDE for what most likely was the unstable and impractical Fiddler's

03:17.860 --> 03:24.360
distro, Arch, wrecking his configuration.

03:24.360 --> 03:27.840
Last time I checked, I've never had my doorbell ring and had a distro walk into my house and

03:27.840 --> 03:28.840
wreck my stuff.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.120
I've never actually experienced this.

03:31.120 --> 03:34.480
Now, I have experienced something to where I may have installed something and I may have

03:34.480 --> 03:36.400
wrecked my stuff, but I just want to put that out there.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.400
Yeah, I'll tell you what I did.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
I'll tell you how I wrecked it.

03:38.400 --> 03:42.360
For those of you, I did wreck it, and for those of you who don't know, I made a big

03:42.360 --> 03:46.560
switch over to KDE, and there was so much stuff I liked about it.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.560
Right.

03:47.560 --> 03:52.840
So, things that actually kind of affect my daily workflow because I encode video files

03:52.840 --> 03:59.720
over network NFS shares, and actually SFTP shares, and that would be like Dolphin doesn't

03:59.720 --> 04:02.280
mount a directory when you browse it on the web.

04:02.280 --> 04:07.040
It does like this fancy Dolphin virtual file system, whereas like Thinar and Nautilus,

04:07.040 --> 04:11.340
or files, actually they put that sucker in a.gvs folder, and Bob's your uncle.

04:11.340 --> 04:13.540
You can go get it if you want to.

04:13.540 --> 04:16.220
And then that makes it like Handbrake works with it, and that makes a bunch of other programs

04:16.220 --> 04:17.220
work with it.

04:17.220 --> 04:18.220
Yeah.

04:18.220 --> 04:19.220
It just doesn't in KDE.

04:19.220 --> 04:20.220
I would agree with that.

04:20.220 --> 04:25.840
I would even go so far as to say my only real honest-to-God hang-up with KDE that really

04:25.840 --> 04:29.800
gets my goat is the sound issue, and I know that a lot of you guys don't experience that,

04:29.800 --> 04:30.800
and that's totally okay.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.800
I get that.

04:31.800 --> 04:36.480
But outside of that, in many ways, KDE is more attractive to me than the alternatives.

04:36.480 --> 04:40.720
You've lived this sound problem with me, though, and I got to say, this is a problem for me

04:40.720 --> 04:44.640
because I have, it turns out, a sound board, right?

04:44.640 --> 04:50.040
There it is, and that sound board is powered by a Linux box, and that Linux box has multiple

04:50.040 --> 04:51.040
sound cards in it.

04:51.040 --> 04:56.720
It has an HDMI sound out, it has two audio jack-out ports, and it also then has a USB

04:56.720 --> 04:57.760
sound deck.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.800
That's what I use for the sound board, and it just happens to be in KDE that it doesn't

05:01.800 --> 05:05.920
seem to be when I switch the sound device that it actually switches, right?

05:05.920 --> 05:06.920
Right, right.

05:06.920 --> 05:07.920
Exactly.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.000
And also with KDE, something I think a lot of the chat room has touched on, and this

05:11.000 --> 05:15.880
is certainly true, that it always feels like it's going to be better in that next release.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.800
We're almost there, just need that one tweak, oh, we broke that other thing, but that's

05:19.800 --> 05:22.000
okay, we got this new feature, let's get excited.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.640
It always feels like we're two steps forward, one step back in a lot of ways.

05:26.640 --> 05:27.640
That's true.

05:27.640 --> 05:32.420
And to be fair, I totally respect the technology in KDE, the integration, the fact that it

05:32.420 --> 05:36.880
let me just create anything I wanted, and I went for a traditional task bar, system

05:36.880 --> 05:38.760
tray, menu launcher UI.

05:38.760 --> 05:44.640
I thought, let's go back to what Windows was doing for 25 years and see if maybe they were

05:44.640 --> 05:49.800
on to something, or CDE, let's go back to CDE, basically, and just kind of do a very

05:49.800 --> 05:50.800
traditional desktop.

05:50.800 --> 05:55.200
Of course, that's what he's saying, look hideous, I don't know.

05:55.200 --> 05:59.760
I will come back to though, the problem is that what I might call instability, you could

05:59.760 --> 06:03.000
also call unexpected behavior.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.920
So for example, Dolphin not mounting a share, the sound system not actually switching when

06:07.920 --> 06:11.720
I make the switch, and then the third, this is the thing that bit me, and this is the

06:11.720 --> 06:15.960
main reason I went back to GNOME, is Matt, you recall back during the show when I lost

06:15.960 --> 06:16.960
my KDE config, right?

06:16.960 --> 06:19.840
I do remember that, I do remember, yes.

06:19.840 --> 06:24.520
And I ended up having to nuke my.kde4 directory and kind of starting from scratch.

06:24.520 --> 06:30.920
So this time around, I broke it again, and I mean, I know I did this, and I acknowledge

06:30.920 --> 06:36.120
I did this, and I kind of feel like it should not be this easy to break, and I'm trying

06:36.120 --> 06:40.560
to remember the exact command, so mind the dinging as I bring it up here.

06:40.560 --> 06:46.640
So I ran the command Plasma Desktop under GNOME, because I was working on a segment

06:46.640 --> 06:51.300
about widgets for the GNOME desktop, because there used to be a whole bunch of options

06:51.300 --> 06:55.920
to get a photo slideshow on your desktop, and there's of course Conky, but there used

06:55.920 --> 07:00.140
to be a whole bunch of things that they've all basically been abandoned.

07:00.140 --> 07:02.920
And I was working on a little spotlight thing I was going to do for last, where I was going

07:02.920 --> 07:06.200
to show you how you could take some of the great KDE Plasma widgets and actually run

07:06.200 --> 07:08.440
them in GNOME, and it works just fine.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.080
And to do that, you run the Plasma Desktop command.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.880
That starts up the Plasma Desktop shell, and then you just add widgets like you would

07:13.880 --> 07:16.160
in KDE, and you pick your widgets.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.160
Super straightforward.

07:17.160 --> 07:21.720
So I logged into GNOME just to play with it, to do a little segment on it, and when I ran

07:21.720 --> 07:26.200
that Plasma Desktop command under my GNOME session, when I logged out of GNOME and logged

07:26.200 --> 07:30.080
back into KDE, everything was gone.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.120
It was back to a fresh install of KDE.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.200
You know, that sucks, because I mean, that would be a real disappointment, because then

07:35.200 --> 07:39.160
you essentially have to live in a world where you've got to have some recursive backup of

07:39.160 --> 07:40.160
your KDE directory.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.160
Right.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.160
I mean, snapshot or something, right?

07:42.160 --> 07:43.160
Yeah.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.160
Yeah.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.160
Yeah.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.160
No way.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.280
That's not, that's not, it's just, I know I told myself I was going to do that, but

07:48.280 --> 07:51.440
then I decided instead of, you know, instead of worrying about something like that, I'll

07:51.440 --> 07:53.160
just reinstall if something happens.

07:53.160 --> 07:57.880
And it turned out to be, that doesn't really work, because you've got worked configs.

07:57.880 --> 07:58.880
It's not going to happen.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.040
And I was like, this shouldn't happen.

08:00.040 --> 08:07.600
And you know, for example, I have ran Nautilus, or files, under KDE, Plasma Desktop, you know,

08:07.600 --> 08:08.600
numerous times.

08:08.600 --> 08:12.400
And like, all of the Nautilus icons will show up on the desktop, and you know, you get the

08:12.400 --> 08:15.480
Nautilus browser, and it's full on, it'll even change the background.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.640
It's full on Nautilus is now controlling the desktop under KDE.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.480
That doesn't bork my whole, my whole GNOME config.

08:21.480 --> 08:22.800
I don't lose all my GNOME settings.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.880
I don't, all my GNOME extensions aren't wiped out when that happens.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.640
I mean, you know, that to me, maybe I shouldn't have done that.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.040
I admit that maybe I shouldn't have done that.

08:32.040 --> 08:36.760
But to me, even if I, worst case scenario, the expected result was not to lose all of

08:36.760 --> 08:37.760
my config.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.680
I don't know if maybe something got, it could have been anything.

08:39.680 --> 08:41.760
I didn't even, I have not even looked at the folder.

08:41.760 --> 08:42.760
It could have been permissions.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
It could have been anything.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.800
I just thought, on principle, that's ridiculous.

08:46.800 --> 08:51.760
Plus, you know, he even stated, actually that was our next commenter, which I wanted to

08:51.760 --> 08:52.760
touch on.

08:52.760 --> 08:58.160
Also, this struck me about GNOME, is, and this was Donnie Kesson, Donnie Eisen, Donnie

08:58.160 --> 08:59.160
Eisen.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.000
He said, he says, by the way, he feels that I'm going to be back to KDE.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.800
But he sings, one thing that KDE has always bugged me is a lack of design philosophy.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.520
And this echoes my sentiments exactly.

09:11.520 --> 09:21.560
And I think what this comes from is I didn't come to Linux from Windows or DOS, right?

09:21.560 --> 09:25.640
I came from the Mac and then later on OS2.

09:25.640 --> 09:32.120
I came from a always graphical, I mean, like I went way back, I started like on, you know,

09:32.120 --> 09:36.320
before then, but I mean, when I was actually like using a computer, when I had like a hand

09:36.320 --> 09:38.640
me down computer, they were all Macs.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.640
It was all Macs.

09:39.640 --> 09:43.280
And about the time, you know, Jobs got out of Apple was about the time I stopped giving

09:43.280 --> 09:44.280
a crap about Macs.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.280
Exactly.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.320
I wanted to play video games and load Linux, right?

09:47.320 --> 09:48.320
Yeah.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.040
There's all these new things and BIOS and all these things that I started getting into.

09:51.040 --> 09:54.160
But even then, even then I did not run Windows, right?

09:54.160 --> 09:55.160
I ran BIOS.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.440
I ran OS2.

09:56.440 --> 10:01.240
I ran whatever the only time I ever used Windows was when I was using somebody else's computer.

10:01.240 --> 10:03.320
And that is true to this day.

10:03.320 --> 10:08.840
And the systems that have stuck with me the longest are systems that had a great design

10:08.840 --> 10:10.640
philosophy behind them.

10:10.640 --> 10:16.920
And that is not to detract from what the KDE camp is doing, but they are just not crazy

10:16.920 --> 10:21.760
enough to spend almost an entire release cycle focusing on the system menu.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.120
They just can't bring themselves to do it because they're too pragmatic.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.520
They're not crazy enough.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.080
Whereas the GNOME project is crazy enough.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.560
And that's the kind of crazy I like.

10:28.560 --> 10:33.500
Well, for me, it always felt like that KDE was very much about the features.

10:33.500 --> 10:37.000
The design philosophy was kind of a secondary nature thing to them.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.720
I always felt like it was much more about features and how can we squeeze them in there

10:41.720 --> 10:42.800
from top to bottom.

10:42.800 --> 10:43.800
That's the way it always felt.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.920
And for me, it's kind of like you think it's like give you everything and then if you want

10:46.920 --> 10:48.600
to make something from that, do it.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.280
But then it's like you never get there.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.840
Well, and it always feels like it's been crammed on top of something.

10:52.840 --> 10:58.160
I mean, like, again, it's pretty, but it's it's kind of like Homer Simpson designing

10:58.160 --> 10:59.160
a car.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.960
I mean, it just it feels very put together.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.560
It sounded like a really great idea on paper, but then you actually watch it happen.

11:03.560 --> 11:07.840
It's like it still looks nice, but man, I got menus coming out of the menus here.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.040
It's just it's really chaotic.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.120
I got really, really close on my last and I don't know.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.160
I thought maybe you winced at the UI a little bit, but I had a new theme.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.320
I thought you could see it in the last episode of the Linux action show.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.120
I felt like, oh, I know the episode before that.

11:21.120 --> 11:26.680
Yeah, I felt like I had, you know, if you get the right KTE apps and you have the right

11:26.680 --> 11:31.340
theme that that that menu spew starts to kind of go away.

11:31.340 --> 11:33.880
It's not totally gone yet, but it's a lot better.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.800
What's so funny is it's so starkly different under Gnome.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.060
It's just so dramatically different under Gnome that it's a bit of a jar.

11:40.060 --> 11:45.760
But I'm almost thinking having fewer options and having the default options be right and

11:45.760 --> 11:48.940
then having ways to go in under the hood when I need to is better.

11:48.940 --> 11:49.940
That is my philosophy.

11:49.940 --> 11:54.360
It's gotten it's basically turned into such a bad situation to where I can't get beyond

11:54.360 --> 11:55.360
XSE.

11:55.360 --> 12:00.080
I every time I try, I mean, I run Unity on an Ubuntu desktop just because that's what's

12:00.080 --> 12:01.080
available.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.800
But my main desktop is XSE.

12:02.800 --> 12:03.800
Probably always will be.

12:03.800 --> 12:07.800
I keep coming back to it because I don't, you know, you can sex it up six ways from

12:07.800 --> 12:09.720
Sunday with a decent theme and it looks great.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.480
I'm running it under Manjaro.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.480
It looks good.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.480
I'm very happy with it.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.720
I don't need more than that.

12:14.720 --> 12:15.720
Everything's where I want it to be.

12:15.720 --> 12:16.880
I run everything from a launcher.

12:16.880 --> 12:22.360
Here's the thing though is I would argue that in order to really happily use XSE, you rely

12:22.360 --> 12:26.280
on a ton of technology that the Gnome project and other projects are.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.280
Oh, absolutely.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.960
So those desktops wouldn't really be fully, would not even be probably half as functional

12:31.960 --> 12:34.160
without those parent projects happening.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.760
I'm not saying like they're sharing maybe even like for example, like quite a bit.

12:37.760 --> 12:38.760
Yeah.

12:38.760 --> 12:42.000
No, there's no question that Gnome especially is a, I don't think has much to do with it,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.960
but I think Gnome especially has a lot to do with it and that's fine.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.640
I feel like if the Linux desktop, and I think a lot of people out there feel this way based

12:48.640 --> 12:53.120
on emails that we've gotten where people are sort of adrift.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.580
They're looking for the desktop that's right for them and there really isn't one on Linux

12:56.580 --> 12:57.580
right now.

12:57.580 --> 12:58.580
Gnome is getting in one direction.

12:58.580 --> 13:00.000
KD is going in their direction.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Unity is going in their direction.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.960
XSE is out in their own island and it's like none of them answer that perfect problem and

13:06.960 --> 13:12.880
the real problem, I think the real challenge isn't going to be how does Unity compare and

13:12.880 --> 13:16.160
all that stuff, but we really have to have a good answer to the Mac.

13:16.160 --> 13:21.720
Because until Apple loses it and starts to iOS up the Mac, that's a full fledged desktop

13:21.720 --> 13:22.720
operating system.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.860
I'm not arguing any technical merits, but from a user on shopping, they've got a great

13:26.860 --> 13:31.720
hardware offering and they got a great software offering to go together and that is a problem

13:31.720 --> 13:36.540
that I think Gnome is closer to answering with and especially with its future integration

13:36.540 --> 13:43.740
with lower level Linux services like SystemD and Wayland, I think Gnome has a better shot

13:43.740 --> 13:49.440
of answering that question because it still allows you to take advantage of what's great

13:49.440 --> 13:50.440
about Linux.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.600
What Valve is taking advantage of Linux is the fact that it's this general technology

13:53.600 --> 13:57.840
platform that doesn't have any stakeholders that can control it in one direction.

13:57.840 --> 14:02.440
I believe Gnome and KDE are going to be the two main desktops that are pulling ahead that

14:02.440 --> 14:03.640
allow you to retain that choice.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.780
I feel like Gnome is going to be the right answer for the Linux side if they continue

14:06.780 --> 14:10.800
to really embrace and integrate with this low level Linux technology.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.800
I think that's going to be huge.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.560
So for me, it's kind of like I look at the field and I say, well, the Mac doesn't meet

14:14.560 --> 14:17.280
my requirements for my day to day computing needs.

14:17.280 --> 14:22.280
Windows isn't a contender at all because Windows, I have all of the same complaints about Windows

14:22.280 --> 14:25.480
that I have with my KDE experience.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.720
And I would completely agree with that.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.800
At the end of the day, I mean, there's Cinnamon, there's Pantheon, there's all these types

14:30.800 --> 14:34.160
of the elementary Pantheon thing into the mixture.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.240
I don't think there's any – I think the problem is that there's not going to be

14:37.240 --> 14:39.440
any one solution for everybody.

14:39.440 --> 14:43.840
And it's where OS X people say, oh, well, I like OS X because I like the whole package

14:43.840 --> 14:46.760
and even to some degree people probably say the same thing about Windows.

14:46.760 --> 14:50.020
I think with Linux is that we have so much choice, so many things to pick and choose

14:50.020 --> 14:55.120
from that we do and really should be customizing a solution for ourselves.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.520
Give me 10 minutes and I can make anything look like OS X.

14:57.520 --> 15:01.520
I'm not going to have the level of integration that OS X has but I can theme anything.

15:01.520 --> 15:06.360
I can slap a dock on there, throw some icons up, redo a tool or I'm good to go.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.440
It's not rocket science.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.540
But I think that as far as the level of integration, I don't know if we're ever actually going

15:12.540 --> 15:17.600
to get there unless you start seeing a company become an all-in-one solution provider.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.680
Until that happens, I don't think that it will ever quite come to that.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.680
Okay.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.960
So that would be the canonical unity answer, right?

15:23.960 --> 15:24.960
Yeah.

15:24.960 --> 15:30.320
I think what Gnome 3.12 and beyond, and 3.10 looks great, but I think it's really starting

15:30.320 --> 15:36.920
in 3.12, they are saying here's your integrated, here's your fully integrated.

15:36.920 --> 15:37.920
Okay.

15:37.920 --> 15:41.080
So before system D, we had a warmed over version of the old Unix system.

15:41.080 --> 15:44.300
I mean it really was like you took the old Unix boot up systems and you just applied

15:44.300 --> 15:45.300
it to Linux.

15:45.300 --> 15:49.520
System D is this whole new system that allows us to take advantage of brand new features

15:49.520 --> 15:53.880
like cgroups in the Linux kernel that allow like Gnome, if Gnome is taking advantage of

15:53.880 --> 15:59.080
that stuff, to resource limit applications, to sandbox applications, to stick them off

15:59.080 --> 16:03.040
in their own areas, to do something which I don't even understand called better application

16:03.040 --> 16:04.040
matching.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.040
Yeah.

16:05.040 --> 16:10.960
And all of this is like it's going to be, I think, this close to OS X integrated level

16:10.960 --> 16:11.960
experience.

16:11.960 --> 16:19.560
However, you get to pick if it's Fedora, Arch Linux, Gentoo, SUSE Linux, Mangero, whatever.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.000
You get to pick whatever you want.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.060
It doesn't have to be where what Canonical's answer is you're going to get all that stuff.

16:26.060 --> 16:29.480
We might even manage to get you some of it sooner than those other guys, although right

16:29.480 --> 16:31.920
now it's kind of a dead heat.

16:31.920 --> 16:36.560
But we might even be able to deliver on some of this sooner, however it's a bit of an island.

16:36.560 --> 16:43.120
And I think that negates the benefits of Linux and those benefits are what are those types

16:43.120 --> 16:46.440
of general technology platform, nobody has a single interest.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.240
And the only problem is when you have a completely integrated solution like that, you have that

16:49.240 --> 16:50.240
single interest.

16:50.240 --> 16:53.560
Well, that's the exact kind of thing that Valve didn't want any part of.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.200
That's why they created Steam OS.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.920
They could have just released a set of packages that you grafted onto an Ubuntu install and

16:58.920 --> 17:01.560
said, here's a PPA, Bob's your uncle, you're done.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.560
Use Ubuntu 12.04.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.120
No, they said, here's Steam OS.

17:05.120 --> 17:08.880
Because we're taking this general technology platform and we're going to bring up our little

17:08.880 --> 17:10.240
pillar in that platform.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.020
Canonical's going to bring up their pillar, they're going to do their own thing.

17:13.020 --> 17:18.040
But Gnome, Gnome is going to work on any of the general technology platform distributions,

17:18.040 --> 17:19.040
any of them.

17:19.040 --> 17:23.480
You just use SystemD, you use Wayland and you have Gnome 3.12 and beyond and you've

17:23.480 --> 17:26.540
got essentially the same exact desktop experience.

17:26.540 --> 17:30.020
You set the clock the same way on every single system now.

17:30.020 --> 17:33.120
It's no longer these back end scripts that detect which version of Linux you have and

17:33.120 --> 17:37.000
which distro and then it sets the clock, no, you just issue this command.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.840
And it's, I think, going to be this grand new future.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.400
I think KD is going to be there too.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.000
I just think maybe Gnome's going to be there first.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.040
I don't know, maybe not.

17:46.040 --> 17:52.680
I don't, yeah, I hate to say it, but I think the really important underpinnings are working

17:52.680 --> 17:54.240
better under Gnome than they are with KD.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.760
So I think from a usability out of the, you know, once you get past the visuals and you

17:57.760 --> 18:01.320
just kind of actually use the desktop, I think Gnome's ahead of the game in that respect.

18:01.320 --> 18:02.320
No question about it.

18:02.320 --> 18:06.480
So Bear454 in the chat room says, you know, don't you kind of see Steam as that, they're

18:06.480 --> 18:11.040
that single interest that's, they're, I think.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.040
Now they're niche interest.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.040
Right.

18:13.040 --> 18:16.760
I think they take the general platform and they build their product on top of it, just

18:16.760 --> 18:18.600
like Android has been built on top of it.

18:18.600 --> 18:23.480
You can have these super deep and tall vertical integrations that are, you know, Android,

18:23.480 --> 18:28.040
for example, but it still moves the whole overall platform forward.

18:28.040 --> 18:33.760
And I, even canonical, even what they're doing, well, I mean, yeah, even canonical, they know

18:33.760 --> 18:36.100
what they're doing, you know, honestly, I don't know.

18:36.100 --> 18:38.520
It's not like when Apple took free BSD, right?

18:38.520 --> 18:40.160
I mean, it's not the same.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.260
There's still more benefit because of the GPL.

18:42.260 --> 18:44.520
There's still more people benefiting from it.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.520
I don't know.

18:45.520 --> 18:49.920
This is, this is a, this is a topic that it just, you know, the comments in the subreddit

18:49.920 --> 18:55.680
kind of got me going down and he continued, Donnie, as Aaron did, he said, Gnome is becoming

18:55.680 --> 18:57.540
beautiful and usable with every release.

18:57.540 --> 19:01.460
After giving 3.10 a try for some time, I'm back on KD for a number of reasons.

19:01.460 --> 19:03.280
Gnome should be usable without extensions.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.280
Yeah.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.280
Totally agree.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.280
I counted.

19:06.280 --> 19:07.520
I'm using 20 extensions right now.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.760
It is crazy because people in the chat room and in the mumble said that I'm using one

19:10.760 --> 19:11.760
or two.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.760
I'm using 20.

19:12.760 --> 19:16.560
Uh, that's, I, okay, users shouldn't have to worry about installing extensions to get

19:16.560 --> 19:17.560
basic functionality.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.680
No one uses or supports Gnome message tray.

19:20.680 --> 19:24.920
It's not been a success in two to three years and nobody is ever going to accept it.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.740
When Chrome launched an app launcher in Linux, you are left in this terrible fight between

19:28.740 --> 19:33.240
Gnome and other developers where they only get to, where users only get to suffer.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.120
Dropbox is not going to change for Gnome.

19:36.120 --> 19:38.320
Skype is not going to change for Gnome.

19:38.320 --> 19:42.680
Hell, Gnome apps like Banshee or Rhythmbox have not switched to Gnome message tray.

19:42.680 --> 19:46.520
I do not want to put all my eggs in the Gnome basket because they will probably remove an

19:46.520 --> 19:50.240
important feature that you're used to without notice or reason.

19:50.240 --> 19:53.640
I find it really hard to use Gnome on big screens because Gnome wants you to use full

19:53.640 --> 19:54.640
screen apps.

19:54.640 --> 19:58.700
It tells you something like, it tells you something when Red Hat was not confident to

19:58.700 --> 20:03.880
ship Gnome 3's interface to enterprise customers after funding it for so many years.

20:03.880 --> 20:08.400
So this part, the part that he touched on here where he's like Skype isn't going to

20:08.400 --> 20:12.380
change, Dropbox isn't going to change for Gnome, these guys aren't going to redo the

20:12.380 --> 20:15.200
way their applications are written.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.320
Not in these current releases, maybe in the future they will.

20:17.320 --> 20:22.600
Whereas like KDE, the notifications are way better, the message tray thing is a lot better

20:22.600 --> 20:23.600
in KDE.

20:23.600 --> 20:27.680
I just honestly, I don't see, okay, I mean Skype has gotten a lot better about adapting

20:27.680 --> 20:31.220
and changing ever since, oddly enough, since Microsoft bought them out.

20:31.220 --> 20:35.920
But I think Dropbox and Skype, I think their approach to it is like, look, we slapped you

20:35.920 --> 20:41.000
up a Linux release, this is how we're going to do it, like it or don't use it, tough,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.080
we don't care.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.760
Your numbers aren't impressive enough for us to care in their eyes, I'm not saying they

20:44.760 --> 20:45.920
are or they're not.

20:45.920 --> 20:50.400
So I think from that perspective, yeah, I think that Gnome is definitely kind of biting

20:50.400 --> 20:51.400
the boot on that one.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.160
But I think at the end of the day, Gnome's got the extension problem, KDE's got the

20:54.160 --> 20:57.280
audio problem, I'm using another desktop and I just don't care.

20:57.280 --> 21:00.000
I get the benefits of Gnome without the crap.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.560
That's true, that's the nice thing about XFC.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.560
I'll give you a ding on that.

21:03.560 --> 21:08.000
So I will just wrap it up and say, you know, elementary OS has the same problem.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.080
Elementary OS has a very specific design philosophy, the way they want things and that's one of

21:12.080 --> 21:14.680
the reasons they have to go create a bunch of the apps on their own because they can't

21:14.680 --> 21:17.000
get people to adapt to their philosophy.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.160
I think as new releases of Skype come out, maybe they'll support Gnome, you know, Pigeon

21:20.160 --> 21:24.400
supports the Gnome notification area and dude, it is so cool.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.200
When I get an instant message, a little, just a little thing hovers up at the bottom of

21:27.200 --> 21:30.800
my screen and if I click it, it then automatically extends up where I can read the whole message

21:30.800 --> 21:33.960
and I can reply to the message right there in the notification, just hit enter and it

21:33.960 --> 21:34.960
sends it off.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.280
I don't have to alt-tab to a different window or anything like that, it's actually, when

21:38.280 --> 21:40.640
it works, it's a really great system.

21:40.640 --> 21:46.800
But you know, yeah, these guys have to, one more thing, I don't think it likely that the

21:46.800 --> 21:51.560
Gnome team is going to remove any major feature all of a sudden and I think you have to look

21:51.560 --> 21:53.680
at things like, they're not calling it fallback.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.640
They're kind of twitchy, I don't know man, they're pretty twitchy.

21:55.640 --> 22:01.360
I think it's more like they nuked and paved and now they're rebuilding one thing at a

22:01.360 --> 22:02.360
time.

22:02.360 --> 22:03.360
Yeah.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.360
Okay, I'll give you that.

22:04.360 --> 22:08.280
And do we have, I don't know of anything major that's launched in the Gnome 3 series that

22:08.280 --> 22:09.880
has been removed.

22:09.880 --> 22:13.120
Things have been changed, like they have a big change coming for the middle click and

22:13.120 --> 22:14.120
all that kind of stuff.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.120
Sure.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.120
I don't know.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.120
Which is, yeah, stuff like that's kind of big.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.000
It'll be interesting to see how it all pans out and I think in the end it will all pan

22:20.000 --> 22:25.040
out to do what it needs to do, but you know, it is a little scary living in the Linux space

22:25.040 --> 22:29.440
because something like Skype or something like Dropbox that we use and rely on, at any point

22:29.440 --> 22:31.280
they may be like, you know what, we're done.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.280
You know what, Matt?

22:32.280 --> 22:33.280
You just nailed it.

22:33.280 --> 22:37.600
Let's flush this topic down because that brings us to the next spot, I think, in this week's

22:37.600 --> 22:38.600
show.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.680
This is where we'll probably bring the mumble guys in.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.720
Wait for the finish.

22:41.720 --> 22:42.720
There's the finish.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.920
Three flush production.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.920
I think you've nailed it.

22:46.920 --> 22:51.840
I mean, we are so often victims of these cloud providers.

22:51.840 --> 22:58.560
So this week, Google announced what looks to be a really fantastic HTML5 creation tool,

22:58.560 --> 23:03.160
like a point and click frame based creation, something like early days of the macro media

23:03.160 --> 23:04.160
creators.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.160
Really looks super impressive.

23:05.160 --> 23:08.320
I couldn't tell you, Matt, they only made it available for Mac and Windows.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.060
Not available for Linux, right?

23:10.060 --> 23:11.920
You mentioned Dropbox.

23:11.920 --> 23:16.200
This is a service that has, if you've used Dropbox for a long time, there was a period

23:16.200 --> 23:20.440
of time where the Dropbox client introduced a bug where it would then duplicate everything

23:20.440 --> 23:23.680
in Dropbox, and then also there's a period of time where it wiped everything in your

23:23.680 --> 23:24.680
Dropbox.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.760
I've lived through both of those.

23:26.760 --> 23:31.200
So the cloud services propose a big problem, and I want to zoom out before we talk about

23:31.200 --> 23:35.200
that because I think there's a bigger problem here, and I want to get some of your insights

23:35.200 --> 23:39.880
on this because you've had a roommate for the summer.

23:39.880 --> 23:45.880
I think cloud computing offers us a future where we have to analyze a few fundamentals.

23:45.880 --> 23:49.560
It's not just about crazy NSA conspiracy theories and things like that.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.360
There's a few questions I want to ask.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.360
So let's talk about that.

23:52.360 --> 23:57.080
But before we do, I want to thank this week's sponsor, and that is Ting.com.

23:57.080 --> 24:02.680
Ting is mobile that makes sense, my friends, and let me tell you, Ting's average monthly

24:02.680 --> 24:03.960
rate, $21.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.080
Now here's how that's even freaking possible.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.080
One of the great things about Ting is it's pay for what you use.

24:08.080 --> 24:12.580
At the end of the month, Ting is going to take all of your minutes, your megabytes,

24:12.580 --> 24:13.580
and what else you got?

24:13.580 --> 24:17.840
You got your, nope, just Ting megabytes, you got your text messages, no hidden services,

24:17.840 --> 24:20.080
so they're not going to add those up because that's not in there.

24:20.080 --> 24:23.000
Let's see, creepy sales guys, no, they're not going to add that up there because that's

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
not in there.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.680
So I think it's just messages, megabytes, and used minutes.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.600
And they just put all that at the end of the month, and they calculate what bucket you

24:29.600 --> 24:30.600
fall into.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.920
So the average price is $21.

24:32.920 --> 24:33.920
That's pretty good.

24:33.920 --> 24:38.880
Now, the most exciting thing about Ting is no contracts and no early termination fees,

24:38.880 --> 24:41.040
and when you buy a device, you own that device.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.000
It's not a subsidized device.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.240
I know all of our friends across the pond, they always give us a hard time about this,

24:47.240 --> 24:48.240
like you silly Americans.

24:48.240 --> 24:51.200
You buy all your phones on contract and pay more upfront, don't you realize what you're

24:51.200 --> 24:52.200
doing?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.200
Right.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.200
Yes.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.200
We understand.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.200
We do, and we're still unlearning that habit.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.200
Well, and Ting is helping with this.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.200
That's right.

24:58.200 --> 25:02.040
So if you go over to linux.ting.com, you're going to save $25 off a device from Ting,

25:02.040 --> 25:04.020
and they've got a lot of great new devices.

25:04.020 --> 25:05.020
Note 3 is coming, Matt.

25:05.020 --> 25:07.360
Now, don't get jealous because the Note 2 is still good.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.360
That's the phone Matt rocks.

25:08.360 --> 25:09.360
Loving it.

25:09.360 --> 25:12.880
The one I might recommend people take a look at though is the Moto X, take a gander at

25:12.880 --> 25:14.520
that, or the HTC One.

25:14.520 --> 25:19.880
The HTC One spec-wise is still pretty competitive, and those front-facing speakers are no joke,

25:19.880 --> 25:23.040
especially if you're a podcast listener, which I suspect you might be.

25:23.040 --> 25:28.200
They are as good as like a Bluetooth soundbar or an external soundbar that you might get,

25:28.200 --> 25:30.980
or nearly as good, and it's all built into the phone, so you don't have an extra piece

25:30.980 --> 25:32.140
of gear you have to carry around.

25:32.140 --> 25:35.640
So I really like that, and I've been using it to listen to audiobooks.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.720
I've been using it to play podcasts.

25:37.720 --> 25:38.800
I'll even listen to music.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.080
It's surprisingly good even for music, and games too.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.200
It's great for games.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.880
So the HTC One, I really like that, plus it's got a fantastic design.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.640
It's built really tight.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.480
It really feels good in the hand, and one of the things that Ting is doing right now

25:49.480 --> 25:50.480
to make...

25:50.480 --> 25:52.200
Actually, I think this is sticking around forever.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.920
I think crazy Ting is going crazier, Matt.

25:55.920 --> 25:59.080
They're making early terminations a little less of a sting.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.800
So Ting now has an ETF relief program.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.580
They'll save 25% off your ETF.

26:03.580 --> 26:08.560
That's up to $75 per device, so here's what you do.

26:08.560 --> 26:11.120
When you're ready to switch to Ting, and remember, the sooner you switch, the sooner you start

26:11.120 --> 26:14.720
to save, you browse your device options, pick your device, and activate it.

26:14.720 --> 26:18.680
You can activate it through their website, super easy to do, or if you'd like to call

26:18.680 --> 26:22.920
one of their customer reps, you can call them at 1-855-TING-FTW.

26:22.920 --> 26:26.200
And a real person, the phone might ring one or two times, I can't tell you that, but what

26:26.200 --> 26:30.160
I can tell you is a person will answer that phone, boom, and then you can actually ask

26:30.160 --> 26:31.160
them a question.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.160
Boom!

26:32.160 --> 26:35.680
1-855-TING-FTW, 8 a.m. through 8 p.m. eastern time.

26:35.680 --> 26:39.280
So once you've gotten that phone activated, although you just go to the Ting, linux.ting.com,

26:39.280 --> 26:42.800
man, everything you can, Matt, you activated your phone through the Ting website, right?

26:42.800 --> 26:43.800
Oh, it was super simple.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.280
You just, wham, bam, thank you, ma'am, you just get in there, get it done.

26:46.280 --> 26:49.920
Please, I've activated like three phones, I got it down to like three minutes, man.

26:49.920 --> 26:53.920
I get on that site, pop, pop, pop, and I've got that phone activated, I'm ready to go,

26:53.920 --> 26:56.040
plus I'm managing the awesome dashboard.

26:56.040 --> 27:01.720
Once I've completed that action, you just fill out a little form, fill out that form,

27:01.720 --> 27:06.320
you send it to Ting, it says, hey, by the way, Ting, I had an ETF for canceling my contract,

27:06.320 --> 27:07.440
could you help me out, Ting?

27:07.440 --> 27:09.120
Hey, Ting, by the way, could you help me out?

27:09.120 --> 27:10.120
Hey, Ting.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.120
And you know what Ting will say?

27:11.120 --> 27:12.120
Yes, we can.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.120
Yes, we can.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.920
Up to 25% of your ETF can be relieved by Ting.

27:15.920 --> 27:16.920
That's a great deal.

27:16.920 --> 27:17.920
And that's sticking around.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.560
And they've also got a bunch of great used devices if you want to pick up a device that

27:20.560 --> 27:24.080
maybe you got somebody in the family that you want to put on the plan because you get

27:24.080 --> 27:29.080
a pooled minute of, you can have unlimited devices, all shared pooled minutes, and the

27:29.080 --> 27:30.760
device is only $6 per line.

27:30.760 --> 27:34.200
So if you've got one or two phones that aren't gonna get used a lot, you don't have to worry,

27:34.200 --> 27:37.320
and if you have a phone that gets used pretty heavily, then you only have to pay for what

27:37.320 --> 27:38.320
you do end up using.

27:38.320 --> 27:42.680
And if you've got somebody maybe that's got more text messaging, like a teenager, or somebody

27:42.680 --> 27:46.920
that uses a lot more data like myself, that's much more easier to manage with the Ting plan.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.960
You also have these refurbished devices.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.880
They have this personal shopper where they can pick one up for you.

27:51.880 --> 27:55.040
Things like the LG Optimus Black, $68 over at Ting.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.280
The Sprint Airwaves, you can have a personal cell tower in your house.

27:58.280 --> 28:04.440
And of course, one of my favorite Android phones ever made, the Samsung Nexus S, $80.

28:04.440 --> 28:08.560
$80, no contract, and no early termination fee.

28:08.560 --> 28:15.080
Samsung S3, $385, no contract, and no early termination fee.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.080
Pay for what you use.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.080
Love it.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.080
I love that.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.640
Plus, included hotspot and tethering with every Ting device.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.640
How great is that?

28:21.640 --> 28:25.200
There's no extra data plan, no shared family plan you have to be on.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.680
They even accept a range of bring your own devices.

28:28.680 --> 28:34.080
You go over to linux.ting.com, click on the devices link, check this out.

28:34.080 --> 28:38.280
Not only can you bring your own device, you can sell your old device.

28:38.280 --> 28:43.320
Between the early termination relief program and selling your old device and the absolute

28:43.320 --> 28:48.520
amazing prices for Ting plans, never been a better time to start saving.

28:48.520 --> 28:53.240
So go over to linux.ting.com and thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.240
That's right.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.280
Gotta love the fact that they make switching easy.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.520
Anybody does that is great in my book, you know?

28:58.520 --> 28:59.520
That's awesome.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.520
Gotta love that, guys.

29:00.520 --> 29:03.440
I'm also a hermit and I don't like to talk to people, so the fact that the website works

29:03.440 --> 29:06.320
nice is a benefit.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.600
So let's talk about cloud computing.

29:08.600 --> 29:12.000
You know, guess who got me thinking about cloud computing this week?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.360
Who is that?

29:13.360 --> 29:14.960
I'll give you a hint now.

29:14.960 --> 29:17.960
See if you can place, he is famous.

29:17.960 --> 29:18.960
Okay.

29:18.960 --> 29:19.960
Okay.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.960
Do you have any guess yet?

29:21.960 --> 29:22.960
Famous, huh?

29:22.960 --> 29:23.960
He's famous.

29:23.960 --> 29:24.960
He's famous.

29:24.960 --> 29:25.960
Keep going.

29:25.960 --> 29:26.960
Okay.

29:26.960 --> 29:31.680
He uses a pretty low end computer on average.

29:31.680 --> 29:32.680
I guess it's a he too.

29:32.680 --> 29:33.680
I know.

29:33.680 --> 29:34.680
Yep.

29:34.680 --> 29:35.680
Yep.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.920
And we're talking famous amongst our people perhaps.

29:37.920 --> 29:38.920
Yes.

29:38.920 --> 29:43.920
Mr. Richard Stallman, when we asked him about cloud computing, his response was, get it

29:43.920 --> 29:44.920
out of here.

29:44.920 --> 29:51.280
And he said, by the way, it's negative in the freedom dimension.

29:51.280 --> 29:55.400
He listed what he uses as his daily driver.

29:55.400 --> 30:00.400
This is a quote from a recent interview, or just recently got kicked up in our subreddit

30:00.400 --> 30:01.400
at least.

30:01.400 --> 30:06.320
He said, I would ideally like to have a machine, oh, so he said, hey, Richard, what's your

30:06.320 --> 30:07.320
dream setup?

30:07.320 --> 30:09.840
Because he has a Yilong sub netbook, man.

30:09.840 --> 30:12.500
It's like, it's not even a netbook, right?

30:12.500 --> 30:16.480
He said, I'd ideally like to have a machine with the speed and memory of a laptop and

30:16.480 --> 30:22.080
the display size of a laptop too, combined with the same freedom I have now on the Yilong.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.800
Until I can have them both, freedom is my priority.

30:24.800 --> 30:28.520
I've campaigned for freedom since 1983, and I'm not going to surrender that freedom for

30:28.520 --> 30:30.960
the sake of more convenient computer.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.880
I do hope to switch to the new model of Yilong with a 10 inch screen soon.

30:34.880 --> 30:39.960
He said, and then he went on to talk about how he's not willing to sacrifice his freedom

30:39.960 --> 30:45.800
in order to use hardware that has proprietary blobs or requires proprietary blobs and things

30:45.800 --> 30:47.080
like that.

30:47.080 --> 30:50.440
And I thought, okay, I just could never live like that.

30:50.440 --> 30:56.520
But I look at what Richard Stallman's principled stance is with his computer hardware as perhaps

30:56.520 --> 31:02.000
some launching off point for our discussion around using cloud services, because if you

31:02.000 --> 31:08.640
are into Linux for any of the aspects of free and open source software, then you have got

31:08.640 --> 31:15.380
to be challenged by the fact that a lot of these Linux desktops are just connecting out

31:15.380 --> 31:20.840
to close sourced, proprietary, locked down cloud systems, a lot of times running on top

31:20.840 --> 31:24.420
of open source hardware and software, open source software.

31:24.420 --> 31:29.800
But the end result is a closed source proprietary app now.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.680
And so you have to look at it.

31:31.680 --> 31:37.280
So I ask you, Matt, is it hypocritical?

31:37.280 --> 31:40.720
Here's my thing with Stallman, and I'm just kind of summarize it with this.

31:40.720 --> 31:45.040
He's able to do this, and from what I was reading, his workaround is when he needs to

31:45.040 --> 31:50.040
go to Google, he borrows another person's notebook.

31:50.040 --> 31:54.760
So he doesn't always Wget his websites or however he does it.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.160
He doesn't always use Emacs.

31:56.160 --> 31:59.460
He has been known, and seriously, go and Google these guys.

31:59.460 --> 32:03.480
He actually has been known to borrow other people's notebooks because it's not logging

32:03.480 --> 32:04.480
him.

32:04.480 --> 32:09.440
He maintains his privacy, but he doesn't mind putting the other person out there.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.760
So it gets kind of fuzzy there for me.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.720
I will say that he rolls hard.

32:14.720 --> 32:15.720
He's hardcore.

32:15.720 --> 32:16.720
I think that's great.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.920
I mean, he definitely has dug his feet in and he feels serious about it.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.520
But he is willing to go that far.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.480
It definitely gets a little fuzzy for me.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.840
I have a hard time taking that seriously.

32:26.840 --> 32:29.680
So Mumblegroom, I want to ask you guys, what do you think?

32:29.680 --> 32:38.800
Should a true diehard guy, he's got a GPL flag flying high, is it hypocritical for a

32:38.800 --> 32:46.040
true freedom fighter to use cloud-based services like Google Docs, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter?

32:46.040 --> 32:50.240
I mean, we had Identica come around for a while that was sort of like, here's an open

32:50.240 --> 32:51.240
source version of this.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.240
No one cared.

32:52.240 --> 32:55.240
What do you guys think?

32:55.240 --> 32:56.240
No.

32:56.240 --> 32:59.520
No, he's totally fine using that type of stuff.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.520
Really?

33:00.520 --> 33:05.600
So you don't see a conflict in somebody who advocates for complete free and open source

33:05.600 --> 33:08.080
software on the desktop using cloud services?

33:08.080 --> 33:10.920
To me, it seems like software is software.

33:10.920 --> 33:16.200
And if you need to have free software on your desktop, then you need to have free software

33:16.200 --> 33:17.440
in your web services.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.080
It would think so.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.080
You would think so.

33:20.080 --> 33:25.960
But you know, I mean, just because it's not open source or free software doesn't mean

33:25.960 --> 33:28.600
that it's always technically bad software.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.920
I mean, we use Google every day mostly.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.040
I mean, most of us do.

33:34.040 --> 33:38.960
But yeah, I think he's okay using Google and stuff like that.

33:38.960 --> 33:39.960
His hypothetical user.

33:39.960 --> 33:46.040
All right, so here's where my struggle comes from with the cloud.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.040
It's multifaceted.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.200
I can outline it really quickly.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.600
The privacy issue, obviously, with the NSA revelations.

33:50.600 --> 33:54.360
You never know if you're getting swooped up in some sort of mass surveillance sweep.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.520
But you know, probably not likely.

33:56.520 --> 34:00.240
I look at things like Google Reader as the go-to, but also just simple things.

34:00.240 --> 34:03.880
Like Google Reader is an example of a service being taken away and shut down without any

34:03.880 --> 34:05.080
user say.

34:05.080 --> 34:10.440
But even something a little more micro, like the Gmail compose window, I vividly with a

34:10.440 --> 34:11.960
passion hate that.

34:11.960 --> 34:15.240
It actually completely breaks my particular workflow because you got to click on a stupid

34:15.240 --> 34:19.200
thing and then click on another thing to get the subject line back and the CC thing.

34:19.200 --> 34:23.140
And it automatically hides under this weird little button the previous thread, which I

34:23.140 --> 34:26.280
often refer to when I'm writing my response.

34:26.280 --> 34:32.020
I mean, in every single way that I on average in responding to emails, this new compose

34:32.020 --> 34:34.260
message completely breaks it for me.

34:34.260 --> 34:35.260
And I don't want it.

34:35.260 --> 34:39.880
I turned it off for as long as I could, but then eventually one day they pushed out the

34:39.880 --> 34:44.600
code to every single server and now I don't have that and I can never get it back.

34:44.600 --> 34:49.200
And as somebody who's elected to use Google apps, I sure as hell regret that now because

34:49.200 --> 34:52.960
I freaking hate that new compose window.

34:52.960 --> 34:57.060
So it's not just about like a Google Reader service being turned off and then I go to

34:57.060 --> 34:58.720
tiny, tiny RSS.

34:58.720 --> 35:04.760
It's also about changes in that service that to me are about driving an alternative motive

35:04.760 --> 35:06.800
than actually providing a good user experience.

35:06.800 --> 35:11.280
So there's that aspect to it, but then you also have the aspect of performance things

35:11.280 --> 35:13.180
that are on your own land perform better.

35:13.180 --> 35:17.680
So using things like, you know, a local video server instead of streaming from Amazon or

35:17.680 --> 35:21.040
Netflix likely means you could do a higher resolution file.

35:21.040 --> 35:24.760
It'll start a little bit faster and nobody's keeping metrics on what videos you'd love

35:24.760 --> 35:25.760
to watch.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.760
Right?

35:26.760 --> 35:27.760
This is very true.

35:27.760 --> 35:32.000
And then lastly, because it's here on my land, there's less of a security issue, right?

35:32.000 --> 35:37.520
I maybe don't have to use as massively complicated passwords because not everyone and their brother

35:37.520 --> 35:41.120
can just log into it because most of these things I don't even open up a port for.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.520
It's only on the land.

35:42.520 --> 35:45.680
And so there's, I think, a higher security potential there.

35:45.680 --> 35:50.600
And then lastly, the internet was built around connecting lands.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.240
That is the fundamental nature.

35:52.240 --> 35:56.980
It is not about consolidating and moving everything to the top.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.140
It is about distributed networking.

35:59.140 --> 36:04.300
It is about connecting large networks so they can share information between each other.

36:04.300 --> 36:07.560
It is not about everybody being a bunch of dumb thing clients that connect up to the

36:07.560 --> 36:11.720
Google master servers and which, by the way, I run in closed source offer, which yes, does

36:11.720 --> 36:12.720
bother me.

36:12.720 --> 36:19.420
So I look at the cloud as as bad from that standpoint, but I will also now pivot from

36:19.420 --> 36:23.720
that and say, here's a whole nother reason why the cloud is awful and is going to doom

36:23.720 --> 36:24.720
humanity.

36:24.720 --> 36:30.040
I think that personally, the internet was supposed to originally be peer based.

36:30.040 --> 36:33.760
And that's just because the way the protocols are made up.

36:33.760 --> 36:34.760
Right.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.760
Yeah.

36:35.760 --> 36:36.760
Yeah.

36:36.760 --> 36:37.760
I had a great time.

36:37.760 --> 36:41.400
See, my look at it is I use the cloud up to a certain extent.

36:41.400 --> 36:46.120
I just use like Gmail, stuff like that, YouTube, whatever.

36:46.120 --> 36:49.760
All my pictures, all my personal stuff, I just keep backed up on external.

36:49.760 --> 36:53.280
I never use Dropbox and all that stuff.

36:53.280 --> 37:00.160
That being said, I don't have the terabytes of data I'm having to deal with like you are.

37:00.160 --> 37:05.000
So I mean, like for me, like I can't get off the G plus sauce for the photos.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.920
I love the fact that I just take some photos on my Android phone and they upload and then

37:08.920 --> 37:11.040
it does some magic to make them look better.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.000
It animates the GIFs.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.840
It you know, selects the best faces like, man, that is just so handy when you want to

37:17.840 --> 37:20.800
keep out when you just want to automatically pull out the good images and just be call

37:20.800 --> 37:21.800
it a day.

37:21.800 --> 37:26.920
That is great plus the design of the platform kind of leaves me needing a photo management

37:26.920 --> 37:31.440
solution and so they kind of conveniently provided one that is kind of hard to put down.

37:31.440 --> 37:34.360
You know, I don't want to really be putting all that stuff up there, but damn, it's just

37:34.360 --> 37:35.360
so great.

37:35.360 --> 37:39.000
But here's the bigger thing, you guys, and man, I want to I want to ask you a question.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.160
You don't have to share anything more than you want to share.

37:42.160 --> 37:46.200
You've recently had exposure just to a high school aged person.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.200
Yeah.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.200
Right.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.480
And when I was in school, we had three classrooms packed full of computer nerds and then we

37:51.480 --> 37:55.520
had one classroom was really the elites and some of us got like root shell access and

37:55.520 --> 38:00.680
domain admin access to the early NT for domain like we were really like high level geeks,

38:00.680 --> 38:01.680
right?

38:01.680 --> 38:02.800
And this was in high school.

38:02.800 --> 38:07.680
And then flashback like 10 or 11 years later, I went back as a contract worker to that same

38:07.680 --> 38:12.120
school district and I found like they had totally like neutered all of the computer

38:12.120 --> 38:13.840
classes and really generalized them.

38:13.840 --> 38:18.560
They were, you know, office classes, really learning about Excel and right and we're learning

38:18.560 --> 38:20.820
to type and they'd really watered it down.

38:20.820 --> 38:26.320
And instead of like 30 super passionate nerds, there was three and only one of those three

38:26.320 --> 38:27.660
even had a shell account.

38:27.660 --> 38:31.240
And it was like that guy, yeah, he's he can help us out with a few things where I was

38:31.240 --> 38:36.240
like back in my day, we wired the whole we wired all we wired the district with cat with

38:36.240 --> 38:37.240
ethernet.

38:37.240 --> 38:41.260
I remember what if it was cat three or five, but we wired the we were like we were I.T.

38:41.260 --> 38:43.260
like the kids were so advanced.

38:43.260 --> 38:45.960
We were I.T. and that's how I got my first job.

38:45.960 --> 38:50.760
And now I look at the kids today and I think the damn kids on my lawn, I think they have

38:50.760 --> 38:53.960
no idea of the context behind the screen.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.400
All they know is how to operate what is on the screen.

38:56.400 --> 39:01.400
And while yes, I have made the argument that this is natural, like before computers, there

39:01.400 --> 39:05.200
was the radio and every kid knew how to build a radio and every there was radio kits that

39:05.200 --> 39:09.960
were advertised in magazines and comics and you would get a kit radio.

39:09.960 --> 39:10.960
Nobody knows how to do that anymore.

39:10.960 --> 39:11.960
All right.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.200
And there was like, oh, well, now we just buy radios.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.080
It's no big deal.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.080
Or cars.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.080
Cars are another great example.

39:17.080 --> 39:21.160
It's a huge part of our of our civilization and I have no idea how to do anything other

39:21.160 --> 39:24.280
than I could probably maybe Google my way through changing my oil.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.280
Right.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.280
Right.

39:26.280 --> 39:31.080
You know, as long as I've got Google under the car with me, I should be OK.

39:31.080 --> 39:35.800
That see the computers, computers are so much more invasive.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.360
Computers are in every aspect of our life.

39:37.360 --> 39:41.760
It's not like radios and cars not understanding how computers work is like not understanding

39:41.760 --> 39:44.540
that putting your finger in the electric socket can hurt you.

39:44.540 --> 39:45.880
Computers run hospitals.

39:45.880 --> 39:46.880
Computers run the government.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.680
Computers run us.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.760
Computers run everything.

39:50.760 --> 39:53.160
And everybody has a computer in their pocket now.

39:53.160 --> 39:58.000
And so to not know how that works is a way bigger deal than not knowing how a radio works.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.800
It's a way bigger deal.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.000
Well, there's a couple of things.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.360
First of all, we were generationally brought up in the world and especially those before

40:05.360 --> 40:09.580
us to where you learn to do things oftentimes out of necessity.

40:09.580 --> 40:10.580
You get the bug.

40:10.580 --> 40:14.280
You're excited about it and then you want to go learn how to do other stuff.

40:14.280 --> 40:18.280
Because today with smartphones, not only are they not verbally speaking to one another,

40:18.280 --> 40:20.560
they'll be texting one another from across the table.

40:20.560 --> 40:21.700
I mean, it's terrible.

40:21.700 --> 40:26.400
But in addition to that, it's – the phones pretty much do it all for them.

40:26.400 --> 40:31.040
So if it's – and like to give you an example with my nephew, his world revolves around

40:31.040 --> 40:32.160
YouTube and Facebook.

40:32.160 --> 40:34.400
He really doesn't stop to rationalize.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.200
There's an internet out there.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.200
It's Facebook and YouTube.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.000
Well, what am I going to – oh, and then I introduced him to Reddit and I'll never

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
see him again.

40:41.000 --> 40:48.120
But I showed him that but I mean, it's like they don't have the ability, not all kids

40:48.120 --> 40:49.120
but a lot of them.

40:49.120 --> 40:52.840
I'd even go as far as to say probably the majority of them don't have the ability

40:52.840 --> 40:57.560
to go out and want to learn beyond that because that's the environment they're brought

40:57.560 --> 40:58.560
up in.

40:58.560 --> 41:05.920
That's what we're working on here is we're working on basically undumbing down the kids.

41:05.920 --> 41:09.640
I mean, that's kind of the whole thing and it's a task and it's a task you've got

41:09.640 --> 41:10.640
to tackle early.

41:10.640 --> 41:14.800
You nailed it when you said the smartphones, like the problems are solved.

41:14.800 --> 41:18.640
I had to learn how to build an instant messenger server because I wanted an instant messenger.

41:18.640 --> 41:22.040
I had – back in high school, I learned how to create a dial-up server so that way I could

41:22.040 --> 41:24.480
get internet connectivity out in my home in the boondocks.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.200
I had to solve these problems.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.600
Starts with necessity and then after a while, it's kind of like, God, this is kind of cool

41:28.600 --> 41:31.000
and it becomes an interest.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.700
So here's where the problem is with cloud computing because cloud computing does this

41:34.700 --> 41:35.760
to all of us.

41:35.760 --> 41:40.240
Even those of us who are extremely technical, who could understand what they're saying,

41:40.240 --> 41:43.000
we also have this dumbification given to us.

41:43.000 --> 41:49.320
We are without any option by using Dropbox, I really have no freaking idea any of the

41:49.320 --> 41:50.320
technical back ends.

41:50.320 --> 41:54.760
I kind of get bits and pieces over the years and kind of construct a theory in my mind

41:54.760 --> 41:58.360
of what it likely is based on how I understand technology works.

41:58.360 --> 42:03.840
But most people don't even have that advantage and we're doing it to everyone and we're doing

42:03.840 --> 42:04.840
it at both ends.

42:04.840 --> 42:08.320
We're doing it at the client side and we're doing it at the server side and we're just

42:08.320 --> 42:12.940
chewing in right to the middle and we're going to leave ourselves like in some sort of dystopian

42:12.940 --> 42:16.600
Star Trek world where they come to the planet and the computers run everything.

42:16.600 --> 42:21.000
Well, it's going to literally be like Voyager with the, what the hell do they call Kess

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
where she's part of the Oompa Loompas or some damn thing?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
The O'Kompa.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
Yeah, the O'Kompa.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.760
I call them the Oompa Loompas, whatever.

42:27.760 --> 42:31.640
Basically they have a caretaker, Google, or Facebook or whatever it may be and they're

42:31.640 --> 42:34.320
basically taken care of.

42:34.320 --> 42:39.240
And I think a lot of the causality for that comes from a combination of parents and schools.

42:39.240 --> 42:43.040
Well, the parents figure, well, I'm busy doing my thing so the schools will take care of

42:43.040 --> 42:44.040
this for me.

42:44.040 --> 42:48.760
And the schools are like, honestly, we can barely keep our lights on so no, we're going

42:48.760 --> 42:52.720
to make this as easy on ourselves as we can and do the very bare minimum we can because

42:52.720 --> 42:55.120
that's how schools seem to operate nowadays.

42:55.120 --> 42:57.780
And it's kind of a lose lose for the kid.

42:57.780 --> 42:58.780
So yeah.

42:58.780 --> 43:01.520
Mailholler in our chat room points out that people don't even know, this happens in all

43:01.520 --> 43:02.520
aspects of life.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.960
They don't even know where their milk comes from most of the time.

43:04.960 --> 43:05.960
That's true.

43:05.960 --> 43:06.960
That's very true.

43:06.960 --> 43:10.000
And I, now there is still a world out there.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Or what's in your milk.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.080
I mean, that's a serious, serious thing.

43:13.080 --> 43:14.400
We switched to organic.

43:14.400 --> 43:17.000
Both my wife and I, our cholesterol did a nosedive.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Yeah.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Seriously.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Yeah.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
And why is that?

43:21.000 --> 43:24.120
Because of the cows, you know, because where your food comes from, if they're, you know,

43:24.120 --> 43:26.920
they're in taking products and things like that that have things you don't want in your

43:26.920 --> 43:28.160
body, you're also in taking it.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.160
There's a lot of considerations of knowledge.

43:29.160 --> 43:32.720
I guess though, but there's still a market, there's still a world out there where you

43:32.720 --> 43:37.160
can decide, I want to know what's in my milk and then go buy something else.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.160
So maybe.

43:38.160 --> 43:39.160
But it's a premium.

43:39.160 --> 43:43.340
It's a premium market because there's not, because it's, it takes more work or more consideration

43:43.340 --> 43:46.400
and the market's not high enough out there and it's more of a niche market so they can

43:46.400 --> 43:50.440
charge more as we know from the gluten stuff or the anti-gluten stuff rather.

43:50.440 --> 43:55.880
You know Matt, just to point out, you're completely right when you're saying it's the majority

43:55.880 --> 44:00.000
of all teenagers that don't understand what's going on in the background.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Yeah.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
It's sad.

44:02.000 --> 44:09.440
I'm 19 myself and the only reason why I know so much as I do right now is because I kind

44:09.440 --> 44:12.960
of was defiant and I was like, no, I want to know how this works.

44:12.960 --> 44:13.960
Right.

44:13.960 --> 44:14.960
Exactly.

44:14.960 --> 44:15.960
Yep.

44:15.960 --> 44:18.200
And I poked and I just kind of just got into it.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.680
I think that takes an exceptional personality type.

44:20.680 --> 44:21.680
It does.

44:21.680 --> 44:25.080
It takes, it takes, it's almost, I would say it's the new A type personality.

44:25.080 --> 44:28.280
There's the old A type to where you're just loud and proud and whatever, but I think the

44:28.280 --> 44:32.480
new A type personality is someone that wants to take responsibility for their environment,

44:32.480 --> 44:36.440
for their skill set, for their goals, for their future, for the whole thing and I think

44:36.440 --> 44:38.040
that that's exactly what you did there.

44:38.040 --> 44:42.120
You're 19 years old and you decided, wow, you know, I'm watching the sheeple around

44:42.120 --> 44:44.720
me do their thing and it's like, well, I want to do more.

44:44.720 --> 44:46.080
I want to do something different.

44:46.080 --> 44:50.320
I kind of laugh when I see other people and they say, oh, Google crashed.

44:50.320 --> 44:51.800
See, for me.

44:51.800 --> 44:52.800
That's awesome.

44:52.800 --> 44:53.800
Yeah.

44:53.800 --> 44:59.880
It's got to do back to up thing, um, my phone actually is the one that got me into running

44:59.880 --> 45:00.880
through the first place.

45:00.880 --> 45:01.880
Oh, really?

45:01.880 --> 45:02.880
That's cool.

45:02.880 --> 45:03.880
But that's cool.

45:03.880 --> 45:04.880
Yeah.

45:04.880 --> 45:07.320
Because, um, back in the day I used to have the original, uh, my touch, like it was like

45:07.320 --> 45:11.960
the second or third Android phone that came out and it was so horrible because T-Mobile

45:11.960 --> 45:17.760
refused to update it to 1.6, I'm like, God, it's got to be a better way to do this.

45:17.760 --> 45:23.120
And so I rooted it and I got it updated to 2.2, I believe, and it was just so much better

45:23.120 --> 45:24.120
than I learned.

45:24.120 --> 45:26.120
Like, wait, I can do this on my computer too.

45:26.120 --> 45:27.720
Well, that's encouraging.

45:27.720 --> 45:30.640
That makes me almost think that maybe there's a positive side to every negative.

45:30.640 --> 45:33.480
In fact, the Android phone to get updated brought you into Linux.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.480
I mean, that's, well, and it's kind of interesting.

45:35.480 --> 45:36.480
Yeah.

45:36.480 --> 45:40.760
I learned all this stuff from like XPA, like originally like those forums over here, like

45:40.760 --> 45:43.280
those guys are amazing.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.280
So.

45:44.280 --> 45:45.280
That's cool.

45:45.280 --> 45:46.280
That's cool.

45:46.280 --> 45:47.280
Yeah.

45:47.280 --> 45:49.800
It seems like it's, it's either going to be, uh, you know, intervention from a, uh, someone

45:49.800 --> 45:53.920
that's an interested party or it's a, it's a pain point such as an Android phone that

45:53.920 --> 45:55.440
it's just not going to cut the bacon.

45:55.440 --> 45:59.480
Um, you know, it's kind of interesting to see how everybody kind of comes into their,

45:59.480 --> 46:03.480
uh, into their own world, you know, I kind of look at it as like, I'm going to use these

46:03.480 --> 46:08.800
cloud services until a really good, practical implementable, if that's a word, solution

46:08.800 --> 46:09.800
comes along for me.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.880
Like I need something to manage my photos in my network.

46:12.880 --> 46:13.880
I really do.

46:13.880 --> 46:16.040
Like my wife takes a jillion photos a day.

46:16.040 --> 46:17.040
She's got like 500.

46:17.040 --> 46:20.880
I mean, it's not that much, but it's going to be by, by mid next year, it'll be a 500

46:20.880 --> 46:21.880
gig photo database.

46:21.880 --> 46:27.080
You know, I've got a decent size and it's like, we need something that's free software

46:27.080 --> 46:30.800
that is not, um, you know, like max specific.

46:30.800 --> 46:35.480
So the problem is she's, she just loves iPhoto and, and honestly, every time I've tried to

46:35.480 --> 46:39.200
get her to switch it to something, she's got a dozen valid points that I can't like, I

46:39.200 --> 46:45.440
mean, you know, it's like, I know by the way, I kind of want to do a photo management segment

46:45.440 --> 46:46.440
on that.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.760
And then last, I think that'd be a good one cause I've, I've been, that's something I've

46:48.760 --> 46:49.760
actually been working on.

46:49.760 --> 46:50.760
Yeah.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.120
Maybe we'll do that in the future.

46:52.120 --> 46:56.240
My wife went to school for photography and of course lives in Photoshop and iPhoto.

46:56.240 --> 46:57.240
So that would be interesting.

46:57.240 --> 46:58.400
And she took some photography too.

46:58.400 --> 47:02.400
And so she's, she's, she knows like, uh, she's going through a problem she has right now

47:02.400 --> 47:06.880
where she's trying to pick the right camera because her camera is going out on her and

47:06.880 --> 47:09.020
she happens to love this style of camera.

47:09.020 --> 47:13.060
And so she's kind of at this spot where she's like, do I buy an older model with lower specs

47:13.060 --> 47:17.760
that I know performs the way I like, or do I buy the latest thing and just learn to live

47:17.760 --> 47:18.760
with it?

47:18.760 --> 47:19.760
Kind of like I'm doing with Nome, right?

47:19.760 --> 47:20.760
Yeah.

47:20.760 --> 47:21.760
I mean, that's a tough one.

47:21.760 --> 47:22.760
You've taken the other route.

47:22.760 --> 47:23.760
You've gone XFCE and you're like, you know what?

47:23.760 --> 47:24.760
I'm just hanging and I'm good.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.360
And to me, I'm like, no, I'm going to go Nome, right?

47:26.360 --> 47:30.680
So I've got the newer camera, you know, but I treat my computers the way my wife treats

47:30.680 --> 47:31.680
her cameras.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.460
Don't worry so much about the camera itself.

47:33.460 --> 47:35.600
It's all about the glass and the technique.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.160
That's where it goes.

47:37.160 --> 47:41.300
So I know what happens in these point and clicks now is they have like a image processing

47:41.300 --> 47:45.800
that they do and like they're adding like a orange to skin colors and things like that.

47:45.800 --> 47:47.800
But see, Oompa Loompas.

47:47.800 --> 47:48.800
Exactly.

47:48.800 --> 47:53.240
I guess I just wanted to, I just wanted to maybe we'll just wrap up the whole cloud services

47:53.240 --> 47:57.240
with, you know, my thought is, is I try to use cloud services as minimal as possible,

47:57.240 --> 48:03.680
but you know, also use them responsibly and just, I look at it is if I have the technical

48:03.680 --> 48:07.240
know-how and means to build my own solution, then I, the only thing that's preventing me

48:07.240 --> 48:11.400
is time and laziness and I should exercise that ability and that right to do that.

48:11.400 --> 48:12.400
So I do it.

48:12.400 --> 48:16.680
I just plan, I think I'm going to continue this trend over 2014 of just moving everything

48:16.680 --> 48:17.680
back home.

48:17.680 --> 48:20.600
And as I, as I move something cool, we'll talk about it, you know, and when I solve

48:20.600 --> 48:23.200
this photo problem, we're going to talk about it.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.640
It might make your life a lot easier.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.640
Yeah.

48:25.640 --> 48:26.640
Yeah.

48:26.640 --> 48:27.640
It's really tough.

48:27.640 --> 48:28.640
It is, isn't it?

48:28.640 --> 48:31.400
What are you a real, are you going to be a farmer to grow all of your own crops?

48:31.400 --> 48:34.280
Are you going to use a drill to drill your own oil?

48:34.280 --> 48:40.440
There's a lot of necessities that you just live to be thankful for.

48:40.440 --> 48:41.440
That's true.

48:41.440 --> 48:42.440
Yeah.

48:42.440 --> 48:43.440
That we just totally take for granted.

48:43.440 --> 48:48.120
And you use your own hydroelectric dam to harvest your own electricity.

48:48.120 --> 48:51.600
I admit I, it's very hard to make your own fuel.

48:51.600 --> 48:56.200
I have tried to move away from Dropbox now a hundred times and I have underestimated

48:56.200 --> 49:00.520
how integrated, I have worked it with my workflow and so every, like I still, now I'm just half

49:00.520 --> 49:01.520
and half.

49:01.520 --> 49:05.880
I'm more than half and half, but I'm, I have like almost everything in BitTorrent sync,

49:05.880 --> 49:11.560
but I still have like three or four applications and config files and stuff in Dropbox.

49:11.560 --> 49:13.080
And it's like, oh yeah, I got to figure that out.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.600
I got to figure out how to fix that, but I just haven't had time.

49:15.600 --> 49:16.600
Matt.

49:16.600 --> 49:17.600
All right.

49:17.600 --> 49:19.320
Before we move on, I think we should probably read some emails and I'd like to hear people's

49:19.320 --> 49:21.540
thoughts on the cloud stuff too.

49:21.540 --> 49:22.680
So go ahead and send us your feedback.

49:22.680 --> 49:27.120
You can tag Linux Unplugged in the contact form and it'll tag it just specifically for

49:27.120 --> 49:28.120
this show.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.840
I also have a link in the show notes.

49:29.840 --> 49:30.840
I just grabbed it.

49:30.840 --> 49:33.160
I was going to work it in because I was reading this this morning.

49:33.160 --> 49:37.760
So the two things I read this morning where RMS is work set up and then also this ex Microsoft

49:37.760 --> 49:42.540
privacy advisor, he said, I don't trust the company and he's, he switched only using open

49:42.540 --> 49:43.760
source software.

49:43.760 --> 49:46.080
And he says, I don't trust Microsoft now.

49:46.080 --> 49:49.840
He said adding that only, he only uses open source software where he can examine the underlying

49:49.840 --> 49:50.840
code.

49:50.840 --> 49:53.340
He said he's told this to the, to the guardian.

49:53.340 --> 49:56.220
So I'll link to that in the show notes if you guys want to read about that.

49:56.220 --> 49:58.680
And I also have a link to the Richard Stallman set up in there.

49:58.680 --> 50:01.920
He's also going to talk a little bit about what I was talking about where he uses other

50:01.920 --> 50:03.520
people's computers on occasion.

50:03.520 --> 50:04.520
Yeah.

50:04.520 --> 50:05.680
Bear, Bear found the quote too.

50:05.680 --> 50:09.840
And you know, I guess you could kind of say that's a loophole, but.

50:09.840 --> 50:13.860
And I have no problem with it, but don't, you know, but where I get, where I get rubbed

50:13.860 --> 50:17.600
the wrong way with it is when he gets the real, real, I'm just going to say it real

50:17.600 --> 50:21.420
high and mighty about it, but yet he's still doing it, but he's putting someone else's

50:21.420 --> 50:23.680
privacy at risk for his benefit.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.240
You know, I'm not cool with that.

50:25.240 --> 50:29.840
It would kind of be like, oh man, I don't want to get in trouble for saying this.

50:29.840 --> 50:33.580
I just, I'm just going to say it'd be kind of like, it'd be kind of like if I went on

50:33.580 --> 50:39.640
last and you know, we got, you and I got on our soap boxes about using anything but Linux.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.560
How dare you use anything but Linux.

50:41.560 --> 50:46.440
And then I go, I wrap up the day and I go edit that on a Mac, you know, and we all do

50:46.440 --> 50:47.440
it.

50:47.440 --> 50:51.880
And, but the difference is, is I don't recall you or I ever saying, Oh, you're using that,

50:51.880 --> 50:53.720
you know, use what works for you folks.

50:53.720 --> 50:55.440
And that's kind of my philosophy.

50:55.440 --> 50:58.600
Even if you do use proprietary software on Linux, Hey, if that's working for you, that's

50:58.600 --> 50:59.600
okay.

50:59.600 --> 51:00.720
But you know, be educated about it.

51:00.720 --> 51:03.960
I think that's the underlying thing that I would like to see Stallman talk more about

51:03.960 --> 51:06.680
is more about the education and a little less of the finger wagging.

51:06.680 --> 51:12.320
I guess maybe now is that's the best compromise, isn't it is as a technical user, we can try

51:12.320 --> 51:15.060
to make ourselves as knowledgeable about the service as possible.

51:15.060 --> 51:16.320
So educate yourself.

51:16.320 --> 51:20.320
And then when, when it seems reasonable, like if you need the performance to improve security

51:20.320 --> 51:24.360
and then improve privacy and you don't want the service to change on you, then when those

51:24.360 --> 51:28.800
conditions are met and you feel like there's a good handoff, move it local and otherwise

51:28.800 --> 51:29.800
just stay knowledgeable.

51:29.800 --> 51:30.800
Absolutely.

51:30.800 --> 51:31.800
Yeah.

51:31.800 --> 51:32.800
Be aware of what, what your stuff's doing.

51:32.800 --> 51:35.560
And if you don't know, you know, that's a decision each person needs to make at that

51:35.560 --> 51:36.560
point.

51:36.560 --> 51:39.160
But yeah, I just have a real problem when we start getting real finger waggy at folks

51:39.160 --> 51:41.940
and telling them what they should or shouldn't use, cause you know, it's different strokes

51:41.940 --> 51:42.940
for different folks.

51:42.940 --> 51:43.940
And I think we need to remember that.

51:43.940 --> 51:48.080
It's also, I think let's keep in mind too, people in the community, people out there

51:48.080 --> 51:52.360
in, you know, sometimes they can be a hard liner and then they go home and they're like,

51:52.360 --> 51:54.040
oh well, yeah, can I borrow your laptop?

51:54.040 --> 51:56.360
You know, you gotta keep in mind, sometimes everything.

51:56.360 --> 51:57.800
I've seen this in the Microsoft camp.

51:57.800 --> 52:02.560
I've seen Microsoft, I won't say who, but I've seen Microsoft employees and their kids

52:02.560 --> 52:06.640
get frustrated trying to do things like connect to wifi with Windows 7 back in the early days

52:06.640 --> 52:10.800
and, and, and shake their fist at their own company because, you know, and then go and

52:10.800 --> 52:11.920
use something that does work like that.

52:11.920 --> 52:14.920
Well, you've been to a Linux conference and seen like a ton of people show up with Mac

52:14.920 --> 52:15.920
books.

52:15.920 --> 52:16.920
Oh yes.

52:16.920 --> 52:17.920
Right?

52:17.920 --> 52:21.200
And there was a period of time where some of the core gnome developers were all using

52:21.200 --> 52:22.200
Macs at this conference.

52:22.200 --> 52:24.200
I was like, Oh, okay.

52:24.200 --> 52:25.600
So it happens.

52:25.600 --> 52:26.600
It happens.

52:26.600 --> 52:32.800
Um, I go back to, to write tool for the right job and I think you've nailed it, Matt.

52:32.800 --> 52:33.800
So, all right.

52:33.800 --> 52:34.800
Very good.

52:34.800 --> 52:35.800
All right.

52:35.800 --> 52:38.040
So before we move into the emails, we've got a couple of emails I want to get to, including

52:38.040 --> 52:42.480
a comment on the DRM aspect of steam and how we kind of glossed over that last week and

52:42.480 --> 52:45.140
a new Archer reporting in with some tough questions.

52:45.140 --> 52:48.800
But first I want to remind folks, we do have affiliate extensions and if you grab these

52:48.800 --> 52:54.040
for your browser for Firefox or Chrome and we have even opera in the works, I, you know,

52:54.040 --> 52:56.600
opera's opera's kind of man, they're coming back.

52:56.600 --> 52:57.600
Opera next is out.

52:57.600 --> 53:01.720
I got it right now on my arch box and uh, it, it's kind of, it's kind of great.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.200
It's, it's not bad really.

53:03.200 --> 53:04.720
Uh, of course it's not Firefox.

53:04.720 --> 53:06.760
I'm, I'm putting all my effort in these days.

53:06.760 --> 53:11.780
I had some browser issues, so I'm kind of doubling down on Firefox and I really wanted

53:11.780 --> 53:15.160
to do, I really wanted to kind of highlight these browser extensions we have for Chrome

53:15.160 --> 53:20.320
and Firefox because we had some recent modifications in the way that the Chrome browser reads the

53:20.320 --> 53:24.640
oral that requires a reauthorization and that cost a big drop off and the timing is bad

53:24.640 --> 53:27.240
because we're sort of ramping up for some big plans for 2014.

53:27.240 --> 53:28.680
So I'm making a special plug.

53:28.680 --> 53:32.540
If you'd like to support all of the shows on the Jupiter broadcasting network, go over

53:32.540 --> 53:36.240
to the Jupiter broadcasting site, scroll down to the bottom and then down there we have

53:36.240 --> 53:40.800
links for a bunch of sites and then at the end of that link list we have Chrome and Firefox

53:40.800 --> 53:41.800
extensions.

53:41.800 --> 53:45.440
You can grab those and then every site you shop at that we have support for, like Audible

53:45.440 --> 53:49.320
and Amazon and Woot and Newegg, including multiple country versions.

53:49.320 --> 53:52.460
Like a lot of times we only have the US country linked to the bottom, but we have other countries

53:52.460 --> 53:54.440
in the extension.

53:54.440 --> 53:57.020
Those will automatically be enabled when you shop at those certain sites.

53:57.020 --> 54:01.720
We just added Woot.com for example, and then a portion of your shopping session is contributed

54:01.720 --> 54:04.200
to the Jupiter broadcasting network, but it doesn't cost you anything more.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.880
So while you're getting yourself something nice, you give us a little something and then

54:07.880 --> 54:12.120
in the aggregate, it's very small, but in the aggregate it helps out quite a bit.

54:12.120 --> 54:13.280
So we really appreciate that.

54:13.280 --> 54:16.240
I want to remind you guys that now would be the time to activate that, especially as the

54:16.240 --> 54:17.980
holiday season is approaching.

54:17.980 --> 54:19.440
This is true and it's so easy to do.

54:19.440 --> 54:23.880
I mean it's literally either install and or activate or update and it's passive.

54:23.880 --> 54:25.040
You don't do anything extra.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.040
Yep.

54:26.040 --> 54:27.040
And we really appreciate it.

54:27.040 --> 54:28.040
And they're open source.

54:28.040 --> 54:29.040
Right.

54:29.040 --> 54:30.520
You know why they're open source?

54:30.520 --> 54:31.520
Why are they open source?

54:31.520 --> 54:34.200
Because I figured if we're going to be loading software on people's computers, they have

54:34.200 --> 54:35.840
the right to go see what it's doing.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.120
And that is a good argument to have.

54:37.120 --> 54:39.600
I think that's, and that's again, it's all about being educated.

54:39.600 --> 54:40.600
That's awesome.

54:40.600 --> 54:44.200
You know, I go back to something I kind of thought about, maybe we'd talk about today,

54:44.200 --> 54:47.560
but it just didn't really seem to fit is I love BitTorrent sync and those guys have just

54:47.560 --> 54:52.760
announced BitTorrent chat and it's a peer to peer chat system with no central chat server,

54:52.760 --> 54:53.760
but it's all closed source.

54:53.760 --> 54:54.760
Oh no.

54:54.760 --> 54:56.560
It's super light on the details.

54:56.560 --> 55:01.720
I just, you know, if you want me to trust it, that's the underlying problem with open source

55:01.720 --> 55:03.640
stuff is that you become wildly successful.

55:03.640 --> 55:07.560
Your open source project becomes your marketing arm and then you've got that closed source

55:07.560 --> 55:09.240
stuff that basically makes you the money.

55:09.240 --> 55:12.120
And I think that's kind of where a lot of these projects end up.

55:12.120 --> 55:14.240
I see like Google's a good example of that.

55:14.240 --> 55:17.480
They use lots of open source stuff, but they're making their money with the closed source

55:17.480 --> 55:18.480
stuff.

55:18.480 --> 55:19.480
They really are.

55:19.480 --> 55:20.480
Yeah.

55:20.480 --> 55:21.480
Yeah.

55:21.480 --> 55:22.480
Yeah.

55:22.480 --> 55:23.480
Like ads.

55:23.480 --> 55:24.480
Well, okay.

55:24.480 --> 55:25.480
Well, so yeah.

55:25.480 --> 55:26.480
Okay.

55:26.480 --> 55:27.760
I was going to get, that's actually, I was thinking we could actually have a whole show

55:27.760 --> 55:31.700
about this because you know, Red Hat just had their 20 years and they're making a ton

55:31.700 --> 55:33.840
of money, but maybe that might be a future topic.

55:33.840 --> 55:35.960
Let's get to our first email, Matt.

55:35.960 --> 55:37.160
And this is a subreddit thread.

55:37.160 --> 55:39.240
It came in from Dexinox.

55:39.240 --> 55:44.480
He says, so after six years of using GNU slash Linux, I have finally defeated my laziness

55:44.480 --> 55:46.000
and I installed Arch.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.800
My thoughts before Arch, better take a whole day off and prepare for some chill pills so

55:50.800 --> 55:51.800
I don't give up halfway.

55:51.800 --> 55:55.560
I like to have a few drinks and get ready.

55:55.560 --> 55:59.640
Then after 30 minutes of installing Arch, his thoughts, what the?

55:59.640 --> 56:00.640
Is that it?

56:00.640 --> 56:03.080
Well, that was unexpectedly easy.

56:03.080 --> 56:06.520
Even when I had network and bumblebee problems after install, I was able to solve it without

56:06.520 --> 56:08.320
even looking at the Arch wiki or forums.

56:08.320 --> 56:09.320
Wow.

56:09.320 --> 56:10.320
Good job.

56:10.320 --> 56:13.120
He says, I'm giving Arch a 10 out of 10 rating.

56:13.120 --> 56:17.640
Can we really see why where it's users so passionate in all those flame wars?

56:17.640 --> 56:19.960
I can see why users are so passionate in all those flame wars.

56:19.960 --> 56:26.200
He's anymore than he asks if anybody else in the last crowd is using Arch for production.

56:26.200 --> 56:28.080
And you know, I am actually using Arch for production.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.080
Yeah.

56:29.080 --> 56:30.080
I was going to say you use it for production.

56:30.080 --> 56:32.920
I actually have an unused partition of Arch that is still there.

56:32.920 --> 56:34.560
I just haven't done anything with it.

56:34.560 --> 56:37.560
I would agree in that it really is not that hard to get set up.

56:37.560 --> 56:40.480
I'd say probably the hardest part is honestly just kind of deciding what themes you want

56:40.480 --> 56:42.040
to use and what desktop you're going to choose.

56:42.040 --> 56:43.040
There's a lot of choices.

56:43.040 --> 56:48.080
There's a lot of choices and I'd say that the customization part is probably the most

56:48.080 --> 56:50.080
time consuming.

56:50.080 --> 56:53.000
But yeah, the setup itself is pretty much just dirt, dirt, dirt, you know, just follow

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
along with the wiki.

56:54.000 --> 56:58.180
But yeah, but for me personally, the customization thing, honestly, I'm just not that vested

56:58.180 --> 56:59.180
into it.

56:59.180 --> 57:03.800
I would almost rather have it done for me, you know, and that changes from time to time.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.600
That is the XFCE user.

57:05.600 --> 57:07.440
Hey, you know what?

57:07.440 --> 57:08.920
Manjaro does it all for me.

57:08.920 --> 57:09.920
That's true.

57:09.920 --> 57:10.920
Manjaro makes it a damn nice looking...

57:10.920 --> 57:13.000
I was in it for Pac-Man anyway, so it's like, eh.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.140
They make a good looking XFCE setup.

57:15.140 --> 57:19.800
So I thought I'd just add to anybody in the mumble room here, you guys, anybody here have

57:19.800 --> 57:21.880
Arch like on a server in production somewhere?

57:21.880 --> 57:25.520
I have it in the traditional production sense, like I use it to generate sounds and talk

57:25.520 --> 57:31.360
to you guys and create showed stuff, so, and encode, I suppose.

57:31.360 --> 57:34.560
And you know, I really have not been bit by this mythical, I don't know how long it's

57:34.560 --> 57:38.040
been now, but I've had a few things happen here or there where I've had to restart, where

57:38.040 --> 57:42.120
I had like a problem that like didn't fix until like maybe I updated the video driver,

57:42.120 --> 57:46.120
I updated the kernel or something, and I'd have to restart before things are right.

57:46.120 --> 57:49.120
So I think maybe under Arch I restart more than I did under other Linux's.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.440
Could be.

57:50.440 --> 57:52.000
But I don't think other than that I've had any surprises.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.520
It doesn't sound like anybody in the mumble room is using it in production.

57:55.520 --> 57:58.600
I know it's all because everybody in here is a bunch of Red Hat Enterprise users.

57:58.600 --> 57:59.600
Right, exactly.

57:59.600 --> 58:01.160
No, they're all using Windows.

58:01.160 --> 58:06.480
No, I think for myself, I think as long as you're, whether it be any type of rolling

58:06.480 --> 58:10.760
distro like that, but you know, Arch or Benjara or whatever, read the release docs every time

58:10.760 --> 58:11.760
there's an update, you're fine.

58:11.760 --> 58:12.920
You know what's going on.

58:12.920 --> 58:13.920
You know what I say?

58:13.920 --> 58:14.920
You know?

58:14.920 --> 58:15.920
Sousa Enterprise Edition.

58:15.920 --> 58:16.920
There you go.

58:16.920 --> 58:17.920
Sousa Enterprise Edition.

58:17.920 --> 58:18.920
That's what I say.

58:18.920 --> 58:19.920
Play it safe to a fault.

58:19.920 --> 58:20.920
Yes.

58:20.920 --> 58:24.280
If you really like Sousa Enterprise.

58:24.280 --> 58:25.280
It depends on the venue.

58:25.280 --> 58:26.280
In the right venue, it's awesome.

58:26.280 --> 58:27.280
Yeah.

58:27.280 --> 58:30.720
Well, I mean, if you're going to say, hey, Chris, you got to load CentOS or Sousa Enterprise.

58:30.720 --> 58:32.400
Oh, yeah, that's no question.

58:32.400 --> 58:33.720
What's going on with Sousa Enterprise?

58:33.720 --> 58:35.720
Yeah, CentOS makes me want to punch things.

58:35.720 --> 58:36.720
I hate that.

58:36.720 --> 58:37.720
Yeah.

58:37.720 --> 58:38.720
But we love you guys.

58:38.720 --> 58:39.720
All right.

58:39.720 --> 58:44.960
So John wrote in, he said, hi, Chris and Matt, I have some comments from last week's Linux

58:44.960 --> 58:45.960
Unplugged.

58:45.960 --> 58:48.920
He said, there was feedback where one user was looking for an iTunes replacement but

58:48.920 --> 58:55.520
felt stuck with the program due to buying a lot of content attached to that dang DRM.

58:55.520 --> 58:59.360
The discussion also turned into the convenience of getting content via file-shared networks.

58:59.360 --> 59:02.440
But the problem is that such networks are labeled as cheap pirates.

59:02.440 --> 59:04.400
Users of such networks are labeled as cheap pirates.

59:04.400 --> 59:07.480
In reality, most of them do not get access to the otherwise denied.

59:07.480 --> 59:12.280
My wife and I are fans of British television, with the most recent favorite being Downtown

59:12.280 --> 59:13.280
Abbey.

59:13.280 --> 59:17.520
As a viewer in the US, the only real legal way to watch the show is to wait six months

59:17.520 --> 59:19.480
after the UK version airs on PBS.

59:19.480 --> 59:24.380
Due to this time restriction, it forces many users to download the UK version from file-sharing

59:24.380 --> 59:27.320
sites if they want to keep up with the show.

59:27.320 --> 59:31.120
Are these people considered bad if they want to consume content and work around the restrictions

59:31.120 --> 59:32.960
of selfish corporations?

59:32.960 --> 59:35.040
Or are we meant to be punished?

59:35.040 --> 59:38.560
A few months back, there was a story about GameStop requiring a critically acclaimed

59:38.560 --> 59:42.740
and unfortunately very rare Wii game called Xenoblade Chronicles.

59:42.740 --> 59:47.400
The game was never meant to be bought over in the stateside, but when it was, GameStop

59:47.400 --> 59:50.400
became the only reseller and had a limited run.

59:50.400 --> 59:54.280
As with many types of these games, the value was high on auction sites, and many gamers

59:54.280 --> 59:56.120
who wanted it paid a high price.

59:56.120 --> 01:00:00.160
All of a sudden, large amounts of games were available at GameStop were sold at $90.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.720
The issue with these copies is the employees were forced to remove the plastic and sell

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:07.960
it used to no longer be forced to pay a $50 MSRP.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.080
From that perspective, GameStop was being unethical against the consumer, and if the

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.600
consumer wanted to experience the game, they would have to turn to piracy to play it or

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.260
at $90 for a new version of the game.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:21.480
So in a nutshell, there are many people who turn to piracy to do it as a way to get around

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:26.720
unfair restrictions on the consumer and are not just being cheap and do not care about

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.720
art.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:34.200
You know, it's interesting because I reflect on the first time I pirated TV, it was Star

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.200
Trek Enterprise.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200
Shocker, right?

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.200
Yeah.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.200
I totally saw that coming.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.200
No.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.400
I thought it was Downton Abbey.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:48.920
I lived in an area where our local affiliate, UPN11, made a big stink about going HD, and

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.200
they had Enterprise.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.680
And Enterprise season three was also recorded with HD cameras, and I thought, and this was

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.920
still season two when they made the announcement, and then when the season three stuff came

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.480
out, I was like, okay, I got to do this.

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:04.520
So I thought, all right, well, KCBW, whatever it was, I can't remember, KCBW, whatever,

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.360
they're going to get HD TV, Enterprise is in HD.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.880
Nothing on TV is more important to me than Enterprise, and I've been thinking about

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.680
getting an HD TV anyways.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:18.600
This is really before even 1080p was big on the market, like 720p, and I paid like $5,500

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:25.960
for my HD, and I was a single guy, so I had some money to burn, and I still have the TV

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.720
to this day, but nothing was in HD, nothing.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.400
There wasn't Blu-ray players, right?

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.680
I don't even think the 360 with the HD DVD drive had come out yet.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:38.720
No, I don't think it did, because I remember when that happened, and I kept thinking, well,

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.080
that'd be nice, but yeah, and I blew my money all on the surround sound system I had at

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080
the time.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.640
Yeah, yeah, I inherited the surround sound system, so I saved money there, so I just

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:54.240
needed the HD part, and then, about three months after I got the setup all in, the local

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:59.280
cable channel, local affiliate announced they were canceling their HD migration, which of

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.680
course, yes, they eventually migrated.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.000
So I just said, you know what?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Screw it.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.240
Oh, and also, at this point, Syfy had launched an HD, but my local cable provider didn't

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.040
have Syfy in HD, and I was watching Battlestar Galactica, I think, or something.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.040
Yeah, I think it was the new BSG.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:19.560
So I was just like, I'm going to keep paying for the cable service, but screw these guys.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.880
They told me I was going to get HD.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.300
I went and bought a TV to watch my Enterprise in HD.

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:29.440
I'm going to watch Enterprise in HD, and it's not that I wasn't paying for the TV service.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.180
I just also pirated it.

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:35.800
And I think that's what a lot of people have to really come to grips with when they wrestle

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.440
with the morality of something like that, is that a lot of stuff like that, even DVDs

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:46.240
to a certain extent, Blu-rays, whatever they may be, you're almost leasing or being lent

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.780
the contents.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.720
You may own the disc, but do you really own the content?

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.960
According to the movie industry, you don't own squat, because they do as they damn well

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.960
please.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.560
And so that leaves us with that moral dilemma.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.040
How do we approach this?

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.040
And I think that more and more people are thinking, you know what?

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.040
Piss on you.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.040
I bought this.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040
I'm going to watch it my way.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.400
Somebody contributed my funds to it.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.800
The other thing, too, is I think people are savvy enough to realize that it is not the

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.040
content creator.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.540
Because as a content creator, as somebody who's making a show, you want as many people

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:19.640
as possible to see that, because that's why you're making it, right?

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.520
That's going to get you renewed next season.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.520
Right.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:29.900
But then these corporations who make profits based on a limited quantity model, and instead

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:34.520
of taking advantage, like our type of show takes advantage of a widely distributed model,

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.520
right?

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.560
It's a completely different approach.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.200
Whereas their model takes advantage on limiting quantity on purpose, so that way they can

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.720
sell it to advertisers at a massive premium.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720
At a massive premium.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.200
And when you go outside that system, you devalue what they can charge the advertiser.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.840
And the thing is, I think a lot of us are, maybe we don't fully understand this paradigm,

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.360
but we're savvy enough to know that it's the middlemen that are getting screwed and not

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.200
the creators that are getting screwed.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.700
And the middlemen are screwing the consumers.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.640
And I think you totally nailed it there.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:10.900
I think also the other issue, too, is that we're not dealing with gatekeepers.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.520
We are the gatekeepers.

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.800
And with TV content, you know, someone creates this really great show, Under the Dome is

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.800
a great example.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:22.520
And, yeah, sure, it's available for Amazon Prime folks to enjoy on Amazon and whatnot,

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:27.600
but it's also being distributed through television, and that happened because the gatekeepers

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:31.640
that the creators of the show made the contract with allowed that to happen.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:36.600
And when you give control of something like that, you as a content creator really are

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.080
left getting what they allow you to get.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.040
And we don't have to deal with that sort of stuff because of the fact we don't deal with

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.040
the gatekeeper stuff.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040
So that's kind of the big thing.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.120
Gonna be an interesting future to watch where these guys kind of pull out all the stops

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.120
they can.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.880
And that includes things like leaning on the administration for SOPA and all other kinds

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:54.880
of nasty things.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.360
Well, they found that the whole suing people out of existence thing's kind of been a flop.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.480
So they decide, well, you know, it really works, let's make this criminal.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.000
So we'll go and we'll buy us some congressmen because, you know, you just go to the exchange

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
for that.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And-

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Except for during the shutdown.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Except for the shutdown.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Oh, I'm sure.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Yeah, well, they're out panhandling right now.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Oh, they'll still take money, yeah.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Yeah, they are.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
They'll still take money, yeah.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Record levels of it, actually.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I'm sure.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
It's gonna be a huge unfiltered this week, Matt.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.040
That's actually just one aspect is funding for these guys is at record highs right now.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.040
Anyways.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.040
Wow.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.040
Wow.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040
That's crazy.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040
Well, it's a zero sum game.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.040
You're right.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.600
It's a game that can play it out.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.080
In the meantime, I think, I don't want to say it is our right to pirate.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.240
I just want to say I don't have the biggest moral hang up if somebody's downloading a

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.240
television show.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.240
I just-

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.240
Exactly.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:46.320
My preferred solution to this problem, and I know this sounds crazy, but my preferred

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.080
solution is just don't watch it.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.080
Right.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.080
There's tons of-

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.440
The support content that is not dealing with these games.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.440
Exactly.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.440
You know what that means?

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440
That means I haven't seen Breaking Bad.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.000
And I realize it sounds like it's one of the greatest television shows ever created.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Yeah.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.320
But eventually, somehow, that'll be made available to me in a way that I can consume

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.960
it on terms that I'm comfortable with.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.680
And I don't know if that means there's going to be zero DRM, but I do know it means I'm

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.160
going to be able to watch it on my Linux box.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.160
Oh, yeah.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.640
No, there's ways of doing that.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.780
But yeah, but there's certainly ways of doing that.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:16.160
And you kind of have to come to grips with the best way to do it.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:19.240
Because shows like that, I would love to see something like that on Kickstarter.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.800
But quite honestly, I don't know if we're probably 10 years out from that because of

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.920
how deep and how well done it was.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920
I mean, it's interesting.

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.520
The thing we're both dancing around is how Netflix totally changes this whole thing up.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.520
It does.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:36.040
Because Netflix is sort of the best model where it's like, we're not selling to advertisers.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.600
We just want as many subscribers as possible, so we're going to make the best content possible.

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.600
That's right.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.920
The only problem with Netflix, and we both know what it is, is they are, they're assholes

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.920
when it comes to Linux.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.140
Linus needs to go give Netflix the middle finger.

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:51.200
But what's ironic about it is the fact that they are supported on Roku, which in theory

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.040
is embedded Linux with a little bit of a DRM chip.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.040
And the Boxee Box.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.480
And millions of Android devices.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:01.320
And they do have most of the Breaking Bad seasons on Netflix now.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.760
Just pointing that out.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.280
You know, screw Silverlight.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.040
Although I just read that they had a job posting that sounded like it was converting some of

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.060
their backend systems from Silverlight to something else.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.040
So what they want is they want to have an HTML5 DRM standard.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:20.320
They want everybody to adopt that, and then they want to start delivering it that way.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.600
They'll call it like Golden Shower or something.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.360
I'm sure they'll have some really great name for it.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360
They don't realize what they're saying.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.360
I'm sure.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.360
Golden Shower.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.360
Yeah.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.360
Does that come with that Golden Shower DRM?

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.960
I'd like to get that Golden Shower DRM.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.960
Wait, no, no, no, not the real, yeah.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.960
All right, Matt.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.720
Well, I think that'll wrap up this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.080
Now don't forget we are live on Tuesdays.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.480
Go over to jblive.tv at 2 p.m. on a Tuesday.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.560
Now you could also go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.680
The calendar will auto-update now with your time zone, or you can manually choose a time

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.680
zone.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:56.480
If you're a Jupyter signal subscriber, dang it, go check your inbox.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.480
A new signal's in there with the artwork from Albert.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.480
Did you see that?

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.480
Matt, how great was that?

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.480
I did.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.480
That was awesome.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.480
Absolutely.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.480
Absolutely awesome.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.480
As a matter of fact, I shared it on the subreddit.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.480
Yeah, oh, that's right.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.360
You guys can find a link if you want to see it if you didn't get the signal.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.360
Well, Matt, have a great week.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.360
I'll see you on Sunday.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.360
Sounds good.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.360
See you then.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.360
All right, everyone.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.360
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:29.480
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.
