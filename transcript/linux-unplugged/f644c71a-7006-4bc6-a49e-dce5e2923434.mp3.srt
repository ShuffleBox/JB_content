1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:09,040
So there's someone in the staging area, Marks, he's from Ubuntu

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,140
podcast, he's also a prior OggCamp organizer and he's the guy that has a Steam

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:21,180
controller and did our review and everything. Will you pull him in there

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,520
Wes? I assume he probably has a working mic. I assume he probably does. Oh I

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,120
should start the show. He has an SM58 and a mixer, yeah. Chat room, please bang

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,640
suggest our show underscored. Okay I should probably... Hello Mark. Hello Mark.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,920
Hello Mark, hello Mark. So Mark you had a chance sounds like to try the Steam

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,200
controller out, what do you think? Did better than we did. Yeah he got farther

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,920
than I did, what do you think of it? I'm really enjoying it, I've tried it with

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,960
with games with quite a few different controller schemes and I found yeah it's

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,400
generally really successful. Have you tried it with Alien Isolation? No I've

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,400
not got that yet, I'm scared to buy it because I'm with games like that I tend

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,880
to waste my money because I play for about an hour and then I'm just too

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,840
scared to carry on. Yeah that's probably my, I bought, I literally bought it

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,400
because I've heard from a few people that it works out of the box with the

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,960
Steam controller so I thought okay this is the one to try it on, it looks really

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,800
visually impressive. It does look very impressive. But no I tried, I just tried it a few

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,040
minutes ago and no dice. So okay so what's the experience like? You get a

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,160
game and it has controller support and if it just has controller support you

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,040
just start playing immediately? Well if it's got Xbox controller support yeah

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
you just tell it to emulate a gamepad and it works as an Xbox controller would.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,960
Yeah if it's got Steam controller support like Portal 2 does then it's

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,480
even better because actually in-game it tells you to press the Steam controller

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,320
buttons rather than the Xbox controller buttons and that's really nice.

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,080
I wonder if that would have worked for this one. It seems like for me it's like in a

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,640
matter of months like a lot of little issues I ran into are just going to be

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,240
totally solved because there probably just be just a couple of updates to some

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,760
of these games. Like take Race the Sun for example it seems crazy that doesn't

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,880
have a controller support yet. Yep. But you give it a couple of weeks. I was playing

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,760
that at Mark's house yesterday, it works fine. Well okay good. So when I went in

31
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,560
there it says it says it doesn't have controller support in the big picture

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,120
mode and that you have to you know that that's that's the kind of support I'm

33
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,720
talking about. Not that it doesn't work I just mean that you have to more

34
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,520
integration. Yeah it doesn't seem. I've played a ton of Race the Sun with the

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,880
Steam controller but I had to use a community config. And that's not such a

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,520
bad solution. It's kind of nice that Valve set it up but it can especially be

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,360
maybe be a good first wave to you and tell them. How do you know what's up but

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,600
how do you know it's a good scheme? You just sit there and try like four or five of them?

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,120
Yeah that's my criticism they need a like rating system so the best ones

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,960
propagate to the top. But yeah well you can tell like how many people are

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,600
using it but just because it's popular doesn't know. That's not a horrible

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,040
indication, at least something though. Yeah go for the second most popular. I

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,640
would like somebody that needs to upgrade controller schemes for players

44
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:08,000
that have actually beat the game. So you just want the macro that will walk you through the game?

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
You know I don't know why I even bother with this controller stuff because the

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,720
mouse and keyboard can't be beat anyways and I shouldn't I shouldn't

47
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,880
bother. Because you can hook up a mouse and keyboard to a Steam machine too.

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,920
So challenge accepted. For what? You play you use a keyboard and a mouse and I'll use

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,640
the controller and see who wins. Have I tried? No I haven't tried replacing the battery so I should try that huh?

50
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,920
See that's the thing you guys is that the Steam controller is working in big

51
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,760
picture mode and like in the Steam overlay and it does work in games when I

52
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,400
go in there and manually map the buttons. It doesn't, what doesn't seem to be

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,680
happening is if I select a controller config it doesn't, the game doesn't seem

54
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,480
to be aware of any controller config or button layout that I've selected and

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,960
most games are telling me I don't have a controller connected even though I'm

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,920
navigating the picture mode and the rest of the UI with the controller.

57
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,440
Are you on the Steam beta? I don't know what I'm on actually I could check but I

58
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,000
don't, I could be. That does sound like something I would do. It does sound like it.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,480
Yeah I've noticed in the beta updates are coming almost daily on the Steam

60
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,080
client lately and the release notes almost always have you know fix this to

61
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,000
Steam controller, add this to Steam big picture mode. So they're

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,200
iterating very quickly right now. Yeah I you know I you know what that is

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,200
actually a good point is I should check for updates. That is probably something I

64
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,040
haven't done for a few days on this, for more than a few days on this machine.

65
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,640
Yeah the beta checkbox is really easy to find in the account settings and I

66
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,320
haven't really haven't had any. I'm not currently participating but I don't

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,920
think I've really done updates either so. Well you'll probably find when you're

68
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,960
when a controller recognizes your you've got buttons but not the actual controller

69
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,160
mapping I found before I had the Steam overlay turned on it just uses the

70
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,600
mapping that the Steam interface uses which is completely useless for any game.

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,920
So yeah there is something going on there where it's it's picking up that

72
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,520
you've got the controller in Steam but it's not applying it in the game. Yeah

73
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:16,560
okay well. This is Linux Unplugged episode 117 for November 3rd 2015.

74
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,600
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that just threw out it's

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,640
no beer rule that it just made ten minutes ago right before the show

76
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,400
started. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hey there Wes you know it is a tasty

77
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,320
beer too thank you for bringing these in. That's my job tempt you to break your

78
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,880
rules. You're a good man I appreciate that. Well it's a good show to break the

79
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,440
rules on coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged show. I tried

80
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,200
out Ubuntu Mate 1510 over the weekend gonna give you my follow-up on that.

81
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,040
We're also gonna hopefully hear a little bit of how odd camp went and then we're

82
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,760
gonna get into some new desktop updates and some really great follow-up

83
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,960
especially for those of you that are looking to do some notes in plain text

84
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,920
and have a nice way to organize them. We're gonna talk a little about the

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,720
Cinnamon desktop as well and then we're gonna look at the Volkswagen situation

86
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,000
one more time because there is another big update there and it has caused a

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,040
whole new round of mainstream press to say this is why proprietary software is

88
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,120
bad it's amazing. It's hard to believe but. We have a showcase in the show notes

89
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,640
and we'll talk a little bit about that later in the show and then last but not

90
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,680
least today as we're recording this very show Fedora 23 hit the internet's

91
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,240
the new Fedora is out we're gonna have our review on Sunday's Linux action show

92
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,320
live on Friday but we're gonna cover what's new how you can get it and some

93
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,360
of the things that we as a group are looking forward to for Fedora 23 big

94
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,480
release with gnome 3.18 in it. Oh yes very fancy very fancy so we have some

95
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,100
follow-up and some things to get into but before we go any further I got to

96
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:03,120
bring in our virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room hello

97
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,560
hey there it's a big turnout today too so that's really cool that's great to

98
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,120
have you now I hope I hope some of you are also breaking the no beer rule that

99
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,520
was implemented ten minutes ago and then then also shattered shattered two

100
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,440
minutes ago I hope you're breaking that right now with me so I have a I have one

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,120
bullet point in the show notes for this very very important bit of follow-up

102
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,160
this week we have assembled a crack team of on the scene reporters from odd camp

103
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,800
2015 and I'm hoping that I know Pope is here I believe mark is here from from

104
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,920
the by some some other podcast I'm told and some actually all these guys from

105
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,200
some other podcast I'm told although those are probably rumors they're

106
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,360
probably not even in the u.s. and they're gonna they're gonna give us a

107
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,400
round of what happened at odd camp so who should I give the floor to first I

108
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,520
think you should hand on to mark first because I understand Pope is having

109
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,080
difficulty with his PC well you know he you know what that's so funny since he

110
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,440
was giving me a hard time running arch before the show started isn't that

111
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,800
appropriate I actually think we should give it to mark to those since mark made

112
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,000
the special trip here it's his first time here so why not throw him under the

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
bus right away that only seems fair that's our policy yeah that's that's

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,120
though we like nice of you yeah yeah so mark welcome to Linux unplugged and tell

115
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,440
us a little bit for those who didn't listen listen last week what is odd camp

116
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,080
and how the heck did it go well camp is we call it a free culture on conference

117
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,120
so it's an event that's been running for the past six or seven years I've lost

118
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,280
count now but basically we we hire out of venue and then we convince a bunch

119
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,320
of people to somehow turn up and come up with a schedule and give a load of

120
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,920
talks about anything from well anything kind of community driven really so we

121
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,280
have people talking about Raspberry Pi's we have people talking about running in

122
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,600
parks at the weekend we had panel discussions we had some live podcast

123
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,160
recordings hardware hacking all sorts wow that is like a pick your choice

124
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,800
there's gonna be something there to delight any geek that would listen to

125
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,840
this show I think I love the generality you know like it's not it's not so

126
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,200
constrained you can kind of just come and share the cool thing you're doing

127
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,540
yeah and so I bet there's a lot of Linux that works up in that crowd that comes

128
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,760
up so how did it go it was a good event it was a good turnout did you enjoy

129
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,720
yourself I heard rumors of shouting etc. mainly in the evenings we went to some

130
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,960
really cool venues in Liverpool which were converted warehouses and being a

131
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,800
bunch of geeks relving getting up and dancing of course we wanted to stand

132
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,120
around and talk about geeky things all evening and they kept on turning the

133
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,920
music up so by by the mornings we were a little bit horse that's hard still

134
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:47,120
recovering the reason I think system D is actually a good idea I could see what

135
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,600
it was like interspersed with I'd like another beer so how does it compare to

136
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,920
last year's I like odd camp 14 and 13 oh that's a good question so I'll camp 13

137
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,440
was at the same venue it was mmm probably comparable actually I mean we

138
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,560
had some different things going on in terms of exhibitors but we had you know

139
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,200
a similar sort of variety of talks last year's was in a different venue and had

140
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,560
probably more of a focus on the the sort of exhibition space as well there was

141
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,240
some really cool like we had a load of hack spaces there last year this year we

142
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,440
had we had a few sort of hardware things and we had the Ubuntu stall and the

143
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,080
fedora stall across from each other in the in the exhibition space but we also

144
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,880
had we also had an intro where exhibiting which was really cool with

145
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,000
their Ubuntu laptops that they're selling now yeah I saw a few pictures

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,800
online of those and I did I also see a fedora laptop there too you might have

147
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,520
done we didn't have anything to do yeah right yeah yeah I made peace with my

148
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:59,280
fedora brethren and they were running fedora 23 and gnome 3 on a large a large

149
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,560
panel and then on a laptop they were running fedora demonstrating their

150
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,080
alternate spins and they had the Marte desktop running there so I decided to

151
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,680
to make my peace with fedora and introduce myself to John Archer and he's

152
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,940
a lovely bloke the ability to stand immediately opposite fedora Stan and

153
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,640
power through the day we we exchanged merchandise stickers and pens and badges

154
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:32,280
and things and made up a football in no man's land nice very good so I so it

155
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,600
sounds like an event that was a well-attended poppy how did the live

156
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,120
tracker end up working out I checked in at one point but I couldn't tell if it

157
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,200
was working or not yeah it was kind of hit and miss we had an Ubuntu phone

158
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,720
polling our position to the website and various people would tell us every so

159
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,920
often when it was broken which was usually because I'd poorly written the

160
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,240
code on the phone and it would run out of memory as it was logging far too

161
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,600
excessively that was my fault that's actually pretty still neat still though

162
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:08,840
but this is not indicative of other apps performance right yeah exactly a little

163
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:14,140
disclaimer that's still a neat thing though I like that I think I think we

164
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,000
should seriously come up with a legitimate live tracker app for Ubuntu

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,760
phone and then in a future road trip when I go somewhere I'll use that to

166
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,280
track where I'm going because I have this silver cloud thing for now but I

167
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,240
could swap that out anytime anytime all right so I wimpy and poppy or mark

168
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,800
anything else from odd cam it sounds like it was a pretty fun event I kind of

169
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,080
want to go there yeah me too yeah one of the one of the cooler hardware hacks

170
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,080
that I saw was a nerf gun range which someone had set up there was a few years

171
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,000
ago someone had built a minecraft crane which picked up boxes and made them into

172
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,760
sort of minecraft style objects and the same guy had brought the boxes along

173
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,800
made these these sensors which he put inside so if you shot them with a nerf

174
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,400
gun it activated the sensor and then he had that hooked up to this RFID tag

175
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,240
system to identify who you were and it tracked your score and tweeted you wow

176
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,120
and there was a prize for the three top scores the prizes were won by these

177
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,900
three kids who discovered an exploit in the system and and managed to get them

178
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,200
skilled score so themselves scores of about half a billion compared to my

179
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,760
sixteen is there a you know a lot of times when I attend a conference like

180
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,280
this even when there's like you know everything from software to hardware and

181
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,360
community and and just the open culture itself is really the highlight a lot of

182
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,840
times though you can't help but walk away and go boy I kind of feel like

183
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,800
there was a overarching theme or an elephant in the room and is there one

184
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,480
like that at odd camp is there like a something is really kind of the buzz

185
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,400
this year or there's a there's like it feels like a bubble or a trend that you

186
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,800
observed or is it really pretty dispersed there was one there was one

187
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,480
emerged as a theme it wasn't planned but there was a lot of discussion about

188
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,280
online privacy yeah I was wondering they were that was that was the topic for the

189
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,660
panel discussion and Linux voice also recorded a live podcast on the second

190
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,320
day and that was also their discussion piece very interesting audience yeah

191
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,160
that makes sense I was that's actually that was when I asked the question that

192
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,120
was in the back of in the back of my mind mark were you gonna chime in with

193
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,040
something too I was going to say exactly what Martin just said actually privacy

194
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,520
and online and is it is it like from is it from the state or is it just privacy

195
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,760
in general is it is it if you abstract it out from there is it is it like

196
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,400
Snowden type stuff or what is it the overall theme that was that was kind of

197
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,560
what what it came out it was we were talking about whether the cloud is a

198
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,920
good thing or a bad thing basically and then we moved on to basically do people

199
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,760
care about what happens to their data online and should they care and can we

200
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,720
make them that was the where it all really went but it does seem like we

201
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,680
care as a community the people that Linux that the average Linux user does

202
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,360
care and and also the average Linux user seems to be better positioned than most

203
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,920
users to do something about it either from a technical knowledge set or by the

204
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,640
very fact they're using an open system and so it does seem to be coming up

205
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,960
more and more of these conferences because we're the type of user to think

206
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,080
about this kind of thing we're also the kind of user that is willing to live

207
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,920
with password managers and dual you know a factor two-factor authentication and

208
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,280
and and we're also the kind of user that cares about these kinds of things so

209
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,640
it's a really interesting cross-section that I find when I go to these kinds of

210
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,280
conferences so that's interesting up there so yeah one of the talks that is

211
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,680
typical for talks to get composed as a result of a conversation the night

212
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,000
before and that was you know typical of our camp this year and John Spriggs did

213
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,920
a piece about squirrel SQL which is a two-factor authentication Gibson's thing

214
00:15:49,920 --> 00:16:00,520
right yeah is that yes really yeah I know which is why I was surprised John

215
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,200
did specifically say the focus on the protocol and not who came up with it yeah

216
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,720
well that mean that is very true right I mean if the code is good code then

217
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,040
that's and if it's it's if it's a good protocol then that's and it's open and

218
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,360
we can take it to you know so is this so okay be honest with me now be be honest

219
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,800
with me is this something that I should try to make it to next year because

220
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,240
that's a big commitment I would have to fly out there lots of money etc etc does

221
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,760
that seem like I mean how many I mean really come on yeah how many people are

222
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,480
we talking well the first thing I'll say 400 oh that's a really nice sweet spot I

223
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,360
like that size that's you get you know you get more than 2,000 it's just crazy

224
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,840
you're looking enjoy it oh that oh that's all I'll say regardless of how

225
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,880
big the audience is you would definitely enjoy it yeah yeah and although it's a

226
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,880
two-day event so there's the the Saturday and the Sunday this time there's

227
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,360
actually like four days packed into that because there's the main events that

228
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,600
happen during the day and then there's the evening events that start at about

229
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,400
six o'clock in the evening and go on to about midnight or two o'clock in the

230
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,260
morning so there's sort of like four events over those two days oh that is

231
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,120
fun I like that now there's not I can rank is as good as the sort of the event

232
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,400
itself now you know that is always so true especially when it's around three

233
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,440
four hundred people because when you get bigger than that it's just it's too much

234
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,200
white noise literally huh now is there a Spartacus there is there a spot I can

235
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,720
park the rover cuz UK yeah I'm gonna yeah yeah well I know I mean a UK

236
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,360
dedicated UK right right oh that's interesting roads are quite narrow okay

237
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,960
and you might have heard that we actually drive on the correct side of

238
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,280
the road oh yeah I am worried about that yeah that is gonna change my that's

239
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,200
gonna change my world if I have to go over there well I I thank you guys for

240
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,280
coming in here give me the update that is really cool any other things you want

241
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:59,240
to mention about the about our camp 15 before we soldier on I know I think it's

242
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,680
it's one of those things that at the end of the at the end of the Sunday we all

243
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,080
get together as there's a guy said there's like the end there's multiple

244
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,480
things to get involved with and the very final thing on the Sunday is a few

245
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,160
relaxing beers where we discuss what we're gonna do next year and so we'll

246
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,640
keep you informed about what's gonna happen next year and when it will be and

247
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,880
where it'll be so you can you know you can plan your flight and everything yeah

248
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,200
do let me know and you know it's funny and and I I know I make this point too

249
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,640
often but and even as we sit here with a virtual log which is pretty awesome

250
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,040
like the mumble and Google Hangouts and all this stuff are pretty damn good

251
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:39,080
tools to connect with people and we can have really great conversations but

252
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,720
there is just there is something about when you go to an event like this and

253
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,640
everybody there speaks your language they know like what a colonel is they

254
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,480
know what you know a cloud what a cloud computer really is when I'm talking

255
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,440
about the cloud they know I'm really talking about somebody else's server at

256
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,200
a data center and you all are on on the same page and is if you walk around in

257
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,840
your life and you're like kind of the technical person in your family like

258
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,680
you're the you're the person that fixes things in your family or you're in the

259
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:14,800
tech department at your work you kind of you almost lose touch with how amazing

260
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,720
it is to be around other people that value the same things you value and

261
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,200
appreciate the same things that you appreciate and and also want to want to

262
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,760
maybe even debate the nuance with you and to do that in person mumble really

263
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,120
does a great job of this you know IRC and Hangouts do a great job of this but

264
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,760
nothing nothing does it like in person and like you increase the social stuff

265
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,480
yeah yeah it is it's a huge increase in bandwidth between two people or a whole

266
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,120
group of people and it is really exciting and what you realize is we're

267
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,760
not as bad as that BSD community makes us look exactly right we're nice people

268
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,160
yeah we are so that's what I take away every time all right so I just wanted to

269
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,280
really quickly do a little follow-up from Sunday's Linux action show we got

270
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,480
an email in asking how Noah and I manage our notes and I said well I always do

271
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,880
plain text files and I try to write them in markdown and that's kind of my base

272
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,900
requirements well we got a great recommendation and I I'm sorry I did not

273
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,680
grab the name of the reddit user who submitted it but it is a Q own notes

274
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,600
it's an open source notepad for Linux and those other desktops that works

275
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,920
together with the notes application of own cloud it's a desktop app though so

276
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,840
this is what's really cool is it's a desktop application that it's a GTK app

277
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,280
from what I can tell that has markdown support and it has a change tracking use

278
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,080
your own notes you can sync them over to other devices you can then log into your

279
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,440
own cloud instance and edit them with a local own cloud app but even if you're

280
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:50,600
on like an iOS device you can if you have own cloud and access like to the

281
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,880
file system you can just edit it with any markdown editor like it is not

282
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,240
lost to own cloud so this is really really cool and I've made a big stink

283
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,080
about own cloud before I have you caught that just a little bit yeah I basically

284
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,600
bailed on own cloud you certainly text a few months ago yeah basically I just

285
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,280
pushed it to the limits with way too much data and I bailed but I only bailed

286
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,760
and I don't think I made this point very clear I only bailed for file sync I'm

287
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,880
still using own cloud and that's one area where it has the most competition I

288
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,640
would say right I'm yeah yeah I would agree and and honestly I think same

289
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,280
thing that's a better job I would agree with that yeah so but I'm still using it

290
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,920
for car DAV and Kel DAV what do you what do you see you have a Nexus 5 are you

291
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,520
are you all in on the Google at the moment my main counter is I do have an

292
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,280
own count own cloud instance that needs to be updated and yeah but I've been

293
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,200
pressed with it in the past have you considered trying to transition from

294
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,720
Google services to own cloud or is it just not worth it no I think it's

295
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,960
totally worth it I need to move email emails of the one thing and then I think

296
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,640
I would consider moving yeah moving the rest of my investment so I did you know

297
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,360
it's funny you say that because I went the opposite route I moved my calendar

298
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,320
and my and my access my calendar and my my address book and I haven't moved

299
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,240
email yet and so this is why for me I kind of like this QO notes because I

300
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,200
still have it on cloud instance sitting around that I could use to sync my notes

301
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,040
but on the back end it's all just text files to markdown files which are text

302
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,600
files exactly so yeah I love the text files this is a really cool

303
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,540
recommendation yeah QO notes and it's a it is a as you probably guessed it is an

304
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,680
own cloud app but it really is just a matter of syncing with text files and

305
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,520
also with text to do was another recommendation that came in a lot and if

306
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,020
you haven't caught this Sunday's Linux action show the question was is how do

307
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,720
we manage our to dues and I said text files how do you manage your to-do list

308
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,680
text files and I use task warrior for a lot of my work stuff what yes task

309
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,200
warrior mm-hmm is this a desktop Android app command line I believe they have

310
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,960
some I believe they have some hold on a second did you just did you just change

311
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,400
my life mom or anybody the mom reviews task warrior task warrior hold on hold

312
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,000
on yeah obviously this is a command line to do this sounds like Linux action show

313
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,520
app pick material to me you jerk West how have you been sitting on this and

314
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,680
not telling me that there is a to-do app for the command line wait till you find

315
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,440
out that you can run your own server sync server on a digital ocean droplet

316
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:31,760
oh I'm very excited all right so this is how you do it yeah okay okay now for

317
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,200
everybody naturally hold on before West goes any further everybody listening

318
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,020
we're gonna play a little game where if Chris makes this is epic on Linux action

319
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,720
show we're all gonna pretend like we didn't already hear about this all right

320
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,640
so tell me about this cuz I'm very excited so you use task warrior with a

321
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,600
digital ocean droplet and you go to the command line to set your to dues yeah

322
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,560
yeah and it really is just like a CLI interface you know like task add and

323
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,440
then you can specify like project you know project at work or your home life

324
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,800
or whatever and then an arbitrary string and they have you know you can set

325
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,160
priorities you can set due dates and then I just task sync and it syncs up

326
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,080
that even there's a Android app called Miracle which does task but it

327
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,400
integrates with the task warrior server oh okay okay you can have the same thing

328
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
on your phone okay but without the command line okay all right so now

329
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,320
what's the server setup like is it like so on the scale of a Quasal client to I

330
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,120
don't know smoke ping how difficult is it to set up I would say similar to

331
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,200
Quasal you don't need a database back or quality area right yeah no database so

332
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,360
you don't have a database or anything like that you do have to set up some

333
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,400
primary error private key infrastructure okay but it's really not that bad it's

334
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,200
mostly you know you pretty much just assemble you have to set up a few

335
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,720
configs and set the right config file so that it allows the Miracle app from

336
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,720
your Android phone but once you've got that in place it really just works oh

337
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,720
that's funny so here's another option there's a basically there's a command

338
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,680
line tool called to do to do text yeah yeah right and it's it's a bash script

339
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,360
so it's essentially this it does the same stuff that task warrior does but

340
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:18,000
task warrior is a lot more like robust and features so if you've ever used to

341
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,760
do that text it's very similar in the way that I mean the main thing about to

342
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,240
do that text is you got to provide your own sync mechanism all right right so

343
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,040
you have to do same thing or really Dropbox is what I think it if you're

344
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,600
gonna use well no if you do the same thing that task warrior does where you

345
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,120
put it on a server you can do the same thing with to do that text put it on a

346
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,720
server and then just oh see so what I'm thinking about so I mean when I say that

347
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,840
what I'm talking about is from the perspective of mobile applications the

348
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,200
mobile apps that use to do that text have always they always want Dropbox

349
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,040
right except actually there's this awesome app I found because I built my

350
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,480
own to do that text app like structure because I don't like the basic structure

351
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,640
I wanted to have a massive customization where one to do that text file is not

352
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,160
enough for me so I currently have like 30 damn dude that's impressive yeah I

353
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,200
have I built my own bash script to to cut to manage all of them too so it has

354
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,200
like automatic archiving from like a huge list of things anyway I'm actually

355
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,720
gonna be releasing it at some point probably well I made it for myself and

356
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,680
then I told people about it and they're like oh wow that's cool we should give

357
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,760
it to me like I didn't it kid for everybody so it's complicated that's

358
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,920
what Linus said about Linux what's he said about getting it still true well

359
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,040
there's the the other thing is that the reason about that I was because there's

360
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,800
a fact because I did this I wanted to find a mobile version and there's this

361
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:50,240
there's a it's called simple tasks and it has it's simple task wire of cloud

362
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,960
and they're simple tasks cloudless so if someone doesn't want a cloud storage

363
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,140
they can use any sync they want and sync it to their phone directly so I have

364
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:06,080
like a custom sync thing set up for that but there's also the cloud version you

365
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,440
can choose whatever cloud you want you don't actually have to be stuck to drop

366
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,000
box okay yeah huh so so there's to do that text and task warrior as two

367
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,080
follow-ups to the email we got in the Linux action show on Sunday and the task

368
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,280
warrior thing is really that's fascinating to me I'm gonna check that

369
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,440
out I like that a lot now no yeah go ahead yeah yeah the the to do not text

370
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:35,560
thing if someone wants a GUI that go for it app that was a epic a couple weeks

371
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,400
ago or a few weeks ago that one is compatible with to got text so you could

372
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,440
have command line and you can also have a nice giveaway if you want it I I don't

373
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,480
make I don't mean to make a popiar token Ubuntu phone guy but I was just gonna

374
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,280
throw this your way poppy because when I when whenever we're talking about like a

375
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,180
task management app or a calendar management app I always think well what

376
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,480
if I want to bail from Android what if I want to bail from iOS what are you

377
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,800
using poppy when you are when you're using your Ubuntu phone what are you

378
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,240
using in that environment for task management to do or he doesn't have to

379
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,480
be like to-do list even just like setting reminders and things like that

380
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,520
what are you using so that's a great question and the reason I use the app I

381
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,120
use is because I always used Evernote in the past so I use Evernote on the

382
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,320
desktop and Evernote on the web and we have a notes client that can optionally

383
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,040
sync to Evernote so I just synchronize all my notes with Evernote and then I've

384
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:40,000
got those local but yeah there's at least three task managers in the Ubuntu

385
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,120
store so you know if you don't want to use that one there are lightweight ones

386
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,640
it's HTML 5 ones or you could just go and get the task binary stick it on your

387
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,000
phone and open that in a terminal if you really wanted to yeah you know that's

388
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,120
but I want to talk about that that's the elephant the room for me for all of this

389
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,560
and this is something I don't say usually well I've mentioned it before

390
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,600
but for me if I want to if I want something and I don't want to forget it

391
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,760
for a really long time and I'll give you an example like when I know I'm I'm

392
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,000
gonna need to know the VIN number of my truck yes for probably about eight nine

393
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,240
years that's probably how long I'll own that truck and that's how long I own my

394
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,400
last truck and so there are many times when you're getting insurance or you're

395
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,360
setting things up that you need to recall the VIN number of your vehicle

396
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,840
you want it easily accessible so for that kind of info like that really long-term

397
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,680
for remember forever kind of stuff I am still today using Evernote and I'm just

398
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,520
choosing to yeah from a smart device although to be fair the kind of stuff

399
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,720
like that which I would I would think is slightly private like I don't know VIN

400
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,840
number of vehicles probably not that bad because it's probably like that I have

401
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,680
like I have all the other information in there that is like kind of I'm not super

402
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,960
comfortable with it being with a third party right so for those I have a GPG

403
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,920
encrypted text file on my local machine which is backed up in various places but

404
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,020
no you know it's GPG encrypted so I feel okay about that and obviously the phone

405
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,800
you can use GPG on that yeah right I was gonna say I keep a lot of stuff in text

406
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,480
files with syncing as it is now so yep yep and using I've been ever since I

407
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,360
started playing with pass I started realizing why don't I just do this more

408
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,480
often just encrypt this stuff and then sync it everywhere and I don't care

409
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,320
because I'm using GPG and I trust GPG and syncing has encryption as well in

410
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,960
transit yeah yeah I but I fundamentally trust GPG yes I did as well same thing

411
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,960
I their encryption I'm sure is great it's just like that yeah yeah good at

412
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,200
least it's not plain text exactly so you get me you get me I remember many other

413
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,040
thoughts on that topic before we move on yes I do on the subject of notes I've

414
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,280
actually been looking and I don't even know if this exists for an application

415
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,760
that you type everything and mark down for the notes and everything and it

416
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:58,120
looks like G note or Xim and has support the sync to like a Google Drive or

417
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,720
Dropbox so that you know you know maybe late it's later at some point you can

418
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,680
access those notes on your Android device yeah you can basically accomplish

419
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:14,440
that today just using G editor Kate or whatever K right or whatever and just

420
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,120
saving it to a Dropbox or sync thing or bit torrent sync folder and then pulling

421
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,360
that up on your mobile device is there a good mobile markdown editor oh yeah a

422
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,080
lot I assume there must be yeah lots I can't remember off the top my head for

423
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,400
Android because I haven't been using it for a while but yeah there are a lot

424
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,680
there are amazing editors for markdown on Android but no the reason that I'd

425
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:40,000
like something like Xim or G note is because of how the notebooks and whatnot

426
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,840
are organized it's yes yeah yeah having that having that sort of meta

427
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,440
organization with tags and and categories and subcategories this is

428
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,800
really nice and that's you know whatever note provides and it kills me it

429
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,760
freaking kills me just like and I don't want to I don't want to go on anymore on

430
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,240
this but just like we're seeing more and more open source projects take on slack

431
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,520
and use slack yeah anter gross is my favorite or enter gross how do I say it

432
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:16,280
and Tegra winter got wimpy can you enter to go and Turgos enter goes is

433
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:22,640
switching from IRC to slack oh really and there was just a sort of well okay

434
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,440
all right well go ahead correct me I'm okay they it's not switching it's both

435
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,420
have using both I'm the split before it's splitting I'm the lead up for the

436
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:41,920
IRC for enter goes and the developers prefer to use slack so there's a weird

437
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:48,080
split right now but yeah they it is a slack thing that they prefer slack yeah

438
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,840
so it has become they then they they listed some really good reasons on their

439
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,560
Google Plus page and also you know what I'm gonna say it Jupiter broadcasting

440
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:02,200
has started using slack but there is a blog post at drew dev vault comm same

441
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,480
you know please don't use slack FOSS projects and I want to dig into that

442
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,920
because I'm gonna be honest we have started using slack here at Jupiter

443
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,400
broadcasting and I have felt like a bastard for the last two weeks we've

444
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,120
been using it it has been driving me absolutely crazy I'm gonna talk about

445
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,120
that with you guys first though I want to mention Linux Academy go to Linux

446
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,560
Academy comm slash unplug to get the Linux unplug discount and support the

447
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,040
show even if you're just checking them out I want to browse around Linux

448
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,080
Academy comm slash unplug supports this show go there and try them out and then

449
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,180
while you're there do the tour take the tour I invite you because I think it's

450
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:45,240
gonna blow your mind it's kind of amazing actually finally an educational

451
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,760
resource that is really actually focused and dedicated to Linux and open source

452
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,880
and all the technology around that included even like AWS and all of the

453
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,320
major technology stacks like Red Hat open stack yeah it is really fantastic

454
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,000
they have step-by-step video courses and they are really good with instructor

455
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,400
help available when you need it you can download the study guides they're

456
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,640
comprehensive you can listen to them in the shower like listener Seth if you

457
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:15,260
want and they come with their own servers which is not just nice but the

458
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,000
way they have done it it's like oh yeah they realize you're a Linux user the way

459
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,880
they set up the SSH the way you can get into it and control the system the way

460
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,500
you get complete control over it and seven plus distros to choose from and you

461
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,880
choose the distro the courseware and the virtual servers they spin up on-demand

462
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,600
automatically mass match that choice you get to keep track of your progress as

463
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,640
you go along and they're rolling out new features you know rather than just like

464
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,240
checking how you did after you're all done and waiting for the feedback after

465
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,560
you do something they're now allowing you to perform exercises and give you

466
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,240
immediate real-time feedback you could have done it this way you could have

467
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,920
answered it this way you could have used this command they have scenario based

468
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,160
courses that way you actually deploy and work with the technology in real-time in

469
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,520
production so when you go to actually do it in production in your production when

470
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,680
you're getting paid for it it's not the first time you've worked with it that is

471
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,960
serious peace of mind and they also now have a new professional development

472
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,520
certification platform I invite you to go check out if you've decided the route

473
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,320
for you is to expand your skill set to make you more employable to make you a

474
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,600
little more competitive if you just want to challenge yourself these are all good

475
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,320
reasons to go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and by the way they

476
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,520
also have time availability planners you can tell how much time you have if

477
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,360
you're busy and as a father of three and somebody who hosts 12 shows a week trust

478
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,360
me oh actually this week I'm not hosting 12 shows I take that back but I'm still

479
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,080
hosting like seven shows a week scrupulously honest hosting seven shows

480
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,400
a week right right it's six shows maybe I don't know who knows maybe I'll just

481
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,480
cancel one of them randomly but still trust me I know what it's like to feel

482
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,960
very busy I really do and that's why their availability planner is freaking

483
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,520
awesome I love it plus they have live sessions you can attend they have a

484
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,880
community that is stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members to help you

485
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,680
when you need a little bit of boost and they have live sessions with those Q&A I

486
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,360
really think that's a valuable thing graded server exercises are really great

487
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,960
and then last but not least I gotta say I think those nuggets the name is funny

488
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,280
it's a nugget tasting you put that in some honey mustard West and I'm good to

489
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,840
go good to go honey mustard with I don't care about pink slime um you know what

490
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,320
I'm still here after years and years of pink slime I'm still here but let me

491
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,720
tell you something that's not what nuggets are about Linux Academy kind of

492
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,000
wish they were but are they what no no in fact it's just like you go deep dive

493
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,560
into a particular topic something like you know I don't know an SSH tunnel for

494
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,480
like a few minutes or something really massive for like 60 minutes but it's a

495
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,980
deep dive into a singular topic Linux Academy comm slash unplugged go check it

496
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,240
out it's really great Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and a big thank you

497
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,900
Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program okay now feel free to

498
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,640
let me hear it but yeah am I a am I the biggest hypocrite in the world by

499
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,400
hosting two Linux podcasts a week and then planning for them in slack and I'll

500
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,000
tell you I've gotten a lot of emails because I haven't really talked about it

501
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,200
in Linux action show or Linux unplugged but I have talked about it in kota radio

502
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,480
and in kota radio I've been getting consistent emails about matter most and

503
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,800
other and other alternatives to slack and I I find it interesting that I am

504
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,600
I'm thinking about this at the same time I'm also seeing you know a post from a

505
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,560
lot of different people about slack including this one over at drew dev

506
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,120
vault comm where he says don't use slack it's closed source has only one client

507
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,360
well not really that's not true it's a walled garden requires users to have

508
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,160
different tabs open for each project and requires hacks to do open registration

509
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:47,060
he says go with IRC which I say IRC is not an open source product it is a

510
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:51,240
protocol it does not compete with slack or things like matter most but let me

511
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,360
have it am I a huge hypocrite am I a jerk for hosting the Linux action show

512
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,520
and then using slack to planet I wish I could comment but since I'm helping

513
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:06,720
plan on slack and you use slack for work I do use like for work yeah we I'm torn

514
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:14,400
yeah part of me part of me says yes you gigantic hypocrite you you should be

515
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,240
using other things but the fact is you're using the best tool for the job

516
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:26,800
and for you that tool is the best tool for the job and IRC works and is is

517
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:33,240
relatively robust you know if you we we often have problems can we use IRC a lot

518
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,360
in canonical and we use free node and we have our own internal private IRC server

519
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:44,880
and when one goes down we switch to the other and and then when slack goes down

520
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,340
what do you do you know you'll probably switch to something else will it be IRC

521
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:54,760
or telegram or something else right so I I don't know I I'm torn because I also

522
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,320
use non free stuff I use telegram which open source client but closed back end

523
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,680
so you know I'm in the same position I am pragmatic about these things yeah I

524
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,120
find this to be an interesting trend this developing and I think you could

525
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,080
also say the same thing would apply to Google Docs or office 365 or base camp

526
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:18,880
or Wunderlist or anything really Debbie and shouldn't use Wunderlist to plan

527
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,900
their tasks right anyways it is something this well that's because it's

528
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,920
owned by Microsoft yeah there's that it is and the reason why I brought it up on

529
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,800
Linux unplugged is because it is something that seems to be brewing on

530
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,520
going on in the background and so for my 50 foot view or 500 foot view or

531
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:42,720
whatever you want to call it my my my intention here is sort of like looking

532
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,840
at the landscape looking at slack and saying does this idea of a way for for

533
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,040
group collaboration because we're trying to solve something where you have people

534
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:58,360
all over the world and and the things we work on they absolutely without a doubt

535
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,960
take a week you know every single show from the moment we go off the air

536
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,280
everybody that walks away from the show starts thinking about this next show as

537
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,560
soon as you're done you go oh geez well wow I'm done with I'm done with 117 but

538
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,800
oh my god now I have to do 118 yeah you open the net for the next one right so

539
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,200
slack gives us a place for all of us who are doing that to dump those things when

540
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,680
they come up and plan for the next thing and then we start and we pick up

541
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,520
momentum as that show gets closer and the the the and the reason why it's a

542
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,800
little better than IRC is it allows for additional functionality that's kind of

543
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,760
nice to have and it also gives you something that is very very valuable a

544
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,840
it's set up ready to go right now I just want to start I just want to do a brain

545
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,480
dump I do not want to start setting up software I want to do a brain dump it

546
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,560
gives me that immediately and I think that's important be or to whatever it

547
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,120
has large user adoption kind of like Skype or Google Docs West already had an

548
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,460
account you know rotten corpse already had an account right I don't have a new

549
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,360
client yeah yeah so we have people in the you know we have people are ready to

550
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,240
start right already can just get going without that quote-unquote friction that

551
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,240
was a nice thing to have and then and then you know number three or see

552
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,080
whatever that was really kind of great about slack is it just isolates it it's

553
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,200
it's all of that stuff in one space where IRC now can be dedicated to other

554
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:25,080
things this is dedicated to those things and if I do not as as a person who

555
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,920
sometimes has to be able to step away and have for God's sakes two hours that

556
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,840
don't involve work it is so nice to know that I could open up telegram or I can

557
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,600
open up my IRC client and there will not be 35 questions about work you know if

558
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,840
that if I want to find that I go into slack and so it also gives separation

559
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,040
in space and and the thing is a slack just gives that immediately so the idea

560
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:54,040
was does this concept actually add value as you know as an organizational tool I

561
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,120
think the answer to that is yes slack does seem to demonstrate there's value

562
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,860
there so now my as somebody who is an open source advocate my question is well

563
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,320
now can I replace that functionality with matter most and it can I convince

564
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,360
the team to switch it's not really my job though to make matter most more

565
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,800
competitive now the Jupiter broadcasting team is pretty much ready to switch to

566
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,760
something that is more open than the alternative like we were all using

567
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,520
Viber for a while to do team messaging and as soon as I said you know what

568
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,600
telegram looks like a way better solution and you know the protocols open

569
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,360
the clients open I'm using I'm using you know it totally open the client right

570
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,320
now let's go to telegram everybody switches to telegram immediately even if

571
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,640
it didn't do absolutely everything Viber did like you didn't do stickers all that

572
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,560
stupid crap at the time and added that stuff later and everybody switched so

573
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,160
the Jupiter broadcasting team and probably a lot of open source project

574
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,540
teams are a little more willing to switch before others would so I can

575
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:52,600
probably get matter most set up in a droplet up on digital ocean ready to go

576
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,160
and get say yeah it doesn't do everything slack does yeah sorry it

577
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,520
won't quite integrate with Dropbox yeah you can't write the bot that we wanted

578
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,240
to write but you can move over to matter most and it's gonna be a pretty solid

579
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,320
collaboration tool because we've we bored the idea out without having to spend two

580
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,400
days setting up the server first that's true you've you've said you've already

581
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,520
said that you've switched from IRC to Viber and from Viber to telegram and

582
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,240
now from telegram to slack I wouldn't say switched because they're all with

583
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,040
exception of Viber we did totally replace telegram invite like Viber was

584
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,440
totally replaced by telegram but IRC is still used as a secondary tool like

585
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,520
you're right I doubt you'll make that go away because there's loads of us out

586
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,600
here lurking in the IRC channel unless you know I mean even from like a

587
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,760
production standpoint like we have back we have back-end channels that aren't

588
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,120
public that we're still using right and that's what I mean the kind of people

589
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,800
who sit in those channels are the kind of people who will continue to sit in

590
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,160
those channels but I don't know it seems like you don't have that much of a

591
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,280
problem switching from one system to another and when you said that yeah I

592
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,600
would like was easy because other people were already on it that's just first

593
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,760
mover advantage and the network effect because they were the right yes not IRC

594
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,360
but you know something like IRC communication method matter most is the

595
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,640
free software option so when in the same way that Windows has got first mover

596
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,720
advantage against Linux and then this is the free software advantage you you

597
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,560
should be choosing Linux over Windows in the same way you should choose matter

598
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,560
most over slack I I suppose I see your point there and it means that when

599
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,360
matter most is ready or we're ready wouldn't be it wouldn't be a hard

600
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,800
transition to switch yeah we do have that advantage yeah not everybody does

601
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,760
though right yeah I think the the main to pick away from this is that with

602
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,920
matter most there's a lot more setup issues that you deal with so if you're

603
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,200
just trying to test to see if the the concept of slack or matter most will

604
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,160
work they would make more sense to try out slack first just because it's it's

605
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:01,000
a lot easier barrier to entry if if you re-listen to exactly what rotten just

606
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,120
said and replace what he said about slack and matter most with Windows and

607
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:11,120
Linux where he said you're right yeah said yeah then this is harder to set up

608
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,960
and that's why yeah you're right using slack and and what I think there is

609
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,800
those see myself out now no no I think what the what the answer there is is and

610
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,800
I in Kota radio this week I linked to and it talked a little bit about there

611
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,840
is a guide now that makes setting up a docker container with matter most on a

612
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,480
digital ocean droplet a pretty straightforward process so it's not

613
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,960
it's getting to the point now where if you are a little technically inclined

614
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,600
and you are you are okay spending a few minutes doing stuff you can deploy

615
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:51,280
matter most now and that's up I would bet you five dollars that if you told

616
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,600
one of your minions you wanted to switch to matter most by the time you wake up

617
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,600
and have done your hair in the morning someone will have it running sir how

618
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:07,280
long do you think it takes me to do my hair you know it's funny actually it's

619
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,040
it's funny you say that because so I have a girlfriend and I had to meet her

620
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,040
family right because that's the thing you do and I met her sister and her

621
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,080
sister's like I really like your hair I don't like okay that's awkward but thank

622
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,840
you yeah and she's like does it how long does it take you in the morning I'm

623
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,840
like what and I never stopped and thought about it like do people actually

624
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,280
think it takes me a while to do this look as a guy it does look high

625
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,760
maintenance I really does now poppy what I what I have to assure you is what I

626
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,680
have done is I have routinated and I have I have I have laser factored as any

627
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,880
male would his hair this hairstyle I it is the laziest approach possible it is

628
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,000
so funny like okay here's another story no shit and then we'll move on I the

629
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,960
first like one of the one of the first times I ever like worked with Noah on

630
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,400
location we go to a Denny's and we sit down his wife is there and we're having

631
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,300
dinner and he goes okay so tell me how you do your hair I'm like what tell me

632
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,960
how you do your hair I'm like what are you talking about like I get out of the

633
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,360
shower and then I grab the comb and I like comb it the way I wanted to comb it

634
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,880
and every now and then every now and then I'll put like I have like this this

635
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,960
coconut stuff I'll put in there and that's it that's it I get it from the

636
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,280
grocery store you've completely left out what time you get out of the shower what

637
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,800
time you get out of the bathroom after you've done your hair fantasy aside it

638
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:33,060
is it is literally here's here's here is literally the trick you just do it you

639
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:38,880
do it before it dries so no actually puppy what he left out is that he

640
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,240
conjures black magic yeah right okay all right fine I'll tell you about some

641
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,320
black magic that is a cinnamon 2.8 which was released today and of course you're

642
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,680
gonna see it soon in Linux Mint 17.3 Rosa planned for release at the end of

643
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,560
November it has better sound applets and man I gotta tell you I've been using a

644
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:01,480
boon to matei this weekend it's nice but that looks way better yeah that's

645
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,640
pretty slick I love you would be but it does look really good all right all

646
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,160
right I've got my rhino hijacked so the a lot of nice improvements to this to

647
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,880
version of cinnamon the new workspace switcher is super super slick and it

648
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,400
harkens back to basically what you get from gnome to or a desktop Matei now the

649
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,240
system tray has got a lot of improvements the window list is really

650
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,160
slick with a really nice tightened window thumbnails visual improvements

651
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,760
all throughout including better support for high DPI and they did a little magic

652
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,440
to make sure that if you hook up a 4k television which are notoriously

653
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,080
horrible at telling the operating system what they do much much improved a

654
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,280
support for that including high DPI which is I mean I got to say it again

655
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,280
including high DPI I mean I got to say it again including high DPI I got to say

656
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,880
it one more time high DPI as I have one machine with high DPI and I feel like

657
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:59,200
I'm constantly suffering a couple other things were true to change sorry cinnamon

658
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,200
now supports a microphone mute buttons the cinnamon settings Damon is more

659
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,840
robust than before and x ran or support was significantly improved many bug

660
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,280
fixes were ported from no shell as a matter of fact also speaking of

661
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,400
interesting things imported into the project cinnamon 2.8 also supports qt5

662
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,320
applications which now look more native and use the GTK theme that you've

663
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,360
selected I don't know exactly how that's pulled off but I find it to be fascinating

664
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,600
I'm curious to see what that looks like also performance improvements throughout

665
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,960
now you use mint don't you I'm still using I'm still using mint at work with

666
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,280
the cinnamon desktop and and how many times does the cinnamon desktop crash

667
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,560
mmm very rarely really good good cuz last time I tried it it was and the only

668
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,920
time I've actually had a crash in the past six months was due to a AMD

669
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,920
graphics card issue are you gonna go to the next mint or what are you gonna do

670
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,680
you know I haven't decided that yet I'm kind of looking to see how the next

671
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,880
fedora release comes out oh find out yeah all right so one last desktop

672
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,040
release while on the other end of the low resources desktop LXDE has a big

673
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,800
update LXDE 0.10 is out this release they say they focused on cleanup and

674
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,840
polishing and quality of life improvements with over 400 issues fixed

675
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,840
and dozens dozens of new translations and also gained two new framework solid

676
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:19,760
which replaces lib xqt mount and some custom power management code and lib K

677
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,320
screen which replaces the X render calls and is Wayland forward compatible that's

678
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,640
nice to hear actually I don't know why they didn't put this front and center

679
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,560
because the issue the number one update that I like is their new LXQT pseudo

680
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,560
which makes that like when you launch something and it needs to your your

681
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,560
pseudo password it's much nicer dialogue in this release that would have been in

682
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,520
one of my front center features but yeah that is in this new release as well also

683
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,320
new file manager improvements better support for the trashcan whatever the

684
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,920
hell that is and you get ready for this West search functionality oh good old

685
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,560
search functionality functional geez that one thing that one beer that turned

686
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,900
into two beers has made me all kinds of sloppy but congratulations to LXDE the

687
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:08,800
oh oh this was also this was also really good some other really important new

688
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,280
updates to the new release version 0.10.0 features are ready for this West

689
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:20,240
replaces all instances of LX lowercase X lowercase T so it's L lowercase X

690
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,320
lowercase T but upper L and Q now everything is uppercase they've replaced

691
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,320
all instances with that with LXQ and then a lowercase T that's important for

692
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,480
consistency so so from right so I'm gonna write this down right now so that

693
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,440
way I remember it right now so it's uppercase LX okay Q and then a

694
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,600
lowercase T perfect excellent work at it as of 0.10.0 that is officially the

695
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,680
way you are supposed to say that I don't I don't even know West I don't even know

696
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,680
but I just want to make sure we get there in fact wasn't there also speaking

697
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,720
of feedback before we wrap up feedback there was feedback on how to pronounce

698
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:01,920
Mate speaking of our slack chat and I wimpy can you tell me apparently I've

702
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:32,360
Spanish you know m-a-h-t-a-y yeah I was told the easiest way to remember is it's

00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:37,320
Marte like latte yeah I was told that too but that didn't seem to stick for

704
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,640
some reason damn it I hate that that it's maybe it's

705
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,000
like a used technically you can say it because people pronounce not yerba mate

706
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,840
with a yerba mate as well but Marta is the nor also also I also while I'm

712
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,080

00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,360
Five dollars?

751
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,840

00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,840
Yeah.

756
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,840
Or you know what?

757
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,840
Like less than...

758
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,400
It's actually even less than a burger from Wendy's.

759
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,400
Yep.

760
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,400

762
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,400

763
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,400
Yeah.

764
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,400
That's right.

765
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,400
A terabyte of transfer.

766
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,080
If you go over to DigitalOcean, too, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED right now, and you

767
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,480
won't even have to put in a credit card.

768
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,920
They have a very, very solid interface.

769
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,120
It's really intuitive and easy to use, and you can replicate it on a larger scale with

770
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,280
their straightforward API.

771
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,840
Very intuitive control panel.

772
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,840
I love it.

773
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,920
They've got a brand new data center in Toronto, and they've also just rolled out floating

774
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,920
IPs.

775
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,920
Yeah.

776
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,320
I think this is going to take it up to the next level for them.

777
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,040
This is really going to bring you up to the...

778
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:20,200
Because if you grow, if you're going to need to move things around, this is a no-brainer.

779
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,840
Floating IPs, you can read about it over at DigitalOcean.com.

780
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,280
Plus, I think it's a great strategy.

781
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,840
I mean, I don't really need everything in my life to be high availability, but now that

782
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:32,600
I can, that's going to probably pick up a few more droplets just to have them on standby.

783
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:37,400
If I was doing VC talk and I was down, yeah, we have an on-demand Linux infrastructure

784
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,360
that we just deploy, it servers on demand.

785
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,360
Oh, yeah?

786
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,360
What's your cost on that?

787
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,360
It's pretty low.

788
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,360
It's like $5 a machine.

789
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,360
No!

790
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,800
Yeah, it's like $5 a machine, and then it just goes up to like $10 from there, and sometimes

791
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,800
we even...

792
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,800
You know what?

793
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,720
I've even figured out a way to deploy the machine two months for free.

794
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,720
No!

795
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,920
Yeah, two months for free.

796
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,920
No!

797
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,320
Yes, I use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

798
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,000
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

799
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Go try them out.

800
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,320
They got CoreOS, they got Padora, they got Ubuntu.

801
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,760
They even got FreeBizzle.

802
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,320
I don't know why you'd want to use it as a server, because everybody knows FreeBSD makes

803
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,780
the best desktop out there, so you could try that.

804
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:22,040
But use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, and really, what I would do, screw that CentOS and screw

805
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,760
that Ubuntu, it's between you and me, Wes.

806
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,760
Yep.

807
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,760
CoreOS.

808
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,760
Yep.

809
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,760
CoreOS.

810
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,760
Seriously.

811
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,760
CoreOS.

812
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,760
I'm putting my...

813
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,480
If there was CoreOS stock, I would be buying it right now.

814
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,480
I'm just saying.

815
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,480
But you could do whatever.

816
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:42,040
If you want to do Ubuntu LTS and have five years of patches and have tons of easy access

817
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,480
to tutorials and community, that's fine.

818
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,120
That'd be fine.

819
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,600
You could try that too, DOUNPLUGGED.

820
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:51,400
But I'm just saying, they also have a lot of really good community tutorials.

821
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:57,540
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

822
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,800
the Unplugged program.

823
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,200
All right, Wes, now, you know me.

824
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,960
I'm not like some hardcore advocate about free software.

825
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,320
I don't sit here and tell you that everything must be free and that if you don't make free

826
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,320
software...

827
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,720
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

828
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,600
But I'll tell you, something's got me fired up, real fired up recently.

829
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,760
And I'm not even a driver or an owner of a Volkswagen, but this whole Volkswagen scandal

830
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,760
is ridiculous.

831
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,080
And I want to talk about proprietary software in devices that not only our lives depend

832
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,560
on but are just really integrated in our day-to-day lives.

833
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,320
But first, if you're not familiar with the Volkswagen stuff because all you care about

834
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:37,440
is technology and you're not actually following the news, no judgment, this story, this clip

835
00:58:37,440 --> 00:59:00,520
will bring you up to speed.

836
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,800
So this software, I'm going to stop it right there, this software is specifically designed

837
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:10,760
by Volkswagen that when it is in test mode, it alters the way the engine performs.

838
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:15,400
And when you're not in test mode, nine times of some of the most poisonous types of gases

839
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,760
come out of the tailpipe of these diesel vehicles.

840
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,440
Which causes respiratory problems.

841
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:25,760
In September, emissions cheating was exposed in 11 million other VW cars worldwide.

842
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,840
None of the cars have been recalled in the US and are still safe to drive.

843
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:36,160
The company could owe the EPA billions of dollars in fines, including nearly $400 million

844
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:40,400
associated with the latest batch of cars.

845
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:47,680
The latest batch of cars includes Porsches, Audis, we're talking high-end vehicles.

846
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:55,320
And this has caused the mainstream press like Cars.com and the New York Times and a bunch

847
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:00,320
of others that are running pieces that are basically saying that proprietary software

848
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,320
is the blame.

849
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:06,560
They say outright fraud is possible because of proprietary software.

850
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,680
And I think this is remarkable.

851
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,200
They say it's a bad situation, they get far, far worse.

852
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,840
You throw a perfectly good phone away after two or three years because components goes

853
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,840
bad.

854
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,520
But because the manufacturer refuses to provide parts and code updates, really, as the driver

855
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:26,000
of an old but beloved car that owns its latest 50,000 miles to the abilities of mechanics

856
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,040
who understand the engine's technology, which is a huge, great point, by the way, they go

857
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,520
on to point out that a day is coming when great cars get scrapped because the automaker

858
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:41,040
decided it was time to force me to buy a new one.

859
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,480
This is Andy Inocco writing for Cars.com.

860
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,640
In that same report, you know, he touches on the same thing we were talking about the

861
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:50,980
other week, you know, with Apple users not owning their software, only licensing it.

862
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,960
Here we see that more and more corporate companies, in this case, General Motors, employers have

863
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,480
defended the practice that you don't own the General Motors software in your car.

864
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,480
They do.

865
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,680
You have no right to play with it or tinker it or make sure that it's not polluting more

866
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,680
than you think.

867
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,680
Right.

868
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,120
Nine times more than they say it is.

869
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:10,080
You go in to get it tested, and it's then polluting nine times more than you thought

870
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,080
it was.

871
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,080
You go in to get it tested.

872
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,080
Yep.

873
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,120
I hope they're revising the tests here as well.

874
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,840
Maybe something you stick in the tailpipe while it drives around.

875
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,840
Pronoun.

876
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,920
You had a comment about proprietary software by law.

877
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,920
Go ahead.

878
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,920
Yes.

879
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:31,160
I think some law entity in Europe actually had a law that you have to put proprietary

880
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,400
software on cars so they can't be hacked.

881
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,800
Huh.

882
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:41,560
That is horrible, and obviously this would be an underscoring reason why that would be

883
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,560
a bad idea.

884
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:48,120
Wimpy, what do you have here from the podcast on season eight, episode 34 of the Ubuntu

885
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,120
podcast?

886
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,120
Sorry.

887
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,120
That was the wrong link.

888
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,160
That's the one after that about the Librarian of Congress.

889
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,160
Oh, yes.

890
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,160
Yeah, from the EFF.

891
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,160
Yes.

892
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,160
Actually, this is kind of where it's going.

893
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,360
We kind of touched on this last week.

894
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,360
Yeah.

895
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,360
Good point.

896
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,440
But there's a particular point in there about how this affects car security, research, repair,

897
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,440
and modification.

898
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,880
What did you catch?

899
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,520
That they've recognized the need for vehicle owners to circumvent access restrictions in

900
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,320
order to repair the fine tinker.

901
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,320
Yeah.

902
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:19,280
And one of the things in this VW case is that you're not able to actually determine what

903
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:27,040
the proprietary software is doing or not doing with regard to these test emission levels

904
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:31,480
and how the car is being tuned is because it's DRM protected.

905
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,320
And because of the DMCA, you're not allowed to hack it.

906
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,760
But under this provision, you now are.

907
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,760
This is a big deal.

908
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,760
Yeah.

909
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,760
This is a really big deal.

910
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:47,880
The Library of Congress has extended this DMCA, I guess, exemption to also phones and tablets

911
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,880
too.

912
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,840
And I wonder if this whole Volkswagen catastrophe is partly responsible for this.

913
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,120
It seems to be turning the tide in at least some of the public perception.

914
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:01,000
So here is now, I don't want to be like this guy.

915
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,480
But I just want to put this out there.

916
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,740
So let's be realistic.

917
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,640
The industry is what it is.

918
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,480
It's not going to be Kumbaya, open source, blah, blah, blah.

919
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,880
It's going to be, at best, people reverse engineering and figuring things out.

920
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:20,120
This software, this stuff is literally going to affect our lives.

921
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,560
It is the stuff that runs our cars, the stuff that runs the trains, the stuff that runs

922
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,400
the drones, the stuff that runs all of this.

923
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:35,960
Chris, just imagine for a second if SIZA or TTPIP or the TTP was in full effect.

924
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:41,800
The person that would have found this bug in the Volkswagen software would be going

925
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,800
to jail.

926
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,800
Right.

927
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,680
And, North Ranger, you also kind of wanted to play on the DMCA laws.

928
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,680
Well, yeah.

929
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:55,880
I mean, what Wimpy pointed out with the exemption granted by the US Library of Congress still

930
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,720
doesn't fix, I wouldn't call it a loophole.

931
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,680
It's a big catch with the DMCA is that the Library of Congress exemption only allows

932
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:15,020
individuals to bypass circumvention and things like cars and video games with servers.

933
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:18,920
It's still a criminal act to distribute tools to break those.

934
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,920
Right.

935
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,920
That's a good point.

936
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:25,320
Wimpy actually has a really good point about how this could be a great opportunity to explain

937
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:29,640
it to regular users about why DRM and DMCA stuff is so bad.

938
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,120
Go ahead, Wimpy.

939
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:36,400
Well, you know, normally we associate DRM with content, and if you try and explain why DRM

940
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:42,280
is bad because it protects video or music content to, you know, your friends and family

941
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,960
outside of the open source world, that's a difficult sell.

942
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:52,000
But if you explain this story that the software, automated software, is DRM protected and may

943
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,800
be tuning the car differently for its test cycle than when it's on the road, but nobody

944
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:02,400
can prove that because it's DRM protected, it's a better way to explain why DRM is a

945
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,200
bad thing and we shouldn't have it.

946
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,520
Yeah, boy, isn't that a good point?

947
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,880
And why not having insight into the software is not a good thing.

948
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,880
And I think that is...

949
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,880
Exactly.

950
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,600
Yeah, and I think we are seeing so much, and we have some links in the show notes, we're

951
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,120
seeing a lot of people report on this.

952
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,080
It's kind of encouraging in a way.

953
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,480
I wonder...

954
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,500
So here's my question, Wes.

955
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,500
And is this crazy?

956
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,000
I have a feeling I'm going to say yes.

957
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
All right.

958
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:35,000
As I wait for this stuff to shake out, is it that unreasonable for me to just avoid

959
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,200
all of these things, avoid the automated cars, avoid all of this stuff, and just say, as

960
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,900
a person who is a privacy advocate, as somebody who wants to know how my stuff works, as somebody

961
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:50,120
who wants to have control and oversight, is it reasonable for me to say, I am just not

962
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,400
going to participate for the next few years in this next way?

963
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,520
Is that actually seriously reasonable?

964
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,800
What that would mean would be, I can't buy a car after a certain amount of time.

965
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,320
I was going to say, how are you going to manage this?

966
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,200
So you're going to be stuck with outdated products?

967
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:10,760
So here's why this question fascinates me.

968
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:16,360
It seems like people who are extremely interested in the cutting edge, what's really going to

969
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:23,000
happen next, but very informed on it, are going to have to face the question if they

970
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,300
want to participate.

971
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:29,360
If you know how unreliable software and technology is, you're going to be pretty uncomfortable

972
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,520
with the direction things are going.

973
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:37,120
And you have to ask yourself, am I going to be one of the first in this first generation

974
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,480
who buys into this?

975
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,600
Or am I going to let a generation of products pass me by?

976
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:46,920
Because this is finally getting to the point where now your life is on the line.

977
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,820
I feel like at the end of the day, I'm probably somebody who wants to just take that risk,

978
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:55,480
but is it unreasonable to say, I'm going to let it just pass?

979
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,000
Is that just get off my lawn?

980
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,880
No, I don't think it's unreasonable.

981
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,920
I think it depends on your priorities.

982
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:05,120
You're in a little bit of a tighter spot in that you report on the tech news.

983
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:09,500
But for someone who's not that involved, who doesn't need to have an understanding of the

984
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:14,200
latest and greatest, and maybe doesn't have a lot of workflows they're looking to change,

985
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:18,000
I think that maybe for the next five, 10 years, you can get away with it.

986
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,440
We'll see what it looks like at that point.

987
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,440
Yeah.

988
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,440
Let it play out for a bit.

989
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,520
I feel like you can kind of, I mean, I don't know.

990
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,240
Boy, it is, for me, it seems like it's-

991
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,240
We're definitely coming to that crossroads, though.

992
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:34,040
Yeah, and it seems like if you're an advocate of open source and open standards, this is

993
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,360
not a great time that we're going into for you.

994
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,680
But I hate that to be a downer, so let me tell you about something that makes me feel

995
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,680
really good.

996
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,680
That's my mobile service provider, Ting.

997
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,720
I mean it, too, because Ting is great.

998
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,600
It's mobile that finally puts you in the position of power.

999
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:52,100
If you're so sick and tired of all these different companies running you over and taking advantage

1000
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,580
of you and milking you, check out Ting.

1001
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,840
Go to linux.ting.com.

1002
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,840
You know what I mean, right?

1003
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,840
I sure do.

1004
01:07:58,840 --> 01:07:59,840
Yeah.

1005
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:04,800
Like all of the mobile companies out there, and I have to be honest with you, I am getting

1006
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,480
so freaking burned by some of them.

1007
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:13,700
Even the ones that, I'm the un-carrier, and then let me completely screw up net neutrality

1008
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:14,700
for you.

1009
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:20,280
Let me be the un-carrier and completely usher in the era of where pro services pay to be

1010
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,280
completely unrated.

1011
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:25,280
They're selling the public on it, and then the tech savvy of us are screwed.

1012
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,560
I hate that.

1013
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,800
And then on the other end, you have the duopoly, right?

1014
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,040
On the other end, you have the duopoly, and it is just the worst.

1015
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,600
Ting is mobile, it makes sense.

1016
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,600
Here's why it's great.

1017
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,820
Flat $6 a month, and then you just pay for what you use.

1018
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:39,900
You want three phones?

1019
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,300
It's $6 for each phone.

1020
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,640
It's not a complicated thing.

1021
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,640
And here's the nice thing, too.

1022
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,400
Like, if a couple of those phones aren't gonna get a lot of usage, then they don't cost you

1023
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,400
very much.

1024
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,180
And if you're even, like, I don't know, a tiny bit WiFi savvy, you can really go nuts

1025
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,180
with the savings.

1026
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,160
Three lines, $40 a month.

1027
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,160
That's what I'm paying.

1028
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:59,600
Linux.ting.com, it'll take $25 off your first device, or it'll give you a $25 service credit.

1029
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,840
I want you to try them out and click that savings calculator.

1030
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,000
They got a lot of stuff over at Ting.

1031
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Try them out.

1032
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,240
They got a GSM and CDMA network.

1033
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,020
I think this is a ridiculous deal, though.

1034
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:13,320
The LG G Flex 2, it's got that curve to it, you know?

1035
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,600
I like some curves, Wes.

1036
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,600
Yeah, I do, too.

1037
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:22,280
Yeah, LG Flex 2's got the curves for $237, ships tomorrow, no contract, no early termination

1038
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,280
fee.

1039
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,280
You own that phone.

1040
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:27,240
$6 a month for what you use.

1041
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,480
And then just your usage on it.

1042
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,480
$237!

1043
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,260
And it's like, that's not for, like, a two-year contract.

1044
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:38,920
That's just an unlocked phone that you own, and you pay for what you use.

1045
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,960
They have CDMA and GSM, too, so if you've got a GSM device or a CDMA device, you might

1046
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,080
be able to bring it over to the Ting network, and they have a whole range of devices that'll

1047
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,080
work.

1048
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,080
This is one suggestion.

1049
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:54,120
I'm putting this out there because the LG G Flex 2 is a really nice phone, and for $237

1050
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,120
on the Ting network...

1051
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,120
It's a great value.

1052
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,120
That's a great...

1053
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,120
That's just exactly it.

1054
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,120
That's just a really great value.

1055
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,080
Also, I would say go check out the Ting blog.

1056
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,800
If you've been kind of pondering the idea of what you can get by, do you need a good...

1057
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,440
You want, like, that sweet spot, an Android device that gets updates, decent performance,

1058
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,240
that doesn't cost $600?

1059
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,240
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1060
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,880
Well, they've got a Ting blog by Andrew over there.

1061
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,880
Go to...

1062
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,840
Well, no, go to linux.ting.com and click on the blog.

1063
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,080
That way, we get credit.

1064
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:26,560
He's been trying out the Moto E 2nd Gen for a month and writing about it.

1065
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,840
He's looking for, basically, a sub-$200 perfect Android phone, and he's been blogging about

1066
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:32,840
his experience.

1067
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,840
Linux.ting.com.

1068
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:34,960
Go try him out.

1069
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:35,960
It's mobile.

1070
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:36,960
It really does make sense.

1071
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,440
Linux.ting.com also supports the Unplugged show and keeps us going.

1072
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,360
So a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged, linux.ting.com.

1073
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,360
Go try them out.

1074
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,880
They are on a mission to make mobile make sense.

1075
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,880
Linux.ting.com.

1076
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,880
Thanks, Ting.

1077
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,400
All right.

1078
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,400
So today...

1079
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,400
Do you feel it?

1080
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,400
Do you smell it?

1081
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,400
It's...

1082
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,880
Well, that might be something else.

1083
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,320
No, the other thing you smell is Fedora 23 released today.

1084
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,120
Anybody in the Mumble Room actually have it installed as we speak?

1085
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,520
Is that actually a thing?

1086
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,520
Don't let us down.

1087
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,520
Come on.

1088
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,520
Anybody?

1089
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,520
Anybody?

1090
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,520
Anybody?

1091
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,520
Just one.

1092
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,520
No.

1093
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,520
No.

1094
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,520
No.

1095
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,520
Okay.

1096
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,520
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

1097
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,520
Maybe we just aren't the right crowd.

1098
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,520
No.

1099
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,520
We're not the...

1100
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,520
And we're not talking to the right people.

1101
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,520
These guys in here, they don't like to mess with computers.

1102
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,520
There's all the software you'd want is free and available on the Linux platform.

1103
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,520
But they don't care about that in the Mumble Room.

1104
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,520
Most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux.

1105
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,520
Oh, okay.

1106
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,520
Tyler's...

1107
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,520
Yeah, go ahead.

1108
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:37,160
If it's any consolation, I actually was going to be running it, but I woke up late this

1109
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,160
morning.

1110
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,160
Well, that's fair.

1111
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,160
Tyler in the chat room says he's...

1112
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,160
You know what?

1113
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,160
Fedora, he's...

1114
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,160
Nah.

1115
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,160
That's not his thing.

1116
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,160
He's going for OpenSUSE Leap tomorrow.

1117
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,160
Yeah.

1118
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,720
I can understand that.

1119
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,240
I actually have it downloaded upstairs.

1120
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,280
I was like, well, I'll do the torrent.

1121
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,320
I'm going to help contribute to seeding the Fedora 23 download.

1122
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,400
It downloaded in like, I don't know, 45 seconds.

1123
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,840
It was ridiculously fast.

1124
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,840
I've been also following the RPM Fusion drama.

1125
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,320
Supposedly, RPM Fusion repos are good to go, but the website hasn't been updated, so people

1126
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,440
are super confused at this point.

1127
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:16,840
And also, Fedly isn't updated for Fedora 23, so people are super hurt about that.

1128
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,320
People really depend on those extras.

1129
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,320
Yeah.

1130
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,840
But I'm looking at Fedora 23 Workstation.

1131
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:25,480
I think the thing that jumps out about, to me, is GNOME 3.18.

1132
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,760
I kind of ding some of the other distros, like Leap's coming out tomorrow, shipping

1133
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:29,980
with GNOME 3.16.

1134
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:32,740
That was interesting six months ago.

1135
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:36,160
But in today's time, 3.18 is much more interesting.

1136
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,160
And guess what?

1137
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,520
Fedora 23 ships with that.

1138
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,780
You see, that's the difference.

1139
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:42,520
You see how they do that?

1140
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,080
That's the difference, you guys.

1141
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,080
That's the difference.

1142
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,080
They've actually got the current GNOME.

1143
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,080
I know.

1144
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,080
It's crazy.

1145
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,000
So they've also got, along with that, that means they've got Google Drive support baked

1146
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
into the new files manager.

1147
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,640
Also, the new copy dialog box, which is a total ripoff of the plasma copy dialog box,

1148
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,080
just saying, is also included now in files.

1149
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:06,600
LibreOffice 5 is shipping with Fedora Workstation 23, which is great.

1150
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,320
The new Calendar application, which has been getting worked on for a long time, used to

1151
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,440
be called California.

1152
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:15,800
But now it's just called Calendar because California didn't make any sense.

1153
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,760
And it is now shipping in Fedora Workstation as default.

1154
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,640
The Builder ID also shipping with code autocompletion for Python.

1155
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,640
That's exciting.

1156
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,640
I've been thinking about giving that guy a try.

1157
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,640
It is very nice.

1158
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,200
Also, their markdown support is very nice.

1159
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:35,600
And the biggest feature, which I don't know if I'll be able to try between now and Friday,

1160
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:41,460
but I'll give it a go, is firmware updates via GNOME software.

1161
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,920
Which device are you going to try to brick?

1162
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,240
Yeah, right?

1163
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,240
I think this one.

1164
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,240
The one you're sitting at.

1165
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,240
Oh, yeah.

1166
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,240
Why not?

1167
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,240
Right?

1168
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,240
Yeah.

1169
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,960
Then also, Wayland is rocking in Fedora 23.

1170
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,160
Oh, that sounds really fun to try.

1171
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,800
It's funny because people are like, oh, Fedora 23, hmm, hmm, hmm, online.

1172
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,720
And I'm looking at it going, whatever.

1173
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,080
It's shipping with GNOME 3.18.

1174
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:06,240
It's got the best Wayland support out of the box of any distro.

1175
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,000
And it's looking really tight.

1176
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,040
So I'm looking forward to really giving it a go.

1177
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,480
They produce very nice images, I must say.

1178
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,680
Like their ISOs, they've got the multi-boot all set up very nicely.

1179
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,960
Whenever I get a Fedora ISO, I frequently use it as a kind of a helper toolkit because

1180
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,480
I just know it's going to load on a number of systems.

1181
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,960
And it always looks nice and comes up with a beautiful GNOME desktop.

1182
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,040
I agree with you there.

1183
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,040
I do.

1184
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,040
I do.

1185
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,040
All right.

1186
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:33,080
So before we go on, anybody in the Mumba Room, any thoughts on Fedora 23 before we wrap up

1187
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,080
the show today?

1188
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,080
Going once.

1189
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,280
I'm going to go twice on that.

1190
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:42,200
Hey, by the way, also, just as a point of reference, in the show notes, there's been

1191
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,680
I've noticing in different forms, message threads, things like that.

1192
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:50,300
And in our IRC room, depending on how you upgrade to Fedora 23 from Fedora 22, you're

1193
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,280
having different levels of success.

1194
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:57,600
So I've got the official best methods to upgrade from Fedora 22 to 23 in the show notes.

1195
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,800
Oh, look at how much brighter, prettier 23 looks in that picture.

1196
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,800
Yeah.

1197
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,840
You see what they did is they took 22, they took the same exact thing, but they made it

1198
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,840
darker.

1199
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,840
Yeah.

1200
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,840
You don't want to be on the dark one.

1201
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,120
No, I want to be on the one that they turned the exposure brightness up.

1202
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,120
23.

1203
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,120
That's the good one.

1204
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,680
That's the one that's got the higher exposure setting.

1205
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:21,360
Wes, you have astutely noticed exactly the same exact thing that I noticed when I linked

1206
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,360
to this thing.

1207
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,080
It's like, oh, they're obviously like, this is the dim one.

1208
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,080
It's no good.

1209
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,080
No good.

1210
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,080
No good.

1211
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,080
It's old and busted.

1212
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,440
But what if we are creatures of darkness?

1213
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,960
Ooh, in the night we lurk.

1214
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,040
Many Linux users are also creatures of darkness.

1215
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,040
Yes, this is true.

1216
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,040
That's true.

1217
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,520
Well, hang out in Fedora 22 land for a while.

1218
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,520
All right.

1219
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,040
That brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1220
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,440
Thank you for tuning in on a Tuesday.

1221
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,920
Did you know we did this show on a Tuesday?

1222
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,520
You might be listening on demand.

1223
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,880
You might not have any idea.

That frickin' daylight savings.

1226
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,640
Ugh, it's the worst.

1227
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,640
Hate it, Wes.

1228
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,040
We should just make the calendar UTC only.

1229
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,920
Well, we just automatically adjust to your-

1230
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:00,920
Okay, well that works too.

1231
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,680

Yeah, come be here.

1239
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,240
Right?

1240
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,240
It's a ton of fun.

1241
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,240
Every week.

1242
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,680
How many other podcasts out there are like, yeah, if your mic checks out, you can join

1243

us and just like share your opinion.

1244

You know what?

1245
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,440
Yell at us, tell us we're wrong, don't know what we're talking about.

1246
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,600
Well, I don't love-

1247
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,600
Or come and give us compliments.

1248
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,600
That'd be good too.

1249
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,600
That's what we prefer.

1250
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,600
That'd be good too.

1251
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,600
Whatever.

1252
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,600

1255
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:44,920
Thanks for joining us.

1256
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:45,920
See you back here next Tuesday, everybody.

1257
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,920
Bye, Zeze.

1258
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,920
Bye Zeze.

1259
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:48,920
Bye Zeze.

1260
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,920
Bye Zeze.

1261
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:50,920
Bye Zeze.

1262
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:51,920
Bye Zeze.

1263
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:14,060
Man, that was a lot of show, and Wes will attest.

1264
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,060
What's the appropriate term?

1265
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:16,060
Because I don't want to say balls deep.

1266
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:20,700
I was deep into something before the show started.

1267
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,000
Yeah, you were taking care of business.

1268
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,440
You might say life changing business.

1269
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,280
Yes.

1270
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,100
Before the show started.

1271
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,020
You nailed it, you buttoned it right up,

1272
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:29,860
transitioned right into a perfect show.

1273
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:32,460
And you know what, it's funny because I showed up, Wes,

1274
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:35,480
and I literally today, minutes before we go on air,

1275
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,860
my life is changing.

1276
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,500
And I show up, we do a show.

1277
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,460
Same old, same old.

1278
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,860
Mark shows up, Mark's never been here before.

1279
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,940
Mark shows up, he does a show, right?

1280
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,660
And then I go to JBtitles.com

1281
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,100
and you know what I see, Wes?

1282
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:49,520
14 titles.

1283
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:54,220
I showed up, you showed up, Mark showed up.

1284
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:55,100
Where's the chat room at?

1285
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,220
Where are the titles?

1286
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:57,600
Where's the titles at?

1287
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,020
Absolutely unbelievable.

1288
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:00,860
Unbelievable.

1289
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:03,860
Maybe slacking off is the appropriate title.

1290
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,140
Or at least the meta title.

1291
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:05,980
Wow.

1292
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:10,380
For the chat room, because everybody else showed up,

1293
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,680
everybody else showed up.

1294
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:16,680
You know what, I'm gonna go get a beer.

1295
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,200
I'm gonna grab a beer.

1296
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,200
There goes the no beer rule.

1297
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,500
I'm throwing it out and grabbing a beer.

1298
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,040
That was a stupid rule.

1299
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:22,880
Ouch.

1300
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,920
Oh wait, he can still hear that.

1301
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,040
Wes, I left one beer for you.

1302
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,080
Well, I added some more.

1303
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,320
I saw that.

1304
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,160
You're a good man, Wes.

1305
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,440
You come bearing gifts.

1306
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,140
You gotta grease the JB wheels.

1307
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:35,980
That's true, all right.

1308
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:37,560
How's our join queue doing?

1309
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,100
Boy, still.

1310
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,120
All right, okay, I think Ron's on top of it.

1311
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,320
Awesome, awesome.

1312
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,040
Well, I'm looking forward to chatting with you guys

1313
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:45,880
about Ogg Camp.

1314
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,440
Okay, so let me open up this beer.

1315
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,720
Never did ask Chris which of the Minnesota brews

1316
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:53,960
he liked most.

1317
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,760
Huh, you know, now that I'm looking back at it,

1318
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,040
I don't know if I can pull them all out

1319
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,160
individually anymore.

1320
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,800
I don't know if I recall.

1321
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,000
Actually, they were all really good.

1322
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,440
Yeah, some of them were pretty strong.

1323
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,000
Volkswagen GT9 emissions.

1324
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Curious.

1325
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,320
Sorry about that.

1326
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,400
It's okay, I don't think the mobile room

1327
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,560
could even hear it.

1328
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,640
So, yeah, we did.

1329
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,600
Oh, you did hear that?

1330
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,480
I forget that radio's auto-play

1331
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,000
in the horrible world we live in.

1332
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,460
We can hear everything.

1333
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,160
It's too late, we can hear everything.

1334
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,720
Oh, okay, all right, well that's fine.

1335
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,480
What you got there, Porter Stout IPA?

1336
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,360
I'm not gonna dignify that with an answer.

1337
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,600
Actually, it is a Imperial IPA.

1338
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:39,600
It's a Pyramid Outburst, a dry-hopped Indian pale ale.

1339
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,240
The Pyramid Brewing Company is,

1340
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,720
I believe, in our neck of the woods,

1341
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,160
isn't that correct, Wes, aren't they?

1342
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,460
Yeah, they're from Portland, Oregon, as a matter of fact.

1343
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,280
So this is a beer right out of Portland, Oregon,

1344
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,340
a local beer for us, and I've seen the Pyramid Brewery

1345
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:53,180
before.

1346
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,000
Oh, very nice.

1347
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,840
Yeah, I haven't gone in, but I've seen it before.

1348
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,040
So I'll give it a, and you've already been drinking this.

1349
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:57,880
I have been.

1350
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,040
It's all about the Oregon beers.

1351
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,720
We make the best beers down here.

1352
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,040
Well, I don't know if that's necessarily true.

1353
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,360
You're implying that Washington

1354
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,400
would not make a better beer.

1355
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:12,520
I happen to disagree, but I think we can be beer brethren.

1356
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,360
We can be beer buddies.

1357
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,600
It's brothers in beer.

1358
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,640
Yeah, but you can't beat Washington beer.

1359
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,240
Come on, let's be honest.

1360
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,680
I think Washington beer is some of the best in the nation.

1361
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,880
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

1362
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:23,720
You know what?

1363
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:24,960
I'll take you up on that challenge.

1364
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,320
Give me a beer and I'll go find it for you.

1365
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,760
Well, no, hold on now.

1366
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,840
I would have to defer to your local expertise.

1367
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:32,680
Yeah, true.

1368
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,760
That's the only way to make it fair.

1369
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,000
Yeah, and I feel like, here's the problem is,

1370
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,440
I feel like that question

1371
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,000
literally changes season to season.

1372
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So I would have to go on a all-star brewery tour

1373
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,640
to entertain the current best beer to get it to you.

1374
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,960
So you would be asking me

1375
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,200
to basically go drink a lot of beer.

1376
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,480
This sounds like a whole new show.

1377
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,840
A lot of tasty beer.

1378
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,040
And yeah, so yeah, well, okay, all right.

1379
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,800
Well, we'll see about that.

1380
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,120
That doesn't sound like a problem, Chris.

1381
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:33,120
Yeah.
