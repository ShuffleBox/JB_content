1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Wes, have you seen this Airplane Mode box that you can put your phone in?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,760
I sure have. I don't know about you, Joe, but it's pretty difficult to stay away from my phone,

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,400
even on the best of times. You're relaxing, you're at home, you're trying to have quality time with

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,280
your friends or your family, and yet you're always drawn to the pocket. And that's where there's

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,480
Airplane Mode, which, while it's a unique collaboration, so far it's just a prototype,

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,400
but the designers really wanted to draw your attention to it. It's a concrete surface with

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,720
some space inside for you to set your phone, and you really want to touch it. And as soon as you

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,360
do, you quickly realize that opening the box requires both hands. It's a full sensorial

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,480
experience. It's got a nice leather cradle. It's a special place for one of your mobile devices.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,200
You can put it inside, keep the vessel shut, and then now, next time you want it,

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,320
it's an act of intention and not just being addicted.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,880
It does look like a giant bar of soap, though, doesn't it?

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,280
Oh, you know, I hadn't even thought about that. Yes, it's either a really well-used pumice stone

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
or a big dirty bar of soap.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,480
I don't know about you, but I've got the self-control to just not pick my phone up.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,080
I don't think I need to lock it in a big concrete container.

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,680
Yeah, you know, I don't love the design. I am a little drawn to the intentionality and the idea

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,520
that, well, maybe you have to choose to access your phone, but there is the lower tech solution,

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,600
which is just turn your phone upside down.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:35,520
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 265, for September 4th, 2018.

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's making a huge mess in the studio.

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,000
While the boss is away, my name is Wes.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,880
My name is Joe.

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
Thank you so much for joining me here today, Joe.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,760
Chris is away, but never fear. He can't stop Linux Unplugged.

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
Yeah, we must stop meeting like this.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,720
We must. You know, someday I think we will, and it will be a happy celebratory occasion.

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,800
And, you know, it almost is today because we've got a great show coming up.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,640
We've got tons of community news, both the highs and the lows,

30
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,000
plus an update from the Wild West of mobile Linux operating systems.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,560
Some Google, Microsoft, all those big names, they filter in here, too.

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,960
And of course, the latest drama from some of the muckety-mucks of the Linux kernel.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,640
Plus, some of our picks rounds it out.

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,960
I'm pretty excited, but before we can get to any of that great stuff,

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,240
well, we're going to need some help.

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,800
And I think I know just the crew.

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

38
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,120
Hello.

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,840
Oh, listen to that. It makes my heart sigh with happiness every darn time.

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,960
How are you guys today?

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,280
Awesome.

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,760
Good.

43
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,880
Eating a steak.

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,160
Eating a steak.

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,200
Now you're just not focused here on Linux Unplugged.

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,440
All right.

47
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,080
Well, let's focus on the release of Linux Mint Debian Edition.

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,240
LMDE 3 has been released.

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,280
Yes, it sure has, codenamed Cindy.

50
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,160
Now, if you're not really familiar with Linux Mint Debian Edition,

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
it's just like the regular Linux Mint,

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,080
but instead of having all of its base packages supplied from the Ubuntu distribution,

53
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,160
well, they go back one level further and pull them straight from Debian.

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,360
It's kind of a tracking project to keep the developers' minds at ease knowing that,

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,920
well, if Ubuntu suddenly disappeared, Linux Mint would still have something to stand on.

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,200
I know it was one of the distributions I first started out with.

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,920
You know, obviously Ubuntu was right there at the beginning of my practical Linux career,

58
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
but quickly after I was like, oh, what's this?

59
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,280
What's this distribution that has all the media codecs pre-installed?

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,760
And, you know, I do think Linux Mint does a reasonable job of having that user base in mind.

61
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,960
You can see in the release notes,

62
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,240
they've got just a section of common troubleshooting tips right off the bat.

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,640
So if you're like, oh, my, you know, my DVDs won't play in VLC.

64
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,120
What do I do?

65
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,080
Well, they haven't fixed that, but they've at least thought about it enough

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,600
to have a handy guide right at the same place that you download your ISO.

67
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,480
A thing to keep in mind here, though, is there are no point releases for the Debian Edition.

68
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,400
So you just get a big new rebase on the next Debian base,

69
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
and then you'll get all the latest Linux Mint changes.

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,720
They'll just filter on down to your system.

71
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,800
But this time there's no Mate version then.

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,160
No, there's not, Joe.

73
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,520
And I don't know about you.

74
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,200
I do like Cinnamon, but Mate has always been such a reliable choice.

75
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,360
I wonder what the motivation for leaving it out?

76
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,280
Well, you've got Ubuntu Mate now, of course,

77
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,480
which kind of renders the Mate version of standard Linux Mint a little bit irrelevant.

78
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,440
So maybe it's kind of an acknowledgement of that.

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
You know, I could see that Linux Mint does.

80
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,880
Cinnamon and Linux Mint seemed like they have a definite kinship.

81
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,800
They're, you know, developed in parallel.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,720
I'm not sure if I would go with the Debian Edition over the Ubuntu Edition,

83
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,000
just at the moment.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
But if you're a Debian fan, maybe you don't like all the things

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,960
that Ubuntu layers on top of Ubuntu's philosophy of putting together a distribution.

86
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,680
Well, hey, you've got options, Linux Mint fans.

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,080
Now, I know that you love GNOME.

88
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm not the hugest fan of it,

89
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,360
but you must be pretty hyped for 3.30 that's coming soon.

90
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,640
3.30, I know.

91
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,240
I think we're expecting sometime this week for that to drop.

92
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,440
It'll be dropping this weekend.

93
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,240
Perfect. Okay.

94
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Hey, that's something great to look forward to as we begin everyone getting back to work.

95
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,320
Now that it's almost fall.

96
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,000
And well, if you're getting back to work, maybe you're refreshing some of your systems.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
I would be looking forward to GNOME 3.30.

98
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,120
And you can get a little preview of that by checking out the latest changes coming to

99
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,160
GNOME Tweaks.

100
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,480
Now, if you don't use GNOME Tweaks,

101
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,520
just hearken back to the days before GNOME Tweaks was as good as it was,

102
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,440
or really even available.

103
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,520
And you'll realize that you probably had to go dig way deep into some settings

104
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,080
and config files to make all these handy changes.

105
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,280
Some of the changes that we're seeing is, well,

106
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,400
to start off, there's volume indicators in GNOME 3.30,

107
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
and they can indicate when over amplification is in use.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,400
Now I use over amplification all the time when I'm doing my noise removal.

109
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,240
I have to turn up the volume way loud.

110
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,920
So that would be handy because sometimes I come back having turned it way up,

111
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,600
and that just blows my ears off.

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,960
So if I knew there was this nice red line showing me that,

113
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,400
then yeah, hopefully they can add that to XFCE at some point.

114
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Right? You can get that stuff, you know, it's buried in the ulcer or pulse settings,

115
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,280
but having it right on the desktop really does make a bit of a difference.

116
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,400
Now, there's another new setting here, and that's the sound theme selector.

117
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
Sound themes aren't very popular yet,

118
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,560
but maybe this will help them become just a bit more noticeable.

119
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,800
But you have got sound themes in Ubuntu, haven't you, Popeye?

120
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,720
Maybe. We had someone in the community make a sound theme many, many years ago,

121
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,840
and we removed it. I think they were slowly removed.

122
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,360
Like the one that played a sound when you logged out was removed because it was too long,

123
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,360
because it turned out we could shut the system down before the song finished playing.

124
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,040
And so it was seen, that was a bit daft, leaving it in there.

125
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,600
And then slowly loads of the others have been removed as well.

126
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,440
So most of the sound themes, I think, are removed.

127
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,120
And the only thing you get is like a donk noise when you, you know,

128
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,440
as the terminal bell, and there's not a lot of other noises in there.

129
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,640
That's something, you know, I hadn't, I wasn't too familiar with sound themes

130
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,400
even before researching for this show.

131
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,040
So I'll be, I'll be playing with that in the future.

132
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,720
One more thing I wanted to highlight was that coming up,

133
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,440
we will see possibly center new windows, that option being enabled by default.

134
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,520
And it doesn't sound like much, but actually, I think it's kind of a nice touch.

135
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,160
Seems like it might be going into Ubuntu 18.10.

136
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,720
Or it has been enabled in Ubuntu 18.10, rather.

137
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,120
And that might be a setting I'm gonna have to copy on my custom assembled Gnome desktop.

138
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,640
So it's not all good news this week, unfortunately, is it?

139
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,880
Purism has pushed back the release date of the Librem 5

140
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,560
in a shocking announcement that none of us saw coming.

141
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
No, not ever.

142
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,480
I am still, you know, just a little bit disappointed.

143
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,360
It seems like you've been following this with some interest over there, Joe.

144
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,880
Yeah, I've been following this from the start

145
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,800
because I have wanted a totally free phone to be available,

146
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,320
but I've also wanted it to be good.

147
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,400
And that's kind of the problem.

148
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,960
You know, when you're starting these things off from scratch,

149
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,960
it's very difficult to make something that's going to even

150
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,560
compete with iOS and Android in any way at all.

151
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,000
It's interesting the spin that they put on this, though.

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,960
The kind of official press release announcing this delay until April 2019

153
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,560
is very much kind of laying on how great the idea is

154
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,920
and, you know, how terrible the other alternatives are.

155
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,360
And then it's kind of right at the bottom.

156
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,960
Oh, yeah, and we've slipped a little bit.

157
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,240
And here's a technical blog post for more details.

158
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,360
And it's really that technical blog post that's more interesting

159
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,240
talking about exactly why this delay has happened

160
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,240
because they got this IMX 8 board later than they had planned, basically.

161
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,600
And when they did their testing on it,

162
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,960
it turns out that it wasn't quite up to scratch.

163
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,400
Yeah, and, you know, there really just are.

164
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,320
I think we've seen this from some of the other vendors

165
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
who have attempted to play in this space.

166
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,960
There's just a lot of challenges of making a non-Android-based mobile phone.

167
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Android has such a long and convoluted history,

168
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,000
especially with all the intricacies you see on different systems on a chip

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,280
and all the various blobs and other hardware components

170
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,480
you need to assemble to make sure that it all boots up, can actually run.

171
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,720
And then, as you so wisely put, Joe,

172
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,240
you know, is actually usable at the end of the day.

173
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,880
Yeah, unfortunately, the bugs in this case

174
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,480
meant that it was just going to have terrible battery life

175
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,320
and just it wouldn't go to sleep properly

176
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,760
and use a single core, that sort of thing.

177
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,640
So that's pretty critical.

178
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
And at least they are acknowledging that and saying,

179
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,560
look, we're going to have to delay it

180
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
rather than just forging ahead and making it terrible.

181
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,160
It kind of makes me think that once we finally do get this,

182
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,240
it isn't going to be terrible.

183
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,400
You know, they're putting some thought into this here.

184
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,040
They're making sure that they don't just ship it as soon as they possibly can.

185
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,160
They want it to be good.

186
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
I mean, it's not going to compete with Android and iOS.

187
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,920
There's just no doubt about that, not to start with.

188
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
But it is going to be fully free.

189
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,120
We have to hope that there is that sweet spot of usable enough

190
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,400
and still respecting a lot of the principles and philosophical positions

191
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,280
that I think a lot of the audience here is interested in

192
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,800
and has just not been something that we've really been capable of

193
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,120
barring maybe a few exceptions in the mobile space.

194
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,520
Now, buried in those technical arguments, Joe,

195
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,280
is there any mention of just how long it slipped?

196
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,640
Well, yeah, they say April now.

197
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,360
It was originally going to be January 2019.

198
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,800
Now they're saying April, so pretty much a quarter,

199
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,600
which sounds a bit arbitrary to me.

200
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
I think that we'll be lucky to see it by the middle of next year, really,

201
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,720
because, you know, they kind of had this plan to put it out in January,

202
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,600
and it was all based on a certain number of things happening in a certain order,

203
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,840
getting the development kits and all the rest of it.

204
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,800
And each thing seems to be slipping just that little bit.

205
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,240
So I think, yeah, we'll be lucky if it's before, I don't know, June or July.

206
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm not undecided on if I'm going to double down and keep playing on the Android world.

207
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,000
I see those ever so smug and satisfied iPhone users and wonder,

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,840
maybe in a world where I didn't use my phone for anything but simple phone things,

209
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,040
that could work for me.

210
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,280
There is, though, another option, and that's the Xero phone,

211
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,080
which is a $50 open source smartphone based on the Raspberry Pi Zero.

212
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,400
Yeah, this is a little bit speculative at the moment.

213
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,760
It's not actually available.

214
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,680
It's been announced on CrowdSupply,

215
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,600
and you can kind of put your email address to register your interest.

216
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,760
So who knows when it's actually going to come about?

217
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,040
But it does look pretty cool that it's a very basic phone.

218
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
What do you expect for $50 based on the Raspberry Pi Zero?

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,680
But at least it is something a little bit different,

220
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,360
and potentially that kind of second phone that you just take out

221
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
when you don't really want to take your main phone out.

222
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Yeah, well, there's all kinds of use cases for that,

223
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
even if it's just a backup phone because you smashed yours on a rock.

224
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,400
It's kind of set apart by the things it doesn't have.

225
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,120
No carrier locks, bloated apps, or data mining,

226
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,680
and it doesn't depend on big companies.

227
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,280
Of course, that means you lose out on plenty of other options,

228
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,640
but I know I feel a little insecure when I just have the one phone,

229
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,440
especially given how much you actually need to have.

230
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
You need a phone to just communicate these days.

231
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,280
So, hey, I have a Raspberry Pi Zero hanging around.

232
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,240
Now it looks like I just need a few more supplies.

233
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
Well, you definitely don't want to be using Android

234
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,600
because Google will not patch a flaw

235
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
in any of the other older versions of Android than the current one,

236
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,920
which is pretty serious.

237
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,360
Oh, Google.

238
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,520
This is really exactly the sort of thing that makes people upset

239
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,080
with modern phone and phone operating systems.

240
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,840
Somewhere between all the different systems on a chip,

241
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,280
somewhere between the rapid state of industry change,

242
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,840
and then you have software practices.

243
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,480
And that might be where it gets sometimes the most frustrating,

244
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,000
at least for me, because you've got to imagine that this is possible,

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,640
at least in theory.

246
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,080
It may be that it's not profitable.

247
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,360
It may be that it just is a lot of work to backport these patches.

248
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,280
But come on, we know Google has the resources.

249
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,160
Yeah, it's one thing for the vendors and the OEMs

250
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
to not actually implement the patches,

251
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,320
but for Google to just not put them out there in the first place,

252
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
that's not very good, is it, at all, really?

253
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,840
And to say to people,

254
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,920
hey, here's your solution, upgrade to Android 9 Pie.

255
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,840
What kind of solution is that

256
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,720
when there's billions of people out there using the old versions?

257
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,360
Yeah, I mean, it's not even really possible for anyone

258
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,920
apart from those who use the Pixel devices,

259
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,560
or if you're lucky enough that your manufacturer actually goes

260
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,520
and updates whatever modified version they've based it on.

261
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,440
Maybe you go install your own operating system,

262
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,760
but you're pretty much a special case there.

263
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,840
And what worries me is that there's going to be,

264
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,960
you know, there's a lot of consumers

265
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,640
who don't need the newest and greatest,

266
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,800
and they have, some of my family members,

267
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,960
they have the original Nexus 5.

268
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,360
And while it's not fast and it doesn't have a lot of storage

269
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
and the camera's not so great,

270
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,960
it really does just work for them.

271
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,760
But I worry knowing that they're on an unsupported platform

272
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
that won't get security updates.

273
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,080
And it's shocking that, you know, Android 9 just came out

274
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,360
and that we're already in a world

275
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,920
where anything else isn't secure.

276
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,960
I don't like it.

277
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,760
Yeah, I don't like it.

278
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,600
But I like that you called me a special case, Wes,

279
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,920
because, you know, I run Lineage on my phone,

280
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,440
and my wife runs Lineage on her Nexus 5.

281
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
So yeah, we're both special cases.

282
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,080
I'm going to tell her that.

283
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,600
Oh, how does the Lineage run on the Nexus 5?

284
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,800
Has she been happy with that?

285
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,040
Yeah, she's been very happy with it.

286
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,960
The camera on that phone isn't great,

287
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,320
and that's the only thing she doesn't like.

288
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,600
But yeah, I keep trying to tell her to get,

289
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,440
you know, trying to convince her to get a better phone

290
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,560
just so I've got something to play with.

291
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,400
But she says, no, I don't need to.

292
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:34,800
It's fine.

293
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,400
I've got security updates.

294
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,240
It's working fine for what I need it for.

295
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,800
It's small.

296
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,640
The only phones you can get now are giant.

297
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,720
So yeah, she's perfectly happy with it.

298
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,960
I mean, it's not the quickest phone in the world.

299
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,560
It's, you know, how many years old is that now?

300
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,080
It must be five years old or something.

301
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,480
Yeah.

302
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,280
But yeah, with Lineage, she's got the very latest updates.

303
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,280
So yeah, she's happy.

304
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,960
I am glad to hear it.

305
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,800
Is there anyone in the mumble room

306
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
who's really an avid Android user?

307
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,760
Are we all just sort of accepting what we get

308
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,880
from the big upstreams?

309
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,200
How many people are, you know, rooting their phones,

310
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,680
actually installing different operating systems?

311
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,160
I did.

312
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,080
I've got a few Android phones near me.

313
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,080
And obviously, I used to run Ubuntu Touch on some.

314
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,120
Right, yeah.

315
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,480
But my main phone is OnePlus 3T.

316
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
And I did try Lineage on it,

317
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,720
but I found it a lot slower than the stock ROM

318
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,600
I got from OnePlus.

319
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,640
So I wiped it and reverted back to Oxygen,

320
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,840
which means I don't get the firehose of updates

321
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,680
that Joe gets on his.

322
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,480
But I get security updates at some point, sometimes.

323
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,400
So I'm happy enough with that.

324
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,360
Yeah, occasionally.

325
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,960
Yeah, now and then I get an update

326
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,080
and that's good enough for me.

327
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,160
Which aspects were slow then, particularly?

328
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,960
Whole thing.

329
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,480
The UI was laggy.

330
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,920
It was really slow.

331
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
You know that thing you do

332
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,760
whenever someone hands you their phone

333
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,040
or you grab somebody else's phone,

334
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,560
the first thing you do is swipe left and right,

335
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,920
swipe up and down on the app screen

336
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,200
to see how it feels, right?

337
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,360
Because you don't want to dive into their applications

338
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,840
and start using stuff and seeing their data

339
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,800
if you're the kind of person

340
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,400
who lets someone else use your phone.

341
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,160
But that's all you need to do with Lineage on the OnePlus 3T.

342
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,480
If you compare it side by side with Oxygen,

343
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,040
I found it really laggy and slow.

344
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,680
That's interesting because I've never had the stock ROM on mine.

345
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,280
It's always been just Lineage from day one.

346
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,200
So I've never experienced it.

347
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,560
You poor, poor child.

348
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,360
You poor thing.

349
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,840
I know, but for me it's perfectly fast

350
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,920
with an AWD or ADW launcher on it

351
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,280
and I turn off the animations.

352
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,960
I've never noticed it slow down really.

353
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,880
Next time we're in the same physical location,

354
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,160
we'll put our phones side by side

355
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,200
and try them out with some benchmarky type stuff

356
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,160
like human perception and we'll see.

357
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,720
Maybe it's just my perception and I'm biased,

358
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,480
but yeah, it felt like it.

359
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,200
But I do use Lineage on the OnePlus X.

360
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,360
The tablet thing, what's it called?

361
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,600
Nexus 7 2013 and a couple other devices.

362
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,680
Don't be going, oh Wes, I've got one of those as well.

363
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,720
I use that regularly.

364
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,280
No, it was an ooh of impressed.

365
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,120
You've been 2013 is right in the name

366
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,000
and five years, that's some support.

367
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,400
That's my zombie apocalypse tablet.

368
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,960
It's got a lot of eBooks and how to start fires,

369
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,480
how to generate electricity and all that kind of stuff.

370
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,440
Survival books on it.

371
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,280
Do you have extra shotgun shells just sort of

372
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,760
in the case there for that situation?

373
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,680
On advice of my legal team,

374
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,360
I am not going to respond to that.

375
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,040
Well, one thing that I do is flash Google Apps on it,

376
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,360
Open G Apps Pico, which gives me just enough

377
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,400
to get the Play Store running.

378
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,680
But now I'm kind of regretting that given that

379
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,560
Android collects 10 times more data than iOS,

380
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,240
at least according to a recent study.

381
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,040
Yeah, the paper titled Google Data Collection

382
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,480
from Douglas C. Schmidt, a computer science professor

383
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,320
at Vanderbilt University.

384
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,720
Well, it arrives at some stark conclusions regarding

385
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,440
just how much data Google is sucking up

386
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,160
from all of those handsets out there.

387
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,080
Among several findings, the experiments found

388
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,640
an idle Android phone with the Chrome web browser

389
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,440
active in the background, communicated location information

390
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,320
to Google 340 times during a 24 hour period.

391
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,240
Now, of course, they ran the same experiment

392
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,120
on iOS with Safari.

393
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Google could not collect any appreciable data

394
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,720
unless the user was actually interacting with the device.

395
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,040
That's kind of a contrast right there.

396
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,880
Well, it's not hugely surprising that Google

397
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,160
couldn't collect the data, but even just the sheer number

398
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,760
of pings back home were lower on iOS as well,

399
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
which is not altogether surprising, is it?

400
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,920
Given that you've got two completely different

401
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,680
business models, you've got Google's business model,

402
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,960
which is collect all the data, sell all the adverts.

403
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,920
Whereas Apple is just sell the product for five times

404
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,800
what we build it for, probably 10 times.

405
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,720
You know, they just sell expensive stuff.

406
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,600
That's their business model.

407
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,200
And then they sell you content to watch on it.

408
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,400
So it's not a surprise at all.

409
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,280
I don't think anyone was surprised reading this story.

410
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,560
No, I don't think so.

411
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,280
It was interesting, some of the deeper findings they had.

412
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,440
Of course, there's just the actual frequency

413
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,400
of data transmission.

414
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,040
But the research also turned up some of the ways

415
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,200
that Google could potentially tie together

416
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,440
anonymous data collected through passive means

417
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,400
and correlate that with personal information.

418
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,040
And of course, that's what advertisers want, right?

419
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,600
They want, you have all of these sort of statistics

420
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,440
and numbers that flow through from user actions

421
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,720
and you want to piece those together

422
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,800
so that you can actually sell that information

423
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,400
as something useful.

424
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,720
As an example, on an Android device,

425
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,200
so-called anonymous advertising identifiers

426
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,120
that collect activity data on apps

427
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,880
and third-party web page visits,

428
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,000
well, that can get associated

429
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,240
with the user's real Google identity

430
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,200
by the passing of device-level identification information

431
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,760
right back to Google services.

432
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,520
And well, that same thing goes

433
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,520
for the supposedly user-anonymous DoubleClick Cookie ID.

434
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,160
It is kind of upsetting that just by default

435
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,680
when you choose this platform,

436
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,520
especially the platform that's based on the technology

437
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,240
that, well, we're all here to talk about today,

438
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,520
you end up with all of these other implications

439
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,240
and you kind of end up at a crossroads

440
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,120
where you have to choose between,

441
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
well, do I care about nominal open-sourceness,

442
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,080
that sort of those arguments that I want a phone

443
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,360
that at least is somewhat open-source

444
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,640
that runs on technologies,

445
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,120
someone can audit that I can understand,

446
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,520
or do I care more about my internet privacy,

447
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,400
about my interactions

448
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,720
and about all of my personal information?

449
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,360
You would hope, and oftentimes those align,

450
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
not in today's mobile phone market.

451
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,440
No, I'm just going to get one of those airplane mode boxes,

452
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,280
stick my phone in it and move into the woods, Wes.

453
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,160
It's the only answer.

454
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,560
Yeah, you know, I mean, maybe you can do this RMS style

455
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,320
and sort of just collect all your stuff,

456
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,280
do it offline and then send it up occasionally

457
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,720
or get some sort of personal assistant

458
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,320
who can do all of your tweeting for you.

459
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,920
They'll scrape the Linux news

460
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,160
and tell you what to say for your shows.

461
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,440
That sounds a lot easier.

462
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,960
That does sound a lot easier, yeah.

463
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,920
Let's get on that.

464
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,040
Well, okay, if you're going to get a personal assistant, Joe,

465
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,800
I think you'll probably need to set them up

466
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,680
with some equipment

467
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,240
and you're probably not going to give up your machines

468
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,320
even if you're not using them anymore.

469
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,840
Have you considered a potential Chromebook?

470
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,120
I don't know, Wes, I don't know.

471
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,200
I don't like any more Google in my life,

472
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
but this Ars Technica article that you found

473
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,120
about $600 Chromebooks being dangerous to Microsoft,

474
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,240
that sounds good to me.

475
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,360
Oh, not a Microsoft fan, are we, Joe?

476
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,680
Come on, who here likes Microsoft?

477
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,640
Okay, yeah, that's fair.

478
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
You know, I think here at Linux Unplugged

479
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,600
we have been trying to say it is a new Microsoft.

480
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,040
Now what that means, that's up to the audience to decide.

481
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,760
But there is this added complication.

482
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,280
This article in particular is highlighting

483
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,000
Lenovo's new $600 Yoga Chromebook,

484
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,360
which, well, as they say,

485
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,280
brings high-end styling and materials

486
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,640
to the Chromebook space,

487
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,560
along with, you know, well-specced internals

488
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,680
and a high-quality screen.

489
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,120
Also, there's Dell's $600 Inspiron Chromebook 14,

490
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,280
slightly lower specs, but it's a similar offering

491
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,600
with better styling, bigger, better quality screens,

492
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
and, well, superior specs

493
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,440
to a lot of the other Chromebooks out there.

494
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,360
Yeah, we're talking mid-range here, aren't we?

495
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,320
We're not talking XPS quality and price,

496
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,840
and we're not talking about terrible, cheap Chromebook.

497
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,440
We're talking about that middle range

498
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,960
that appeals to not kids, but kind of college students

499
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,760
and people kind of just out of college or whatever.

500
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,600
And it is Google's play against Microsoft,

501
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,320
potentially, to try and get people

502
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,760
onto the Chrome OS platform

503
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,120
using all the Google services,

504
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,400
get tied into things like Drive and Docs and everything,

505
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,680
and then hopefully push Microsoft off their perch

506
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,840
at the top of that market.

507
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,040
Microsoft has obviously been

508
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,120
sort of the assumed solution for this,

509
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,160
and in some ways it feels like

510
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
we're watching the Chromebook world grow up.

511
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,240
You know, it started off with these really cheap machines

512
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,000
for schools and for educational use

513
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and young kids using them,

514
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,280
and now that some of those people

515
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,600
that have been using them, they get older,

516
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,240
they're familiar with the Chrome OS interface already,

517
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
and at the same time, Chrome OS is just becoming

518
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,360
more and more capable of real workloads.

519
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,160
So the Lenovo people, they're excited about this.

520
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,560
They say that this new Chromebook was developed

521
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,400
because the company was seeing demand for Chromebooks

522
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,520
from users with a bit more disposable income,

523
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,400
college graduates, people from upper-class families

524
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,080
that could afford a nicer machine.

525
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,880
That's a lot of the space where you kind of see,

526
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,360
especially for people that aren't computer enthusiasts,

527
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,520
just, you know, an average midline Dell HP laptop

528
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,680
that, of course, they've got that Microsoft Windows deal.

529
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,800
That's going to come preinstalled.

530
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,560
You've got the latest and greatest Microsoft products.

531
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,040
You'll probably get some sort of preinstalled office suite

532
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,080
that you'll start using.

533
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,200
With the Chromebook's advantage of already being in schools

534
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,320
and having all the sorts of user management

535
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,600
and child permission controls

536
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,360
that maybe you have to know what you're doing

537
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
on maybe an open-source solution,

538
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,280
seems pretty competitive.

539
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,440
This seems to be mostly in America, though, doesn't it?

540
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,720
This push into education.

541
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,840
Poppy, you've got kids.

542
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,640
Do they ever use Chromebooks at school,

543
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,000
or is it all just Windows?

544
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,840
Never seen a Chromebook in the kids' school,

545
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,760
but I do know the school that one of them

546
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,680
is going to starting tomorrow.

547
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,160
They get given iPads,

548
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
so that's a different thing altogether,

549
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,800
which should be interesting.

550
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,680
Well, that's really where the competition is these days,

551
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,720
isn't it, in education?

552
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,000
Windows and, you know, Microsoft,

553
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,440
I get the feeling are kind of slipping a little bit,

554
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,560
and it's really between Chromebooks and iPads, isn't it?

555
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,080
Possibly.

556
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,400
Ask me again in a month or two when I've seen what they get.

557
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,920
Yeah.

558
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Oh, yeah, it is just that back-to-school season.

559
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,120
That's a funny angle.

560
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,560
You know, I always think about what I'm going to get

561
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,600
for the latest things,

562
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,400
but, of course, kids need supplies too.

563
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
Yeah, and Google is really trying to hook them

564
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,680
while they're young.

565
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,240
That's why they got into the whole education market.

566
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
I mean, Microsoft did it 20 years earlier, didn't they?

567
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,760
Yes, absolutely.

568
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,800
I wonder where this leaves some of the, you know,

569
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,640
if you've got iPads, but where do you go?

570
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,520
I guess you can go to the desktop Mac OS experience,

571
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,680
but between some of the newer lower-end Windows devices

572
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,600
and then more functional Chromebooks,

573
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,760
it's just a lot easier to get started with.

574
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
And then if you can, you know, maybe you go up,

575
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,360
you start, you learn about Linux.

576
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,680
One of these kids could be just using the Windows subsystem,

577
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,080
or they could be running their Linux app on Chrome OS.

578
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,440
And does that mean, do they ever make it off those platforms?

579
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,960
Or is it just too easy these days?

580
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,880
You use a combination of web apps,

581
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,800
you've got Linux there if you need it,

582
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,400
you've got some native apps maybe.

583
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,760
Are you ever going to need to install Ubuntu for real?

584
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,800
Well, that's a good question.

585
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,160
Probably hoping that people will keep installing that.

586
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,320
And I think that they will.

587
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,000
It's going nowhere on the server, is it?

588
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,200
And that's the thing that people,

589
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,280
as they get more into technology and realize that

590
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,360
everything in the world runs on Linux,

591
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,840
runs on Linux pretty much server-wise,

592
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,600
they then realize, well, hang on,

593
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
it's so robust and solid on the server,

594
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,000
maybe it's worth a try on the desktop.

595
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,520
And I don't know if these, you know,

596
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,960
the subsystem and the Linux apps on Chrome OS

597
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,120
are really going to do it justice.

598
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,560
And hopefully, I think it's only going to be a percent,

599
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,680
put it this way, you know,

600
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,360
it's not going to be everyone who gets into development.

601
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,920
I'm sure that some of them will be absolutely fine

602
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,600
with the subsystem.

603
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,520
But it only takes a small percent to make a big difference.

604
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,600
And so that's my hope.

605
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,680
I don't know, that's my positive spin on it.

606
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:31,920
Right.

607
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,640
And maybe one way to look at it too is that

608
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,200
if it's easier to become familiar with those technologies,

609
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,120
then the draw will be immediate, right?

610
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
You can start playing around in a terminal,

611
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,760
getting a feeling for the real Linux environment.

612
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,160
And then when you're ready, go full bore.

613
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,440
Now, of course, what have we all been talking about right here?

614
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,920
Um, it always sneaks into the discussion somehow.

615
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,760
I don't know, it must be in the name of the show.

616
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,200
But yes, of course, that's the Linux kernel.

617
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,560
And well, there's been some, I don't know,

618
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,680
I'm not going to call it drama,

619
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,560
but there's been some news around some of the remarks

620
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,520
from two of the top people associated with that kernel.

621
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,160
And of course, that would be Linus and his right hand man,

622
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,520
Greg K. H.

623
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,760
Over at the recent open source summit in North America,

624
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,080
Greg warned some attendees about the severe impact that,

625
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,200
of course, we've all been talking about,

626
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,960
which has been Meltdown and Spectre,

627
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,120
the CPU vulnerabilities that have been flagging

628
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,680
modern out of order processors for the better part of 2018.

629
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,640
Really, what's at issue here is responsible disclosure.

630
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,440
And how does that work, especially in a world dominated

631
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,280
by large enterprise distributions and, you know,

632
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,480
two, three, four main hardware providers?

633
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,560
How does open source fit into that picture?

634
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,360
Well, to give an idea, Jan Horn discovered

635
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,720
the first of these issues way back in July, 2017.

636
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,720
And it wasn't until October that some of the kernel community

637
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,400
were starting to hear rumors of the flop.

638
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,680
That's not disclosure of the flop,

639
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,160
that's rumors of the flop.

640
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,520
That's a long time, especially as, you know,

641
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,720
in the same vein, other very large operating system vendors

642
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,880
had already heard the news and really,

643
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,040
it only filtered down to the Linux kernel.

644
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,960
It only filtered down to the Linux community

645
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,720
because some of those vendors told Intel

646
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,000
to just get off their butts and tell people about it.

647
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, I remember around Christmas time,

648
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,440
the register put it together, I think,

649
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
with the various bits of evidence that they had,

650
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,080
and that basically forced the disclosure.

651
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
And then there was a huge scramble

652
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,120
with the various Linux distros and the other OS vendors

653
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,400
to get the patches together.

654
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,960
And by all accounts, it absolutely ruined

655
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
the Christmas holidays and New Year time

656
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,760
for a lot of people in those companies.

657
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,720
Yeah, right, they siloed Zeus, they siloed Red Hat,

658
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,520
they siloed Canonical, they never even told Oracle,

659
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,040
and they wouldn't let anyone talk to each other.

660
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,320
And, you know, normally, of course,

661
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,400
you get all the people together, you start talking,

662
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,840
everyone has different resources.

663
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,240
Each company and contributors can pick and choose

664
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,320
the people that know the most about these subsystems,

665
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,080
who has time, who has energy to do this,

666
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,840
group them all together, form a war room,

667
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,600
and actually get stuff patched.

668
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,360
And of course, when it's a security vulnerability,

669
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,920
you want to get that patched as fast as you can.

670
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,040
So really, this process that happened this time around,

671
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,960
it just isn't good enough.

672
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,720
But thankfully, lessons were learned from that.

673
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,800
And both Greg and Linus have said that,

674
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,320
you know, things are a lot better now.

675
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,520
Now they've got back channels to Intel

676
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,680
and, you know, they can all talk to each other.

677
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,280
And you've even got the Windows people

678
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,240
and the Linux people talking together

679
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,200
and working together, which would have just never happened

680
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,240
five or 10 years ago.

681
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,040
So it's almost like the silver lining

682
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,920
of this terrible, terrible cloud of speculative execution

683
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,800
is that we've got people working together

684
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,480
that wouldn't have otherwise.

685
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,640
I was pretty impressed when I read that, Joe.

686
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,520
I will be honest.

687
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,040
Add that to the bucket of, hey, it's a new Microsoft.

688
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,240
But it also makes sense, right?

689
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,320
I mean, largely what they're trying to do,

690
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,600
build operating systems to run on top of Intel's hardware

691
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,320
or, you know, x86 hardware or whatever,

692
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,480
that's the same job.

693
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,400
And it would make sense where appropriate

694
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,280
to share resources, share insights and share knowledge,

695
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,880
especially because as we've seen,

696
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,920
a lot of these speculative execution attacks are complicated.

697
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,160
And especially when they first released,

698
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,000
this was a new type of vulnerability

699
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,240
that no one really understood very well

700
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,280
and is really ingrained in the core parts

701
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,920
of how modern out of order processing happens

702
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,160
and some very clever attacks therein.

703
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,440
And of course, you have to remember that these attacks,

704
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,680
although they do render client machines,

705
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,280
desktops kind of vulnerable,

706
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,880
really the biggest problems are on servers

707
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,880
and especially with virtualization.

708
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,040
And that's a huge part of Microsoft's business now

709
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,240
is virtualization and a lot of it's running Linux.

710
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,760
Microsoft loves the Linux and all that.

711
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,480
So, you know, it's not a surprise

712
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,680
that they are now working with the Linux community on this

713
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,560
because they're working with them.

714
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,480
You know, look what they're doing with Canonical

715
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,760
to get the subsystem into the Windows desktop.

716
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,960
We're seeing a lot more cross-pollination here.

717
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,880
And it's, you know, a cynical person might say

718
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,800
that it's Microsoft trying to, you know,

719
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,560
embrace extend and extinguish.

720
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,240
But I always say this, it's about them making money.

721
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,440
They're just following the money

722
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
and the money's in Linux out of source.

723
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,440
And that's why they're getting into that.

724
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,040
This all makes me curious.

725
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,640
Okay, so maybe it's as we've heard today.

726
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,240
Maybe Intel's learned a lesson from this.

727
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,360
They're gonna do better next time

728
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,480
and I'm sure there will be a next time sooner rather than later.

729
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,240
That's all well and good.

730
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,480
But what happens when AMD, you know,

731
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,880
Ryzen really takes off, AMD is the dominant

732
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,640
or Intel just can never compete.

733
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,960
Mobile operating systems become the norm.

734
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,640
And, you know, we're dealing with Taiwanese semiconductor.

735
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,920
Is this gonna be a battle we have to keep fighting

736
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,480
as one dominant or several dominant companies?

737
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,160
Come into play, fade away.

738
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,400
I imagine that a lot of these open source communities

739
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,000
will last a good bit longer or have that kind of staying power.

740
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,760
So are these constant battles?

741
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,480
Or can we actually reach a cultural norm

742
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,240
where people understand how to make this work

743
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,280
and understand and can navigate the complex relationships?

744
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,600
Well, there's one obvious answer to all of this

745
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,200
and that is to go to RISC-V, a properly open instruction set

746
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,800
rather than having to rely on Intel and AMD and ARM

747
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,880
where there's all sorts of things going on

748
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,640
that we just don't understand, you know.

749
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,640
The future has to be something.

750
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,440
If it's not RISC-V, it has to be something similar, doesn't it?

751
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,960
It does seem to be that way.

752
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,520
We are obviously running against physical limits

753
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,800
in our current architectures.

754
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,480
And a lot of these difficulties are a result

755
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,240
of just how darn complicated everything that we do these days are.

756
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,600
We haven't, you know, x86 has a lot of legacy built in,

757
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,080
even though we're all really running, you know,

758
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,600
the more modern 64 variant, there's still a lot going on.

759
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,160
We have this, this CISC architecture architectures

760
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,240
on top of really like a RISC core, complicated firmwares.

761
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,800
We were just talking about it in a recent episode of this show,

762
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,360
the complicated licenses that go around that.

763
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,640
If you could start with something a little more peer, right?

764
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,280
Yeah, something like RISC-V, something where you've got an open foundation,

765
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,960
you can pick a retailer or a foundry that can make that hardware for you

766
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,720
that you choose and then you can take the open source operating system

767
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,240
you want to run on top of it.

768
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,480
You're getting me excited and also really upset

769
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,560
because I can't really do that right now.

770
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,760
And you can't even trust your operating system and processor together

771
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,960
to give you truly random numbers, can you? Or can you?

772
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,360
Or can you? You know, that's a good question.

773
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,240
We've seen a lot of controversy about this over the years.

774
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,280
Way back in 2013, you may remember there was calls on the mailing list

775
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,560
to ditch Intel's RD-RAND instruction,

776
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,640
which can be used to help provide secure sources of random numbers.

777
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,120
And, you know, there was a lot of pushback then.

778
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,040
There was a lot of saying, like, well, can we really trust this?

779
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,480
We don't know what's going on.

780
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,800
At the time, the kernel community really was saying that,

781
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,640
well, we already use multiple sources of input.

782
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,440
We mix them together in a secure and trustworthy way.

783
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,600
So you really, you just shouldn't have to worry about this.

784
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,680
But of course, when there's big corporations involved

785
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,680
and black boxed microcode, I can understand why you'd be suspicious.

786
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,400
So this week, we have some news.

787
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,920
Linux kernel version 419 RC1, which was just published,

788
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,520
allows those building their own kernel to choose whether or not

789
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,640
to trust particular CPU hardware run random number generation.

790
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,400
Now, of course, when random number generation is insufficiently random,

791
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,800
everything you do on a computer that relies on that core source of entropy,

792
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,000
it's just, it's not really going to work.

793
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,280
One solution to this has been having external hardware

794
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,480
sources of randomness.

795
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,440
You have hardware keys.

796
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,400
You have things scavenged from radioactive decay.

797
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,200
There's all sorts of techniques to get around this, right?

798
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,000
Cloudflare has a wall of lava lamps at their headquarters

799
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,160
where they use cameras to sample the lava lamp state

800
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,800
and use that as a source of random numbers.

801
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,160
These days, hardware manufacturers have gotten wind that people want this,

802
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,080
and they've been building it in.

803
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,360
That makes a rather complicated trust arrangement.

804
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,080
Yeah, do you trust the likes of Intel?

805
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,680
Not necessarily to not be nefarious, but just to not be incompetent.

806
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,480
I mean, look what they did with speculative execution.

807
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,320
That wasn't them deliberately doing that.

808
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,960
That was just them not stopping to think about it.

809
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,160
And so if they can't get that right, then why should I trust that they're going

810
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,400
to get the random number generation right?

811
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,640
I like how this was described.

812
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,280
There's a recent patch, and it's determined that it's been punting

813
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,240
the controversy into the laps of Linux distributions and kernel builders.

814
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,760
If enabled, the random trust CPU flag prevents the kernel's get random system call

815
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,200
from blocking the boot process in order to accumulate enough entropy.

816
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,720
This, you know, that can hasten the boot process, which has some benefits,

817
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,360
but obviously that makes it so that you have less certainty in your cryptographic strength.

818
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,520
Now, this setting would apply not only to that RD rand instruction

819
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,800
that we talked about before, but also RD seed, which works for both Intel and AMD chips,

820
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,680
as well as random number generators that are built into some of the other

821
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,320
built into some of IBM's power PC chips.

822
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,560
But at what point do you just stop worrying and just get on with it?

823
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,040
You know, do you spend your entire life just paranoid about these things?

824
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,160
And, you know, is it providing enough entropy?

825
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,960
And, you know, at the end of the day, does anyone care enough to attack you?

826
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,640
And, you know, that's not a great attitude to have from a security point of view.

827
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,960
Obviously, you want things to be as secure as possible, but you always have to weigh up

828
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,240
that choice, don't you, between usability and security.

829
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,920
And, you know, what other choice do you have but to trust these hardware vendors, really?

830
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,040
Unfortunately, at least for individual users, really not much of a choice.

831
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,760
Now, maybe if you're a big vendor or a big manufacturer or one of those big Internet

832
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,440
companies, you might have more say in this.

833
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,080
You might have the ability to fabricate some of your own hardware.

834
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,400
But I can see it being a prudent choice for the kernel developers because

835
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,080
it just gets them out of the decision.

836
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:14,480
I imagine a lot of distributions will just ship this same as it has ever been and not

837
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,280
enabled.

838
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,200
But, you know, who's to say?

839
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,360
And if you are a purist, you have that option.

840
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,200
I, for one, well, I'm not doing anything secure enough to really care.

841
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,040
And I already have so much implicit trust in every company that plays a part in manufacturing

842
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,760
anything that runs on all of my computing devices.

843
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,040
There's not a lot of gain.

844
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,720
But, hey, it's cool.

845
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,960
It's a small patch set, which I was pretty impressed with.

846
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,920
So that makes me think at least this is a good it's a good framework.

847
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,240
It's a good idea that you have options.

848
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,680
They might not even be practical options.

849
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,680
But if it makes it a more usable kernel for everyone, even if I'm not going to use it,

850
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,200
well, I support the idea.

851
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,440
Yeah.

852
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,440
And even if you can't trust your CPU hardware, you basically can't trust any of the other

853
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,080
hardware, can you?

854
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,040
It's all got firmware in it.

855
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,120
Even your SSD and everything has got firmware.

856
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,520
And, you know, we've talked about being able to update that.

857
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,640
But that's all just binary blobs that we have no idea what it's doing.

858
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,920
And so at some point, you just have to relax and just use your hardware and just get on

859
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,480
with it.

860
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,680
It's all shifty turtles all the way down, Joe.

861
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,160
Yeah.

862
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,080
So you've got a couple of picks to share with us.

863
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,640
Yeah.

864
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,520
You know, it just wouldn't be a good Linux unplugged if we didn't sneak in a few picks

865
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,800
here and there.

866
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,000
First up, something called Proven.

867
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,920
Proven is an alternative to Twitter's verified program.

868
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,720
But, oh, my friends, but it's powered by Keybase.

869
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,320
Proven is a browser extension that has badges for Keybase, GitHub, and a number of online

870
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,080
services next to usernames on some sites, especially Twitter, much like Twitter's verified

871
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,640
badge.

872
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,200
But instead, it's based on the user-hosted proofs Keybase enables.

873
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,680
Yeah.

874
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,920
And to be honest, these days, the Twitter verified badge is pretty much worthless, isn't

875
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,400
it?

876
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,320
So this is much more valuable to me.

877
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
Yeah, you know, Keybase has done a lot of things.

878
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,560
We haven't talked about it too much on Linux Unplugged recently, but they've been working

879
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,360
hard in the background to establish a sane way to build distributed trust that doesn't

880
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,760
all have to be based on key signing parties.

881
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,360
Now, if you use their service, you've got some verifiable accounts set up, you've posted

882
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,520
some proofs to services, we all interact on this internet.

883
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,160
And knowing that I can actually have some trust that you are you and that someone I've

884
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,440
talked to on IRC, and someone I've seen in the comments of Hacker News, and then someone's

885
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,480
Twitter feed are all actually the same identity, even if it's a pseudo-anonymous identity,

886
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,880
there's a lot that I like there.

887
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,240
In addition, Keybase has done a lot of neat things like they've got their own distributed

888
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,360
file system that you can check out and a chat app I haven't tried, but I'm very curious.

889
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,640
Yeah, that sounds very interesting.

890
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,280
I've only heard of it today, when we were talking about this before, and I had no idea

891
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,080
that they did so much more than just, you know, this verification stuff.

892
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,240
So yeah, I'm going to definitely have to check that out.

893
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,360
Although, do we really need another chat app at this point?

894
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,480
No, probably not.

895
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,280
Although, if it does have security in mind, well, I'm tempted.

896
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,160
If you're curious, though, don't worry, you can head on over to linuxunplugged.com

897
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,000
slash 265 to get a link to everything we've talked about, but also proven.

898
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,120
You can go try it out, see if you like it, see how many I think you might be surprised

899
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,680
how many people are actually on Keybase that you already interact with online.

900
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,120
And if you don't mind one add on, of course, they have one for Firefox and Chrome.

901
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,360
So probably a browser near you.

902
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,720
I don't know, something I've installed and maybe you should too.

903
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,560
That's not the only pic for this week, though, is it?

904
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,600
No, of course not, Joe.

905
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,400
What are you trying to say?

906
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,640
I'm not trying to sell everyone short of the pics.

907
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,000
That would be insane.

908
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Okay, so this one's a little bit weird.

909
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,920
It's got an unfortunate name.

910
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,400
It's called Rat.

911
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,080
Yeah, that's right.

912
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,680
Rat, R-A-T.

913
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,440
And well, I don't know why it's called Rat, but what it lets you do is kind of novel.

914
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,840
It's a tool to compose shell commands to build interactive terminal applications.

915
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,560
This is one you should definitely go follow up, click on those show notes, go over to

916
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,560
their GitHub page and watch some of their demos because it's a little, really, there's

917
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,520
a lot of power here.

918
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,240
I think they've found a unique way to leverage that Unix philosophy we're always prattling

919
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,840
on about here and actually get some pretty usable results.

920
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,240
Have you had a chance to fully check this out then?

921
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,600
Yeah, it's a Go application, so it's really pretty easy to get.

922
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,960
I don't think they have any binaries pre-compiled for you, but if you've got the Go build chain

923
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,920
already installed, it's just a Go get away.

924
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,440
And it was really inspired by things like TIG to have very little actual opinionated

925
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,640
UI logic, but allowing you to stick that in together.

926
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,960
So they've got an example here where they've hooked up various, you can configure various

927
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,360
modes and then trigger that on key presses to show different things.

928
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,360
So their example is maybe you're working in a complicated Git tree and you know you're

929
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,400
going to want multiple panes.

930
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,440
You're going to want to be able to see maybe like the actual tree layout.

931
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,640
You're going to want to see some blames.

932
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,720
You're going to want to see just raw diffs.

933
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,400
This lets you do that and you can do it all interactively.

934
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,040
So you can choose, you can have it show like Git show, you can have it show the Git log.

935
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,560
You can imagine using all sorts of tools.

936
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,880
Maybe you have your whole development environment set up in this.

937
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,160
You've got something watching to show all your tests in one window.

938
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,760
You've enabled it with key presses so that you can rerun those tests or trigger to go

939
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,880
do a build and upload it to a server when you're ready to test it in staging.

940
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,520
I think the possibilities are kind of endless.

941
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,320
Now, of course, that means RAT is a little bit of a power user tool.

942
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,400
You're going to have to get down and gritty with all of that config.

943
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,600
But the upside is it's, you know, it's composable.

944
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:45,840
It has some really nice, I think, base abstractions and what you could build, I bet, is limitless.

945
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,760
This sounds really interesting, even from a systems administrator perspective.

946
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,720
I'm doing more and more work with SaltStack and I'm trying to pick up Ansible to automate

947
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,480
stuff at work or stuff here at the house.

948
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:03,120
And it's nice having something like Visual Studio Code.

949
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,320
I like their implementation of Git and that kind of thing and how it's all within the

950
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,880
GUI.

951
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,760
There's days where I just live in VS Code.

952
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,360
But having something like this that is that intricate, I think, would really help, especially

953
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,480
for someone who just within the last few months has started heavily using Git when, you know,

954
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,680
six months ago, 12 months ago, I didn't use Git at all except to pull down new applications.

955
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,120
Yeah, and it seems like one of those things, too, where often you end up with workflows

956
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,800
where on one side you have some scripts that you have to custom set up.

957
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,200
Maybe you've got a script to open them all in Tmux panes, or on the other side of that

958
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,800
spectrum, you've got custom developed web UIs that hook through and maybe you've set

959
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,680
up like a Rails app or an Express app.

960
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,200
To my eye, RAT occupies an interesting middle space where you can actually set up actual

961
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,560
UX workflows on the terminal, relying just on terminal commands that you're already using,

962
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,080
but in a more structured way.

963
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,360
And as someone who always has way too many terminals open, I'll be pointing out that

964
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,280
open, I'll be playing with it.

965
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,120
And you've got yet one more perk, haven't you, tcpdump101.com?

966
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,960
Yeah, this one's not so much of an app as it is a web app.

967
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,760
I don't know about you, Joe, but sometimes there's something shady going on on your network

968
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,560
or on your box.

969
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,000
The kernel's failing you.

970
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,280
You're getting a lot of spam or your packets just aren't going where you told them to go.

971
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,400
That's when I turned to my trusty friend, tcpdump.

972
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,520
Unfortunately, I think for many of us, if it's not one of your daily drivers, it's just

973
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,280
one more tool that you can you forget the language to use to configure it.

974
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,880
You forget all the command line flags.

975
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,960
And to add to that, there's a lot of hardware out there that has somewhat similar commands

976
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
that aren't just always the same.

977
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:53,840
Enter tcpdump101, a handy site that has a simple GUI builder to help you compose tcpdump

978
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,720
commands.

979
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,280
This looks super useful to me, man.

980
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,760
Yeah, that's it.

981
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,320
Because like tcpdump, it has a lot of functionality.

982
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,480
And usually, I saw a lot of outcries of people discussing this tool being like, well, you

983
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,840
know, it already has a man page.

984
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,000
And you can just type dash h.

985
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,280
And that's all true.

986
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,440
And you know, we probably do that already.

987
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,320
I know I do.

988
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,600
But it's nowhere near as in depth of this.

989
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
And there's some amount of shame.

990
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,560
I think we like to we like to put a stigma on people that need help, right?

991
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,080
Maybe you're always going to stack overflow or you just can't learn to memorize those

992
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,440
command line switches.

993
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,360
But all that matters at the end of the day is you have a powerful tool and you want to

994
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,000
be able to use it.

995
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,040
And if you don't use it every day, you might need a little help.

996
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,640
That's where things like query builders or planners really come in.

997
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,600
And they've got different stuff.

998
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,480
So maybe you're using a Cisco ASA checkpoint thing.

999
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,120
FortisGate doesn't really matter.

1000
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,960
Just plain old good tcpdump.

1001
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,880
They've got a handy GUI you can click through.

1002
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,480
It'll help you graph all the options.

1003
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
You enter your capture interface.

1004
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,040
You've got a whole bunch of sort of where do you want to save this output?

1005
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,480
What's the format that you want to save it?

1006
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,240
And at the end, you're given a command to copy, paste in your terminal and away you go.

1007
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,800
Very nice.

1008
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,800
Well, Joe, I think that's the end of the picks.

1009
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,880
And unless you've got anything else you'd like to add today, I think that's going to

1010
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,360
wrap up Linux Unplugged 265.

1011
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,760
Yeah, I think we did an OK job while the boss is away.

1012
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,280
You know, it was definitely a quick episode.

1013
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,120
There's been lots going on over here, but never fear.

1014
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,120
You can't stop Linux Unplugged and you can't stop

1015
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,200
Jupiter Broadcasting.

1016
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,840
You're probably saying that wasn't enough Linux Unplugged for me.

1017
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,400
And you know what?

1018
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:26,880
I feel you.

1019
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,680
So don't worry.

1020
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,800
We'll be back next week.

1021
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,360

You can, of course, find the wonderful poppy over at the Ubuntu podcast.

1034
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,440
And you can find Joe while all over the place.

1035
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,720
He's at Joe Ressington.

1036
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,760
And make sure you check out Linux Action News this week.

1037
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,640
And the always fabulous late night Linux.

1038
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,440
I'm at Westpane and the whole darn network.

1039
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,480
Well, that's at Jupiter Signal.

1040
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,080
Thank you for joining me so much, Joe.

1041
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:53,520
We'll see you maybe next week.

1042
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:01,360
Thanks for joining us, everyone.

1043
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,440
Sorry it was a short one today.

1044
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,120
I wish I had more to contribute.

1045
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,720
Yeah, I just didn't have much to add today.

1046
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,120
I feel like I should have had more to say.

1047
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,080
More more in my head to say about 3.3.0,

1048
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,400
since I'm supposed to be helping with our social media for it.

1049
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,360
I was too busy enjoying a steak.

1050
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,960
Think about it and be ready for next week's Unplugged, sir.

1051
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,040
Yeah, next week's going to be huge.

1052
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,960
I've already got it blocked off on my calendar,

1053
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,560
and I'm probably even just going to take a few hours off of work

1054
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,000
because between the Libre Application Summit and GNOME 3.3.0,

1055
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,040
I'm going to try and make some notes and come properly prepared.

1056
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,840
Oh, excellent.

1057
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,000
You're a blessing to us all.

1058
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,520
All my thoughts are around the conference I'm driving out to tomorrow.

1059
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,320
I'm really excited to get away from my routine,

1060
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,600
get away from the house and take a few days off work

1061
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,520
and just hang out with a bunch of other nerds.

1062
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,720
Which conference is that then?

1063
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,600
Oh, that would be the Libre Application Summit, right, Eric?

1064
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,640
No, Wes listens to me.

1065
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,840
I sure do.

1066
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,340
Yeah.

1067
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,240
I was going to say, I didn't want to presume I had heard you talking about it.

1068
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,840
Yeah, that sounds really cool, man.

1069
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,480
There's going to be people from all sorts of communities there, aren't there?

1070
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,240
Yeah, it's going to be nice to meet.

1071
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,080
In particular, I'm looking forward to meeting the folks from elementary,

1072
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:15,200
talk to both of them quite a bit on the show and IRC and that kind of thing.

1073
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,880
So it'll be fun to just get to meet a bunch of these folks in person.

1074
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,080
You know, you really just can't replace that in-person feeling.

1075
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,560
Even if you get to talk to them every week here,

1076
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,400
there's something about seeing someone in person,

1077
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,960
giving them a hug and just having some time to hash out everything you want to talk about.

1078
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,920
You just can't replace.

1079
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,320
Yeah, and you can't replace that hangover feel the next day

1080
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
after you've been out for drinks all night.

1081
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,760
No, that's an important aspect.

1082
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,960
Yeah, I take it there's going to be plenty of that as well then.

1083
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,080
Oh, there's plans flying around and they're trying to figure out

1084
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,400
how much of a budget there is for drink tokens.

1085
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,760
It's like, no, no, we don't need drink tokens, that would just make it worse.

1086
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,600
Right, yeah.

1087
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,280
You want a self-limiting supply.

1088
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,240
Yeah, exactly.

1089
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,440
Oh, I'm really envious now.

1090
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,240
I really wanted to go to that, but unfortunately it was the wrong time of year.

1091
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,560
Yeah, you'll really have to be the ambassador there, Eric.

1092
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,680
I'm excited for that.

1093
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,680
I was toying with the idea of taking my setup here

1094
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,560
just in case there's some thoughts or something I want to record.

1095
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,280
But I've also set up a one-click ghost deployment on DigitalOcean.

1096
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,000
And I'm just going to try and, if nothing else,

1097
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,800
I'm just going to try and start blogging about everything that happens just to record it.

1098
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,680
Oh, excellent.

1099
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:43,680
Yeah, that would be a good read.
