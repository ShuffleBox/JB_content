1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
I present to you over at github the fastest website ever ultra fast single TCP packet

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,360
audio-visual experience yeah that's right it's a web server and website that

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,080
just sends you one packet you can try it at HTTP packet city all right

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,200
apparently it's an actual audio-visual experience yeah well they did say yeah

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,560
they even have room for 120 bytes of ad space and a single packet that's pretty

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,840
impressive that's just some high-quality music yeah I'm gonna mute that right now

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,560
because we do not need that let's look at the source though no to be fair that

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,280
that music is probably copyrighted and we'll get us pulled down that will

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,600
probably get us pulled down yeah not again beard yeah okay this is a pretty

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,960
small yeah that's a tiny amount of source code with no formatting with no

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,760
formatting whatsoever yeah so you can go you can go check it out they got a

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,280
client here index dot HTML just a tiny little thing and I think they just have

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,040
a tiny little C web server that sends this to you so if you know your clients

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,560
don't want a bloated website who does these days just send them to the fastest

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,600
website ever see what they should do is they should figure out how to also send

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,840
you a copy of the thing to run it yourself in that same packet oh yeah

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,720
yeah that would be like a quine type thing but for a single packet web server

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,680
you know getting all meta up in here I like that beard this is Linux unplugged

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:48,680
episode 216 for September 26 2017

20
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,760
welcome to the Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's definitely

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,400
not jealous of Chris's awesome New York City adventure my name is Wes and I have

22
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,400
a beard you sure do have a beard we have a great show coming up today we spent

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,800
some time with our friends over at Microsoft we catch up with some of our

24
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,480
favorite projects discuss some of the hard details of being a free and open

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,000
source software maintainer and get a little quantum with the latest Firefox

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,720
quantum beta but before we do all that I think we have at least one friend to

27
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,320
join us we should say hello to and time appropriate screening to our wonderful

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:35,000
mumble room time appropriate greetings oh wonderful to have you mr. mech oh how

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,880
are you doing beard thanks for joining me Chris is away he's out in NYC I am

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,200
stuffed full of five guys oh yes I am a fan of five guys in my mouth five guys

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,760
all up in that mouth yep with a side of fries yeah excellent well we can't be

32
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,560
having as much as fun as Chris but we sure can make a show happen so I guess

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,360
we pop over here talk about our first story today which is okay so on the

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,080
previous episode we had quite the kerfuffle we were talking about mr. Jim

35
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,400
Zemlin of the Linux Foundation and his his choice of computing hardware device

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,840
that was a little contentious right because he was caught not using Linux

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,640
how could that be how could that be so I just thought and you know maybe it's a

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,520
little fun we poked some fun at the other side Bill Gates now uses an

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,080
Android phone at least according to the verge I mean to be fair to him he has

40
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,240
more an excuse because nobody makes Windows phones anymore yeah really yeah

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,080
it starts out but you know Windows phone has been dead for a good year now and

42
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,520
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has decided it's also time to move on in the

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,120
interview with Fox News Sunday Gates reveals he's now using an Android phone

44
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,840
well Gates doesn't reveal the exact model he does note that it has a lot of

45
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,040
Microsoft software on it which could suggest it's the special Microsoft

46
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,280
edition Samsung Galaxy s8 but who knows I guess he's still not interested in

47
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,360
iPhone though he famously banned iPhones and iPods at home in the past that's

48
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,200
kind of funny I wonder too like is it just because do you think you'd use

49
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,280
Android just because there's probably is it easier to get Microsoft software on

50
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,040
there versus iOS yeah probably but it would you know I don't know who's a

51
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,480
bigger competitor to Microsoft these days Apple or Google I mean Google's

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,440
going after their cloud business a lot more yeah but of course Apple has been

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,200
there a long time I mean not arrival almost feels wrong clearly they're

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,440
beating them in the you know in the mobile world but for a long time Apple

55
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,440
was the underdog does Bill Gates even care anymore no I don't think he does

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,600
right that's a lot of it too it's like it just doesn't matter and that's really

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,440
what I was trying to get he's just a dude now that happens to also be a

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,920
billionaire that people write articles about yeah you know still owns a bunch

59
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:50,040
of Microsoft but hey that's just what happens okay so moving on then to our

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,920
next story today which is an update to lineage OS change lock number 14 brings

61
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,120
burn in protection and changes to privacy guard audio effects and more so

62
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,320
lineage is this something you would ever be interested in mr. beard not really

63
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,880
yeah what do you run on your phone is it just stock yeah it's whatever Samsung

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,000
sends me yeah just trust into the old same song well that's fine well I mean

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,800
with the Samsung phones if you if you root them breaks the the knocks

66
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,120
protection yeah right yeah so that's no good anyway the lineage OS team has just

67
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,800
released a new change like summarize the most important changes made to the

68
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,200
popular third-party custom ROM in recent weeks originally made every two weeks

69
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,560
change logs now being you know only only when the team teams necessary so I

70
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,280
thought hey this might mean something interesting has changed so there's now

71
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,360
the lineage updater app has been rewritten from the ground up to fix

72
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,080
some long-standing issues doesn't seem very exciting but I think that's one

73
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,440
thing that like if you're gonna have a successful long-running ROM you actually

74
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,200
need to be able to get updates because I can't like the number of times I've had

75
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,440
to install something and then like a few months later been like I just have to

76
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,300
like reflash this phone I don't want to lose everything what what is the

77
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,480
procedure here so if you have like a really official good non buggy simple to

78
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,360
use updating tool I think that goes a long way so is the the update you're

79
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,360
like a utility that you're on your PC or is it an app on the phone you know I'm

80
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,420
not actually sure I imagine it's something you run on your your computer

81
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:25,380
but let's see let's find out I'm not actually sure cuz uh if we're on the

82
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,100
phone that'd be that would be nice yeah that would be here we go at your change

83
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:38,640
devices yeah okay it looks like it's a flask app here so that would suggest to

84
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,440
me that you run it on your on your device and then interact with it and then

85
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,840
you know it will then flash your phone or provide the update interesting yeah

86
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,960
you're right if it was right on the phone that would be like first party

87
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,120
level of yep just boom this is official just open the app it's like you got an

88
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,180
update and it downloads it and you reboot and flashes that'd be great so

89
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,760
also they now have burnin protection so if you have an AMOLED screen that you

90
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,480
know a fancy AMOLED screen that you would prefer not to get ruined they now

91
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,280
have burnin protection which shifts the position of the status bar and

92
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,020
navigation bar icons every few minutes you may think you're going crazy if you

93
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,500
haven't read about this you know you just like is my phone my phone changing

94
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,320
on me I didn't do that but hopefully that prevents burnin in those areas so I

95
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,280
guess they actually move at 3 DP horizontally 1 DP vertically subtle

96
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,840
little change and really what was highlighted here is September security

97
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,280
patches have been included and fixes that blue born vulnerability we were

98
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,560
talking about last week as well so that's another good point if you do have

99
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,120
one of these ROMs boom update yourself you've got these patches you don't have

100
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,960
to wait for Google to roll them up into some update that takes however long or

101
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,000
Samsung to do so which will clearly take forever yeah that's really I mean it's

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,320
beginning to a point where I don't I'm not that interested I have not even

103
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,960
unlocked my pixel so I which is weird for me I only got Android 7 a month or

104
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,080
two ago hmm which is like many months behind yeah so you're not gonna get Oreo

105
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:14,160
until 2019 yeah 2019 yikes well then maybe for your next phone consider

106
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,800
something that can run lineage maybe yeah I know somehow I don't see that

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,480
happening but you can think about it okay so if you aren't going to do that

108
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,040
you are probably still concerned about security turns out Google is concerned

109
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,100
along with you Google has extending security support for Nexus 6p and Nexus

110
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,040
5x devices until November 2018 this has been one of the more maligned things

111
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,520
about Google's devices I was seeing a you know comparison thread that the

112
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,440
iPhone 5s is still supported and how long that's been compared to the the

113
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,420
support that that Google generally has for their devices so it's nice to see

114
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,840
that maybe maybe you're getting a little more than you expected or a little more

115
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,800
than they've actually promised so since Android is the most used operating

116
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,200
system in the world it also stands to reason that it's also the most attacked

117
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,920
the only way to prevent security problems on mobile devices is to keep

118
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,440
them updated amen see the text that program and this is exactly what Google

119
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,360
is doing up until now the support for both the Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x was until

120
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,480
September 2018 but has been extended until November 2018 adding two more

121
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,400
months this can only be a good thing for Nexus users who can hold on to their

122
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,360
devices a little bit longer fancy scroll in there that's my mistake

123
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,960
don't mistake but you should not mistake security support with software support

124
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,200
it's important to keep in mind that security support only refers to patches

125
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,280
and nothing else software support ended in September 2017 so it's ending right

126
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,440
now which means that no new version of the OS will be provided after this date

127
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,560
that definitely limits the usability but there's a lot of people I think of like

128
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,920
my mom as an example where she doesn't need the latest and greatest you know

129
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,000
like software updates necessarily she just needs a phone that will just keep

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,840
working run the same apps that she's had for the past however many months but I

131
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,960
would worry if she was on a phone that was no longer getting updates so that's

132
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:08,960
nice to see yeah it doesn't really change the like haphazard path haphazard

133
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,800
pace of change hardware change deprecation ending lifespans of phones

134
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,400
after like two years but maybe there's a happy medium somewhere in here well

135
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,520
isn't that um that one project that they announced supposed to help with a lot of

136
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,320
that yes it is man I'm blanking on that come on beard what's it called hey I

137
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,400
covered the project part you get the other part yeah you remember that it's a

138
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,040
project yeah that's true though it does sound like there are some you know

139
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,320
upstream changes going on in Android that will help refine some of that make

140
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,240
it easier for people to have those have all the weirdness of the actual system

141
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,520
on a chip confined at one software layer and then be able to build on top of that

142
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,120
so hopefully this will not be a problem that we see indefinitely in the future

143
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,360
still though I was a little I'm glad to see this I know a lot of people who

144
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,480
still have the 6p several people who have gotten the pixel and kind of missed

145
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,160
their 6p we'll see pixel 2 I guess will be coming out before too long but it's

146
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,760
nice to see Google at least kind of makes you wonder if they're extending it

147
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,680
because of that that new stuff maybe has made it easier for them to extend it oh

148
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,040
that's an interesting idea yeah maybe now it's yeah provides less less you

149
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,080
know lack of momentum less breaking to their bill yeah because you can update

150
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,520
the the OS without also having to update the the baseband and the firmwares and

151
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,120
all that yeah yeah as they end here also we have to remember that Google launched

152
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,320
the Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x back in September 2015 wow that seems like that

153
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,640
ain't a long time ago this means that support for them will end three years

154
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,600
later that's not too bad at all I've done the the math West that is two years

155
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,960
ago yeah I suppose that's not that long but that's a long time in the world yeah

156
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,960
exactly okay so speaking of phones let's just jump right on over to our first

157
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,040
sponsor today and that is our friends over at ting what is ting ting is

158
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,160
mobile that makes sense it's I mean it really it's a smarter way to do mobile

159
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,600
so go to linux.ting.com that will get you a $25 service credit and is my

160
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,400
mobile service provider is it yeah yeah you know what it's mine too I don't

161
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,960
believe it it's true and my parents mobile service provider and just about

162
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,200
anyone I can convince to switch it's a little weird right because you're like

163
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,640
hey can I talk to you about your cell phone plan I don't work for a phone

164
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,240
company but this can save you money but I yeah exactly it's like to that point

165
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,560
where it's like I'm not trying to pressure you I'm just letting you know

166
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,080
that there is a company that does things differently it really is smarter because

167
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,760
okay so it just starts at six dollars a month right so each line six dollars a

168
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,440
month one line two lines but the studio has like three or four lines something

169
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,280
like that yeah even if you have another another phone plan just pick up a sim

170
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,240
and screw around with it on the side for a bit to see if you like it yeah right

171
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,040
that's like one one hamburger a month less and then you have a you have a

172
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,120
phone line you can use as much data as you want yeah sure you pay for it but

173
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,360
you're free to do so which is awesome so head on over to the rates page they'll

174
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,280
make it super easy for you to figure out what you might be paying per month as I

175
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,220
said lines are just six dollars each then you just add up whatever bucket

176
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,440
you fall in so let's say you don't use any minutes because hey why would you no

177
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,200
one wants to call me and so I don't have that problem and you probably don't use

178
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,840
text messages because SMS is really just the worst thing ever so don't use those

179
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,760
either we're still at a whopping six dollars but now you get to data this is

180
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,280
one of the best things about Ting because data is just data tethering yeah

181
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,400
you can tether that's included you want to use a whole bunch of data that's fine

182
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,500
Ting doesn't try to like nickel and dime you with these complicated plans

183
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,400
overage charges none of that just pay for what you use so you know if you just

184
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,520
use a gig a month now we're at $22 maybe use two gigs a month $26 how reasonable

185
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,920
is that seriously $26 a month two gigs of data one phone that's perfect that's

186
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,800
affordable that's why I love Ting plus okay CDMA and GSM you can bring your own

187
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,200
device so maybe you all have got up you know got one of those supported lineage

188
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,400
phones Ting is a perfect place to bring it whether CDMA is better GSM is better

189
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,440
maybe you have a fancy one with like dual sims or you want to switch them out

190
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,800
depending on where you go all kinds of options plus they have an incredible

191
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:26,120
dashboard great apps and real live human customer service so Linux dot ting

192
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,360
dot-com there you can save a bunch of money on your cell phone plan and thank

193
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,880
Ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program thanks Ting okay so moving on

194
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,440
more Linux to talk about always more Linux can we just like skip the Linux

195
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,880
yeah okay what are you uh I don't know I guess we're going back on I guess we're

196
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,600
okay we're just gonna fall back to Linux anyone else doesn't want to talk about

197
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,760
Linux then I guess I'll be outnumbered I don't have Chris here to back me up

198
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,400
today yeah that's okay though okay so here's something we've talked about

199
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:08,280
more than a few times on the show and that is the top icons plus extension you

200
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,680
mean the one that the gnome project recently recommended that people use if

201
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,680
they want that stuff yes that that is the one looks like according to an issue

202
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,320
over on their github page development might be pausing or stopping so hey y'all

203
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,880
I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to take some distance with the development of

204
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,880
this extension it's motivated by a couple things one I have not used the

205
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,240
extension myself recently I use less and less extensions that use it and among

206
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,040
them none of them breaks or loses functionality without this to the gnome

207
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,720
project does not give a shit about it and made it public they don't even point

208
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,400
to this extension but to an outdated unmaintained one besides Ubuntu after

209
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,520
making a survey also moves on with its own extension all right we're getting

210
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,120
dramatic here anyway the API is dying it won't be dropped in future GTK updates

211
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,720
documentation is sparse and the development requires considerable effort

212
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,200
also the API is buggy and incomplete so it's impossible to make a reliable

213
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,600
extension or really enhance it of course it will never be fixed for top icons plus

214
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,160
then became a magnet for claims that would be better to be addressed by the

215
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,360
gnome project people fail to understand that the extension depends on an API and

216
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,200
is not capable slash intended to fix the gnome shell service it's extremely

217
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,720
exhausting and five the gnome extension website is awful as there is almost no

218
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,320
maintainer there and validation takes sometimes weeks

219
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,600
meanwhile I get issues from disgruntled users so I came to the conclusion being

220
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,160
also very busy with my job and my life that the hassle is no longer worth it

221
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,760
especially when it requires considerable effort because of the sparse

222
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,480
documentation status icons are dead with gnome shell move on and enjoy gnome

223
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:54,640
shell or switch your desktop environment oh okay those are some strong words over

224
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,440
there oh I kind of agree with them though like that's kind of what gnome

225
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,560
said that is kind of what gnome said yeah you're right I mean it is and that's

226
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,120
just one of those you know like love it or hate it that's kind of the way gnome

227
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,560
has been going these days right like they stick to their guns they have a set of

228
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,440
principles and philosophy whether or not you agree with it or not or even think

229
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,720
it's consistent they that's that's the way it's a benevolent or not so

230
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,480
benevolent dictator project yes dictator framework Adam I don't know what to call

231
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:32,720
it but so do you know much I usually use made okay yeah so this was not an

232
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,720
extension that you yourself was we're availing of no Chris uses it though I

233
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,640
think yeah definitely so I wonder what he's going to think about this no no

234
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,560
well right now he's on budget so it doesn't matter yeah right now he's on

235
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,520
budget the budget craze is sweeping the studio and I think the world mmm

236
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,600
probably yeah probably that's that's what seems to happen when those solace

237
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,280
guys get ahold of something and enough enough that I key went full-time yeah

238
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,840
full-time which is incredible it's nice to see that having listened to some of

239
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,520
that coverage do it does seem like you know it could be pain if you if your

240
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,120
development has diverged from what GTK intends it becomes increasingly it

241
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,200
becomes increasingly and increasingly difficult so I definitely have sympathy

242
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,680
with that you know that line of reasoning and you got it especially in

243
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,880
the open source world you just got to do what you can do don't stress out too

244
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,680
much about it and if he's not using it it'd be really hard to maintain

245
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,480
something that much work if you were not actually using it yourself any longer

246
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,960
and the fact that they that he said that the buggy or the API is a buggy and

247
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,240
incomplete kind of probably speaks to how much gnome cares about things that

248
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,800
aren't things they care about exactly yes exactly okay well I don't know if

249
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,200
anyone in the mumbroom wants to chime in but now is the time before we move on to

250
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,200
our next story unless you have something else to add mr. beard no well it's but

251
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,720
she considered to be a lightweight to desktop because I have a rest free

252
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,640
pipeline here around and I would try I would like to try some different

253
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,240
decimal budgie is more lightweight than gnome as far as I can tell at least I

254
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,160
would that seems to be easy yeah well true but I'm not sure where it where it

255
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,640
fits in relevance to the other ones I'd say probably somewhere on the level of

256
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:22,320
main yeah okay so it would be worth a try and is it it's fully compatible with

257
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,600
weight on the cast I think so yeah I believe so I don't know that I don't

258
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,240
think I've actually run it under Wayland yet on any of my systems but if not I'm

259
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,040
sure that I key guy will come yell at us about it yeah that's the fastest way to

260
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,440
find out or everybody else will go yelling at him oh yeah you're right oh

261
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,800
even better okay that's just fine then by the way I would have a last comment

262
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:51,000
on the lineage discussion you had a selfish has taken the first steps to do

263
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,280
to to base to have a base on lineage OS until now they had Cyanogen always for

264
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:04,120
the community ports and so they started to have the first steps to port to port

265
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,240
it to lineage which would be a great improvement because right now the

266
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:17,880
newest Android base for selfish always is Cyanogen modes 13 so probably there

267
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,520
is a way to go further now and take the energy space yeah I mean it seems like

268
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,840
there's a lot of momentum there so that makes like that seems like it might be a

269
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,960
good choice as something to base yourself on you well it seems to be the

270
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,920
only option now it does kind of seem to be the only option now yeah very true

271
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:42,480
excellent okay so moving on talking about only options in a way that's not

272
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,640
the button here we go announcing the X free kwin project no it's not X free 86

273
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,520
as you might be thinking but it is kwin running without X support so Martin

274
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,440
writes over the last few weeks I've contradicted concentrated my work on

275
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,040
kwin on what I call the X free kwin project the idea is to be able to start

276
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,840
kwin wayland without X Wayland support well most of the changes required for

277
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,160
it are already in plasma 511 not everything got ready in time but now

278
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,680
everything is under review on fabricator so it's a good point in time to talk

279
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,560
about the project so why an X free kwin you might ask you might wonder why we'd

280
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,780
spend time on this after all we need to provide support for X Wayland anyway to

281
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,160
be able to support legacy applications which are not yet on Wayland yeah I'm

282
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,200
sure a ton of us who are using Wayland are using a lot of X Wayland under the

283
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,480
hood so what's the advantage of a normal

284
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,840
session one needs to start X Wayland anyway well one aspect is that it shows

285
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,440
that our porting efforts to Wayland are finished over the last few years I've

286
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,720
tried to start kwin without X Wayland support for a few times just to find

287
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,120
areas which are not yet ported by being able to run kwin without X 11 support we

288
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,480
know that everything's ported or at least does not hard depend on X 11

289
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,980
anymore hey okay that kind of makes sense yeah we can actually run it all

290
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,520
without this stuff running so hey guys it's good another aspect is obviously

291
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,360
plasma mobile does not really need X Wayland and so it doesn't make much

292
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,920
sense to have a build that includes it and especially like lib hybrid systems

293
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,820
they won't have open GL there so it just it just doesn't make sense so by not

294
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:22,240
requiring X Wayland we can reduce our runtime and memory costs speaking of

295
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,360
runtime cost not requiring X 11 means that we don't have to wait for X Wayland

296
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,280
during kwin startup instead X Wayland can be started in parallel this means k

297
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,720
win and the complete plasma session starts just a little bit faster and most

298
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,360
important this is an important prerequisite to be able to handle a

299
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,120
crashing X Wayland so far when X Wayland crashed kwin terminated gracefully as k

300
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,080
win depends on X 11 the hope is that when X Wayland crashes we can just

301
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,220
restart it and keep the session running yeah okay that seems like a totally

302
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,760
legit reason to do that I don't want X buggy old X Wayland bringing down my

303
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,280
beautiful pristine new Wayland session makes sense yeah definitely so how it

304
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,800
was done the general idea behind getting here is that the code that isn't loaded

305
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,360
can't interfere kwin uses platform plugins for the various platforms kwin

306
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,360
can run on there's also a platform plug-in for kwin slash X 11 so code

307
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,560
which is only required in that case can be moved into the platform plug-in as

308
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,200
kwin slash Wayland does not load this plug-in we're certain that the code will

309
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,760
not be loaded and thus cannot interfere interesting but how do you find all that

310
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,840
code after all kwin's code base is about a hundred and fifty thousand lines of

311
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,280
code yeah I would just ctrl F and search for X just search for X yeah that'll do

312
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:47,240
it right X and then separately search for just 11 that will help too or org

313
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:53,000
or yeah definitely won't find that X 11 is the really really old code really old

314
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,960
code X 12 that's where it's at yeah good help is I guess they have a they have a

315
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,920
pretty good CI system which performs code coverage so kwin's tests mostly are

316
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,640
based on kwin slash Wayland so an area which just does not have any test

317
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,920
coverage is a good candidate for being X 11 specific boy doesn't that say a lot

318
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,320
right there that's why they want to protect it from the bugginess because

319
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,560
it's not tested I mean I'm sure that that's that's totally possible so

320
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,880
anyway like they kind of looked at those things by looking at these areas it was

321
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,120
possible to find patterns which also helped to find more usages so you know

322
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,840
kind of profile oh here's where we have to keep adding X 11 support that's

323
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,360
probably refactored in the same way in other parts of the code base there's

324
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,840
also kwin's internal X 11 API so they were able to find a bunch of those

325
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,480
patterns root those out and then exercise it so now they're able to you

326
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,840
know control it exercise I like that yeah right I mean it's all about it's all

327
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,480
about violence mostly that's how it works when you work with these old code

328
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,520
bases just got them got them got them right out put them back together we have

329
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,480
the technology beard like we just totally do okay so being able to start

330
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,600
and run X kwin slash Wayland without X 11 support is of course only the start

331
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,080
more changes will be required for example the delay loading X Wayland

332
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,040
until an app elation tries to connect to it another area to try to get X win

333
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,120
compiled without excellent support and to move everything required for X Wayland

334
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,200
into a plug-in so be a larger project as it will require much more code movement

335
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,280
and added further abstractions to some areas of kwin but this could be a nice

336
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,480
Google summer of code project as a fast step for especially plus mobile and the

337
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,780
purism Libra and phone which we've talked about there's an if-def now

338
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:33,600
around the X 11 code so that might be another path forward but the his motive

339
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,580
Martin's real motivation here is handling a crashing X Wayland so I think that

340
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,840
makes sense and it's cool to see I really appreciate these blog posts just

341
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,080
because well I don't always run kwin like I don't have a plasma system going

342
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:51,040
at the moment it really is a heck of a I mean compositor everything that it is

343
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,560
now right I mean a Wayland desktop yeah so it's cool to get to see this sort of

344
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,280
stuff that's one of the things that's so wonderful about open source is like sure

345
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,000
I remember the old days like Microsoft would have like a tech post about

346
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,920
something they were doing but you didn't get to go look at it whereas we can go

347
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,400
like look at the commits that have changed this I'm probably not going to

348
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,820
on this one because it sounds like it's kind of gross but the fact that we can

349
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,120
that we can learn from it and we get to see the motivation I think that's pretty

350
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,280
awesome what about you are you a plasma plasma fan I actually prefer plasma over

351
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:30,080
any other desktop I just don't run it because I still find the the settings to

352
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,520
be too over complicated yeah you know I've had that problem myself I actually

353
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,880
I like it a lot and I just but it just had a couple years ago I had it tuned

354
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,240
really nicely it was just perfect I loved it but I that time I did not do a

355
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,120
great job of like remembering what those settings were so the last couple of

356
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,040
times I've used it for like a week or two here and there but I've been in the

357
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,000
same boat where it's like I just don't have the time right now to sit down and

358
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
make this perfect when you have to go to three completely separate sections of

359
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,360
your settings to to theme your your your stuff then I think it's a little over

360
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,600
complicated yeah what is this Windows 10 especially since some of them like to

361
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,040
override other ones so you end up going circles you'll never win yeah circular

362
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,440
dependencies that's that's what we need here well okay so maybe that makes you

363
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,200
pretty frustrated beard maybe frustrated enough to just leave this whole planet

364
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,720
behind and join a new spaceborne Linux supercomputer it's now started running

365
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,320
in space achieves one teraflop I'm sure it's pretty warm I can just like lay on

366
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,320
it yeah you can just snuggle up with the supercomputer out there and you won't die

367
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,200
at all yeah it'll be fine okay so we'd heard about this a little bit before I

368
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,120
you were mentioning that that yeah I think this is the same HP supercomputers

369
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,320
that was launched on a SpaceX rocket that recovered a couple weeks ago yes

370
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,440
about one month ago the HPE their new name of course come on it's HPE now they

371
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,520
split Rekai HP Enterprise yeah uh-huh it's serious stuff anyway their

372
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,800
spaceborne computer was launched into the space using the SpaceX Dragon

373
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,960
spacecraft this beast was launched as a result of a partnership between HPE and

374
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,880
NASA to find out how high-performance computers perform in space now the

375
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,240
supercomputer is fully installed and operational on the International Space

376
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,080
Station the performance experiment will be carried out for about a year which is

377
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,160
roughly the time will take for spacecraft to travel to Mars at the

378
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,960
moment lots of calculations for space research projects are carried out on

379
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,360
earth but this brings in an unavoidable factor of latency yeah I imagine your SSH

380
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,320
sessions aren't great when you're going from space to the earth and back huh

381
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,240
yeah we've got some photos here I'm sure it's better than like the the

382
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,000
SSH session to like the satellites we got way out far out looking at planets

383
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,920
enter a keystroke wait six minutes and then check that's when you use a mosh

384
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,280
that's when you use moss yeah okay finally a situation that makes sense

385
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,040
that's great actually I do kind of like mosh so here's a cool picture it looks

386
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,040
like it's getting installed here the hardware which is being talked about

387
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:05,360
here is an Apollo 40 server with a high-speed HPC interconnect running you

388
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,440
guessed it Windows ME no it's Linux it's a Linux beard come on now it has a

389
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,800
water-cooled enclosure and additional software to take care of the

390
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,000
environmental constraints yeah sounds like this is also a closet gaming box

391
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,440
for the astronauts on onboard that's what I'm picking up here it must have

392
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,800
upgraded from their solaris supercomputer that's great can you

393
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,920
imagine putting together a computer in space though it's hard enough are it's

394
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,320
hard enough yeah your screws are floating all over the place oh that

395
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,840
could be good in some ways yeah you just kind of like set it there over the screw

396
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,720
in the sky yeah maybe you have to I guess I guess magnets would be even more

397
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,840
helpful but be careful don't let the magnet float too close to the computer

398
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,360
now the magnetic screw trays is pretty good too on earth that's true yeah so I

399
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,600
guess it's not so different yeah I will take that challenge though so if anyone

400
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,280
wants to send me pay for a new computer and send me to space to assemble it

401
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,320
sounds like it would make great content just gonna just leaving that there you

402
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,640
should pitch to what's his name Richard Branson yeah okay ask if you can build a

403
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,720
computer on the first version of galactic flight I'm gonna just write

404
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,880
this down right now following up on that after the show anyway this is devices

405
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,720
the first high-performance commercial off-the-shelf computer to run one

406
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,120
teraflop at the ISS for those who don't know one teraflop is 1 trillion

407
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,360
calculations per second which is 30 times faster than a laptop okay that

408
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,280
really doesn't sound that impressive now that I mean like 30 they could have just

409
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,080
taken 30 laptops up there I probably already have like yeah it's really hard

410
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,520
to do like Beowulf cluster yeah that's true and then what if one person's

411
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,600
playing steam and it's really tying up the whole cluster all them Ethernet

412
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,080
cables in space oh yeah that's true you'll get caught up in them that makes

413
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,320
sense okay so according to their technology officer engineers are ready

414
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,080
to launch the multi node high-performance linpack benchmark test

415
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,920
this test will determine the number of multiplication system can produce per

416
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,760
second so now that it's all been doing over the coming months the engineers

417
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,640
will study this installation and its performance so that's kind of cool not

418
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,400
that often you get to hear about Linux in space like we all know it's there

419
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,920
obviously but it's just like do you remember seeing all those pictures from

420
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,920
years ago of you know we still had the space shuttle and seeing astronauts on

421
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,640
there when they got like their ex Windows XP thinkpads running on the

422
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,800
space station yeah so hopefully now they'll have some it does seem like it

423
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,360
would be pretty handy if you're doing it you know they do so much science up

424
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,160
there that just to have your own little supercomputer that you have right there

425
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,600
to go do your workloads on so I guess the supercomputer is inside the the

426
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,160
pressurized area of the place that's what it looked like yeah or at least the

427
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,000
front the way they talked about I thought they were gonna do something

428
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,400
crazy like just have it sit in the vacuum of space to keep it cool yeah I

429
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,120
thought that too like it was just you know it would just be floating maybe

430
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,040
alongside or in a similar orbit I guess they didn't have a way to deal with

431
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:56,080
potential like any amounts of condensation at all oh yeah okay

432
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,360
interesting and then I guess you have to devise the right kind of like would you

433
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,840
use like a like laser beam or infrared or other type of like line-of-sight

434
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,760
communication to it now you just poke a hole for Ethernet cable and then you

435
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,320
tether it on to that yeah mm-hmm maybe like and then a couple extra ones just

436
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,480
for security sake and then one that's actually the data line yep hmm no that

437
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,160
is an interesting idea there Beardsley how'd you get so smart mm-hmm

438
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,880
who knows okay so I know I've heard that you like video games fact or fiction

439
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,000
hmm well the video games are fiction true that I like them as fact okay how

440
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,320
do you feel about Atari and how do you feel about a new gaming system from

441
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,640
Atari called you've guessed it the Atari box so it's an Atari branded PC I'm

442
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,520
guessing yeah take a look that seems completely pointless yeah doesn't it but

443
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,840
guess what it's Linux based hmm so it will use an AMD customized processor

444
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,720
with the Radeon graphics technology this means a proper CPU so not like an arm

445
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,880
chip that's nice it will run Linux but the they will be providing a customized

446
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,000
interface as it's mainly aimed at using it like a console on a TV even so they

447
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,240
say it will give a full PC experience for the TV so we're back to like

448
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,720
whatever web web TV is that what it was what I'm hearing is that Atari couldn't

449
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,920
make a deal with Steam to make another steam is exactly what it sounds like but

450
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,080
you will apparently get full access to the underlying Linux system so it might

451
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,800
be possible to have you know buy this and then put your favorite OS on it why

452
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,680
you would do that I don't really know maybe it'll be maybe that's subsidized

453
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,560
somehow so it'll be cheap like Xboxes of old I'm not sure I wonder if the the

454
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:48,800
modules for the the custom PC chip are publicly available I wonder that too

455
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,520
yeah it sounds like it's going to remain quite open as they say you will be able

456
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,660
to access game purchased from other content platforms as long as it's Linux

457
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,640
compatible so it sounds like installing Steam might just be possible so this

458
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,200
really is like a weird side loaded steam you're gonna get it's just gonna be like

459
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,320
Ubuntu with an Atari wallpaper yeah Ubuntu Atari wallpaper and Steam

460
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,440
pre-installed and then Steam pre-installed yes and then maybe a

461
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,580
couple other game platforms oh we'll come preloaded with classic Atari games

462
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,280
and even some current titles from a range of different studios it'll be

463
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,120
interesting to see if these current titles are games already on Linux or are

464
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,720
they gonna have some actually ported games especially for this I'm gonna

465
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,600
guess they're already on Linux I would bet so I don't know how much they're

466
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:35,480
actually gonna try to outlay on this yeah so it will launch on IndieGoGo soon

467
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,720
they say this fall it might seem strange for a bigger company to go with

468
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,920
crowdfunding yeah it is kind of strange I didn't know Atari is broke yeah but

469
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,320
they say this because they want the community to be part of the launch

470
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,760
Rekind not because they're broke yeah they want part of the community's money

471
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,160
to be part of the launch yeah you're probably right though honestly though

472
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,560
it's mainly so there's less risk involved for them but because Atari is

473
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,640
broke because Atari is broke but maybe it's a good way for them to gauge real

474
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,380
interest I don't know as for the proper launch it'll be late spring 2018 with a

475
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,080
price aimed between 250 and 300 dollars depending on the addition and

476
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:13,800
configuration Atari is still reeling from the the whole ET cartridge fiasco

477
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:21,760
back in the 80s yeah you're right about that okay but what do you think about it

478
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,600
this is apparently not a render it's a real unit with real wood involved the

479
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:34,400
wood edition it just seems like another steam machine with less everything yeah

480
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,220
and I haven't heard like this hasn't talked much about like what is the

481
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,220
controller gonna look like will there be controller are people putting keyboard

482
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,080
and mouse hooking up to this is it just USB ports on the back like it doesn't

483
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:50,760
really excite me because it's a it's just a slightly more proprietary PC that

484
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,560
happens to support Linux but so don't all non proprietary PCs yeah okay that's

485
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,300
fair that's fair yeah no that's about now if they announce that it's some

486
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,120
absurdly cheap price and it has good performance maybe I'll change your mind

487
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,560
but I doubt it yeah I'm with you okay well I guess I do have something that

488
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,280
you might get excited about and that's our next sponsor today which is our

489
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,320
friends over a digital ocean it's hard not to get excited but yeah exactly

490
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,840
have you heard about their new spaces a beautifully simple and scalable object

491
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,880
storage service hmm yeah so if you listen to if you listen to tech stamp

492
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,760
you hear about all kinds of people always getting hacked because they leave

493
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,400
their s3 buckets open to the public don't make that mistake just hop on over

494
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,840
digital ocean they've just launched basis you can get in on it I think

495
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,280
you'll find the price is very competitive and kick your bucket get a

496
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,640
space get a space yeah exactly and I mean digital ocean makes it so simple

497
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,920
you don't have to fight through the always confusing AWS API's you can use

498
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,360
digital oceans amazing super simple API the well not to mention the the web

499
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:05,040
interface for AWS is so confusing convoluted especially compared to

500
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,040
digital ocean where you just click click and you're done or like have you ever

501
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,320
tried to like find out what you might expect to pay for your your AWS oh no

502
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,080
you find out what you expect to pay when you get the bill for what you pay yeah

503
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,280
so head on over to digital oceans pricing page and you'll see the

504
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,960
difference because like look at this oh look oh yeah it's just the prices per

505
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,340
month or per hour whatever you want and you can switch between them you can

506
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,840
switch between them yeah which is also like a huge feature so I like this

507
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,880
$10 a month one because you get one gig of memory one CPU 30 gigs of SSD disk

508
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,480
and it's all SSD des over digital ocean and two terabytes of transfer and this

509
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,880
transfer is not this is not your grandma's transfer this is not 56k it's

510
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,880
not some single bod modem this is like 40 gigabit e straight to that KVM

511
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,480
hypervisor go run like a couple apt-get updates go pull down some files you will

512
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,400
see that this is real transfer I use it all the time when I'm like trying to

513
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,160
connect to a server in Europe and my ISP just doesn't seem to have great peering

514
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,680
across the Atlantic but digital ocean sure does that's because they have data

515
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,800
centers all over places like London and Frankfurt and then a bunch here NYC San

516
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,940
Fran and they keep expanding so there's almost certainly one near you if you

517
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,760
have two droplets in the same data center you can get private networking

518
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,080
between them you can use our promo code do unplugged that will get you a $10

519
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,120
credit so that will pay for your first month or you know you probably don't

520
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,840
really need that whopping droplet so just just downsize just downsize five

521
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:38,640
dollars a month or seven tenths of a cent per hour isn't that insane it's

522
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,240
insane so it's so cheap run an IRC bouncer run a server of any kind start

523
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,920
hosting your own website you can use their attachable block storage so if you

524
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,960
need to do some backups up there plus they've got stuff like monitoring load

525
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,480
balancing cloud firewalls all the all the bells and whistles you've come to

526
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,000
expect from those big-name competitors for way better prices way simpler

527
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,360
interface and way better API go to digital digital ocean comm our promo

528
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,600
code do unplugged go get yourself a droplet and join the cool kids club so

529
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:15,640
easy to remember that we forgot it that is exactly how easy do unplugged okay so

530
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,640
talking about talking about do and therefore we had to talk about AWS

531
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,520
because they're just you know AWS some yeah they're just exactly up exactly

532
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,600
mm-hmm you're just trying to get them to sponsor you aren't you beard yeah right

533
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,840
so they're a big competitor another big competitor in that space is our friends

534
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:40,720
over at Microsoft I don't know if this is relevant or not but Microsoft and

535
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,120
Facebook have just teamed up and laid a hundred and sixty terabit per second

536
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,840
cable four thousand one hundred miles across the Atlantic I love that the

537
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,960
verge feels it's necessary to tell you how many videos you can stream on that

538
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,600
but that's 71 million HD videos at the same time so that's HD that's only 1080p

539
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,160
yeah 1080p man I mean yeah might even be 720 if they're like skimping on you why

540
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,400
aren't they telling us like 4k Netflix streaming I don't know yeah that's

541
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,560
what's relevant for the future anyway Microsoft Facebook and the telecoms

542
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,400
infrastructure company tell Telxius have announced the completion of the highest

543
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,960
capacity subsea cable to ever cross the Atlantic Ocean the cables type of wolf

544
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,400
transmitting 160 terabits of data per second that's terabits so that's an

545
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,240
important important point there and is 16 million times faster than an average

546
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,720
home internet connection ouch it's trying to make us feel bad now Microsoft

547
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,920
we all get it you have gigabit apparently the cable be operational by

548
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,000
early 2018 called the Maria which is Spanish for tide the 4,000 mile long

549
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,440
subsea cable lies 17,000 feet below the ocean surface and extends between

550
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,720
Virginia Beach Virginia and the city of Bilbo in Spain it also stretches

551
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,920
route south of most existing transatlantic cables because of this

552
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,640
Microsoft says the cable provide resiliency for those living in the u.s.

553
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,560
and Europe by safeguarding against natural disasters or other major events

554
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,520
that might cause disruptions that's nice but where's our Pacific cable yeah where

555
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,480
is that I want to have high-speed transfer to Singapore I'm trying to

556
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,760
download some sushi right direct from Japan and it just doesn't fit over these

557
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,320
low bandwidth pipes we've got I like my sushi okay don't judge me I guess it

558
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,000
comes at a pretty critical time submarine cables in the Atlantic already

559
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,520
carry 55% more data than trans-pacific routes ouch gosh well maybe that's

560
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,960
okay you're not putting down the cables yeah we need more cables and 40% more

561
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,840
data than between the US and Latin America there is no question that the

562
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,360
demand for data flows across the Atlantic will continue to decrease I

563
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,400
suppose there's a lot probably a lot of financial transactions and others oh yeah

564
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,360
I wonder why it's so different in the Pacific for most of the route the cable

565
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,080
made up of eight pairs of fiber optic cables enclosed by copper lays on the

566
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,520
ocean floor some parts are buried to protect from shipping traffic usually in

567
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,820
areas closer to the shore in a blog post Microsoft said the project was

568
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,280
completed nearly three times faster than usual in under two years maybe it was

569
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,080
even under budget who knows they are an open design which allow it to evolve as

570
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,240
technology does and as the population of internet users around the world

571
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,400
continues to increase so anyway I don't know what their exact like why they

572
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,360
Facebook and them had to be involved are they going to get some sort of are they

573
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,520
gonna get a bunch of this lease here are they immediately buying transit across

574
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,400
this cable or ownership are getting data collection rights or they're just

575
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,960
kidding yeah so if your connection goes across this cable it instantly has ads

576
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,800
so just watch out for that but it is just really cool that this is something

577
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,480
that we can do you know you like you don't we don't really get to talk much

578
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,000
about these undersea cables but turns out a lot of the internet and backbone

579
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
of it needs them and it boggles my mind like 17,000 feet and somehow from the

580
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,160
surface we can just like lay giant cable on the on the bottom of the ocean I

581
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,760
couldn't do that it's probably like titanium reinforced or something you're

582
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,000
right probably probably titanium reinforced beard you just know

583
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,840
everything well that way the the lobsters can't cut the cable I can't

584
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,440
even with you I can't even with you we're moving on and I know this will

585
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,120
make you upset so Microsoft ignite sequel server 2017 for Linux goes live

586
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:21,040
you know or Windows if you want and then get this the preview Docker image has

587
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,960
already been fetched two million times Microsoft's just like full-on hipster

588
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,240
DevOps up in here I didn't realize that not only is sequel server popular what

589
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,240
it's popular in the Linux not yet popular under Linux and despite everyone

590
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,800
who likes to say you should never run a database and a container that you can

591
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,960
have the Docker container obviously that's not for production I'm just

592
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,720
kidding but it's interesting I mean I know Microsoft's on like a ton of work

593
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,360
with Docker to make Docker on Windows work clearly they embrace it on the

594
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,320
Linux side too so I guess yeah sequel server 2017 is now generally available

595
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,680
today's release is a remarkable step in sequel service history because it's not

596
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,720
just a release for Windows today makes the general availability of the sequel

597
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,000
server for the Linux there's also a containerized version for deployment

598
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,440
using Docker it was announced March of last year to widespread surprise yeah

599
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,880
amen sequel server as they say here at ours

600
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,280
technico sequel server is the kind of software that shifts Windows licenses

601
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,440
people buy Windows Server for the express purpose of running sequel server

602
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,880
supported to the Linux world is really forfeiting a huge amount of Windows

603
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,720
server potential revenue Scott Guthrie executive vice president for cloud

604
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,640
enterprise acknowledged that risk but felt that it was offset by the

605
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,880
opportunity sequel server for Linux presented sequel server has a rich

606
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,840
feature set and potential customers were telling Microsoft that they'd love to

607
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,520
use it but they were Linux shops or were dependent on Docker and

608
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,120
containerization as such being Windows only prevented sales to these customers

609
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,880
so it really does kind of to me it feels like the organization of Microsoft is

610
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,720
like really realizing that they have to like they can't just compete at this OS

611
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,560
level anymore they can't let the OS drag back their other products so they have

612
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,640
to they just have to make it available and you know sequel server is great I

613
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,960
haven't used it a ton but I know a lot of people who really like it and find it

614
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,200
sometimes the only acceptable alternative to Oracle database Postgres

615
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,840
obviously has come a long way but sequel server has been like a dominant force in

616
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,520
the industry for a long time and I'm sure there's a lot of people are like

617
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,560
yes I can run it on Linux now and you wonder too is it just good for them to

618
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,560
have more people familiar with it so that you know there's more devs who can

619
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,600
use it there's more devs trained to use it well it might not mean that they have

620
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,080
to buy Windows it might make it easier if they're already into the sequel

621
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,720
server enterprise if Microsoft can be like hey here's your cheap Windows

622
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,760
license or here's why it runs better under Windows I don't know that it does

623
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,440
in fact in the early builds we'd seen some articles stating that it was

624
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,560
running better under Linux than it did under Windows but maybe that's part of

625
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,520
their play here bringing the Windows dependent software to Linux made use of

626
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,120
a Microsoft research project named drawbridge that investigated new

627
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,640
approaches to virtualization and software isolation it happened that

628
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,680
this research work already aligned neatly with the way sequel server itself

629
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,800
was was engineered so they were able to just kind of stack those two

630
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,240
technologies together abstract away the host OS levels and make this work on

631
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,840
Linux it's kind of wild like Microsoft's they might be better at Linux than

632
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,640
Linux is now I don't know about how you feel about that

633
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,040
well aren't they one of the top kernel contributors they're not I don't think

634
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,120
they are in the current cycles they were for a while I think that was at a time

635
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,040
when they were doing a lot of work to get like better hyper-v support and

636
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,520
stuff for Azure but they certainly have you know they've certainly contributed

637
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:29,360
to it so we'll see I'm not gonna use it but it does seem like it further cements

638
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,280
Linux dominance in the server world

639
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,200
okay so one more little Microsoft update here just our little Microsoft check-in

640
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,560
in today's show because you know Microsoft loves Linux they love it so

641
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,240
much canonical Microsoft have now teamed up to make an Azure tailored Linux

642
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,480
kernel yeah that's right custom kernel customized by Microsoft actually this

643
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,840
isn't too surprising Microsoft runs Gentoo Microsoft runs Gentoo yeah baby

644
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,000
emerge world it kind of makes sense like there's already extensions you can do it

645
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,160
for better you know better virtualization support pair of

646
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,800
virtualization stuff on AWS so this basically adds a bunch of those options

647
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,080
to the Azure world so canonical has announced that it is joining forces with

648
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,080
the Microsoft Azure team to build an Azure tailored Linux curl for Ubuntu

649
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,840
cloud images of Ubuntu 1604 the new kernel will receive the same level of

650
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,840
support and security maintenance offered to supported kernels but is not yet

651
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,920
compatible with the canonical live patch service if that doesn't matter to you

652
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,000
then you'll be able to enjoy the improvements right along the kernel is

653
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,800
provided by the Linux as your kernel package and here are the highlights from

654
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,480
right from canonical infinite band and RDMA capability so you'll have more high

655
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,440
performance networking options available to you full support for accelerated

656
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,080
networking and Azure this is a huge one direct access to the PCI device provides

657
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,200
gains and overall network performance offering the highest throughput and

658
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:58,600
lowest latency for guests in Azure they have basically basically it's all of

659
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,040
these sorts of things right to make your virtualization less expensive 18%

660
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,600
reduction in kernel size hyper V socket capability and the very latest hyper V

661
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,320
device drivers and feature support available so it will now be used by

662
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,880
default if you spin up any Ubuntu 1604 LTS images on Azure but if you you can

663
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,000
check just you name dash are that will show that has a dash Azure in the name

664
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,520
if you don't want to use it you can install the regular stock kernel just

665
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:27,080
fine you just won't get those performance increases so you can also

666
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,000
still get support from canonical so really just business as usual but a

667
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,360
little bit more better tailored for Azure so that makes sense to you got to

668
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,320
be competitive it is interesting though like canonicals done they've been

669
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,240
working a lot with Microsoft between running on Azure the Windows

670
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,960
subsystem for Linux all that I'm sure they're not doing out of the kindness of

671
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,640
their heart a little bit of money a little bit of money on the sides here

672
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:54,080
yeah I know I see some speculation that maybe a bunch of wants to get wants to

673
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:59,120
get bought by Microsoft I don't know if that's the case or not but is there a

674
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,560
reason Microsoft wouldn't buy canonical I don't know all their stuff is Linux

675
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:10,040
focus so yeah unless Microsoft really really loves Microsoft loves Linux and I

676
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,640
think the real thing is Microsoft loves developers and Ubuntu has a lot of

677
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,920
developers how many of those tutorials you know you see by default that are

678
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:26,040
just boom right here right now okay so that's it for our Microsoft coverage

679
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:33,360
today but so we do have a little update just in the world of like Microsoft

680
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,560
loves next links is open source open source can be difficult so Rika are you

681
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:45,920
familiar with caddy no okay so caddy every site on HTTPS caddy is the HTTP

682
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:53,320
slash 2 which is the new version of HTTP it's a HTTP HTTP slash 2 web server with

683
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:59,040
automatic HTTPS so it's like a modern modern open source web server

684
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,200
lightweight recommended by experts it has secure defaults so unlike a lot of

685
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,920
you know you can install engine X even or like old Apache and have to do a lot

686
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:15,040
of work to get from like web 1.0 open everywhere port 82 I'm running a secure

687
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,720
modern patch web server caddy aims to make that just like you start it up it'll

688
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,000
serve your files it can integrate with let's encrypt to automatically get it

689
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,640
HTTPS enabled it has secure ciphers enabled by default all that stuff and so

690
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,600
it's been you know it's been praised by experts at usenix and NYU lug ACM all

691
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,000
kinds of stuff it's free for personal use there's commercial licenses available

692
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,240
and there's open source so you can go to their site caddy server comm you want to

693
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,520
find out more about actually using it but we are here to talk about a recent

694
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:53,840
blog post by Matt so this is titled the realities of being a FOSS maintainer

695
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,040
authors note here this is a more intimate look into what it's like to be

696
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,400
a maintainer of a popular open source software it's written by me personally

697
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,080
and not as a representative of the company I'm going down on a limb here so

698
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:09,800
try to be nice okay we'll try Matt don't worry so over the past few days I've

699
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,680
been inundated with well over 1,000 comments tweets emails messages and even

700
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,680
phone calls about Wednesday's announcement so what he's hearing is

701
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,920
that they've announced caddy commercial licenses so they were pleased to unveil

702
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,480
that we've been working digitally on fast past few months on caddy commercial

703
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,320
licenses the change has decided to accommodate the needs of the growing

704
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,920
caddy community and user base with commercial licenses were able to offer

705
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,000
exclusive features and services that parts key to our business users that we

706
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,720
couldn't do before while sustaining caddies open source

707
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,880
development we're even starting today with one new service for our customers

708
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,720
and more plan so you can read more about that if you want they have some like you

709
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,200
know if you use caddy for personal academic or nonprofit purposes not much

710
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,360
is different just a new response header that gives tribute to our sponsors it's

711
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,960
one part that was contentious if you use or distribute official caddy binaries

712
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,120
at work or as part of a product service you will need to a commercial license

713
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,160
based on how many instances you want to run concurrently official binaries are

714
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,960
produced by our build server I this website and get caddy comm with a commercial

715
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,240
license you can use this website to seamlessly download official caddy

716
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,400
builds blah blah blah if you automate installations or use direct download

717
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,880
links the URL syntax is changing slightly so that's like it right they

718
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,560
are now trying to like paywall basically there'll be a commercial license for

719
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,920
some features and services and their limitations for how you can use the

720
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,600
official binaries freemium freemium yeah totally so that's one you know that's a

721
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,920
model we've seen before so anyway lots of feedback interestingly most of the

722
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,320
positive reactions came from individuals who have met met me in person who are at

723
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,520
least somewhat acquainted with me online whereas every one of the negative

724
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,520
reactions stem from someone who has never met me or interacted with me in

725
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,560
other words there was not a single person who responded negatively or

726
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,880
unreasonably whom I knew or who could recall prior interactions with so if you

727
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,520
ever find yourself in a similar situation look at this statistic it

728
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,800
might give you some relief not everyone you know hates you okay so right after

729
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,520
right after this announcement he went on a research lab to retreat the mountains

730
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,240
had no internet connections so got some nice time away from the internet which

731
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,640
is always nice Matt's back now I want to take a few minutes to respond personally

732
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:18,360
and candidly about everything that's going on what he's learned what the

733
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:23,880
reactions have been like and just kind of a reflection so announcement day he

734
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,480
posted it on hacker news within nine minutes after someone had they posted on

735
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,160
Twitter after it was tweeted it was right on hacker news right at the top

736
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:37,040
the at that kind of that kind of makes sense right so it became very popular

737
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,320
he talks about forks here too so forking is a normal part of open source it's

738
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,080
allowed by the Apache license which is the license as long as you give

739
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,440
attribution and state all changes when one fork started a spinoff project on

740
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,760
Wednesday my co-founder Cory reminded me reminded them to remove the caddy name

741
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,400
and logo from the repo to avoid confusion with the caddy brand that's

742
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,320
also an important part of that spinoff was quick to change the name and leave

743
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,840
attribution and within minutes the issue was resolved and closed

744
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,120
unfortunately the response to this by spectators has largely been less than

745
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,880
professional and I think is along with some other reactions I discussed below

746
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,680
exposes a glaring community flaw in our open source community there was no

747
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,800
hostility in Cory's comments nor those of the projects maintainer both Cory and

748
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,280
the maintainer did the right things as has been seen so many times before

749
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,600
toxicity festers in open source because it's all too common for forks to ground

750
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,200
their motivation and enmity towards other projects this obviously isn't

751
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,960
healthy and we hope that the open source community will figure out a better way

752
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,800
to deal with negative sentiment than by creating new communities rooted in it so

753
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,360
they also removed the header basically had a header that would send back

754
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,080
thanking the sponsors of the server a lot of people just were like I don't

755
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,560
want these weird headers on every response that I send out of my web

756
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,960
server they say that although they did ask their sponsors about it before this

757
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,560
is implemented they didn't get any response so add this to the list of

758
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,000
things we're learning we'll do better over communicating with our sponsors in

759
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,120
the future sorry I don't know what else to say about this I guess there was a

760
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:05,200
lot of confusion as well around the EULA and the caddy binaries so really what at

761
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,840
the end is the open source code of the software's

762
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,800
licensed under Apache 2 and not under the end-user agreement so caddy is

763
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,680
still open source we go to extra effort to provide you with convenient binaries

764
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,560
customized just for you so the official binaries are licensed either for

765
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:24,280
personal or commercial use under this EULA so you get like the commercial ones

766
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,000
have like private plugin hosting and the future maybe some other features this is

767
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,880
really something we've seen before the build server is also not going to be

768
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,640
open source because it's just it only works for caddy and that's what they're

769
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,280
using to produce these binaries so some reflections one phone call I received

770
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,840
was from a friendly company it had associates associations with offering

771
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,440
their support and congratulations for the bold move it was much appreciated

772
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,680
I also have received dozens of tweets and DMs mostly from friends to those who

773
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,840
took a side were supportive thank you you didn't have to and it helped us

774
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,840
weather the storm from one human being struggling with the daily realities of

775
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,920
life to another thank you yeah I can I can that's nice sentiment there well if

776
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,240
you had criticisms of the change all of those were reasonable but none of them

777
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,460
could quite been down what it was that made the changes wrong to quote one but

778
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,760
the whole affair has made me extremely uneasy for a variety of reasons that are

779
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,720
really hard to put a finger on the crux of the opposition even according the

780
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,640
most well reasoned arguments was missing the best we could find is that was that

781
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,280
a commercial license out of reach of small startups that are bootstrapping or

782
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,440
don't have revenue yet we agree Cory and I are looking to a good way to handle

783
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,400
this so for now we encourage some startups to simply contact us with their

784
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,160
needs and ask about special pricing okay that's somewhat reasonable now we get to

785
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:40,280
the bad some feedback read opinions and advice we received had good intentions

786
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,080
but wasn't very well thought out or didn't have the necessary perspective of

787
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,520
project owner or maintainer to hold any water here I address some of them

788
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,640
candidly so why not offer a comprehensive support package instead we

789
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,680
tried this nobody bought it why not offer an enterprise solution or

790
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,560
consulting service we're two resource-constrained we could probably do it

791
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,560
but that would stifle almost all caddy development as well as my graduate

792
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,380
schooling and research so I have to pay to remove ads from my web server no your

793
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,800
company is required to pay for commercial use of official pre-compiled

794
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,720
pad caddy binaries not further removal of the caddy sponsors header you could

795
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,880
do that on your own anyway because the source is still Apache licensed further

796
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,000
our sponsors don't pay us for advertising the pay us for its ongoing development

797
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,720
to make the web better to support our customers who benefit from good web

798
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,520
servers and to keep caddy free for you to use the license frankly had nothing

799
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:29,200
to do with the header limit the free features instead and things like but

800
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,120
then I have to build from source to get what I want and yes that's the point

801
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,600
welcome to open source I do find it ironic that the open source community is

802
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,400
so irate about having to compile software from source to customize it the

803
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:44,360
way they want so he kind of just goes through talks about a bunch of the you

804
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:49,440
know a bunch of the problems just take donations then it really comes back to

805
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,240
how do we support how do you want to support open source this is how he

806
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,240
touches on this a little bit with the ugly I really don't want to focus on

807
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,720
this but now it must be talked about I've been balling these things up for

808
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,380
years I think the worst thing I saw this week was twofold the overwhelming

809
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,400
illusion of entitlement and subtle emotional manipulation based on a

810
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,320
misconception so there's like there's a lot more here it's a pretty long article

811
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,800
of his really is just mapping very candid they kind of talk about more the

812
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,800
pain here the emotional manipulation the entitlement that we're talking about

813
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:24,240
but they end with it with one final note here just want to emphasize how great so

814
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,600
many people have been several dozen individuals reached out over many

815
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:32,360
mediums to express their appreciation and even congratulations thank you thank

816
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,000
you for showing me the human side of an industry that is often dehumanized by

817
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,160
long distances screens and texting we expected some pushback as usual but the

818
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:44,160
extreme controversy this created was unforeseen sorry about that thank you to

819
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,940
all who responded quickly but at least reasoned out their comments before

820
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,320
writing them here's looking forward to what's next and we hope you'll be a

821
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,680
part of it with me so that was that was heartfelt whether you agree or disagree

822
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:59,400
whether you think that it's a good business model or not I think we should

823
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:06,560
talk about that but it's interesting to see such a candid response we could talk

824
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,320
about that a little bit before I do I just wanted to pop on over to the Linux

825
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,040
subreddit where there's also a discussion going along that sounds like

826
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:16,520
Synergy 2.0 is going closed source Synergy was one of those projects maybe

827
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,120
you've used it beard I don't know yeah a lot of people have you know especially

828
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,760
if you have a Windows or a Mac and you also have a Linux you want to share your

829
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,600
mouse and keyboard between those systems really works pretty great or even just

830
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,480
multiple Linux boxes or just multiple Linux boxes yeah I think for a long time

831
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,080
now not forever but for the past couple years Synergy kind of had the same thing

832
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,920
where you could pay and they would give you pre-compiled binaries but if you

833
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,600
didn't you know you had to build it from source yourself some distributions still

834
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,840
have it I think arch has it there's a couple other ones Debian maybe but you

835
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,040
know and I don't I've actually built it as well not a big deal I think what was

836
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,840
harder is like I don't know how to build that for Windows so it's a little more

837
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,520
difficult I don't have a Windows build build chain installed that sort of thing

838
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:02,600
it sounds like now for Synergy 2.0 they're removing some things from the

839
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,680
open source and the GUI will no longer be open source so if you want to pay and

840
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,720
support Synergy which if you use it I mean you definitely should consider

841
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:14,480
doing it sounds like the core will remain open source so you can still use

842
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,720
it it would probably be command line only you'll have to like write your

843
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,320
Synergy configuration file yourself I don't know I imagine this will still be

844
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,840
the same setup where you're gonna have to compile it yourself get Synergy core

845
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,520
check it out from github build it and then run it so there's definitely I

846
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,400
mean you can go check that out on reddit as well or the hacker news discussion

847
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,680
thread I'm sure we'll see some of the same elements that we just talked about

848
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:41,480
in the caddy post about entitlement about about changes there's one little

849
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,320
note though that there is a program called x2x which is apparently a pretty

850
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:49,280
decent alternative for X sessions who knows about Wayland though so I don't

851
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,840
know what are your what are your thoughts on this how do you stand are you the

852
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:55,480
type of person that doesn't want to ever pay for software do you do you know I

853
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,000
think currently pay for software I think if software is good it's worth paying

854
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:08,040
for yeah that's nice and simple yeah no I mean and it's like I can feel that too

855
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,680
because I think a lot of times things start open source check I'm scratching

856
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,680
my own itch or an itch I see in the community you start doing it things take

857
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:21,500
off like crazy like that's kind of what happened to caddy and then just like it

858
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,880
makes so much sense to me that you'll want to go like I want to go make that

859
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,720
my life like if you get so into this project you're spending so much time on

860
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,160
that you really want that to be the thing that you can work on day in and day

861
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,920
out or at least a part of that time you end up needing to have some sort of

862
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:40,120
revenue model and it's great when you can make that in a way that people seem

863
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:44,000
to like like support packages donations patreon's it seems like are pretty

864
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,800
popular in the open source community yeah but at the end of the day if you

865
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,760
like use and value this software it has to be whatever whatever is gonna work

866
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,160
both for you the users you the potential population that's going to be buying it

867
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,400
and for the actual maintainers and developers of it because they're gonna

868
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,360
have to spend all their time doing support and not be able to just you know

869
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,640
make the project better that might not be what's in everyone's best interest

870
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:11,840
and it depends on you know it's not everyone's red hat so may I jump in

871
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:18,480
absolutely so if I had a project that needs some of these premium features of

872
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,600
caddy I would probably jump on the caddy wedding as you said I'm ready to pay for

873
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,440
software if it's good otherwise if I have a basic project and all of a sudden

874
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,760
my project grows and I'm confronted to the situation that I have to pay for

875
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,360
per instance and so on maybe I would try to avoid this kind of software and it

876
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,840
would start with a software I know or because you're working as you said

877
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,960
you're working for a long time with a web server for example and if all of a

878
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,560
sudden you come to a point where you have to pay for instances if you launch

879
01:02:52,560 --> 01:03:00,120
your server then maybe it's not a good choice for me oh yeah no that's that's

880
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:05,480
fair but I appreciate that attitude of you know you're happy to pay for what

881
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,320
you use if you can but it may depend on what that you know what the distribution

882
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,800
model what the use of it how that looks in terms of like your actual

883
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:19,480
application workflows so that make that that makes a lot of sense

884
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,720
anything else you'd like to chime in there Mr. Minimac thank you for joining

885
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:31,240
us today we certainly appreciate you thanks okay so if you are now super

886
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,240
thrilled by all the possibilities of open source software and not so open

887
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,320
source but you know between Microsoft support between all the great projects

888
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:42,560
that exist for Linux Linux is a better platform than other to use so if you

889
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,800
want to become a part of it our last sponsor tonight is probably the best

890
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:50,320
possible way that is our friends over at Linux Academy head on over to Linux

891
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:55,160
Academy comm slash unplugged there and you will find just about the best

892
01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:00,320
resource possible on the web to learn about Linux so you can just you'll go

893
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,480
there just sign up what are you gonna get when you sign up well you're gonna

894
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,460
find this is not one of those sites that will teach you just about anything right

895
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:10,880
that's crazy now this is a site that will teach you about Linux and related

896
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,640
technologies you don't have to worry about hey am I gonna learn how to do

897
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,240
underwater basket weaving crochet any of that no they don't do that because

898
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,200
they're Linux experts and that's why all the features that they have show so like

899
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,280
one thing I use all the time nuggets I love those nuggets not only are they

900
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,960
delicious fried golden and tasty but they're like little tiny morsels of easy

901
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,760
to plan around time that just teaches you like one I mean some of them are

902
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,920
kind of big some of them are pretty small but you just get like one solid

903
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,280
new skill or command-line tool or you know whatever that concept is and the

904
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,080
way Linux Academy does it it makes it like they have they make it super easy

905
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,400
just but you know schedule and budget your time they tell you right up front

906
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,040
how long these things are gonna take and it's all customized to the OS that you

907
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,000
need so whether you're trying to learn CentOS for some reason maybe you've been

908
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,160
listening to Noah way too much or you're using Ubuntu like a sane person it

909
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:04,320
doesn't matter they're gonna customize the courseware automatically for you

910
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:08,720
which is awesome you have unlimited access to the courses they've got six

911
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:13,680
different cloud servers hands-on labs and exercises in-depth certification

912
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,920
training that's one of the best parts right there is like if you need to go

913
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,000
get a certificate sign up for Linux Academy they have great courses to help

914
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,080
prepare you for it they have real mentors and stuff that you can talk to

915
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:27,040
like humans and get help on your projects plus it's stacked full of JB

916
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,200
community members and they've got like team options too so you know if you have

917
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,120
a training budget at work Linux Academy is a great option managers can sign up

918
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,200
for it sign up whole teams it makes it really easy to track people you know

919
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,960
make sure that people are doing their courses see how far they've gone verify

920
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,120
that they are learning the skills that you're you know paying for that to be

921
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:49,400
used so whether you're big or small next Academy is a great option check out

922
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,840
their courses because they have like a ton of stuff AWS Google Cloud they've

923
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,720
got a ton of the Red Hat tests Linux professional Institute exams on here

924
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,840
maybe you want to learn OpenStack turns out it's super complicated maybe you

925
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,960
want to learn about Azure because you've just been so hyped up about our awesome

926
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,680
Microsoft coverage here on the Linux unplugged show or you just want to learn

927
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,000
all about DevOps so you can become a certified Jenkins engineer a Nagios

928
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,960
certified professional or take puppet 204 system administration using puppet it

929
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:21,840
really has become one of the go-to trusted places on the internet something

930
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,000
you can put on your resume they even have you know an easy way for you to have a

931
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,800
personal page that will show your accomplishments so if you are looking

932
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:32,080
for a job Linux Academy can be one of your best partners so head on over to

933
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:38,640
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and they can get started join us over in the

934
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:44,440
awesome Linux Academy community it sure is a lot of fun and you can learn a lot

935
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,800
of things about Linux I know Chris talks about a lot but when you will teach

936
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,120
yourself Linux sometimes you miss like random commands there's just so many in

937
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,800
core utils and others that like it's nice to sometimes go through like a

938
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,360
really structured course and you're like oh nice refresher that's how I do that

939
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:03,520
yeah exactly ah so talking about oldies and goodies here

940
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:12,000
introducing Firefox quantum it's now two times faster on the speedometer 2.0

941
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,960
benchmark I don't know what that benchmark is but that sounds really

942
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,760
freaking fast I don't know about you beard sounds like a JavaScript benchmark

943
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,440
maybe yeah it does so start your engines Firefox quantum lands in beta developer

944
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,040
edition engines are important both in cars and in browsers I don't know if you

945
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,200
know about that but that's why we're so revved up Mozilla writes because we're

946
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:36,200
releasing the beta of a whole new Firefox the version number 57 can't

947
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,800
really convey the magnitude of the changes we've made not since they copied

948
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,960
Chrome's crazy version in any way and how much faster this new Firefox is

949
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,960
that's why we're calling it Firefox quantum last October they announced

950
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,080
project quantum an effort to create a next-generation engine for modern

951
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:55,520
computers by leveraging technology from the servo research project which is the

952
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,480
project that partially helped create rust it has uses rust and is there a

953
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:03,320
next-generation browser so now we're finally seeing some developments of that

954
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:08,320
the R&D arm pays off since then the engineering team has been relentless in

955
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,480
their focus on making Firefox incredibly fast so there's already been

956
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,120
a ton of you know Firefox improvements we've talked about that a little bit

957
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:19,200
things like those containers speed improvements I remember Chris and I both

958
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:24,040
installing Firefox 55 and being pretty impressed with how much faster it was so

959
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,920
you know they're trying to run for example we've transformed Firefox to run

960
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,720
using multiple processes trying to strike just the right balance between

961
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:33,720
speed and memory usage plus they've got new things like web VR and web assembly

962
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:38,200
trying to make you know games other heavy what should be desktop apps but

963
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:42,320
now run in the web browser which I can only assume is good for Linux in the

964
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:47,160
long run Firefox quantum is also a big leap forward in that it's much faster on

965
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,220
many top websites so just like browsing your favorites I can think probably like

966
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:54,480
heavy fit websites like Facebook and other things is a way that you can

967
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,440
notice that and it turns out you can measure Firefox quantum speed too so

968
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:01,840
they're kind of obsessed with this data driven approach maybe you've heard of it

969
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:06,880
but you can go check out speedometer 2.0 which is a still in development

970
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,440
benchmark that simulates modern web application results vary based on the

971
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,480
computer and the apps that you're actively using but one thing that's

972
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:17,920
relatively consistent is that Firefox quantum is about two times faster than

973
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,080
Firefox of a year ago wow all right that's actually that's that's pretty

974
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,480
actually significant I think so take your own we can make your own

975
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:29,040
comparisons go try it out this is just the beta release but if you care about

976
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,240
this if you want Firefox to be better or you just are a big Firefox user you can

977
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:43,680
go check it out they even have a little video here oh come on Chrome that's so

978
01:09:43,680 --> 01:10:02,720
slow happy Firefox quantum music

979
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:21,800
yeah all right so uh it's not like a it's not a blowout but I would say it

980
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:30,880
certainly seems pretty competitive with Chrome these days so there you go

981
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,000
Firefox quantum I don't know about that name I mean quantum is a fun words and

982
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,880
all I don't know that I mean quantum doesn't really mean fast I don't really

983
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,760
know well well when they speed it up enough they can call it a Firefox

984
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:49,160
quantum leap oh that's definitely where they're going and I think Scott Bakula

985
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,240
will be there up on stage to help announce that when it happens so we can

986
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:56,120
look forward to that anyway we have a couple more links about Firefox I

987
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:59,000
figured we'd round out the show today with Firefox coverage honestly I've been

988
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,360
using a lot of Firefox at work Chrome has all of my personal stuff and I

989
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:07,120
didn't really feel like making a separate profile profile just for like

990
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:12,080
work stuff so I was like I'll just have a separate browser for a long time you

991
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,200
know it's just like stock Firefox from up on 216 that wasn't really cutting it

992
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:20,440
I was used to a lot of niceties from Chrome but once I installed it's actually

993
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,320
really easy I just downloaded the tar from Firefox extracted it under slash

994
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:28,600
opt now it self updates super easy to sideload it's kind of it's kind of

995
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,240
awesome there's a lot of nice features I've definitely noticed the process the

996
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:35,120
multiple process improvement there's still some like UX changes between

997
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,880
Chrome and Firefox that get me like I really like that Chrome has the

998
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:43,080
duplicate tab functionality that comes up helpful way more often than I would

999
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,200
have ever thought there's probably a Firefox add-on that gives you that I

1000
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,640
don't know I haven't looked at anyway we have a few more links just to round it

1001
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:56,600
out so like they do a deep dive here over at e rom org Eric roms blog

1002
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:02,300
Firefox memory usage in the quantum era so as a continuation of the are they

1003
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:08,960
slim yet series Firefox release 57 has a huge focus on performance as we've just

1004
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,920
heard so we've quantum all the things but we haven't really talked about

1005
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,360
memory usage which is something that often falls by the wayside in the

1006
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:18,880
pursuit of performance but honestly like especially these days like when I'm on

1007
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,280
not that nice of a laptop or frequently on smaller devices memory usage is one

1008
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,920
of the things I actually care about a lot and I know you were kind of like me

1009
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,960
beard and we have quite a few tabs open at one time do we not true yeah so

1010
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,040
Firefox actually does a pretty good job of suspending them I use the great

1011
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:39,960
suspender in Chrome to do that too so it's but it's like I would almost I

1012
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:45,840
would almost rather have better memory usage sometimes then speed because half

1013
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,760
the time I load one page and I'm gonna be on that page for a couple minutes

1014
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,560
yeah and so it doesn't I appreciate speed but I would definitely take

1015
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,920
memory usage first so it's interesting to see them talking about it so this is

1016
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,440
kind of a it's like a little bit technical blog post they've got some

1017
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:03,480
nice nice styling here to show you what's going on

1018
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:11,640
so I'm really excited to see these changes in Firefox I mean if you see the

1019
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:19,040
last changes you see in 40 54 55 really exciting and they continue to do that

1020
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:24,080
it's really cool I'm an all-time Firefox user I mean my first five books really

1021
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:31,000
was called firebirds if you're yes I do if I remember it was a one-man

1022
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,280
development at the start and then they took over and then Firefox has become

1023
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:44,160
their browser and I really love it and I won't change I have chromium aside but

1024
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:49,760
my all-time browser is Firefox oh yeah nice yeah it's nice to it's nice to see

1025
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,240
that I you know I remember back in the day convincing people that like

1026
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,920
Firefox was something they should check out hey get away from that evil

1027
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,680
Internet Explorer and it definitely felt like you know Chrome's a great browser

1028
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:05,000
they've done a lot of they've done a lot of great things I was recently reading

1029
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,160
about some like fuzzing of the Dom Chrome with their new with their web kit

1030
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:12,920
for blink has added a lot of security but Firefox you know there was a time

1031
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,400
where it really felt pretty stagnant and that kind of upset me and I had really

1032
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,960
sort of started preparing for a time where Firefox wasn't gonna be brought

1033
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:25,600
up that much but yeah it's true it became heavy at the time and then and

1034
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:31,080
now they have made some changes and and the last month you see the development

1035
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:35,880
and it's going in a good direction yeah exactly but I couldn't say that better

1036
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:40,080
so now I see some hope some momentum and hey I don't have to be ashamed to be a

1037
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,000
Firefox user I don't think I mean I'm also a crime user right who you don't

1038
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,840
have to limit yourself to one browser these days it's just nice to have

1039
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:50,160
competition so looks like they've done some good work here they've got some

1040
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:53,880
stats you can check out on various platforms memory usage tests but boy

1041
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:59,000
looks pretty great especially on Linux apparently edge has the highest memory

1042
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,320
usage on Windows which is a little bit strange because you think that would be

1043
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:06,280
exclusively what they could optimize for and Safari also doesn't doesn't look

1044
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:10,680
like it's doing so great in memory usage on Mac either that kind of surprises me

1045
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:16,960
Chrome is a hog we kind of all know that but it looks like on Firefox on a bunch

1046
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:22,720
of 16 is doing pretty great so overall they're pretty happy with other at but

1047
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,320
now our big performance pushes over they'd like to spend some more time

1048
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,960
focusing on dropping memory usage so we can start pushing up the number of

1049
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:31,320
content processes they'd also like to see like Mac OS was kind of a big

1050
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,760
regression for them in this so they're gonna spend some time investigating that

1051
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:37,680
as well which is always nice while I'm not a Mac user it's nice to see the true

1052
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:43,960
multi OS first class kind of support for this open source project one more I

1053
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:47,800
guess two more and then we'll get out of here today looks like there's a little

1054
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:54,880
sneak peek here client-side decorations will be coming to Firefox yeah so I

1055
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:59,120
don't know how you feel about client-side decorations but maybe

1056
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:05,680
Firefox is getting hip now meh yeah man okay fine beard I was trying to get you

1057
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:12,600
all riled up okay well then this last one this one's just for you oh there's

1058
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,600
two more things what am I doing there's just too much news today anyway Mozilla

1059
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:22,080
adds tracking protection to Firefox for iOS and focus gets multitasking focus is

1060
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,440
that new browser of theirs that's supposed to be lean and trim fast and

1061
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:31,040
just simple for focused reading while you're on your your device so yeah

1062
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:37,920
Firefox for iOS version 9.0 now available iPhone iPad etc they'll also

1063
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,180
have an automatic add and content blocking with private browsing mode as

1064
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:45,980
well as tracking protection in regular so that's great at the fees feature uses

1065
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:49,320
the same ad blocking technology and as Firefox focus for Android and iOS

1066
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,840
Firefox desktop and Firefox for Android so it's nice to see that they've really

1067
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:56,520
like kind of pulled up the stops here there's also better sync functionality

1068
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:01,640
and a bunch of other fixes and maybe the bigger thing Firefox focus now has

1069
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,440
multitask so multitasking capabilities that allow users to browse multiple

1070
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:10,040
websites simultaneously using tabs it seems silly that this is how we're now

1071
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,240
at and I think focus what a big focuses big thing was like didn't really have

1072
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,080
that you were focused on it I don't know if that like does this break kind of

1073
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,600
what they were doing or is it just a simple and pragmatic change that keeps

1074
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,200
things light and minimal but gives power users like a little bit more of what

1075
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:30,800
they're used to I'm not sure but it should not interfere with your private

1076
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,080
browsing experience nothing else should really change you just get tabs now so

1077
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:39,480
hey you one thing I was I don't actually use it right now because I just use

1078
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:44,640
Chrome but when I was on my Nexus 5 still I was using Firefox I was really

1079
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,240
pleased I like the Firefox for Android it's pretty snappy it was a lot faster

1080
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:52,760
than Chrome at the time I liked the way it did tabs I was kind of surprised

1081
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,880
because I hadn't really never really considered it as a real option as a for

1082
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,640
a mobile browser before what about you are you just Chrome through and through

1083
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,880
I'm Chrome everywhere all the Chrome desktop mobile everywhere yeah well so

1084
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,360
you're what you're telling me is that you're not even going to consider our

1085
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:14,360
final story for the day which is a new release of pale moon this is a major

1086
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:18,720
update further in general development of the pale moon browser so you can head on

1087
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:23,360
over to pale moon org slash release notes release notes dot s HTML go check

1088
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:27,440
those out for yourself maybe you're not familiar with pale moon pale moon is an

1089
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,360
open source go on a based web browser available for Microsoft Windows and

1090
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:34,520
Linux with other operating systems in development focusing on efficiency and

1091
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,640
ease of use pale moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser

1092
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,840
completely built from its own independently developed source that has

1093
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,520
been forked off from Mozilla Firefox code a number of years ago with carefully

1094
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,440
selected features and optimizations to improve the browser stability and user

1095
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,960
experience while offering full customization and a growing collection

1096
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,480
of extensions and themes to make the browser truly your own so I wonder if

1097
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:02,120
that mean they probably won't be getting those EME extensions we're all worried

1098
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:07,240
I'm so worried about I guess not yeah have you ever used pale moon nope yeah

1099
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:10,760
so you're probably not gonna be yeah I'm not gonna be checking out this new

1100
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,280
new release mmm probably not I don't know 2750 it's almost feels like old

1101
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:21,560
style Firefox versions there's got got a nice stuff improved MPE MP3 metadata

1102
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,320
parsing change window stuff bunch of user interface fixes a bunch of DOM

1103
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:30,800
improvements so I don't use it either but it's kind of nice to see that their

1104
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,240
development is proceeding according to plans it sounds like it's a big release

1105
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:37,880
I'm not gonna use it but it's just a testament I think today's theme might be

1106
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:43,000
hey open source is hard we all need encouragement so yeah here's to you pale

1107
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,320
moon I think with that that's that's it for

1108

1141
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,120
back in here regaliness of stories of Ubuntu the East Coast and I'm sure how

1142
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:26,360
scary and confusing New York City is we actually recorded an episode of user

1143
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:30,300
error today at the end of the week that will cover some of that as well awesome

1144
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:34,560

1145
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,400

1146
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,760

1147

1148
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:52,600
Poland for beard thank you all very much for joining us and sticking around for

1149
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:58,440
today's fun day of broadcasting we'll see you next week and JB reruns coming

1150
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:03,760
right up think the the next live show we should be bs now oh yeah that makes

1151
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,880
sense and there might be a whole crap load of coder at the end of the week

1152
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:12,440
whole crap load of coder so get ready for that apparently I just didn't do our

1153
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:16,640
post show here but whatever that's fine chromium will let you browse the web in

1154
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:21,040
VR with the daydream view headset so that's something I don't even know what

1155
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,680
that means really but I guess it just means that you can take your daydream

1156
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:28,680
headset hook it up to chromium and then a big wall of a browser a big browser

1157
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:34,560
wall yeah I think there was a new 3d file system a relatively new actively

1158
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:39,200
developed like that old Unix II one from Jurassic Park so that just feels like

1159
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:45,400
that I find it really amusing that they they they they hype the stuff when it's

1160
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:50,760
it's trying to put something that's inherently 2d in a 3d space yeah oh man I

1161
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,600
can see the corners of your website bro your website is basically a poster in a

1162
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:05,360
virtual world yeah right exactly
