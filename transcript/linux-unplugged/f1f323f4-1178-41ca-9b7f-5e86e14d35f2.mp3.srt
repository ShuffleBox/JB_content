00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 41 for May 20th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's digging through all of the

3
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,680
quote-unquote big data. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey Matt. So this week by

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,600
big data I mean we've got some results from the survey that we did last week in

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,520
the Linux Unplugged show. We asked folks to chime in with their home server

6
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,880
setups and I had some like I had some basic like do you have this installed do

7
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,240
you have this installed and then I left like these fields for like leave some

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,760
notes and that's where there's some really interesting stuff but I think

9
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,960
some of the other things that stood out for me is the cloud versus home

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,760
installation bias we'll talk more about that and then also just the massive

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,080
amount of people that listed Arch as their home server distribution.

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,760
Interesting. Which is funny. I'm not surprised. We just did an episode on that

13
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,720
right? Yeah we did. And I thought maybe I was going out on a limb but turns out I'm

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,640
behind it I'm behind the trend and we've also got the survey from our Linux the

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
Linux subreddit they do like an annual survey and they got a brand new one that

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,400
just came out it's actually it's getting to the size now where I think it's worth

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,280
talking about they had over 10,000 respondents from all different walks of

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,280
life on the Linux subreddit so we'll cover some of the results from that

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,440
coming up in today's episode but first I wanted to tease a couple of things just

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,040
let's just you know what like I'm just a hint bomb I'm gonna drop I haven't

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,120
showed you this to you Max I wanted to surprise you on the show I don't know if

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,040
you have the video stream up but just a little hint I do we have a little hint

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,840
now on the video stream of where things are going with how to Linux there is

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,560
chase Eric and I down in downtown Seattle on the beautiful Kerry at the

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,760
beautiful Kerry Park which is like the most picturesque version of Seattle you

26
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,680
have ever seen it's gorgeous so I won't say what we were doing but there might

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,360
have been some shenanigans happening yesterday some scenery some selfies you

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,760
know just some weird you know we were we were kind of making asses of ourselves

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,360
to be honest with you because it's a pretty busy park because it's so iconic

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,920
you know it's so like it's so like classic Seattle yeah and when there we

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,480
were kind of goofing around and people were actually to be true to be truthful

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,280
about it very patient with us because for the most part I mean every now and

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,160
then there was like some dog shenanigans going on and things like that and some

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,560
dog fights and and we sometimes like the reflector would fly away and go towards

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,240
a crowd of people yeah that was a possibility too so but it was funny gosh

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,520
it was a gorgeous day yesterday it's gorgeous day here today as well but

37
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,560
that's so yeah boy I just tell you what man that was that was some nice

38
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,200
shooting but that's not actually all this morning I wanted to talk about

39
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,520
before we get rolling I also have see if you can guess see I'll try to do it

40
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,600
before you see the video version on the stream see if you can guess what I have

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:24,040
in my hot little hands by this audio tone can you guess what I have in my

42
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:34,600
hands no that's the Intel sound man yes yeah I got the we just got it in studio

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:41,840
today this morning the Intel NUC D 5 4 2 5 0 W Y K H rolls right off the tongue

44
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,680
that's a gorgeous piece of hardware yeah this so this is the I wish I had my

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,120
box to join you this is the fatter NUC this this is a big fat on it's and the

46
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,640
reason for that is it can take a standard size SSD you know two and a

47
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,520
half inch SSD instead of that PCI little card you have to use so and it's not

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,880
that much bigger to be honest with you but now yeah so we're gonna have a

49
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,840
little this is gonna be a little dedicated Skype machine so we can do

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,880
some fancier Skype stuff here in JB one and you know we were really kind of like

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,280
okay how do we want to do this what is the best way to accomplish what we want

52
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,080
to do and the at the end of it it was like because we already had the SSD on

53
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:27,040
on-site it really meant all-in for a core i5 rig with I think it's I think we

54
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,920
get eight gigs or 16 gigs I can't remember eight gigs I think it was like

55
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,280
400 bucks from Amazon yeah 460 or something like that total and it's gonna

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,240
make you know it's just perfect for Skype it's it's small Rekai calls it

57
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
the glue of the studio cuz now we've got this is our second one and I believe it

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,760
these little it's just so much it's so much power in a little compact machine

59
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,400
and Linux is such a slam dunk on the NUC it's just really easy cuz it's all

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,360
Intel parts how much do they got well that one that one is yeah like also all

61
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,080
set after we bought the RAM and everything was like 460 or 480 something

62
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,220
like that but that's pretty good this is my five right yeah that's an i5 laptop

63
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,880
i5 with yeah but it has like the virtualization stuff yeah it's just a

64
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,220
really low undervolted underclock yeah I mean you get really low TDP yeah don't

65
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,240
get the most performance like you would if you went with a desktop i3 you you

66
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,640
know we get the same feature set just a little bit less performance but it can

67
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,400
turbo up there sometimes if it's not overheating yeah the one we've got now

68
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,480
in in production is usually around you know 1.8 gigahertz for each core which

69
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,440
for doing for doing HD Skype is more than enough it's really more than enough

70
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,960
so it's it's it's great or you know mumble or whatever that's gonna be

71
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,760
essentially like another call-in box that way we can take multiple Skype

72
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,120
video calls and things like that essentially like the communication hub

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,320
yeah and so having something that is low profile quiet like that and so

74
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,640
eventually the other nice thing is we can essentially add more I'm just we'll

75
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,160
just get a little shelf and put them on there and they have HDMI directly out

76
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,480
that goes into the capture machine they have one audio out port and then we use

77
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,360
one of the USB ports to add a USB sound card which we would do anyways so they're

78
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,280
pretty nice little machines so the one that I'm showing the picture on the

79
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,200
live stream is a nut too and this is an arch box run in gnome 312 and it's just

80
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,280
it's it's great it's it's sometimes needs restarted I've noticed that

81
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
sometimes these knocks need to be rebooted I don't know what's up with

82
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,200
that I don't know if it's the Intel driver or what have you updated the

83
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,400
firmware chiptap I don't know I don't think so oh because they don't or at

84
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,520
least mine never came with updated firmware so when I got it I updated them

85
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,680
and it seems to be better after about David Rick I might have you know the

86
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,600
thing what we've noticed is the HDMI audio out after like about 24 48 hours

87
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,800
starts to get crackly oh see I don't use the audio at all in mine so I wouldn't

88
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,800
know so maybe that's why I haven't noticed Rekha says he did update the

89
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,360
firmware yeah well what's cool about it is so so so they have an audio out jack

90
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,000
plus then we have the USB sound card so that we can like you know so we have

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,840
this so audio comes in over USB or goes out depending on the setup and then we

92
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,800
also have an audio out over HDMI and because it's the Intel Iris graphics the

93
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,980
driver works pretty much flawlessly so after your base install of even you know

94
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,480
and it makes an arch setup super simple after your bachins base install you've

95
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,040
got working HDMI mirroring with audio signal so for us that means one wire to

96
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,380
the capture machine and we can get the desktop picture and the sound from the

97
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,080
machine without having to run any other wires which leaves those other audio

98
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,640
interfaces available for other things and so it it's it's a great combination

99
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,960
I really am impressed with these boxes and I think I wonder why Intel is the

100
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,600
only one selling these because it seems like people could be relabeling these

101
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,920
maybe people are oh I think like gigabyte does so yeah gigabyte uses a

102
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,600
more powerful chip in the brain yeah and then you have that company that makes

103
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,320
the orange box they also do a whole line of nick things yeah those guys figure

104
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,160
what they're called no I'm not they have an i3 version that's only 299 or 289 yes

105
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,040
yeah they do yeah I went with the higher processor just so that way we have a

106
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,480
little more flexibility what we use it for right because a lot of times thinking

107
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,040
for me I maybe just get the cheap yeah you know it'd be great for like a

108
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,120
visuals machine for BSD now because it's super small and it's just out of the way

109
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,440
and I went with the i5 because here in the studio I have found that every

110
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,160
piece of gear ends up getting used for all kinds of different stuff that you

111
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,800
would never expect it and and so I try to just sort of hedge my bets when I'm

112
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,360
buying studio equipment and I err on the side of more power so that way when it

113
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,840
ends up doing something I never planned for it's a capable for doing the job but

114
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,560
if you would like this is always gonna be email web you know it's it's it's

115
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,320
always gonna do like maybe one VM something like that you could go lower

116
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,160
power I think oh yeah I can think of so many uses for those boxes yeah so many

117
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,800
yeah I think calling them the glue is a good description and you know I've seen

118
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,840
some pushback on our coverage of the Ubuntu orange box people are like this

119
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,360
is like there's a thread right now in the subreddit it's like what's the

120
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,000
actual use case for something like this I I think people undersell the NUC and I

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,640
think I think it's I think that's why I maybe it's because I've had so many good

122
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,400
experiences with the NUC now I started off feeling like it was a finicky

123
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,800
device and I still think there's some I think still has some esoteric rough

124
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,780
edges but I think it's I think it's gonna revolutionize some production

125
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,320
stuff it's what one of my opinion all on the NUC NUC is a great workstation it

126
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,720
could be a great media center but at the end of the day it's not gonna make a

127
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,280
good data center you can actually exactly a whole portable data center

128
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,640
with that Ubuntu orange box yeah that's just what I'm seeing yeah I could use

129
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,960
that yeah exactly for a data center there's something like the the super

130
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,080
micro iCloud it's like three use and fits ten i3s and it's probably more

131
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,000
practical yeah Alan what I'm talking about is basically people who want to

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,560
build their own data center and don't have that much space so right well three

133
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,720
uses enough only like three pizza boxes well yeah that's true you know it's

134
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,120
heavier and harder to carry around whereas the orange box has those carry

135
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,200
handles and stuffs it's super portable in that case so you can take one of

136
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,640
those data center and a truck those half-use sleds and put one in a case like the Nuc

137
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,040
is but it's sorry the orange box rather is but well there were a bunch of places

138
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,520
I used to do this with Mac Mini's I was just gonna say that do that I was just

139
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,800
gonna say the Mac Mini they're still around it's Mac Mini polo dot net I

140
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,160
still haven't made the money back yeah you go Matt you send him a power PC Mac

141
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,360
Mini and you could run things the power on those I mean like because they're

142
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,040
really they weren't powerful but they were real consistent I don't know how to

143
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,760
describe that better they just the power something about the power piece oh the

144
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,800
power PC chip was solid yeah I thought that was a great machine I agree and I

145
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,680
couldn't bring myself to throw it away yeah yeah why am I looking at buying a

146
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,440
NUC right now I'm supposed to be having dinner I'll tell you about something

147
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,520
else you should consider buying because it's mobile that makes sense and that's

148
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,160

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,480
air but here's why you'd want to go there once you're there you'll you'll be

153
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,640
amazed at Ting because it's no contract mobile and you only pay for what you use

154
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,320
it's a flat six dollars per month and then it's just taxes and your usage on

155
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,680
top of that so like in my case I have two phones on my Ting account and I end

156
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,200
up paying a very very low rate because both myself and Rekai who's the other

157
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,320
person on my account are very smart about our data usage we're primarily Wi-Fi

158
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,320
users because we're pretty much either here at the studio or somewhere else that

159
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,600
has Wi-Fi and then you know of course when I'm driving I'm careful with that

160
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,480
that makes my monthly bill with two phones generally unless we have a big

161
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,320
day where we have to tether or something like that for you know several days in

162
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,560
row and Comcast is totally biting the dust you know that because that'll go up

163
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,640
a little bit but even in that scenario it was like forty four dollars for two

164
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,760
smartphones that's for a Nexus 5 and an HTC one and that's with everything picture

165
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,400
picture messaging hotspot tethering included with that plan it's just use

166
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,120
it's just your usage they bail they bill on the usage not on the gimmick and

167
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,240
that's what makes Ting stand out so go to linux.ting.com because that's gonna

168
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,120
take $25 off your first device and they've got a whole new slew of devices

169
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,680
including the beautiful HTC one m8 that is unquestionably one of the best

170
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,160
Android phones on the market now one of the big improvements they made over the

171
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,120
HTC one is considerable battery improvements which I think is awesome

172
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,000
and a little sleeker design of course and a few other things they've got

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,960
Samsung Galaxy s5 as well they have new mid-range and entry-level phones and I

174
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,120
was taking a look at the Moto X on Ting check this out you buy this Moto X if

175
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,120
you go to linux.ting.com it's gonna cost you three hundred and fifty six dollars

176
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,840
that's an unlocked phone that you own that you're only paying for the usage

177
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,680
you're not in a contract it's $356 that's not the cost where they're

178
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,920
spreading it out over a two-year contract without and gouge you that's

179
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,280
you pay it and you're done and then it's just what you use after that for a

180
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,040
Motorola X and some folks say this is one of the best Android phones ever made

181
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,480
that's unbelievable so go over to linux.ting.com and check out what they've

182
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,160
got to offer and try out their savings calculator put your current bill in

183
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,800
there and then check out the difference and tell me you couldn't go get

184
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,080
yourself a new computer every couple of years on that money you'd save it was

185
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,980
unbelievable for me linux.ting.com and a really big thank you to ting for

186
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:40,720
sponsoring Linux unplugged getting us into our 40s Matt it's so crazy all

187
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,920
right hard to believe we're in the 40s already I mean it's like where'd that go

188
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,720
I know right that really did go fast so I'm just reposting in the chat room

189
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,220
right now a Google Doc that's it oh hi that's the problem oh you're the problem

190
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,840
you are the Samsung can be hi we were discussing a side conversation well

191
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,600
we're back I'll let you finish it up in the post show sorry I just jumped right

192
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,760
back in I just posted in the chat room if you guys want to take a look at it to

193
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,240
the survey results the Google spreadsheet results from the home

194
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,180
server survey that we did last episode and rocks like everybody has a home

195
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,320
server yeah seriously yeah so rotten I don't what what jumped out at you

196
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,440
initially when you looked at the results the majority of people using the home

197
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,960
for their home server is heavily in backups and media for likes file storage

198
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,680
like media servers and stuff like that but also it's a lot of hate against

199
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,120
using cloud services yeah it was sort of well go ahead that's pretty easy to

200
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,400
explain the average user has like what a megabit of upload baby yeah even even

201
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,900
high-end people like me only have five megabits of upload yeah well try to

202
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,360
upload a couple of terabytes that way well there's other uses in just in file

203
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,480
storage and back yeah yeah right so you know I like knowing where my stuff is

204
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,120
and I this was a home server survey but that jumped out at me too rotten when I

205
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,920
was looking through this essentially like out of out of how many do we get a

206
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,600
hundred and what was it I think hundred fifty five respondents hundred fifty

207
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,000
eight respondents like two of them are using like a host somewhere to be their

208
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,240
home server and like VPN into it and in like both cases like it's because of bit

209
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,000
torrent sync and maybe like plex or maybe more than two but it's like almost

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,880
just two and in in all cases where they're using cloud hosting it's for bit

211
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,800
torrent sync and in some cases plex and I was I was surprised it was that strong

212
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,600
of a difference because it's there was a huge standout what about you it what

213
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,480
stuck it what stood out to you when you were looking at the results you know

214
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,720
actually I I see a lot of flex when I look at these results yes a lot of media

215
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,080
serving yeah couch potato and some other stuff I've never even heard of like sick

216
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,280
beard oh yeah well we covered sick beard recently but that does seem to be really

217
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,520
popular yeah which is good it's good and it's ab nzb which kind of goes along with

218
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,760
six beard sick beard and I didn't participate in the survey but a lot of

219
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:13,680
these people and I are in perfect sync like that with bit torrent sync you know

220
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:20,720
I use all the time yeah and plex yeah and network backup I a few folks are

221
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,120
using tiny tiny RSS which makes me happy because I think that's a good project

222
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,240
and it was a great Google reader replacement use that as well you know

223
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,200
what jumped out to it jumped out at me is not as much own cloud as I expected

224
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,040
there is definitely a fair amount of own cloud representation but not quite as

225
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,040
much that's just because you know in my opinion I've talked about this before

226
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,640
it's a pain in the butt to set up and then once it does get set up it's like

227
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,840
sometimes it screws up and maybe that's just the database back end or something

228
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,160
I just honestly don't know but yeah there's a lot less own cloud I see one

229
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,400
or two things of own cloud on here but not much I like some of these that some

230
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,920
of these guys gave us a total like like a list out of their drives and all that

231
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,720
kind of stuff if you are considering jumping into a server and you want to

232
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,520
see some of this stuff this is a really good resource we'll have it linked in

233
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,280
the show notes here's an example of somebody who has a DVR running on fedora

234
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,840
20 but he's planning to change it to archie says 2 terabyte hard drive 4

235
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:22,560
gigs of RAM he's got myth TV subsonic xbmc plex and of course SSH so many

236
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:29,840
folks so many folks using plex so many plex users very dominant there's also a

237
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,080
lot more arch than I would expect it yes and you know what a lot more arch

238
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:41,120
almost almost a majority of arch and also a few mentions of free BSD in here

239
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:50,960
and a lot of free NAS too so here's a good one I liked this one this guy's got

240
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,560
sab nzb couch potato plex uses his network backup and then a git annex

241
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,480
which a git server is a really good idea he says I think the main importance for

242
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,400
the NAS will be enough storage being able to put whatever I would like on

243
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,080
there he says I do monthly ZFS scrubs I do snapshots every day with the ZFS

244
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,400
tools and then I use ZFS send to send my data to another storage device in

245
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,040
another place which I thought was really good he said he likes to do our sinks

246
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,360
for simple backups duplicity for Windows duplications and BUP BUP one of the best

247
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,720
backup utilities out there which sounds familiar but I haven't checked it out I

248
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:33,440
don't think really cool results I really liked going through this and yeah like

249
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,720
other people have picked up on arch really stood out in in this survey arch

250
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,280
really stood out and I wanted to talk about that a little bit because we just

251
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,520
did us we just did an episode about building the ultimate home server on

252
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,480
arch and before we went on the air I thought maybe I would get a lot of

253
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:58,440
feedback that I was crazy I was being too on the edge I I was using a toy

254
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,200
operating system for a serious task and I was being irresponsible it's honestly

255
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,400
what I I kind of projected what I thought if I was looking into what the

256
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,320
future what I thought the feedback was gonna be and I would say overall it has

257
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,240
been very positive we had a very good response to Sunday's episode the

258
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,600
ultimate you know a home server arch home server the arch home server

259
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,160
challenge that we did and this the survey results here which is funny I

260
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,400
didn't I didn't want to look at this before I did the episode because I

261
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,400
didn't want to like cheat and like do oh that looked cool I want to do that I

262
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,640
wanted to build the thing I wanted to build and then follow up this on Tuesday

263
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,960
so when I opened this up this morning to look at this I was kind of floored and

264
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,320
then combined with all of the really positive feedback that we got and a lot

265
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,640
of folks saying yeah I run arch 2 that was sort of revealing to me and I

266
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,920
thought I've been wondering if maybe you and I just sort of happened to

267
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,920
serendipitously and thanks to the chat room as I've been reminded to point out

268
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,120
switch to arch it's sort of a time when arch is reaching sort of a mass momentum

269
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:04,200
and despite I think so yeah and despite how hard the arch project seems to try

270
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,760
to make it hard for people to adopt it seems to somehow keep happening and then

271
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:15,760
we just got these results of the 2014 reddit linux subreddit is that hey yeah

272
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,840
the subreddit for the linux art is like what our slash linux yeah our slash

273
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,000
linux subreddit and they've done these for a while but a couple of years ago it

274
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,440
was taken over by somebody new and I think he's been doing a good job with

275
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,000
this and so I wanted to cover his results and chat with you guys about

276
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,320
this and you know I mean these are just these were results they were posted on

277
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,920
a subreddit they made it sticky for a while you know so I take it for what it

278
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:51,320
is they had 10,292 respondents which is up from 7,698 last year and the year

279
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:59,000
before that it was 4,932 so a lot of growth and it seems our linux itself has

280
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,520
grown a lot in the last year so you combine the growth of linux itself with

281
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,840
the with the linux subreddit and then the fact that the mod stick it it they

282
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,440
had some pretty good results and so they asked folks do you use linux on

283
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,680
non-server computers and of course like 96 of their respondents 96% of the

284
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,600
respondents yes because they're in the subreddit do you use and then they asked

285
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,800
them do you run linux on any of your server computers and 58% of people

286
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,520
responded yes when they asked for fun or profit for fun 66% of people for profit

287
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,360
27% of people so that's all kind of interesting but what I thought really

288
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,280
stood out is this next survey question what linux distro distro do you

289
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,920
primarily use on your non server computer what is the out of all 10,000

290
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,080
respondents what is the number one distribution arch not Ubuntu it's arch

291
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:57,880
it's arch linux 64% on the server 36% on the desktop overall I just thought that

292
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,280
was pretty stand out here's a couple of bits of differences Debian has replaced

293
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,960
linux mint for position number three elementary OS has quickly gained a

294
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,920
following putting in position number six Zubuntu has dropped to position number

295
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:14,080
seven after elementary OS and crunchbang has risen above kubuntu and gen 2 for

296
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,200
position number eight and kubuntu has dropped off the top ten making it in

297
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,680
position 11 now I don't know about you guys but my gut for some reason gives

298
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,280
more credence to this survey then the top ten results on distro watch no

299
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,600
disrespect to the distro watch folks but for some reason distro watch is based

300
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,800
on just clicks on their website it's very right right and this seems like I

301
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,160
mean I don't have a strong impression of the user base of our Linux but it seems

302
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,480
to be a wide mix and in fact if anything I would have labeled them as anti arch

303
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,160
Linux to tell you the truth I would have said they kind of hate on arch a lot in

304
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,160
the I disagree I think I think that they're I think you're definitely gonna

305
00:22:52,160 --> 00:23:02,320
have a mix but I would say they're more anti boon to I've seen like a bigger

306
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,000
group of purists for sure but they're definitely pretty pretty set in their

307
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,560
ways yeah also they should have looked at the the survey should have also

308
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:14,160
included the the basis so they should tell you like elementary OS is based on

309
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,160
a bunch of so they should point out like how much space in a bunch of yeah well

310
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,120
then you lost this place because of fragmentation possible well you could

311
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,560
make that same argument about Debbie and then sure but it's more I think it's

312
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,560
there's the the more important part is that they they did the survey for like

313
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,040
people to fill out the survey like three weeks before Ubuntu released 1404 yes

314
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,640
and that would have skewed the results massively in that pay in that way well

315
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,440
they should have it should have skewed the results towards Ubuntu because the

316
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,920
Ubuntu hype was at an all-time high before the 1404 but people weren't

317
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,400
using it it was asking what are you currently using people are probably

318
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,000
waiting to use it well I know I would think they'd be using a book do don't

319
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
you think and don't you think more Ubuntu users would be trolling the our

320
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,640
Linux subreddit for news about the Ubuntu release than normal and there's

321
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,200
a lot of people who went from there's people who went from arch to 1404 and

322
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,320
have been using it for a while there's even a couple blog posts about it but I

323
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,160
know it's just it's not that it's saying that they it's just the timing was

324
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,120
where they could have waited a month I don't know I I think if anything doing a

325
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,680
survey as the weeks leading up to the next major release of anything gives

326
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,080
more attention to Ubuntu and it's getting if anything I think that's

327
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,720
actually more of an indictment of the poor showing of Ubuntu hmm but I could

328
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,880
be wrong our could be nothing you know all of this could mean nothing let's

329
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,240
keep that in mind here's I want a couple more things just to just as for us to

330
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,600
chew on what Linux distro distro you primarily use on your non server

331
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,920
computers so this is fun versus profit number one distribution people use for

332
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,620
fun arch Linux no surprise there when it comes to profit only 15% of them use

333
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:55,100
arch which is not too surprising Debian does a strong showing at 23% as does

334
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:02,320
fedora for profit 28% fedora came in at number two for fun at 71% now what did

335
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,440
what other Linux distro do you use on your non server computers Debian played

336
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,720
showed very strong here followed by Ubuntu and arch Linux but through this

337
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,400
whole thing arch does really good now here's here's an interesting one more

338
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,400
people using Linux on laptops than on desktops not by a huge huge number but

339
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,480
by by a pretty good number with that that number though because he set it up

340
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,840
where it was laptops and tablets are the same answer yeah but who's running who's

341
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,400
running Linux on the tablet people could be considering Android or you know a

342
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,920
bunch of touch yeah yeah but you know it does kind of get to the point where I do

343
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,320
run Linux on my laptop but I also run Windows on my gaming desktop for those

344
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,880
windows right games right yeah I think there's some folks that do that so yeah

345
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,560
Debian it's interesting too for server distributions Debian was the top

346
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,520
followed by Ubuntu then sent OS number three then arch in number four or it's

347
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,440
Linux at number four then followed by right at Enterprise Linux that's that's

348
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,640
got to be because of the demo that's got to be the demo I would think yeah

349
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,840
although just because they make the most money doesn't mean they have the largest

350
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,840
install base and then which Linux distro do you primarily use on your

351
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,240
server computers fun versus profit Debian again is up there now I thought

352
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,600
that was kind of funny too they get into the desktop scene and they ask folks

353
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:29,800
like what desktop and what's your favorite Linux GUI gnome 3 really no

354
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:36,400
wow that surprised me yeah yeah well I actually went and arched it and

355
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:44,600
put the good man on it I am too yeah I'm doing gnome 3 on the ultra pro right now

356
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,840
and I love it it's growing on me I'm actually a big fan of gnome 3 except is

357
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,120
it mutter yeah mutter is the it's not it's not working very well for me so

358
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,720
I've had a few crashes just because of mutter and so it may be kind of locked

359
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,640
me down and not be nice gnome 3 yeah yeah but as when I did use it it's it's

360
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,440
pretty awesome Katie Katie that's number two oh go ahead there Devlin make your

361
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,600
point yeah that actually makes me question now that we've been seeing like

362
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,840
the cutie and GTK fight going on if gnome shell is gnome trees being so

363
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,520
successful in terms of usage in desktop wouldn't that mean that kind of GTK 3 at

364
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,640
least is getting some attention there yeah I mean maybe this momentum will

365
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,280
keep them relevant so what what do you guys think what is the most hated Linux

366
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:45,560
graphical environment any guesses unity by a freaking ginormous margin ginormous

367
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:51,720
margin which honestly feels a little unfair in fact he even points out that

368
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:59,280
the hate for unity is actually up over previous years so now I think that

369
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,040
improves so much well that comes to people more people being exposed to it

370
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,880
now because it's it's in the mainline version go ahead there is the second

371
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,920
most what I see here is like it seems like the power users that being are the

372
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,000
ones that are actually actively in these communities and participating on the

373
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,960
voting and stuff and the result is that those are the users that feel that they

374
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,720
got kind of left out yeah the newest choices right and as a result it goes

375
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:35,360
back to yep pretty much yeah you got it and let me tell you something else I

376
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,560
think what this shows you is and this is my this is my connection here but I

377
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,000
think one of the reasons why arch is seeing such strong performance is

378
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,640
because it's a great distribution to run gnome and what's the number one desktop

379
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,160
everybody loves gnome so what do people run on their desktops in this survey

380
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,520
arch what's the number one desktop environment they're using gnome so it is

381
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,520
interesting that because nobody even though fedora does a pretty good job

382
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,920
nobody has gotten off their dumb asses to make a good gnome 3 implementation so

383
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,880
arch is eating their lunch in the power users and I think I think we as Linux

384
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,840
users need to change our perspective because we always talk about these

385
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,200
magical pony new users who show up from magical land and just want to say please

386
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,120
sir give me some Linux because that's of course how new users operate so we're

387
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,480
always talking about these mythical new users and in reality it is those of us

388
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,040
who've been running Linux for over a decade now that are still here we're

389
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,920
still relevant we're still buying products and guess what we like gnome we

390
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,120
like arch Linux because we have evolved our tastes over time not all of us and

391
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,440
I'm not disparaging anybody who hasn't but I think there is a vast majority of

392
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,360
longtime Linux users who are sick of the distribution crap and politics they want

393
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,280
these kids off their lawn they just want to get a good damn desktop use the

394
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,360
latest software and that's what they want to do all day long and let the kids

395
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,120
fight it out they can go do whatever they need to do and personally maybe I'm

396
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,320
just bringing my own baggage into this but I think I might be representing a

397
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,440
large crowd here and I think these numbers might back that up what do you

398
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:18,760
guys think I don't think it's your own your baggage I mean when gnome shell

399
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,800
started came out people were bashing at it I looked at what they were trying to

400
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,960
achieve and it pleased me I didn't like the implementation at the moment so I

401
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,680
didn't jump right right away to using it but yeah that's how I was to know

402
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,320
crossroads crossroads do you uh what do you think do you think this is a me

403
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:45,040
bearing my own baggage well the thing about no gnome 3 and are just arch

404
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,200
doesn't really do a lot there I mean the whole thing is you know upstream and all

405
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,480
that kind of stuff but Fedora really pushes gnome a great example of this is

406
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,600
gnome software still does not run on arch because package kit on official

407
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,640
arch repos is zero dot seven dot six and gnome software requires zero dot eight

408
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:12,400
dot one I think yeah and it doesn't build as I've tried I can't I can't get

409
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:19,560
it to build and so it really it's Fedora is pushing gnome Fedora is the epitome

410
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,680
of gnome all right Colonel Linux why don't you play devil's advocate for me

411
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,680
so I don't disagree with what you're saying yeah you make a very good point

412
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:34,720
but what but taking that attitude of you know we're the power users and and and

413
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,960
cater to us that's great for one desktop and and we have that but that I think

414
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,200
where these companies like canonical are coming in where they're trying to craft

415
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:51,600
the the unity desktop is we want to want to further we want to spread the idea of

416
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,840
Linux and new users are turned off to Linux primarily because there's people

417
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,960
like us that say well listen I can do everything from the command line and

418
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,920
that works really really well and it's really really efficient I mean you just

419
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,680
talked a couple episodes ago about how efficient crazy efficient it is to be

420
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,960
able to do things from the command line but that scares new users off and so if

421
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,080
we want to reach past 10% of the market share we have to create a welcoming

422
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,440
desktop I think that's the other side of the argument right I agree yeah and that

423
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,560
then and that what that what that means is it doesn't minimize the open seusses

424
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,160
and the Ubuntu's and and the fedoras and the manjias and all of these things

425
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,680
because they obviously have a role to play in this but what I think it does

426
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:34,000
mean is there I think there has been this group of Linux users who kind of

427
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,940
have just been overlooked because we're so busy thinking we know what's

428
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,120
best for everybody and thinking how we're gonna get more users we're so

429
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,240
we're so worried about getting more people using Linux that we kind of just

430
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,520
forget about this group who I think is is trying to show their voice in these

431
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,120
results and I but I at the same time doesn't mean you cater exclusively to

432
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,160
them I think that would go I think I think that would that would that would

433
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,280
stagnate the adoption of Linux absolutely I agree with you Noah all

434
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,520
right Riley you had a you had a point for unity I wanted to get to that

435
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,240
actually said unity is actually almost underrated because like the only thing

436
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,840
people ever use unity on is Ubuntu and people just don't like Ubuntu for

437
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,360
whatever our reason but if you actually tried it on Arch it's actually pretty

438
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,040
awesome I've been using it for like two weeks now I can't believe how stable it

439
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,700
is are you using the mooo OS or did you just load it on no I just did it I did

440
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:32,080
the repo method is it the 1404 yeah it's the same version in 1404 it's got

441
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,160
like all the new global menu stuff all that I like that idea we should do a

442
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,720
poll and find out what desktops the chat room and the and the unplugged users use

443
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,120
now there is a caveat with that though cuz Eric installed it he said this week

444
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,280
and his GTK stuff got messed up on the other desktops so if you're you need if

445
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,600
you're gonna use unity just to use unity don't try to use other stuff with it

446
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,080
yeah correct yeah correct yeah it kind of borked my machine and I didn't back

447
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,240
it up before so or that partition anyway so I ended up having to just nuke and

448
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,280
pave my arch install that kind of applies to Ubuntu as well if you use

449
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,520
unity you just use unity yeah that's true you know when I loaded LXQT on my

450
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,480
Ubuntu 1404 install I was a little bummed because the menus were so jammed

451
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,480
full of just all kinds of junk that unity kind of does a good job of not

452
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,840
putting in your face but when you go to something as a more traditional menu

453
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,440
structure oh it was it was like I was feeling the presence of unity and all of

454
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,080
the system setting all of that stuff but you know that's what you get when you

455
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,200
install something over a desktop so that's any no thing you know I should

456
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,000
stop into a spot but it would you mind going to straw poll dot me and making a

457
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,880
poll of like just say what's your desktop environment and just put like you

458
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,880
know some of your some of the top ones in there and give me a link I'll in fact

459
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,960

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,740
pricing plans they have hourly pricing I don't mention that enough and so if you

491
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,440
guys just need to do a little bit of testing you can go get a digital ocean

492
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,280
account use our promo code unplugged May and try the hourly pricing you will

493
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,680
probably be able to run that machine for quite a while with that $10 credit

494
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,960
that is a great way if you just want to run it for a couple of hours I've got

495
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,840
emails from folks that do build projects up there they do some quick

496
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,840
syncing and they shut it down try it out try out their hourly pricing you might

497
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,560
find that works really well for you and also if you get stuck when you're trying

498
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,980
to deploy something go look at their community section they've got some

499
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,960
really good tutorials that people have written up like here's an example how to

500
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,920
use bit torrent sync to synchronize directories and Ubuntu 1404 one of the

501
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,360
things I noticed in our survey was a lot of folks who are using cloud hosting are

502
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,760
using that now as their own method of backup because it's just a really good

503
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,720
way for you to be able to control your data and backup and there's all kinds of

504
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
things that are in here it's not just bit torrent sync of course there's all

505
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,320
kinds of server-side applications you might need a little help they've got

506
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,160
tons and tons of pages and their current and up-to-date because they've got a

507
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,480
really passionate community digital ocean comm and use the promo code

508
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,160
unplugged me to get that $10 credit and a big thank you to digital ocean for

509
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,120
sponsoring Linux unplugged loves it so I'll jump back in here how we how we

510
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:32,720
doing are we working on the pole okay yeah so once you submit it it'll it'll

511
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,120
make a little link that you can copy at the top you just you can drop off the

512
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,280
results a little slash R and then try toss out the chairman we'll have the

513
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,120
chatroom vote and get an idea of what their poll is I'll vote to and we'll put

514
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,440
that out there but I might have too many options it's not good letting me oh

515
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,760
really you guys put that what are the desktops you put in there what are they

516
00:38:52,760 --> 00:39:01,440
oh gosh we put in no Michelle Kate unity Katie e X of CE LX DE LX QT mate i3

517
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,320
awesome ex-nomad Pantheon cinnamon flux box open box TWM window manager e17

518
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,600
that's probably the problem that's just the shell there's a few you can easily

519
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,720
take out like JWM you can take that out yeah this is what happens when a

520
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,760
committee comes up with some of it if also some of them you maybe just

521
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,480
combine a bunch of the very very simple yeah let's do that yeah that's a great

522
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:35,560
idea XFCE and LXD yes we should just say tiling or something all right UT is not

523
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,720
it's not even final yet let's give you to be in there dear Devlin has something

524
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,120
he wants to add to the to the discussion let's him go ahead even though I

525
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:47,280
personally use a tree most of the time and I use gnome tree when I go out in

526
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,240
public and if I'm going to a place full of noobs I go with something more that

527
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,000
will be more user-friendly to them even though my personal preference is I tree

528
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,680
in that scenario I think it matches well and I think a lot of us kind of do that

529
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:11,160
we've seen that at least in the in the Linux best stuff like that people go and

530
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:17,320
use their technical stuff but when they go into to meet new users it's just that

531
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:27,200
becomes so simpler to to show something up yeah all right so I wanted to open up

532
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,200
a topic to the to the room here so now everyone is free to move about the

533
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,600
cabin one thing I thought it'd be kind of fun because we are obviously a bunch

534
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,000
of Linux enthusiasts slash advocates we're always talking about why people

535
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,240
switch to Linux I also think it's good though to be real about it so that way

536
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,400
because here's the here's the here's the truth you guys here's there's a lot of

537
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,920
people listen to this show that have a dirty secret they don't use Linux they

538
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,040
run Windows or Mac or whatever it is but they listen they listen to kind of keep

539
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,960
their beak wet they listen to kind of keep their ear to the ground so they

540
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,880
know what's going on because they're considering it and so for these folks I

541
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,240
like to give them the real story and you know I've been thinking about this a lot

542
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,240
because in how to Linux chase is going to be making the switch and you know I

543
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,740
don't want to blow smoke up his butt I want to be honest like when something

544
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,600
sucks it sucks and I wanted to be able to say yeah man that doesn't work so well

545
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,240
but don't worry you can do X or yeah we're still working on that that kind of

546
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,760
stuff so bit puffing the chatroom just came out of the closet he's on a Mac

547
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:35,560
right now but I thought let's talk about some some Linux switching stories or

548
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,480
when we convince somebody to switch to Linux and it backfired real bad because

549
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,520
maybe we can learn as a group I'll start and then I wanted to toss over to Noah

550
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,400
because I know he's done some client deployment so he probably has the story

551
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,640
but I'll start with mine my like one of my biggest Linux shames like my big

552
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:55,040
Linux failure was when I got my wife who was my girlfriend at the time I believe

553
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:01,480
switched over to Linux and it was KDE this is a long time ago and I switched

554
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,120
her photo manager over from whatever she was using at the time on the Mac it

555
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,200
might have been I photo though I feel like this was pre I photo it was

556
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,880
different enough that when she was organizing her photos she was

557
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,960
permanently moving and deleting them and didn't know that because that's not how

558
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,080
it worked in her own program and she I end up losing a whole bunch of her her

559
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,680
photos and that was like you know at that point we were done you know

560
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,120
experiment was over going back to another opera I can't remember was

561
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,960
Windows or what it was and it was no that the switch to Linux experiment was

562
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,640
done no no we're married now so I managed to save the relationship but I

563
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,200
don't know if I had pushed that Linux thing who knows so that's that's my

564
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,480
failure you know I should have I should have probably thought ahead and thought

565
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,680
yeah this photo programs gonna work different for her but Noah have you been

566
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,200
out there have you been to have you convinced a client or a user or a friend

567
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,840
or family member to switch to Linux only to have it blow up in their face or your

568
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,240
face as the case might be yeah many it has it has blown up I want to give a

569
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,720
disclaimer it has gone the other way many many many more times nine out of ten

570
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,080
times right when I install Linux for a client they are much happier and I lose

571
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,840
money right that's that's 90% of the way they're not they're not taking they're

572
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,400
not calling you up for support anymore so you lose money right yes right but

573
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,960
there have been a couple of times one one that I'll tell you one that's that's

574
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,120
comical and then then a true example of where Linux just failed the we instead

575
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,360
we had a hotel it was complete web-based system that they used to check people in

576
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,400
and out and so we walked in this I said well what's the problem well the

577
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,160
computer is really slow and it takes a long time to boot nothing really works

578
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:45,400
right and I I mentioned this when when we were all meeting at Linux fest but I

579
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,520
have a dirty a dirty little secret when I anytime I try somebody out on Linux

580
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,520
for the first time what I will do is I will use a Samsung 840 SSD because when

581
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,280
I put that drive into the computer all of a sudden not only don't they have the

582
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,160
junk that comes with Windows but that SSD just super fast yeah right and base

583
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,960
next to an actual spinning hard drive it just seems that much faster right so I

584
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,120
put the drive in there and oh my gosh the computer so fast everything works

585
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,420
we're so happy great when I leave the next day I get a call the computer

586
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,440
doesn't work what do you mean it doesn't work so I go back over and I look and she

587
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,320
goes well I don't like see this the icon has changed it's no longer the little

588
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,480
blue e how do we get the blue e on there and I said well it'll do the same thing

589
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,800
just click on this well we don't know which one to click on and all of our

590
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,360
staff doesn't know which one to click on and when you open it everything works

591
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,200
fine but if anyone closes it then we don't know how to get back there so I

592
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,000
actually ended up downloading the icon file and changing it and renaming it

593
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,400
Internet Explorer and theming it to look like Windows Internet Explorer just to

594
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,120
keep them happy oh man now that I don't think that really exemplifies Linux

595
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,920
failing where Linux actually truly and totally failed me was I had a friend and

596
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,960
she called me she said you know what do you recommend I'm my computer's kind of

597
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,080
reaching the end of its life and I said what do you do with it well I get online

598
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,640
and I edit documents and I do this and I do that okay so walked her through

599
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:08,160
installing Linux all of her music would not pull over because she had purchased

600
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,000
it in whatever Windows uses I don't even know but plays for sure purchase well I

601
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,040
sure she had a zoom okay so whatever plays yeah okay so whatever it is it

602
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,680
doesn't pull into Linux and it was it was a it was it was one of those things

603
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,960
where she'd asked me before can I move my music collection over well of course

604
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,320
you can move music Linux plays music yeah no problem right right no that

605
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,480
didn't work yeah and then she goes well I can play can I play Netflix well we

606
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,120
installed the Netflix desktop but if you don't have a really powerful machine

607
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,160
that running all of that the layers that it needs to run that didn't work yeah

608
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,600
yeah and essentially what it all boiled down to was she could edit her word

609
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,800
documents and she could check her email and that was it and we ended up going

610
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,200
back to Windows oh yeah I mean that you know like that the WMA they were

611
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,880
probably even WMA files they were yeah I mean I think yeah so that's you know

612
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,160
that's a that's a hard thing because that's Angela my wife's mom kind of the

613
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,640
same situation right they use a computer they're on a satellite connection so

614
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,880
they're basically just downloading a few things printing off photos and you know

615
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,160
updating Facebook but they have bought I mean I don't want to speak for them but

616
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,480
it's potentially thousands of dollars worth of DRM copyrighted protected music

617
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,800
and it's just one of those things where I don't have the time to unencumber all

618
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,600
of that music for them so they are on like some ancient you might even be

619
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,920
Vista install like what are you gonna do right all right mumble anybody else in

620
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,360
the mumble room want to share like a Linux deployment blew up I mean again

621
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,240
like Noah said of course it generally goes good I don't have like a huge

622
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,800
detailed one but essentially I gave someone Linux because they were tired of

623
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:53,440
windows and then they I had to go away for like a couple weeks or so and while

624
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:01,080
at the time I got back they had given up and bought a Mac that was a quick nut

625
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,920
punch like I was like I thought you're gonna keep going then boom you strike

626
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:10,560
with that I was going over to a friend of a friend's house it was late at night

627
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,360
we weren't gonna be there for long and I see that he's running Ubuntu on his TV

628
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:21,400
like right in front of his bed I'm like oh cool Linux Linux Linux and then he

629
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,640
couldn't get the resolution correct and I'm like well hmm maybe you should just

630
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:30,640
try updating so we do a little pseudo app get update pseudo upgrade and it

631
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:40,840
doesn't boot and I have to leave pretty soon and he never talks to me again all

632
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:51,400
right if my microphone works yeah yes yeah we so does it go ahead check yeah

633
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,640
okay actually I have three stories why can I can wrap it up in one because it's

634
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,520
always the same story for all three okay what is it in the last month I just

635
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,200
can't explain how it happened but I guess it's mixture between the XP ending

636
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:12,400
and the always malware stuff that happens on Windows systems anyway three

637
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,960
guys came to me and asked specifically to install them Linux on their

638
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:25,360
computers and I must say they are happy with it oh good just happy well that's

639
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:34,200
good that's great yeah I had my dad on it for years and years and then he ended

640
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,520
up wanting a new computer and the shiny Mac got him and we had a couple we had a

641
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,520
little we had a little bit of a mini disaster that kind of pushed him over

642
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,960
and yeah but my worst story is the photo one all right we've had we've had some

643
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,440
back and forth but we do now have the official oh yeah what we have one more

644
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,240
story before I get to know I just wanted to point out that my story was like a

645
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,280
dropping a bomb with a Mac thing but this is also in like 2005 2006 so it was

646
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,760
it was kind of a mess back then anyway yeah mine mine was mine was way mine

647
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,640
like was before iTunes was a thing I think it before I photo was a thing

648
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,840
that's how long ago mine was but and so like now I would ever use dark table or

649
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:13,280
something like that yeah really short positive one sure yeah yeah go ahead

650
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:20,080
turns out my 80 year old staff that actually put Suza on his box on his own

651
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:27,080
and it works he's happy with it you know and you guys has and I didn't help him

652
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:33,160
that no bearing on the fact that I'm a Linux user now but my my grandpa on my

653
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:39,560
dad's side of the family he's he's in his 80s and he's got he's his favorite

654
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,280
distro is puppy Linux that's his he's loved puppy Linux for years and he

655
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,120
thinks this is the best perfect distro for him and he likes putting on low end

656
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,800
hardware but he's also a big Fedora user and he tries out every Ubuntu

657
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,200
release but he always ends up going back to Fedora which I think is hilarious

658
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,960
because yeah he's also in his 80s and it's awesome yeah it's just something

659
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,480
he's always enjoyed tinkering with and I didn't even know until after I started

660
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,080
the Linux action show like a couple of years into it it came up like my dad

661
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,880
mentioned to him that I was doing a Linux show and it's like oh you like

662
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:17,320
Linux like are you serious like my mind was blown it my mind was it was like I

663
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,960
entered another reality all right so yeah that's more or less what happened

664
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,120
to me as well that's amazing here is the we've had a few iterations of but here's

665
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,960
our latest poll which desktop environment do you use I'm gonna vote

666
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,040
we'll also have this in the show notes we want the download audience to vote

667
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,120
too I'm just curious what you guys use so I'm gonna vote for Gnome Shell for

668
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,240
both of us okay Matt okay sounds good that sounds like me all right so I'm

669
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,640
voting and I guess I already voted on that maybe I already voted voted all

670
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,720
right and the results are hold on survey says I think we put straw poll under

671
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:53,260
some load here right now Gnome Shell has a healthy 27% lead followed by KDE with

672
00:50:53,260 --> 00:51:01,600
a 22% lead cinnamon coming in at 11% unity 9% XFCE 9% mate 7% and then it

673
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,840
kind of trails off from there this is almost mirroring exactly what we saw in

674
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,360
our Linux that's wild and you know I've kind of lost my love for cinnamon I mean

675
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,240
it's it was fun for a while I just you know it's kind of like watching the same

676
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,880
TV show over and over after a while you can't get bored with it well yeah but

677
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,560
the extensions of cinnamon are not as good as gnomes but they are pretty good

678
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,000
yeah they are pretty good it got my interest at the end of the day for me in

679
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,480
cinnamon and I I think it's great in like for a lot of folks who want a

680
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,500
classical UI but brought a little more into you know the year 2014 man to

681
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,280
cinnamon nail that and it doesn't really well for me the problem is is I think

682
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,760
what you're kind of getting at Matt is I'm just kind of done with that it's the

683
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:43,080
same thing that eventually kind of wears on me about mate or Mate you know I've

684
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,560
I've played that I grok that UI but I recognize that the paradigm that was

685
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,680
set up way back in the 80s you know is due for some refreshing and I think

686
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,720
that's why I like gnome 3 and and honestly if I spend enough time

687
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,840
configuring my KDE desktop what I like about KDE 2 is I can make it feel like a

688
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:07,440
more modern operating system it's true I mean now on some boxes I still do use

689
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,720
XFC simply because I'm not in front of them every day I just need I need quick

690
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,720
access to something I've used in a launcher anyways I don't care why run

691
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,880
the resources at that point but for a daily use situation yeah I do prefer

692
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:26,160
norm go ahead Riley for people who don't want like all the unnecessary stuff that

693
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,320
Katie yes like it still has all your extensions it still has like your

694
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:43,680
desktop but effects and all that stuff so yeah pretty much 30 ways to get to

695
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:50,880
the control panel I mean you know that's kind of I would disagree with that but

696
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:56,280
that's I think cinnamon is also a good source for people who want to a full

697
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,440
fledged DE but can't you know put they can't devote a lot of resources to it

698
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:06,440
because I've there's been benchmarks that show that XFC Inc and cinnamon are

699
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,440
very close to about the same resource usage and that's actually kind of

700
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,480
amazing when you can say and you think about it came from gnome how does how

701
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,160
does cinnamon work when you don't have compositing does it still work okay you

702
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,280
know it's it doesn't work very well it's very it's very slow it needs a graphics

703
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,080
card it doesn't really matter what kind of graphics card so that would be an

704
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,760
area though where XFCE kind of has yeah that leg up and still you're still in a

705
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,120
GTK environment and I think an area where LXQT is gonna be a strong

706
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:39,680
competitor for XFC I wanted to go back to something that Crossroads was gonna

707
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:46,720
mention go ahead Crossroads okay so the thing about thing about cinnamon is that

708
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:52,040
at least when I but I always thought when I was on unity I saw cinnamon I

709
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,080
thought it was great I thought it was wonderful I really wanted to try it out

710
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,440
I never really got around to it ended up using KDE and used a few things and then

711
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:07,520
I finally installed the mangero version of with cinnamon and I you know I thought

712
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,160
I was gonna love it I thought it was gonna be great and I used it it was fine

713
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:18,360
and then I got bored really quickly and I just it never turned me on I think

714
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,840
sometimes too because the options are there to tweak with them you fiddle with

715
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,400
them and then you get bored with fiddling with those options and kind of

716
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,880
sounds so weird it almost sounds like what's it called when like you get

717
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,200
kidnapped and then you relate to your kidnappers Stockholm Stockholm Stockholm

718
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,920
I wonder if gnome gives me Stockholm syndrome a little bit because I'm like

719
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,640
because it doesn't have all these things for me to tweak although they are

720
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,520
tweakable actually like a lot of stuff is surprisingly tweakable but because

721
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,800
like it's not just a right-click it's not right there I generally just leave

722
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,040
it alone like one I essentially I install gnome I spend about 20 minutes getting

723
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,840
like my theme and my icons and and fiddling with different things that may

724
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,880
you know every time I try something new settling on something and then I

725
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,400
generally don't ever change it again unless a new icon back comes out that I

726
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,880
want to check like right so but on KDE it is a daily occurrence that I'm

727
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,640
changing something because it's there and it's it's just right there too it's

728
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,800
right-click boom there it is so it's a long and short if you have any type of

729
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,400
obsessive types I guess that's probably not because I'm that way too um you know

730
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,720
I speak from experience that might not be the best desktop choice for folks

731
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,360
like us I don't know now lion head you just don't get it I understand what's

732
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:36,360
your point well I just feel confused when I'm using it so I just feel that

733
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:43,400
no X yeah so I just feel that XFCE is more streamlined at least for my kind of

734
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,880
workflow yeah it just works better on the laptop or on the same time you can

735
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,600
stream it streamline it whatever way you want to yeah all right well before we

736
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,960
wrap up I'll go ahead finish up finishing thought I was just gonna say I

737
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,840
think the the problem with gnome is that people aren't you aren't used to the

738
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,040
paradigm so they expect something else yeah when if they give it enough time

739
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,640
then gnome could actually be it can change your your your preference of the

740
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,320
paradigm and you'll actually like no more than other ones if you just try it

741
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:20,400
yep very good guys well so if you wanted to check out this the home server survey

742
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,600
I would especially if you're gonna build a home server soon or you're thinking

743
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,040
about or you want to figure out how you want to improve yours go look at those

744
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,280
results there's some great content that you guys supply gals guys and gals I say

745
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,000
guys universally it's a unisex term for me just disclaimer on that and then also

746
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
we'd love to hear your feedback I I decided this week we would do the survey

747
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,320
for the feedback we generally read a few emails on the Linux unplugged show for

748
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,760
this week I actually ended up replying directly a lot to the emails and didn't

749
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,800
really feel like anyone particularly grabbed me that I want to pull into the

750
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:56,280
show but we do love featuring your emails so go over to Jupiter broadcasting

751
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,480
comm click that contact link choose Linux unplug from the drop-down and

752
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:05,120
maybe you can kick off our next discussion I love having a topic on the

753
