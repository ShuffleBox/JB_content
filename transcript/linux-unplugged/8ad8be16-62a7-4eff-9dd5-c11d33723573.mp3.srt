1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
I happen to believe a lot of people like they would try to go they try to have like a big bang for their 100th

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,440
Episode you know they try to do something big actually

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,800
But I feel like no the 100 should be your low point like you should if you can make 100 worse than episode 1

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,400
So that way nobody says man. They really picked it episode 100 right like you can say boy

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,560
I feel like an episode 100 like they got their second win

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,960
So I think we just got to make a horrible show today, and we're fine

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,320
I think it's good that you're setting everyone's expectations for the yeah, thank you. Yeah, I like that

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,300
That's right go for like I'm gonna go for a more intimate feeling right we're gonna be more

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,640
Together and it's not gonna be just a big bang. It's gonna be just condensed and we're gonna all express our opinions

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,400
And then you just take it to like this is gonna be terrible. Yeah

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:51,160
Yeah, well expectations. There's no disappointment you guys yeah, yeah, you guys ever see that mad TV bit about lowered expectations

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:01:11,160
That's beautiful man, that was really nice. This is Linux unplugged episode 100 for July 7th 2015

13
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,880
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's honestly struggling with a bit of food coma from a little bit too much barbecue

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,160
My name is Chris and joining me in studio well one of the several gentlemen joining me in studio is Wes hey Wes

15
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,060
Hey gang hey there welcome, and thanks for joining me in studio and eating my barbecue my pleasure

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,440
Last week I put the call out. I said you know for episode 100

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,160
I wanted to do a meetup, but we have so much going on

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,200
We've just done a bunch of meetups

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,440
And we have a couple of coming up kind of didn't really fit in the schedule

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,560
So why not just have people over to the studio and do a little cookout we had six people RSVP

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,120
And we had a pool going I said three would show up. I nailed it three people showed up

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,960
Were you the first to make it I think so yeah, yeah, it was nice

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,680
That was good, and so we had I had the barbecue going

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,240
I figured because we're up north a little bit people used to show up a little late

25
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,480
So I didn't even start the barbecue until like about the time

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,900
I thought people were maybe supposed to start showing up so that way there was plenty of time

27
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,480
And then as people trickled in we had the barbecue ready to go we've been talking Linux. It's been nice

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:15,800
Oh, yeah, play a little Ronald jankies while we ate and so I thought today to celebrate episode 100

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,160
We would do the only thing pop pop proper the only thing you're supposed to do for your 100th episode is not playing anything clip show

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,760
Yeah, ha ha ha clip show that would actually be even better. It's just sit back here play all the clips

31
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,920
They don't do anything. We just play everything no actually that would have been way more way more clever actually

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,760
I should have thought of that no no today. We'll do yeah

33
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,680
Yeah, I will do it for 200 exactly now today. We'll do a little a brief retrospect

34
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,400
We'll do a little navel gazing, but we won't go too far

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,760
We'll just talk I just we kind of look back over the hundred weeks this shows been on the air

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,900
And I don't think we've missed a single week. I don't think I don't think so and some really interesting stuff has developed

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,640
And then we're gonna have a review of the new Linux mint release of based on that cinnamon the 17.2

38
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:02,160
And then towards the end of the show a brand new tiny tiny device is running Linux that is x86 based

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,120
And you're gonna be able to get your hands on it for pretty cheap really soon so before we dig into all of that

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,960
Let's bring in that virtual lug time appropriate greetings mumble room

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,200
Thank you guys hello huge turnout today look at that. It's scrolling off the screen there

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,960
We got so many people in the in the mumble room. Hey there guys

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,400
I like Popey must like start before I'm done. That's the only way I can figure is he's always in there first he nails it

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,280
So we're gonna talk about a little bit of the show's history

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,720
And so that's one of the reasons why Wes here is joining us in the first segment is out of the group here

46
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,880
Wes has been probably watching since closest from the beginning what you said about a couple years. Yeah, you know I think

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,560
About episode 18 okay, not bad all right well, so guess what this is all gonna be in your wheelhouse then so I didn't want

48
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,080
To go like way way way way far back

49
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,360
But let's start with more recent history some episodes that were just kind of my favorites of Linux unplug

50
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,880
These are like if you're if you're new to the show

51
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,320
We'll just point out a couple things that I thought were interesting and you guys you can chip in if you want or not

52
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,400
But starting kind of more recently episode 70 when we looked at well first of all we talked with the fedora project about

53
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,240
Them them switching to this ring cycle where they have fedora core again

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,000
Fedora workstation fedora server and all of that was around the fedora 21 release and the restructuring of their project

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And I really we did a couple of a couple of week coverage of that and we had them come on and discuss it with us

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,040
And do a roundtable discussion

57
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,320
I thought that was a really interesting way to sort of approach like a big well-known distro going through a major restructuring

58
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,040
It's really help people wrap their heads around it and so that was in episode 7. I'm thinking in the future

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
If there was a distro that had a big change like that

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,980
There'll be it's nice to kind of just really double down on it

61
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,580
I think that's one of the best things about unplugged is you can connect

62
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,920
Developers with the people who are actually using them. Yeah, they come into the room

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,880
Yeah, I like that right there and sometimes like, you know behind the scenes rotten corpse gonna test of this. Are you still in there rotten?

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,520
Yep, we've had to have rotten write up a tutorial and like he you know

65
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,800
He has to work with the guests a lot of times to get them set up with mumble

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,040
Oh because we have them come in and hang out with the rest of the lug and you know

67
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,600
A lot of times like the last time Matt from fedora was on the project. He

68
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,480
He actually had to get and build and package mumble for fedora 22 because it wasn't a mumble available for door 22 yet

69
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,440
So sometimes our guests will go really about

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,400
Just peer pressure our guests they'll go above and beyond to you know

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,560
Cuz they have to go install this extra piece of software configure it to our mumble server

72
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,640
And but then they get to hang out and and the people in the room can ask questions, too

73
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,800
So that's that's pretty neat. So while we're still navel-gazing and we're looking back keep going back to episode 68

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,400
That's when we talked to Charlie and his students from Penn Manor School District where we got to talk about how they gave each student

75
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,240
Root access to their rigs. I was episode 68 Linux powered schools

76
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,600
I love the concept of trusting the students with root access and the way Charlie empowered students to be the

77
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,080
IT people and all of that was really neat and now they're still getting some recognition

78
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,160
They just got written up in a Red Hat magazine just recently

79
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,720
Oh, and I was just up there robe from warhead episode 57 going right through these because I hate talking about ourselves

80
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,000
System D haters busted. There was a whole swath of system D. This is the part I've been rushing towards man

81
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,840
Did we have some serious system D episodes another one another sentinel sentinel Seminole Seminole. Thank you. Thank you

82
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,640
Another really important that system D episode was

83
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,800
Episode 27 Debbie and system D decision where it was announced. Can you believe it was that long ago? It seems ages ago

84
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,640
February 11th

85
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,760
2014

86
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,800
One of the bumpier chapters in Debbie and history. It looks to be drawing to a close at least for now

87
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,800
What was all the drama about it was the switch to system D?

88
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,280
Now it seems so far ago, you know, no problems

89
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm so glad to be in an abundant who have switched to system D now, you know, just how it's all gone quiet

90
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,160
Yeah, it really has in a big way, hasn't it? What do you think that means is it?

91
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,600
I think it means all the haters were making a fuss about nothing because they didn't know what they were talking about which I think

92
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,960
Strictly summarizes what we were saying at the time. Yeah, they actually tried it finally

93
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,280
Or they don't realize they're using it now because it just works. Yeah

94
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,360
I think that's a little unfair. I think that's characterizing everyone who was anti system D as a hater

95
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,600
Is a little bit unfair because some of them were some of them were yes. Okay. It's a general. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I agree

96
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,200
I'm referring to the peanut gallery. I think a better summary that the haters have moved on

97
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,520
You know the rest of us have made you or enjoyed it. Yeah, I guess maybe that's it to the haters

98
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,760
Or did they're just not using systems that use system D right there are options out there free BSD converse

99
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:42,080
So as we're as we're talking about system D who's installed Dev1 recently?

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,080
Dev1 I haven't heard anything about that. No, I haven't either and the room goes silent. Yeah, I forgot that existed

101
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,880
Yeah, I haven't but I wonder what I wonder what they did with all your money. Oh

102
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,560
That's right. They were taking donations about that. How about that?

103
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,280
So yeah, boy, the system D stuff was really fascinating. So from I mean, it's such a range that it covered and I know there's a

104
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,960
Certain amount of time where it really got burned out

105
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,920
But now it's we have a little bit of interesting history in there. So I wow

106
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,480
Well, that is really something I so West have you had a chance to use it much? Yeah

107
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,640
I mean, I run an arch at home. So system B is pretty much on all of my systems

108
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah, I use a lot of legacy init scripts at work and having a sane set status command

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,760
Regardless of if the author of the system to the init script bothered to write one is a godsend. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

110
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, once you have used in a production environment if in a server environment, it's it's very nice

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,120
I want it. There's a lot of places a lot of moments that unplugs history where we talked about

112
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,080
Docker

113
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,960
And Docker, you know following Docker was it's been really fascinating episode 16 meet the dockers

114
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,560
A new version of Docker was released

115
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,320
So we brought on the CTO and founder of Docker to chat about the new version of Docker

116
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,200
And that was really like an interesting moment in Docker history before well before the one oh well before the partnership with Red Hat and VMware

117
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,640
And all the other companies that they now work with but well before Coral West and and rocket and all of that

118
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,880
We talked with the CTO and founder of Docker in episode 16. I thought that was pretty interesting then. Oh, and Ron. Did you have any?

119
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,240
I'm just saying it's it kind of sounds like where the Linux unplugged is like container hipsters

120
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,640
We were hip to we were hip to Docker before everybody else was

121
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,720
Kota radio has this beat by a few weeks actually so Kota Rick Mike Mike found Docker before Docker was even like

122
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,960
He found it really early on when they were just desperate to get people to know about it

123
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,800
And then one of the most popular and of course the older the show is the more downloads it gets so this isn't a super fair metric

124
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:43,800
But episode 15 of Linux unplugged don't switch to Linux has been one of the most popular episodes on YouTube and one of the like

125
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,240
People have people have written me at saying that I have done more damage to Linux with this episode title then in anything any other

126
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,040
Don't switch to Linux. They I have been told is single-handedly hurting a Linux adoption because of that title

127
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,280
But it at least you got a legacy. I guess that's after all this work. That'll be my legacy

128
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,880
You know if I recall it was like what episode 15 was about was Linux is amazing

129
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,960
But we're gonna get to that in the next episode

130
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,960
15 was about was Linux is amazing, but we're gonna we're just gonna tell you here's a couple of the elephants in the room when you switch

131
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,320
Gotta be real. Yeah, and like I was just telling you guys during lunch

132
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,760
Our former nanny who is no longer our nanny

133
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,440
Her Macbook died and so Noah got her Dell laptop, and she liked it. She likes it

134
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,320
Oh, I was already using the office. She says it was great. Oh, I was already using Firefox

135
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,760
It's great, and I'm thinking to myself. This is gonna be perfect. So it's I think you put up onto LTS on there and

136
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,320
And

137
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,280
She had it for about two days, and then she calls me up, and she says so um Chris. Yeah, what's up?

138
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm having a hard time with something. What is it? I can't is it is is there no iTunes for Linux? Oh?

139
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,720
No, there's no iTunes Jenny. I didn't even I didn't even think to tell her of course not I mean

140
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,720
I don't use iTunes I who uses iTunes a lot of people use iTunes

141
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,500
But Linux users don't use iTunes

142
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,720
But those are the kinds of things that we covered in the don't switch to Linux is like there's some there's a lot of

143
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Good stuff, but there's some gotchas, too

144
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,760
And and so that I was surprised by the reaction because I felt like if you listen to the episode

145
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
It was kind of obvious what we were trying to go for

146
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
But boy did we get a lot of hate for that

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,360
And so episode 15 that was like ever since it was like oh

148
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,520
I don't want to I don't want to be flame baby in the titles anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

149
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,300
But we've matured since then the real yeah the real funny thing about Linux unplugged is it started as a show?

150
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:39,900
Simply to handle the overflow of mail. We were getting from the Linux action show. I was getting so much email

151
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,980
Then this is well before I'd like before we had the contact forms really where it were

152
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,860
Really good

153
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,880
And we have the subreddit as a as a really good form for feedback so everything was coming in my inbox my inbox

154
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,420
And I realized I was spending as much time reading email every week as I would just to prep a show

155
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,160
So then I thought well well here's an idea

156
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,680
Why don't I just turn all this email reading into show prep, and I'll just sit down. I'll read and respond to emails

157
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,220
Nobody'll want to listen to show like that, but if I'm gonna do it anyways. I'll just do it and so that was like episode 1

158
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,160
You know it was like yeah, maybe I'll try like here's in a concept episode 2 and 3 you know

159
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,160
Go doc yourself. What was that about? Oh? Yeah? Oh? Yeah? That was a little KD hate

160
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,640
You know I played with it a little I and then I realized pretty early on that nobody

161
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,600
Nobody wants to listen to a show where some guys read an email

162
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,440
Nobody is yeah. Yeah, she's a witch

163
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Which show did you?

164
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
Introduce the mumble chat room then I think it was this show I?

165
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,320
Think so no no as in which episode oh

166
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,520
Good thing to find. Oh, I that is a really really good question. Do you think it wasn't an episode 1?

167
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:52,120
It was episode 1. I'm thinking that maybe a chat with our live hangout. Maybe we did a hangout for the first episode

168
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,320
But yeah, we had a panel discussion about we should our first episode

169
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,800
We talked about the lava bit shut down, and if it was time to start rolling our own email servers

170
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,000
That was our panel discussion on the first episode. It looks like so it started out dicey

171
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,120
Yeah, yeah, the lava bit stuff was kind of a was kind of a mess wasn't it I remember that Levar Levinson and the whole

172
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,760
He was hosting Snowden's emails right yeah, that's that's right. That was what lava bit was about

173
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,800
Now he's off doing the dark mail initiative, and I think we interviewed him one of our shows even might have been unplugged

174
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,880
That's a great question though. Hmm. Yeah, I do read. It's funny. I greater says now

175
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,400
I no longer read emails in love. I don't read as many I do read a few, but

176
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,920
Yeah, I don't read as many now because we read more emails in the Linux action show these days

177
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
So it kind of it kind of

178
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,040
Softened up on that well in the mumble room brings all the complaints that you could pass that's true

179
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,760
Yeah, you got we got live feedback right there, right, and you got a chat room. You got a chat room, too

180
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,840
Hey, you know what?

181
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,760
It's something that just crossed my mind. I got I got to get your info before you go

182
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,680
I gotta get everybody who visited today. We're gonna give away a special for the you guys have visited a special

183
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,400
Linux unplugged 100 t-shirt. Oh boy. I just remind everyone I was here first yeah, so there you go

184
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,760
So and we're gonna make it available

185
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,000
Just for like a day or two or probably like a couple of days if you would like to pick it up out there in

186
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,560
The audience teespring.com slash lup 100

187
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,360
It's just a sure we threw together celebrate episode 100. We're not gonna make a big run of it. We're not gonna make a big deal

188
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,760
I don't even think we'll probably update the website

189
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,560
So it's just for you guys if you're a fan of the show and we're selling it basically at cost $19

190
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,440
Because once you add shipping and stuff, it's gonna be a little bit more than that and there's also a long sleeve version

191
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,280
which are pretty great and it's at teespring.com slash lup lup 100 if you would like it and

192
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
for you guys who visited just

193
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Give me your deets and I'll for them on to and she'll order some for you guys because you made the trip and I'll put a link to that in the chat room too again that's teespring.com slash lup 100 if you want to grab it and I don't know how long we'll run it because I really just kind of want to be something special just for those of you who listen to episode 100 of the unplug program.

194
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That was something I wanted to do too and we only need three more prints to make the run because we're just doing a couple so and it'll be running I guess it's running for 14 days I guess we'll probably just run the couple of days.

195
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I guess it's running for 14 days I guess we'll probably just run the clock out on it that probably makes the most sense teespring.com slash lup 100 all right so that'll bring us to the end of the navel gazing I appreciate you guys letting me do that I thought it was fun to kind of look back over 100 weeks and see some of the more interesting things that have developed and you know it's funny because on the pre show we're like no we don't want to talk about this again all we don't want to talk about this and we were talking like Firefox and system D and the reality is we feel like we talk ourselves out too much like it's oh my gosh we've we've beat it to death.

196
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But when you go back with a little perspective and look at it it's and I'm just saying this based on you know 300 plus episodes of last two it is.

197
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's a it's an uncanny time capsule it is like getting in a time machine and going back to that moment and you realize there was so like we look back at this stuff now and we see in very broad terms the Debbie and distribution switched over to system D and there was some debates and there was in fighting.

198
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But back then the nuance is so rich and so detailed that when you actually go back and listen to the back and I go wow I can't believe we're worried about this or an old man that was such a big deal and like it's very fascinating.

199
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So it's all respect what's that it's a good retrospect.

200
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah yeah for 200 we should actually clip it all together.

201
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's a good idea. I like that. Thank you. Thank you. That's good thinking. All right. Well so well we're going to shift gears and talk about Linux Mint 17.2 and the flavor of cinnamon that you can get with that addition.

202
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But first I want to tell you about our first sponsor and that is DigitalOcean. In fact go over to DigitalOcean.com right now and remember our promo code of absolute power and wisdom that is D O unplugged one word lowercase D O unplugged.

203
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:49,000
They'll give you a ten dollar credit over DigitalOcean and you can try out their five dollar rig two months for free. Now DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up your own cloud server.

204
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Now a cloud server is really a rig up on the DigitalOcean data center that is powered by Linux running on top of Linux in the KVM virtualizer and you can choose from core OS free BSD Fedora Ubuntu Debbie and lots of distributions to pick from one click application deployments and you can get started in less than 55 seconds.

205
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I can't even believe this is somebody who used to create virtual machines for a living using like clunky VMware ESXi platform tools and things where I had to run a Windows box to create a Linux machine those days to be able to create a machine in 55 seconds blows my freaking mind.

206
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And at five dollars a month you're going to get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer a terabyte.

207
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Jeez wow and here's another great thing DigitalOcean data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam and London they got a brand new hotness in Germany with 40 gigabit E connections to each hypervisor their fastest SSDs yet and that thing is located in great great great locations all of its neighbors have fantastic speed but look at DigitalOcean's interface.

208
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:55,000
In fact it's worth using our promo code just to play with that go over to DigitalOcean.com use the promo code DOUNPLUG get that $10 credit also help support this show and then try out their interface.

209
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You know it's super intuitive it supports web standards which is really nice which means it's going to work on your tablet or your desktop that is great if you're on the go.

210
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:11,000
They also have a fantastic API that allows you to replicate the functionality really really well done and there's so many great community apps built around that API.

211
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:22,000
For like me I just take advantage of those apps and for those of you out there that use unity for your desktop there are applets that snap right into the Ubuntu desktop to manage your droplet.

212
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't actually know how well they work on other desktops but I did notice they're also available in the AUR so I know I'm users and whatnot I think you could actually install them as well.

213
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:41,000
There's also tons of command line applications Android iOS management tools things to snap it into puppet whatever you need to do there's probably somebody's already written some code for it or you can take advantage of that API just remember that promo code.

214
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's what supports the show and keeps us going for another hundred episodes DOUNPLUG you apply that you get a $10 credit no credit card required DOUNPLUG try out their $5 rig two months for free.

215
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If you're in our chat room right now the functionality of the J-Bot powered by a digital ocean droplet my chat room powered by a digital ocean droplet using Quasal core my own cloud my bit torrent sync my Minecraft servers the back end systems that we use for transferring files between on location and production in the studio.

216
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:23,000
All of it powered by digital ocean our Jitsi server that we bounce off of a digital ocean droplet I'm telling you it can be your back end infrastructure for testing or for production digitalocean.com use the promo code DOUNPLUG and a big big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program.

217
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You guys are fantastic.

218
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
All right well now sitting down to join me at the mic is Romeo.

219
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Hey Romeo welcome to Linux unplugged man.

220
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hey Chris.

221
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So thank you first of all for making the trip out from Portland right.

222
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah yeah.

223
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Good man.

224
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And also not only that you also volunteered to be our Linux Mint 17.2 Cinnamon user.

225
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And so I saw you have it installed here on a Lenovo laptop.

226
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Is it a Lenovo?

227
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Oh it is a Lenovo.

228
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
See I thought it was a Lenovo.

229
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And what do you think of it.

230
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What do you want to start is it how is the installation experience out of box Wi-Fi hardware.

231
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How's all that work for you.

232
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Well I mean installation is pretty standard nowadays.

233
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I mean we nailed that a while ago.

234
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's nothing to write home about.

235
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's a Linux installation from USB.

236
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's what it is.

237
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Wi-Fi worked out of the box which it didn't in 17.1 when I use this laptop.

238
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's a Broadcom in that?

239
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah Broadcom chip.

240
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Which was exciting.

241
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was pretty hyped about that and it carried over my Wi-Fi settings from the install.

242
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I love that.

243
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I thought that was really cool.

244
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah and more and more distros are doing that.

245
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And man does it stand out now when a distribution doesn't do that.

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah definitely.

247
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I didn't notice a whole lot of changes when I was just using it regularly.

248
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Theming is really easy.

249
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Do they still support like the automatic downloading of themes online inside the like theme control panel?

250
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
No.

251
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
At least not that I could find.

252
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It seems that they've removed that functionality.

253
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't really know why you have to download them manually and pop them into your dot themes.

254
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Which isn't difficult but my grandma wouldn't do it.

255
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Right, having it built in there is very nice sort of KDE-esque too.

256
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I looked at the changelog and they say they fix the screensaver not actually being a screensaver.

258
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Nice.

259
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
They put some new repos on but it's only 14.04.

260
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I mean.

261
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah that's right, right.

262
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Did you feel that when you're using it?

263
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Does it feel old?

264
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It feels sluggish even though they say that they've improved and sped up and optimized Cinnamon a lot.

265
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I didn't feel it.

266
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
For me it felt slower than when I used 17.1.

267
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Maybe it's drivers being weird.

268
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Maybe it's something else but I didn't feel the speed improvements they were talking about.

269
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And admittedly this is on a very low-end laptop.

270
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's a ThinkPad X131E which isn't the best but I mean it should be able to run Cinnamon.

271
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah and it's ran it before.

272
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah it has.

273
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And it has an Intel graphics so you've played Race the Sun on it so it can do 3D acceleration.

274
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I believe it's actually AMD.

275
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh okay.

276
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But it's enough to actually have 3D compositing.

277
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah.

278
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So the Cinnamon should have everything it needs to be snappy.

279
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It is but.

280
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And the Cinnamon menu still hasn't opened when I hit the.

281
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Is that, hit it again.

282
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Did it even register?

283
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah.

284
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh my gosh.

285
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah that is a bit laggy.

286
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yeah.

287
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So I thought that was worth mentioning.

288
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's like my play and pause and brightness and those all worked out of the box which they didn't last time.

289
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So it seems kind of like they're just making it more stable.

290
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Making it more of a distro that'll just work on everything.

291
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I noticed they're refining a few things that seemed kind of appealing.

292
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Like I don't know if you had a chance to play with this but I guess they have like a new inhibit feature for notifications now.

293
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I didn't play with that but I did see that they did that and I thought that it was cool.

294
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah that's nice.

295
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't want any notifications for a while.

296
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Just turn this crap off. That's a great idea.

297
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And not just that but it also disables your screen saver.

298
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And screen blanking in total which on my desktop I just wrote a script for that.

299
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah.

300
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Caffeine is another desktop application you can get that'll do that.

301
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah yeah.

302
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And it's nice like when you're watching a movie or a live show or something like that.

303
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And when I looked at like you were saying what I saw was like so one of the things they've listed is improved system settings.

304
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Like a better layout of the system settings and when you go through there now does it feel like it's one nice cohesive place to configure the system?

305
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I went into the system settings and I didn't notice anything which I think is what they were going for.

306
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Yeah it's probably a good sign.

307
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Because it felt a little hodgepodge in the past and looking at these screenshots it seems pretty good.

308
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Now Wimpy I think on the pre-show you were mentioning you might have had some questions regarding the Cinnamon release of Mint or I'm sorry of Mint.

309
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Well you've just covered some of it there.

310
00:23:45,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I mean I find listening to podcasts that do distro reviews really useful because I have too long commutes a day and I can listen to other people reviewing distributions and I can get hints and ideas about how to improve the one I make.

311
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So all of this I find fascinating.

312
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I am intrigued by your experience with it being based on 14.04.

313
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So I'm assuming user land applications all feel very current and modern right? It's the latest Firefox.

314
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yeah I mean all that stuff is fine.

315
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah it's all taken care of.

316
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's usable but I don't know why they went with 14.04.

317
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Do you do me a favor? What's the version of the kernel that's used in there? Do you give it a new name or something for me?

318
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm just kind of curious to see. They probably have it listed on the specs page.

319
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Now here's the nice thing about this. So it sounds like your biggest takeaway is the performance is not quite as good as you're hoping especially since they kind of made that a cornerstone aspect of the release.

320
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But the flip side is this is a long term supported edition.

321
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So this is something you could give friends or family and they would have years of patches coming from this thing.

322
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So that's something to consider. Wimpy you wanted to jump in.

323
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well you were saying about why is it based on 14.04 and this was something I discussed with Clem way back when this was first put out as an idea.

324
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Well it really comes down to the fact that with each new version of Ubuntu the Mint team being outside of the Ubuntu family if you like.

325
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
They had to keep re-engineering things and fixing things and moving with this shifting base system.

326
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And one of the other criticisms was that you couldn't upgrade between Mint releases or you could sometimes and sometimes it didn't work so well.

327
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So the decision was to base on an LTS and then iterate on top of a stable largely unchanging base system.

328
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So they could actually concentrate on developing their own tools and applications without having the constant churn beneath them with the operating system changing.

329
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So that was the rationale and part of that was fueled by when is system D going to land.

330
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:10,000
What's happening with Wayland and Mir and what that might mean for distribution such as Mint and elementary and how they would have to adapt.

331
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It buys them a couple of years to let that kind of thing shake out.

332
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah just let those things shake out yeah.

333
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Now also I've been reading online that a lot of people are upgrading from 17.1 to 17.2 which is not something normally done in a Mint release.

334
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But I guess because they're both based on 14.04 there's actually a way to do this now.

335
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah because you're not doing a distribution release upgrade you're effectively upgrading packages on top of a base OS.

336
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Which is nice for Mint users because that's always been a mismatch.

337
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Mint is great for people that aren't very comfortable but every time you want to go to the next version you have to completely reload.

338
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:57,000
They're actually going to do that another time for the next release which is 17.3 and the next one who knows because that's going to be 18 and it's going to be LTS to LTS.

339
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So maybe they'll have an upgrade maybe not.

340
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Now did you see the kernel version there?

341
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Yes I've got 3.16.

342
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
3.16 is not bad okay.

343
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Alright so it's not 3.13 that's all I care about.

344
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's also actually got a kernel versioning manager thing so you can actually update and choose which kernel you want.

345
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Or avoid it all together I think too.

346
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yeah as well.

347
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Interesting.

348
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:34,000
There's actually a lot of things that they're doing that are LTS based but they are actually updating packages and updating different security software and stuff outside of just the LTS point releases.

349
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
They're doing more than just that.

350
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:48,000
There's a few applications that I've experienced where they've actually updated in the past couple months or so that were like a year old in the Ubuntu versions.

351
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So they're not doing it for everything but they are doing it a lot more than any other distro based on LTS.

352
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Do you remember which applications those were?

353
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
No I don't.

354
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I remember some of the applications that are not in the repo at all that they added like some proprietary stuff like they added Sublime and stuff like that.

355
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I like that.

356
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Sublime is great.

357
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You know last week what I was trying to sort of hazardly say and I'll just very plain stately say this time is I'm still a little confused why I wouldn't go with Ubuntu Mate or Ubuntu LTS itself over Mint.

358
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:33,000
If I'm really going out on a ledge and say I'm going to pull a NOA and I'm going to ship somebody a laptop halfway across the country and I'm never even probably going to see them.

359
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I don't know if I would do anything but an official Ubuntu flavor for that person because it just feels like you're deviating the further you deviate from that official status like the more room there is for something you don't know about or something you don't have oversight over or something just weird to break.

360
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't know maybe it doesn't seem like a main issue because I've moved people to Mint and had success with it and I've never had a problem but I'm just trying to think like where if I'm trying to pick between the two what the core advantage over say Mint Cinnamon edition is say over Ubuntu Mate or Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

361
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
What do you think?

362
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I feel like Mint Cinnamon tries to be intentionally a lot like Windows.

363
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
The start menu is very similar to Windows. The two finger scrolling isn't a thing. They use the Windows Edge scrolling.

364
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Just the general usage of it feels a little bit like Windows but almost like not in a bad way though.

365
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Sometimes I'll say that to put something down like oh it feels like I'm using Windows 7 and maybe somebody might describe an old version of KDE like that.

366
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But with Cinnamon it's got a start menu but it's now a better start menu than what Windows has.

367
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's like they've refined it in a way where they took some concepts that if you're familiar with Windows you'll see there in Cinnamon and they'll be somewhat reminiscent but they're not like a one-to-one copy of the concept.

368
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It's easy for the Windows people to get into which is what everyone's been saying about Mint since as long as I can remember.

369
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
That really is a main advantage to it isn't it? And one of the big advantages to it is if you're switching a Windows user it's going to be kind of comfortable for Cinnamon.

370
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
How's the stability been? Any crashing or anything like that?

371
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I haven't had any crashing other than the general sluggishness.

372
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Corky wants to throw his hat in the ring. Go ahead Corky.

373
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'd have to say Cinnamon is definitely the most important thing about Linux Mint. I've four switches I've used Cinnamon for because I find it great for switching people and Linux Mint is the only way you can go if you want proper Cinnamon implementation.

374
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And you like GTK apps too which is nice. If you still like the GTK apps but you want something a little more traditional and Gnome 3 isn't your thing or it's going to be way too different if you're switching and you don't want to go to KDE.

375
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Yeah I like that.

376
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Okay so 17.2 and if you have any experiences with it out there and want to share it with us at linuxactionshow.reddit.com find the feedback thread for episode 100 and let us know.

377
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'd specifically like to hear your experiences with the performance aspect. How has that been? Anybody in the Mamba Room want to chime in? Anybody tried 17.2 that has opinions before we, Hip Scott, jump around? Nope, go in once.

378
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I looked at 17.2 for accessibility but that's just me though.

379
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Okay I'd love to hear about that.

380
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So in 2.6 they started work on accessibility for Cinnamon so that's what 17.2 has, Cinnamon version 2.6 and above. But it's still not there yet. It works in terms of just kind of navigating, getting around.

381
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Nemo is not sort of accessible but there are some things that don't work as well. Some of the keyboard functionality when you want to assign keyboards like keyboard shortcuts and things, those don't work with Orca.

382
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The panel is sort of accessible but there needs to be some work done. But the start is there so hopefully the ball will keep rolling.

383
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
How is it compared to say Unity or Gnome or KDE?

384
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So KDE is not accessible as of right now. Apparently there's some move for that to happen. Unity is sort of accessible but the functionality is not really there for Orca users.

385
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But in terms of Gnome or Mate, Gnome and Mate are the most accessible out of the box for Orca users.

386
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Cool. That is really good to hear that perspective because that's obviously something that's very hard for us to test so I really do appreciate you mentioning that.

387
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And also a grader in the chat room points out that if you're not a SystemD fan, Mint 17.2 is a bastion of non-SystemD-ness for you which also probably explains why it's taking a little while to boot up.

388
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It might have to do with the hard drive encryption.

389
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Oh you have it encrypted?

390
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah I've got the hard drive encrypted and the Gnome folder encrypted.

391
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
That definitely could take a bit of a hit. Yeah for sure.

392
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
For boot up time but I don't think that would affect after I've booted up.

393
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It might but yeah I don't know. It might still. Just even though it has the key it still might. I don't know. That's a good question. I'd be curious to see what it would be like with or without it off.

394
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So how was that setting that up? Pretty easy?

395
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah during the install process it was just check a box.

396
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Enter your master password?

397
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah. Cool. And were you able to set one master password for all of them? Or was it different passwords for your home and a different password for your root?

398
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I set a different password for my home and a different password for the root.

399
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Cool. That's really neat. Well very nice. Well thank you for doing that and thank you for coming in from Portland to give us that review in studio too. That was really awesome.

400
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And jump back in and let us know how it goes. Are you going to keep it installed or are you switching to something else?

401
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm going back to Arch.

402
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Okay. Alright well thank you for trying it for a little bit. Yeah I know how you feel too.

403
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Alright well then I'll take a moment and I'll thank our next sponsor right here on the Linux Unplugged program. Of course that's our friends over at Ting.

404
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Go to linux.ting.com to get our special $25 discount off your first Ting device or $25 in service credit if you have a Ting compatible device and you just might because Ting has a GSM network and a CDMA network.

405
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Now here's what I love about Ting. You only pay in for what you use. This is phenomenal.

406
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:23,000
If you've got like a device, like a little tiny computer device that maybe is doing some monitoring or some sort of sensors, you could put a GSM SIM card in that thing and give it internet access for $6 a month.

407
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Why? Tings only pay for what you use with a flat $6 for the line. They just take your messages, your minutes, your megabytes, they add that all up and that's what you pay in.

408
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
That's really simple. And they have a dashboard to help you keep it all straight and it's really a good system.

409
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And because I'm pretty savvy like with the Wi-Fi or I'll use anything. I'll use Hangouts, I'll use Skype, I'll use SIP now with NOAA.

410
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Man, I don't even – we're like seven days into the month. I've probably got like a handful of minutes used total. It's so slick.

411
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And so if you're savvy like that, it's really useful. And here's the best part. You can get a whole team of people on there, right? And $6 a line, that's not going to cost you anything.

412
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And it's just your usage. And then when they get stuck, you can just have them call the Ting customer service. It's no-hold customer service.

413
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You just call and get to speak to a human at 1-855-TING-FTW. That's really nice if you don't want to get stuck having to help people because they've got really good service.

414
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
They've also got great online support and a fantastic dashboard. And one of the great things about Ting is to save my butt a few times is you can just turn on hotspot and tethering.

415
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So if you need data, like oh, maybe I don't know, Comcast goes out on you, happens, and you just turn on the hotspot and tethering and you get Ting's tri-band LTE.

416
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm getting like 20 megabits in the studio. It's really nice. Plus they've got a whole range of devices from basic devices like feature phones all the way up to the Nexus 6, the best stuff.

417
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And one of the things I really like about Ting is they always are iterating on the features around the Ting platform. And so they have a Ting app.

418
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I've told you a little bit about it before. You can find more about it at ting.com slash app. And of course Kyra is here. She's got a little discussion for us too.

419
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I mean I could sit here and tell you about it, but what I love about the Ting app is everything good you need to manage your Ting account.

420
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And why have me tell you about it when Kyra could tell you all about it? Go Kyra. Take it Kyra.

421
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
This is the Ting app of the week. It's also meta. I'm Kyra and this is the Ting app of the week.

422
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I love you.

423
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
At Ting we pride ourselves on giving you the tools to take control of your cell phone bill.

424
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Practically anything you do in your Ting account dashboard on a computer can be done inside the Ting mobile app.

425
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
The usage panel shows how many minutes, messages and megabytes your account and all your devices have used.

426
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Tap a number to check out recent activity on that device. Tap again for detailed event info.

427
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Easily enable or disable device settings like international calling, internet access and picture messaging.

428
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You can view your current bill and detailed billing history and set alerts and caps to keep things under control.

429
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You can also give us a call, access our help site or submit a help request right through the app.

430
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You can also stay up to date on the latest Ting news by hitting the blog.

431
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
You could even watch this episode of the app of the week featuring the Ting app on the blog within the Ting app.

432
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Just be careful not to create a glitch in the matrix.

433
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
The Ting app is available on Android and iOS devices and is free.

434
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You'll find links to the Ting app below or just search Ting in the Google Play or the App Store.

435
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Thanks for watching!

436
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Hey Kyra, and Kyra's all in. Kyra over at Ting was all in and you can get all into linux.ting.com.

437
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Support the show and only pay for what you use. That's right, go to linux.ting.com.

438
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Alright, so now we are sort of winding down towards the end of episode 100.

439
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
We had Romeo join us just a moment ago. Oh, hold on, don't peek, don't peek.

440
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Of course Wes joined us a minute ago and now Nick, right?

441
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That's right.

442
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Nick is sitting down to join us. Nick, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

443
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Thank you for having me.

444
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Now Nick, how was the drive up, first of all? I should start with that. Where did you come from?

445
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm actually coming from Bremerton, so it was a little bit of a drive.

446
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah, I know, it feels like it's pretty far north when you're actually making the trip, huh?

447
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
When you look at it, first of all, that's not that bad.

448
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
But yeah, then you have to make the trip out there.

449
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So Nick, I remember we were talking before we started, you just started kind of looking and moving into the technology field.

450
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And so your day job isn't necessarily working with technology, so why the hell are you using Linux?

451
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Well, I've always kind of been interested. Ever since high school, I've been playing with Ubuntu really.

452
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And then I kind of got into a little deeper into it.

453
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Just stuck with it?

454
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yeah, just kind of stuck with it actually. About six months ago, I completely got rid of Windows.

455
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So how is it going to school, taking technology courses, do they accommodate the fact that you're a Linux user?

456
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Or when they give you courseware and instructions, do they just assume you're on a Mac or you're on Windows?

457
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah, pretty much just have to figure everything out myself.

458
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's almost all Windows and a little bit of Mac here and there.

459
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Do you end up having to run a VM? Is there just no way around it sometimes?

460
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
There was one class I had to run a VM for, just for Microsoft Office.

461
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I had to do some stuff with a newer version of PowerPoint, but that was it.

462
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And now maybe Office Online would help a little bit, I suppose.

463
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The reason why I was kind of thinking about this is I was looking at this, we haven't talked about it yet.

464
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Well, we kind of talked about it when it first came out.

465
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
But there's this Ubuntu-powered Intel Compute Stick. For $110, it's an x86 computer.

466
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's going to ship with a 64-bit version of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, 1.3 GHz quad-core x86, 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of storage.

467
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And it just plugs into the HDMI port. $110 for this.

468
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And this is going to run any x86-compatible application.

469
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:58,000
For schools and libraries and low-budget computers that can do basic computing, this seems like such a no-brainer.

470
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Because you could get a $100 flat-screen computer monitor, plug this into the HDMI port, and you've got a full computer setup for $250 or something.

471
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah, that would be perfect for that whole situation.

472
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm actually really surprised that more schools and stuff aren't using open-source software in Linux.

473
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Well, what am I missing about these Compute Sticks? Because I think there's some skepticism in the Mumble Room about them, right?

474
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Well, one thing is they're very easily stealable if they're just shoved in the back of a monitor.

475
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Yeah, I guess so. But boy, laptops and tablets are also pretty easily stealable, but they still have them in schools and whatnot.

476
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The Ubuntu ones also only have, I believe it was either a single gig or two gigs of RAM, where the Windows one has double that.

477
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Ah, Wimpy, is that what you mean by it being a little more gimped?

478
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Yeah, so way back when, Popey was reading a more optimistic brand of news than me and was saying that the Windows and Ubuntu versions were going to be the same.

479
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But sadly, we find ourselves in the usual position where the Ubuntu version, yes, it's a bit cheaper, which is great,

480
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,000
but it's got one gig of RAM and eight gig of storage versus the two gig of RAM and 32 gigs of storage on the Windows version.

481
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So that's disappointing, but I guess this is Microsoft's deep pockets subsidizing the hardware.

482
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Is it that? Or is it Intel wanted to ship it for a cheaper price, but Microsoft couldn't agree on that because of the amount of RAM that Windows takes?

483
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Well, in the netbook era, Microsoft did their damnedest, didn't they, to make sure that these devices shipped in such a fashion that they weren't ideal.

484
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And they're bending over backwards for the Raspberry Pi B, or Raspberry Pi 2, whatever it is.

485
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah, I don't know that they're bending over backwards. I think that's lip service they're paying to the Raspberry Pi 2.

486
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:59,000
If you've actually looked at what's involved in getting Windows 10 running on a Raspberry Pi 2, it's, well, yeah.

487
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It's a joke. And also it's command line only too, right?

488
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Well, it's not so much that. It's the, you know, you must have Windows 10 preview installed in order to flash the device.

489
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So you must have a Microsoft Connect account. You must have a Microsoft online account.

490
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And there's also, and you must fill out every survey on the Microsoft Connect site before you get access to the Raspberry Pi 2 preview image download.

491
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So there's a lot of stuff you have to do, and a lot of information you have to give away to get access to this.

492
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So I do think those sticks are useful for the low end stuff, like to even, yeah, okay, it ships with Ubuntu,

493
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
but I can see a lot of people wanting to wipe that off and put something like a media center stuff,

494
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,000
and use a Bluetooth remote, or even an infrared remote or something, or a Bluetooth keyboard, and use it as a media playback device.

495
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It's like a Chromecast, but completely open.

496
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So, you know, the things that annoy me about Chromecast is I can't easily play local media without hacking the thing.

497
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I can't tell it to use DNS servers other than Google, so if I wanted to bypass region locks and stuff, that's hard.

498
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Whereas with this device, okay, it's a bit bigger, it takes a bit more power, and it's a little bit uglier than a Chromecast,

499
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and it's a do-it-yourself thing, but I would expect very soon there will be people making x86 images for that kind of device.

500
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah, and wasn't Firefox working on a casting stick? Yeah.

501
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Maybe instead of building the hardware they could just release the software and people could flash themselves,

502
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
but Wimby, you warned us maybe we are not going to want to replace the Ubuntu OS on the stick, what do you mean?

503
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Not just yet. So the wireless device in these Intel compute sticks isn't supported in the mainline kernel just yet.

504
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So if you're comfortable with patching your own kernel with the current out-of-tree drivers, then that's fine.

505
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So, you know, this comes with all the hard work having been done for you, but if you want to run Kodi on it or Arch or something else,

506
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
then for the time being at least you're going to need to roll your own kernel to support it.

507
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:27,000
So maybe in a couple of months that won't be an issue, but just, you know, be fair warned that changing distros is not going to be trivial at the moment.

508
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But this is way easier than using an ARM device like the mythical Mozilla thing that still hasn't arrived and we get no updates.

509
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Right, BNX86, you mean kind of, yeah, the matchstick, that's what it was, the matchstick, thank you Jerem, thank you.

510
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah, yeah, I backed that, I'm still waiting as well. I think I did too.

511
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes, I did back it.

512
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And whilst I agree with Popey...

513
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That is not from Mozilla themselves, just a heads up.

514
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Yeah, no, it's not, it's a project built on top of their platform.

515
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Thank you for the clarification.

516
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:09,000
But whilst I agree with Popey that, you know, x86 devices are far more flexible, versatile, just be fair warned that if you get one of these,

517
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
just be patient before you start wanting to experiment with other distributions.

518
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Now we might have, maybe we'll see something better from Lenovo, right there, Warhead?

519
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
We might be seeing something from them that might be easier for us to use.

520
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah, they're basically redoing the same thing, branding it their way.

521
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
However, with my connections there, we might be able to get Linux running on it fast.

522
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Nice, that would be cool, that would be good.

523
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Theirs is going to run for $130, it says.

524
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi, HDMI compatible, I'm not seeing anything on the, where's the, probably just the same specs, huh?

525
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's probably right down to the letter, and then it's got the Lenovo branding and the WES inside it, so.

526
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Yeah, it's got the Atom processor, it's got 32 gigabytes of storage, so it has a little bit more storage.

527
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
This one will be shipping with Windows 8, oh boy, what a winner that is going to be.

528
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Who would want that?

529
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I've seen some online that are built around the Core M, like in the MacBook.

530
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And I can't remember the price point for those, but I've seen them out there.

531
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Wimpy, before we wrap up, you have a little bit of news to share with us.

532
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You are wheeling and dealing these days, my friend.

533
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Not to stand still, you have another hardware partnership to talk about, tell me about it.

534
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:32,000
We do, so we have our second hardware partnership with an organization called LibreTrend, who are based in Portugal.

535
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And they make the LibreBox, which is really about supporting free software.

536
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So it supports Linux without any drivers that require blobs or anything like that.

537
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So it's quite an interesting initiative because the guy behind it has handpicked all of the components,

538
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,000
has designed his own motherboard, has found a fabricator in China that actually makes his motherboard for him.

539
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But then he actually manufactures the devices in Portugal, including the alloy casing is all bespoke build.

540
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So this isn't an ODM device that he's putting a badge on, the whole thing is entirely bespoke and hand designed.

541
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So if you're a BSD user, this is also a good choice because all of the hardware works.

542
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And one of his aspirations was to actually get this all working with a core boot.

543
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
But that turns out it's quite a long and expensive process to remove a proprietary BIOS.

544
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So at the moment, the LibreBox is using a traditional BIOS, although it doesn't have UEFI.

545
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And in time, he's working on actually replacing that with core boot.

546
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So the last vestiges in his mind of the freedom hating can be removed.

547
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And he has a couple of revisions of this device in the works as well.

548
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So in the not too distant future, there'll be another device announced.

549
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And he's also working on something for 2016, which I can't say anything about, but I'm super excited about.

550
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Sounds like it's going to be a fruitful partnership down the road, long term.

551
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Well, I hope so. I mean, it's nice that these organizations have approached us and said,

552
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
we'd like to ship your operating system. That's really satisfying.

553
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And it's great for me because this particular device, although they're based in Portugal, they ship worldwide.

554
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
So anyone can order these. And up until September the 13th, there's free global shipping as well.

555
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So if you order one now, there won't be any costs.

556
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And there was some criticism when the device was first released about the cost.

557
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So he's listened to that. He watched what was going on on Reddit until our Linux went private.

558
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And he's actually reduced the price of the device within a few days, having watched people's feedback.

559
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So they're good eggs and they're doing the right stuff.

560
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That's awesome.

561
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And yeah, I'm looking forward to getting one of these.

562
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I'm going to use one of these as a little codey box in the front room.

563
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Perfect. You know, I think that's probably a perfect ending point right there because that's also been one of my favorite things

564
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
over the 100 episodes is watching you guys work on that project.

565
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Watch Ubuntu Mate just sort of really, I don't know how else to describe it, blow up, blossom, explode,

566
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and do like from going from something you guys started to really a well-known full flavor of Ubuntu now

567
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
with a couple of hardware partnerships and contributing to open source projects on a routine basis.

568
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I mean, it's a pretty impressive journey. I don't even remember where and about the show's history we started talking about it.

569
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But it's been going on for a while now and that's sprinkled throughout the history of the show too now.

570
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So thank you, Wimpy, for chatting and sharing with us as you've gone along on that. That's really cool.

571
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Oh, well, you're welcome. It's all Popeys fault. We can blame Popey.

572
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Blame Popey.

573
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And it started a year ago to give a take a few days.

574
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Wow. Heck of a year.

575
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
That's when I went around to Popey's house and he got me started on this crazy idea.

576
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
All right. So that's been a heck of a year then. That went fast. Wow.

577
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah, it really did. Yeah. And it's kind of surprising because, you know, I made this for my mom, really.

578
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
My mom and my dad and my wife and my father-in-law.

579
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And now I've got hundreds of friends and acquaintances I've made online that are using it. So it's quite satisfying.

580
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So if people want to find out more about that hardware, go to ubuntu-mate.org and I will link it in the show notes as well

581
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
because that is a pretty, pretty cool deal. Congratulations.

582
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So that's two now. That's two now, right? Two different hardware partnerships. Probably more coming I bet.

583
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah. Yeah. And the original partners, Entroware.

584
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Yeah. Still around.

585
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Their Apollo. Their Apollo device is the same as the Librem 13.

586
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Right. So I've got one of those.

587
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
How do you like it?

588
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah, it's great. Although I'm working on kernel drivers for the trackpad at the moment because that's not properly supported.

589
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I think that'll be a good post-show topic. Stay right there and let's talk about that.

590
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
All right. Thank you everybody for tuning in. If you've been here for 100 episodes, thank you for listening to all 100 episodes.

591
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Join us next week. We'll be here. Go to jupyterblogcasting.com slash calendar to get our time.

592
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com to leave feedback and we'll see you right back here next week.

593
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:08,000
The show, the show. Thanks you guys. That was a lot of fun. Thank you. Thank you Nick.

594
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
You're welcome.

595
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
So Wimpy, tell me how is this Librem laptop?

596
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Yeah, in the main it's very nice. So Entraware have been selling the Apollo for about three months now and part of the agreement I've got with them, they sent me some hardware.

597
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:39,000
So they've sent me two of the laptops to evaluate and the Apollo, which is the Librem 13 I've now learned, that's for me to keep.

598
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And that's now my daily machine that I use. So it's a full metal aluminium case.

599
00:52:48,000 --> 00:53:01,000
My traditional machines are rather clunky and old, you know, thinkpads with traditional quality thinkpad keyboards, which I never thought I would be able to give up.

600
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And the Apollo's got a chiclet keyboard, which I thought I was going to hate. And I've actually realized that actually that's a really good keyboard. I really like the keyboard.

601
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I'm very happy with that.

602
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I think Noah's going to get one.

603
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I'm telling you now, everything that I'm telling you could directly translate to the Librem 13 because in my contact with Entraware and then consequently the ODM and some of the component manufacturers, I've learned that what I have is the Librem 13.

604
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:47,000
It's the same device. The one difference being is that Entraware shipped theirs with a traditional BIOS, whereas Librem are hoping to use Coreboot.

605
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But in terms of the specs and the case and all of the other features, it's the same.

606
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:11,000
But the issue is this, it's got a really nice large trackpad, but the kernel currently detects that as a PS2 mouse, so consequently there's no gesture recognition.

607
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
And what I've also learned, and brace yourself because you've backed the Librem 15, haven't you?

608
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:33,000
The Librem 15 has the same trackpad in it made by BYD. So I've contacted the component manufacturer BYD to try and get the specs and I got a general PDF that isn't all that much help.

609
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:49,000
There's a couple of people I've found on various mailing lists that have had a go at reverse engineering the packet protocol for the USB device to try and enable the full gesture support, and that's quite hard going.

610
00:54:49,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I've made some progress but I don't know enough about kernel development and in particular the input stack, so I'm kind of struggling with that.

611
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:23,000
So what this means is if you actually look at the product updates for the Librem 15, in one of those they actually acknowledge that the trackpad only works as a PS2 device, which means you've got basic trackpad movement, move your finger around and the cursor follows you and you've got edge scrolling, that works.

612
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:33,000
But there's no two finger scrolling or gestures, which means that when you need to right click and drag something that's a bit awkward.

613
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So maybe somebody needs to hold the candle to Purism's toes and just find out what their plan is regarding the trackpad support is.

614
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Actually I had a similar mouse on my Asus laptop and when I installed the new version of Fedora 22 it actually worked right out of the box, so whatever they're doing.

615
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah they have a new lib input library, doesn't Fedora 22 have a new one?

616
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It does, yeah. In fact I think Fedora are actually going to make that mandatory in the next release, so if projects aren't using lib input they're going to struggle because their libraries are going away.
