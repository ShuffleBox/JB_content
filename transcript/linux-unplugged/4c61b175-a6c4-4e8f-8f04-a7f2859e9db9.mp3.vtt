00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
It sounded like you inherited this fancy shaving kit from family.

00:04.200 --> 00:06.160
I got the handle.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.960
It was my grandmother's dad's.

00:08.960 --> 00:09.960
She was going to toss it out.

00:09.960 --> 00:10.960
She was going to goodwill it.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.800
And I was like, I'll take that.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.800
And then I bought the, there was a little brush and cup set at Target for like 20 bucks

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
or something like that.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.800
It was like super cheap.

00:18.800 --> 00:19.800
Awesome.

00:19.800 --> 00:20.800
Yeah.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.400
And then the stand I did get on Amazon.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.720
So it all started with the handle.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.440
That does look like a nice weighty handle.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.720
Like it's got a good feel to it, a good heft.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.720
And it's long too.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.200
Like a lot of the ones that I've seen online, I've looked at different ones, they're really

00:32.200 --> 00:33.720
short and I like the longer handle.

00:33.720 --> 00:34.720
It feels better in my hand.

00:34.720 --> 00:35.720
There you go.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.360
Go get yourself a good wet shave before the show starts.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.160
That's making me want a nice stand like that.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.160
That's the piece I'm missing right now.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.240
You need the mug too.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.920
And then of course, is that, what animal hair is that?

00:44.920 --> 00:45.920
Cause you got to get, what is it?

00:45.920 --> 00:46.920
Oh, it's probably plastic.

00:46.920 --> 00:47.920
Oh, it's not badger hair or something.

00:47.920 --> 00:52.800
I thought like, I thought you had to have like badger hair or something to help.

00:52.800 --> 00:53.800
There's a bunch of different ones.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.200
I didn't buy a good one.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.200
What is it?

00:57.200 --> 00:58.200
It's not badger hair.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.200
Badger the hair of my enemies.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.200
Yeah, they say badger.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.200
Is it?

01:01.200 --> 01:02.200
Oh, okay.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.200
Badger, horse.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
There's like badger.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
There's horse.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
There's like four different kinds.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.600
And then depending on whether you're using a soap or a cream, depends which one you're

01:08.600 --> 01:09.600
supposed to use.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.600
Right.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.440
There's this whole crazy methodology behind it.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.440
Hmm.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.480
Well, maybe I should get in the badger industry.

01:16.480 --> 01:33.600
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 235 for February 6th, 2018.

01:33.600 --> 01:37.800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is prepared for the atomic

01:37.800 --> 01:38.960
revolution.

01:38.960 --> 01:39.960
My name is Chris.

01:39.960 --> 01:40.960
My name is Wes.

01:40.960 --> 01:41.960
Hello, Wes.

01:41.960 --> 01:42.960
Hello.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.660
We have quite the show coming up this week.

01:44.660 --> 01:47.920
So we're going to get into a couple of follow-up items from last week right off the top, but

01:47.920 --> 01:52.760
then we'll get into some community news, and then not one, but two different individuals

01:52.760 --> 01:57.200
from Project Atomic and Fedora Atomic will be joining us to tell us what is the Atomic

01:57.200 --> 02:02.120
project, what is Fedora's role in all of this, and can I one day run this as the ultimate

02:02.120 --> 02:03.800
development workstation.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.840
I really hope so, because it's pretty cool technology.

02:05.840 --> 02:10.480
We'll talk about that, plus somehow I got a wild bug up my butt again.

02:10.480 --> 02:15.340
Last week you heard about it here on the show, and I've, in the span of one week, reloaded

02:15.340 --> 02:16.340
all of my systems.

02:16.340 --> 02:17.340
It's infected everything.

02:17.340 --> 02:18.340
We've launched a new challenge.

02:18.340 --> 02:22.400
I've gotten Wes to reload his system, I've gotten Popey to reload his system, and a whole

02:22.400 --> 02:30.040
crew of people are trying out KDE Neon as the new release of Plasma 5.12 releases today.

02:30.040 --> 02:35.680
It's a new LTS of the Plasma desktop, and it's better than ever, and a huge number of

02:35.680 --> 02:39.380
us have been trying it out, and we're kicking it off this week and inviting you to participate

02:39.380 --> 02:40.380
with us.

02:40.380 --> 02:43.440
We'll give you the details, give you a little status update and how it's going, and all

02:43.440 --> 02:47.600
of that, that's coming up towards the end of the show, plus our friends over at Elementary

02:47.600 --> 02:52.300
OS are trying something big in their app center that we've talked a lot about, and Wimpy's

02:52.300 --> 02:57.320
here to tell us about something very exciting coming to the 1804 version of Ubuntu Mate,

02:57.320 --> 03:02.400
which is gonna be really good stuff, and Wes, on top of all of that, we have our standard

03:02.400 --> 03:03.920
community updates.

03:03.920 --> 03:08.000
Holy smokes, huge show this week, so let's kick it off by bringing in the Mumble Room

03:08.000 --> 03:12.380
time appropriate greetings, time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room, hello virtual lug,

03:12.380 --> 03:13.760
it is good to have you guys.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.760
There it is.

03:14.760 --> 03:15.760
Hello.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.760
Hey.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.840
Oh, I love that sound.

03:18.840 --> 03:23.260
Back in the studio again, Popey Wimpy, how are you guys doing, you all right, you over

03:23.260 --> 03:24.260
the jet lag?

03:24.260 --> 03:25.260
You doing okay?

03:25.260 --> 03:26.260
Yawn.

03:26.260 --> 03:29.160
Sounds about right.

03:29.160 --> 03:35.120
Yeah, well, I guess sort of just to pick up really, just really quick off the top of the

03:35.120 --> 03:42.240
show here from last week's episode, episode 234, we were live from the canonical January

03:42.240 --> 03:47.240
Snap Sprint down at the Hilton in Seattle, and the big news kinda out of that event that

03:47.240 --> 03:54.040
came out just recently is Skype announced shortly after our show that they are packaging

03:54.040 --> 04:00.120
up the Skype application for Linux as a Snap, which is huge news, and that was part of the

04:00.120 --> 04:03.680
work that was conducted there, and I think we're gonna be hearing more coming from that

04:03.680 --> 04:07.560
whole channel too, so that's sort of big, it's good, you know, I went over and reviewed

04:07.560 --> 04:10.880
my audio, I got a couple of secret things that I'll just release here and there, I'll

04:10.880 --> 04:14.480
link it to the media, you know, no, I'm just kidding.

04:14.480 --> 04:18.880
It was a good event, and man, you guys really work hard at those things.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.680
That felt like that was a real serious work session because here's something that you

04:22.680 --> 04:26.300
can tell when people are seriously working is when the end of the day is scheduled every

04:26.300 --> 04:31.920
day at 6 PM and people aren't walking out of the room until 6.15, 6.20, or even later,

04:31.920 --> 04:36.680
you guys really, I mean, down to the, down to the, every hour just working to the grindstone,

04:36.680 --> 04:40.280
so it was interesting to see you guys in your natural habitat, it was good to see you there,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.280
and I'm glad to hear you're making it.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.280
So stay around.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.280
That's a good reason for that though, Chris.

04:44.280 --> 04:45.280
Yep.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.280
We enjoy doing it, that's why.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.280
Oh, Popey.

04:47.280 --> 04:48.280
That's the best.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.680
And you know what, I enjoy getting an opportunity to hang out with you guys, so I'm always happy.

04:50.680 --> 04:51.680
Heck yeah.

04:51.680 --> 04:52.680
It was great pizza, yeah.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.200
You know what I learned?

04:54.200 --> 04:59.160
I didn't know this, but our friends from across the pond taught me, and you were there, I

04:59.160 --> 05:02.000
didn't know, did you know this before we had dinner with them, that they don't have the

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
greatest pizza over there?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.160
I had no idea.

05:04.160 --> 05:09.440
So we took them to America's fastest growing pizza, fast, fast, fast, mod pizza, which

05:09.440 --> 05:13.420
apparently was the first mod pizza, and I guess they said something crazy, like they're

05:13.420 --> 05:18.120
opening up 500 stores a month, which sounds impossible, and so we took Popey and Wimpy

05:18.120 --> 05:22.440
over there and had pizza with them, and Popey said, this is pretty good pizza, and we all

05:22.440 --> 05:25.360
kind of look at each other like, this is fast food pizza?

05:25.360 --> 05:30.320
And my first thought is, oh Popey, I could show you a world of pizza, I could just swoop

05:30.320 --> 05:33.760
you away from Seattle and show you a world of pizza.

05:33.760 --> 05:37.480
Actually I went back in there and the girl behind the camera said, hey, are you English?

05:37.480 --> 05:38.900
And I said, yes, I am.

05:38.900 --> 05:42.600
And she said, did you know we've got these restaurants in the UK?

05:42.600 --> 05:45.880
And she listed all the cities where they have them, so I'm going to make it a mission to

05:45.880 --> 05:47.360
go and find them in the UK as well.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.360
That's great news.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.360
That does make sense.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.360
I can show you the world.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.360
Yeah, exactly.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.720
That was a lot of fun.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.920
And that's sometimes where the best conversations happen, really, is when you're just sitting

05:56.920 --> 05:59.360
around talking about stuff.

05:59.360 --> 06:03.520
I wanted to also just do a quick update on a project that I personally love to follow

06:03.520 --> 06:10.360
because as a longtime desktop Linux user, one of the projects that makes Linux feel

06:10.360 --> 06:17.120
like a first class citizen is the firmware update project, the LVFS project.

06:17.120 --> 06:23.200
And when I'm on my XPS 13 and I get microcode updates and firmware updates coming through

06:23.200 --> 06:25.480
GNOME software, I tell you what.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.480
It feels first class.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.480
It's beautiful.

06:27.480 --> 06:33.760
And so we actually have some really interesting data from the Linux vendor firmware project

06:33.760 --> 06:37.080
because they've recently been introducing telemetry, which I'll tell you more about

06:37.080 --> 06:38.120
here in a moment.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.120
Don't freak out.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.120
It's not that bad.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.240
But we now have an interesting nugget of information.

06:42.240 --> 06:48.180
The Linux vendor firmware project has shipped nearly 1.2 million firmware updates out to

06:48.180 --> 06:51.000
Linux users since they started the project.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.720
1.2 million firmware updates that in the past you may have had to reboot into DOS, a free

06:55.720 --> 06:58.560
DOS or Windows to make that happen.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.160
Remarkable.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.480
This is a remarkable achievement.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.640
Just that right there deserves a moment of recognition.

07:03.640 --> 07:06.240
I want to talk about the telemetry just so you guys are aware of what's going on.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.200
I have more information linked in the show notes.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
But here are some key points.

07:09.200 --> 07:14.520
They're not sharing your IP address with any vendors, not even saved in their database.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.120
They generate a machine ID.

07:16.120 --> 07:20.600
It's a salted hash of your actual Etsy machine dash ID.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.560
And so then they store it based on hash off of that.

07:23.560 --> 07:28.220
LVFS doesn't store reports for firmware that it didn't sign itself.

07:28.220 --> 07:32.360
So if you've been locally building firmwares, you're trying to hack something, you're trying

07:32.360 --> 07:36.960
to mod something, it completely ignores that and does not ever report it up to the vendor.

07:36.960 --> 07:43.360
You can also disable all of the telemetry reporting functionality by editing the fwupdremotes.dcomp

07:43.360 --> 07:44.360
files.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.800
And they've documented all of this.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.800
It's all kind of a...

07:46.800 --> 07:50.120
It's in the early stages, but it seems pretty sane.

07:50.120 --> 07:54.200
It seems like a good mix of giving the vendors metrics that they need without compromising

07:54.200 --> 07:55.680
people's identities.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.720
And I really like the part where it ignores like local stuff that you've been building

07:58.720 --> 07:59.720
yourself.

07:59.720 --> 08:03.120
It seems like they put thought into that from the get-go, and that should make it a lot

08:03.120 --> 08:04.120
more successful.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.120
Yeah.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.120
Yeah.

08:06.120 --> 08:11.600
And I used this when I was in Seattle last week with my Dell XPS 15.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.600
Oh, really?

08:12.600 --> 08:13.600
Nice.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
Yeah.

08:14.600 --> 08:23.600
And it's a simple thing, but it's very satisfying when you just say fwmgr update, and it says,

08:23.600 --> 08:27.100
oh, there are these six firmware updates that need to be applied to your machine.

08:27.100 --> 08:33.760
And it says, right, queued, and the next reboot, you just watch your firmware update, and off

08:33.760 --> 08:34.760
you go.

08:34.760 --> 08:39.600
And this updated things in the past, I've had to install Windows and other things in

08:39.600 --> 08:41.040
order to install these updates.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.700
So this was just wonderful.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.760
And you were doing that with the command line?

08:44.760 --> 08:45.760
Yeah.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.760
Yeah.

08:46.760 --> 08:52.000
I think it's fwupdate manager or something, and just it did it all for me.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
It was brilliant.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Nice.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
That is really great.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
We have the world of tomorrow.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Don't even need.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.240
I figured I knew there must have been a way to do it outside of GNOME software, but I'd

08:59.240 --> 09:01.200
never done it outside of GNOME software.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.640
Because also the nice thing about GNOME software is that it exposes the fact that they're even

09:04.640 --> 09:05.640
available.

09:05.640 --> 09:06.640
I don't even think to check.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.640
Right.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.120
Unless I know about Meltdown and Spectre, then I think to check.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.900
All right, Wes, I want to play a game with you.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.640
Let's see if you can guess the release I'm talking about.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.440
I'm going to give you a few hints and you try to name it.

09:16.440 --> 09:17.440
Okay?

09:17.440 --> 09:18.440
Okay.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.440
All right.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.960
So your first hint is, it's the latest update in their continuous innovation stream that

09:21.960 --> 09:24.640
delivers many new features and enhancements to secure data.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.640
Okay, that's hint number one.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.080
That's pretty broad, though, so I'll give you another one.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.880
Is it Windows Server, maybe?

09:29.880 --> 09:33.360
Okay, here's your next hint, okay?

09:33.360 --> 09:38.640
It's engineered for security at the entry level, allowing you to spend time innovating

09:38.640 --> 09:40.120
while reducing risk.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.160
I do hate risks, so I'm intrigued.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.840
Yeah, and you do love to innovate.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.840
Of course I do.

09:44.840 --> 09:49.200
It has new sandboxing capabilities that allow you to control exactly what applications can

09:49.200 --> 09:51.320
see.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.640
It ships with the GNOME desktop as default.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.360
The GNOME desktop, you say?

09:55.360 --> 09:56.360
Mm-hmm.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.360
Am I narrowing this down at all enough for you?

09:57.360 --> 09:58.360
A little bit.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.160
Okay, it has support for ZFS.

10:02.160 --> 10:05.640
Not Open ZFS, but ZFS.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.640
That's your big hint right there.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.640
This can't be.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.640
I thought it was dead.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.000
No, Wes, it's true.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
It's true.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Solaris lives.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.520
Oracle Solaris 11.4 Open Beta has been released.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.520
Celebrate, everybody!

10:15.520 --> 10:16.520
Woo-hoo!

10:16.520 --> 10:17.520
Yeah, that's right.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.520
It's here.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.520
Solaris 11.4 is here.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.920
You can go grab it right now.

10:20.920 --> 10:25.440
It runs on Spark architectures as well, which who doesn't want that, right?

10:25.440 --> 10:27.120
Everybody wants that.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.400
Yeah, check it out.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.400
Check it out.

10:30.400 --> 10:36.240
Dusty, you might want to check your MumbleTalk key, because it's triggering every now and

10:36.240 --> 10:38.680
then, like when you're typing or something, heads up on that.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.160
Oh, it looks like they got Go now.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.160
They got Golang.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.160
Yeah.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.160
That's exciting news.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.560
Anybody in the MumbleRoom have any interest in trying this out?

10:46.560 --> 10:47.720
Nobody does, right?

10:47.720 --> 10:48.720
Nobody does.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.000
It's adorable that Oracle's still shipping this, though.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.280
I really like it, and it's nice to know that some people that have had some jobs still

10:54.280 --> 10:55.280
have some jobs.

10:55.280 --> 11:01.000
That stuff's really nice, but to hear Oracle pitch this, it's like, I don't know, engineered

11:01.000 --> 11:06.560
for security at every level, because nothing else is, allowing you to spend time innovating

11:06.560 --> 11:08.760
while reducing risk.

11:08.760 --> 11:09.760
Okay.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.760
I'm looking forward to that.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.240
I'll get right on top of that.

11:12.240 --> 11:17.360
Anyways, I make fun, but it is sort of amazing to see, like Wes was saying, it's almost unbelievable

11:17.360 --> 11:19.640
that Solaris continues to chug on.

11:19.640 --> 11:23.240
Solaris Open Beta has been released, and you can go get an ISO of it.

11:23.240 --> 11:26.280
When you go try to download it, the first thing, it's obviously just a cloud pitch,

11:26.280 --> 11:27.280
right?

11:27.280 --> 11:28.640
Streamline your journey to the cloud.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.480
No, let's try this.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.480
You're right.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.480
Oh, no.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.800
This is, okay, okay.

11:33.800 --> 11:38.800
So the, oh, so they're also offering you to spin it up on the Oracle cloud.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.800
Interesting.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.240
And then you can download the USB installer, which is 1.1 gigs.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.840
Oh, I have to first accept the license agreement for it.

11:45.840 --> 11:46.840
Well, come on.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.840
I mean, what website are you at here, Chris?

11:48.840 --> 11:49.840
There you go.

11:49.840 --> 11:50.840
Good old Oracle.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.600
That and unbreakable Linux.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.920
They're unstoppable these days.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.480
They're just unstoppable.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.460
So Red Hat actually is a bit unstoppable.

11:57.460 --> 12:01.640
We're going to talk a lot about Red Hat today, so let's kick it off with something that's

12:01.640 --> 12:02.640
kind of neat.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.160
I think it was Alex that pinged me about this.

12:05.160 --> 12:09.520
This is an initiative that Red Hat's taking to the community to help design the next Red

12:09.520 --> 12:10.520
Hat logo.

12:10.520 --> 12:11.520
Oh.

12:11.520 --> 12:16.000
Yeah, they're essentially taking input from everybody, and it's funny to hear them talk

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
about this.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
They say, we need your ideas.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.660
The more feedback we get, the more likely we are to make the best decision.

12:22.660 --> 12:28.000
And it's sort of, they talk about how their icon, how their logo sucks as an icon is one

12:28.000 --> 12:29.520
of the things they really don't like about it.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.520
Really?

12:30.520 --> 12:35.840
It's a 17 years is a long time for a logo, and when we made this logo, we weren't really

12:35.840 --> 12:38.240
thinking about what it was going to be used for.

12:38.240 --> 12:42.680
We were like sort of secret agents of change, but that's kind of different now, and it does

12:42.680 --> 12:43.680
suck as an icon.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.640
Anyways, I think they're early in the stages, so I wanted to let you guys know about it

12:46.640 --> 12:47.640
right now.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.320
You know, I know we do have a few graphic artists in the audience that might actually

12:50.320 --> 12:52.400
care about this, so you'll find a link in the show notes.

12:52.400 --> 12:58.040
Go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com, look for Linux Unplugged 235, or just go to redhat.com and

12:58.040 --> 13:00.080
look around on the About Red Hat section of the site.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.520
That's where they have this going on.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.520
Neat idea.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.520
It is a neat idea.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.240
And it's a change of pace from Red Hat on this kind of stuff.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.280
I don't think I've ever seen them do something like this before.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.680
Interesting community aspect.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.440
We do have much to get into.

13:11.440 --> 13:16.040
We have two gentlemen from Red Hat here today to talk to us about Project Atomic, which

13:16.040 --> 13:21.880
we've got into a little bit on the show before, but I recently had a change of framing for

13:21.880 --> 13:26.720
Project Atomic, and I went from thinking about it as a way to deploy Fedora on servers, and

13:26.720 --> 13:33.160
I went to thinking, well, what about a bulletproof workstation, which is actually a bigger project

13:33.160 --> 13:38.200
that I'm working on, and a bigger topic that we're actually going to get into today is

13:38.200 --> 13:44.760
I'm still working towards the most reliable, bulletproof, as close to appliance, assuming

13:44.760 --> 13:47.040
the hardware is functional.

13:47.040 --> 13:51.680
I would like the software to be as close to reliable, immutable infrastructure, as they

13:51.680 --> 13:52.680
say.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.360
I want an immutable workstation, Wes.

13:54.360 --> 13:58.800
And we'll pick Dusty and Ian's brain here in a moment and see if that's possible.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.040
But before we go any further, let's start right now by thanking Ting for making this

14:02.040 --> 14:03.320
here show possible.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.660
Now years into it, I've never been a happier Ting customer.

14:06.660 --> 14:08.800
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.040
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.040
Here's what's great about it.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.720
You only pay for what you use.

14:12.720 --> 14:16.280
So if you don't use the phone a lot, or you don't use a ton of data, or you don't send

14:16.280 --> 14:19.140
text messages, you don't pay for that functionality.

14:19.140 --> 14:25.080
I do everything either over, well, almost everything over Telegram and a couple of other

14:25.080 --> 14:26.380
messaging services.

14:26.380 --> 14:30.920
The only thing I use text messages for is when I log into Twitter and they two-factor

14:30.920 --> 14:32.720
me over SMS.

14:32.720 --> 14:37.160
So like why pay for 300 text messages when I maybe use three a month?

14:37.160 --> 14:38.160
There's no reason.

14:38.160 --> 14:41.400
There's just no, except that you pretty much every other carrier, you just have to.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.400
You just have to.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.400
Ting is different.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.960
It's a fair price for however much you talk, text, and data you use.

14:45.960 --> 14:52.680
With nationwide coverage, GSM and CDMA, no contracts, no quote unquote agreements, nothing

14:52.680 --> 14:53.680
like that.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.160
And they have a beautiful control panel to let you control all of it.

14:56.160 --> 15:00.540
You check your usage, take complete control of your account, turn services on and off.

15:00.540 --> 15:04.340
They have great devices you can buy directly or bring your own.

15:04.340 --> 15:06.040
And it is Ting's birthday right now.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.040
So what else?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.040
They're doing a giveaway.

15:08.040 --> 15:12.440
The first hundred Ting customers are getting a shirt just automatically, but you still

15:12.440 --> 15:15.300
have a chance, even if you just recently become a Ting customer, or maybe you're not even

15:15.300 --> 15:19.160
one yet, to get in and get some free Ting swag.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.080
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

15:21.080 --> 15:25.440
That gives you the $25 discount on service or off a device, and it lets them know you

15:25.440 --> 15:26.440
heard about it here.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.640
And then you can browse over the blog, check them out.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.700
There's some really incredible devices.

15:30.700 --> 15:35.960
They have the full range of Moto devices that are almost just vanilla Android with a couple

15:35.960 --> 15:42.320
of improvements, and then big batteries, expandable storage, multi-network chipsets.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.640
It's really great value for the Motorola devices.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.800
You can buy them directly from Ting.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.980
Buy any device from Ting or bring your own.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.920
Just get started by going to linux.ting.com.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.580
They have a savings calculator.

15:52.580 --> 15:55.520
You can plug your information in there, see how much you would save, and see if it's a

15:55.520 --> 15:56.520
great fit.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.640
And something tells me it probably is, linux.ting.com.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.640
Big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the show, linux.ting.com.

16:03.640 --> 16:08.980
Well, I want to say a big welcome to Dusty and Ian from the show.

16:08.980 --> 16:10.460
We've been planning this for a little while.

16:10.460 --> 16:12.840
You guys are pretty busy traveling the world.

16:12.840 --> 16:18.320
I would imagine preaching the good news about Project Atomic and whatnot.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.520
So guys, welcome to the show.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.520
Thanks for making it.

16:21.520 --> 16:22.920
I really appreciate it.

16:22.920 --> 16:23.920
Thanks for having us.

16:23.920 --> 16:24.920
Indeed, thank you.

16:24.920 --> 16:29.740
Now, I've roughly talked about Project Atomic on the show before, and I kind of feel like

16:29.740 --> 16:34.520
before we get into Fedora Atomic, it would be sort of great to just sort of establish

16:34.520 --> 16:39.760
what Project Atomic it is, what it is itself, because I think that's kind of like essential

16:39.760 --> 16:40.960
first bits of information.

16:40.960 --> 16:46.280
Dusty, do you want to take that to sort of the elevator pitch on Project Atomic and what

16:46.280 --> 16:47.560
problem it solves?

16:47.560 --> 16:49.720
Yeah, I can try to do that.

16:49.720 --> 16:54.360
So Project Atomic is essentially, it's like an umbrella project for a lot of different

16:54.360 --> 16:59.360
technologies related to next generation container technology.

16:59.360 --> 17:04.980
So for example, Atomic Host, which is kind of what we're here to talk about today, was

17:04.980 --> 17:07.620
one of the first initiatives out of that.

17:07.620 --> 17:13.680
Some of the changes that we've made to Docker live in upstream repos under Project Atomic.

17:13.680 --> 17:17.840
Pretty much any discussion that we have related to things that we want to do in the container

17:17.840 --> 17:21.920
landscape go on under that umbrella upstream.

17:21.920 --> 17:22.920
Okay.

17:22.920 --> 17:29.120
And so the key phrase you said in there was the host aspect of Project Atomic, and that

17:29.120 --> 17:35.140
is essentially either Fedora or CentOS or perhaps, correct me if I'm wrong, but maybe

17:35.140 --> 17:40.240
even Red Hat Enterprise Linux itself, there are atomic versions of those different Linux

17:40.240 --> 17:41.240
distributions?

17:41.240 --> 17:42.240
That's correct.

17:42.240 --> 17:47.120
Yeah, we have Fedora Atomic Host, which is something that we build continuously pretty

17:47.120 --> 17:50.160
much but we only deliver every two weeks.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.720
We don't believe that people want an update every night.

17:52.720 --> 17:57.580
However, if they do want an update every night, they can access those if they want them.

17:57.580 --> 18:02.080
We also have Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host, which is something that we build from

18:02.080 --> 18:05.960
rel bits and deliver every six weeks.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.320
And there's also the CentOS Atomic Host, which follows from that.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.320
Okay.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.320
All right.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.320
So that's all pretty understandable.

18:12.320 --> 18:17.980
And am I correct in my understanding that one of the core benefits of an atomic host

18:17.980 --> 18:25.040
is that the host itself, the core OS is updated via like OS tree snapshots, which is essentially

18:25.040 --> 18:28.520
sort of disconnected from the data and the containers that might be running on the host.

18:28.520 --> 18:34.640
So you can you can update your host operating system via OS tree and then it just reboots

18:34.640 --> 18:37.600
and then reconnects to the containers and the applications of the data move on like

18:37.600 --> 18:39.760
nothing changed, correct?

18:39.760 --> 18:40.760
That's right.

18:40.760 --> 18:41.760
Yeah.

18:41.760 --> 18:46.480
So for example, the user file system is read only and there are two file systems that are

18:46.480 --> 18:48.020
read write.

18:48.020 --> 18:51.560
One of them is the slash etc or slash etc directory.

18:51.560 --> 18:57.740
So that's read write and it's also tracked, which means that whenever you want to go back

18:57.740 --> 19:03.320
to the previous deployment, say you do an upgrade and you don't like it, it also means

19:03.320 --> 19:09.920
that all of your configuration data in Etsy gets reverted back to that state from before.

19:09.920 --> 19:15.800
So the rollbacks are a big part of this and is it all or nothing type of rollback?

19:15.800 --> 19:24.120
So mostly at least for the data that's delivered in the OS tree that gets rolled back and then

19:24.120 --> 19:30.360
anything in Etsy gets rolled back, but slash var that that stays the same.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.360
Okay.

19:31.360 --> 19:35.600
And the other thing that sort of jumps out at me about this is you guys in the slides

19:35.600 --> 19:38.680
that you sent me, you sort of go out of your way to say this is not a disk image.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.200
This is a tree.

19:40.200 --> 19:44.520
What's the difference and what's the benefit between shipping your base image of your OS

19:44.520 --> 19:47.800
as an image versus a OS tree?

19:47.800 --> 19:53.820
So there are some trade offs, but more or less OS trees kind of like a file system layer

19:53.820 --> 19:55.400
technology.

19:55.400 --> 20:00.160
So it knows about all of the different files that are at a part of the tree, which also

20:00.160 --> 20:08.240
means that it can dedupe any files that are common between say one update to the next.

20:08.240 --> 20:14.800
And it also knows about all of the packages that are included in the tree.

20:14.800 --> 20:18.920
So it's kind of a little bit of a higher level.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.960
Is that using RPM to keep track of the packages?

20:21.960 --> 20:22.960
It does.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.440
It uses RPM to keep track of the packages.

20:24.440 --> 20:29.600
And we kind of decided to do that more or less because it was a natural flow from what

20:29.600 --> 20:30.600
we already do.

20:30.600 --> 20:35.080
It complements kind of what's going on in Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.880
We can just pick up what's going on there, all the hard work that's going in there and

20:38.880 --> 20:40.440
just build it a different way.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.440
Okay.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.440
Fair enough.

20:42.440 --> 20:50.240
And I would imagine in a Fedora atomic host or a CentOS atomic host, my base atomic system

20:50.240 --> 20:51.640
is probably pretty minimal.

20:51.640 --> 20:57.760
I'm not installing MySQL and Apache on the atomic host, I'm loading that into containers.

20:57.760 --> 21:02.920
So it's a simpler system in a sense to update and manage, correct?

21:02.920 --> 21:03.920
That's right.

21:03.920 --> 21:09.240
So typically we do want people to use containers for their application software.

21:09.240 --> 21:15.760
However, we have added some technology later from when we first came out with atomic host

21:15.760 --> 21:20.980
to enable people to package layer things, which essentially means they can install RPMs

21:20.980 --> 21:22.720
if they want to.

21:22.720 --> 21:27.800
But generally what we prefer people to do is only package layer things that are hard

21:27.800 --> 21:29.400
to containerize.

21:29.400 --> 21:34.240
Like for example, if you want like a system daemon running on your system, like for example

21:34.240 --> 21:40.520
Firewall D or any really low level thing that would be hard to containerize because it would

21:40.520 --> 21:45.640
have to be like a really privileged container or access parts of the host operating system.

21:45.640 --> 21:49.040
We prefer that you probably package layer that.

21:49.040 --> 21:54.200
But like anything that's really easy to containerize, like an Apache daemon or a database or something

21:54.200 --> 21:58.040
like that, we would much rather you pull that from a registry.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.040
Awesome.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.920
That makes it actually, that just seems like the way of the future too.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.720
Ian, honestly, if I've glossed over anything that you think we should touch on, feel free

22:05.720 --> 22:06.720
to jump in.

22:06.720 --> 22:11.160
I'm kind of new to all of this, so I'm likely to miss something and you are welcome to catch

22:11.160 --> 22:12.160
me.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.520
But I did have a kind of a clarification question.

22:14.520 --> 22:18.560
I'm not sure who might be the better person to ask, but just so I can conceptualize it,

22:18.560 --> 22:23.120
as an old sysadmin, what does it look like, say I want to go from Fedora, and I'm probably

22:23.120 --> 22:30.940
getting the vernacular wrong, but say I want to go from an atomic Fedora host 26 to 27,

22:30.940 --> 22:32.760
what functionally do I do?

22:32.760 --> 22:39.780
What do I have to actually functionally do to bring a Fedora atomic 26 to 27?

22:39.780 --> 22:43.160
So I'll take that one.

22:43.160 --> 22:47.200
Essentially what we have right now is, I don't know if I actually mentioned this before,

22:47.200 --> 22:53.520
but I like to pitch the technology behind atomic host and atomic host itself as like

22:53.520 --> 22:56.600
Git for your operating system.

22:56.600 --> 23:02.600
So essentially what you have whenever you create a new OS tree commit is you feed it

23:02.600 --> 23:08.440
a list of RPMs and maybe some scripts to run, and it basically creates a new repo for you

23:08.440 --> 23:13.120
that's like a Git repo, but with just all the files hashed and compressed and everything.

23:13.120 --> 23:17.360
Oh, okay, is that something that Fedora Project does for each release?

23:17.360 --> 23:22.760
Yes, so every time we get new package updates, we essentially make a new commit in the server

23:22.760 --> 23:30.480
repository and that can be served over just plain HTTP slash HTTPS.

23:30.480 --> 23:38.320
But to answer your question, so right now for Fedora 26, we have one repo that's like

23:38.320 --> 23:42.160
a Git repo, and for Fedora 27, we have a different one.

23:42.160 --> 23:46.080
So essentially what you would do if you want to move from one to the other is you just

23:46.080 --> 23:51.960
run a RPM OS tree rebase command that will rebase from one of the upstream repos to the

23:51.960 --> 23:52.960
other one.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.840
It'll pull in all the new software and you're off to the races.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.680
Ah, the rebase command, I see.

23:58.680 --> 23:59.680
Fascinating.

23:59.680 --> 24:07.840
And is there any discussion right now of how frequently atomic users are expected to upgrade

24:07.840 --> 24:08.840
to the next release?

24:08.840 --> 24:13.920
I know 27 came out for atomic, came out like November-ish, right?

24:13.920 --> 24:18.160
Which was after the official 27 release, the standard 27 release, is there an expectation

24:18.160 --> 24:21.840
that users do an immediate upgrade or how does that work?

24:21.840 --> 24:24.280
How do you decide how long something like that gets supported?

24:24.280 --> 24:28.620
I'm sure it'll be different for each project, but in regards of Fedora, how does that work?

24:28.620 --> 24:35.460
So in Fedora, obviously we're trying to minimize the maintenance burden there.

24:35.460 --> 24:40.600
So since we actually do a decent amount of testing on each one of the releases that we

24:40.600 --> 24:45.040
do, we've tried to automate that as much as possible and we're getting better about that.

24:45.040 --> 24:48.960
But we've tried to focus on just the latest release.

24:48.960 --> 24:54.960
So for example, because we're doing testing, we really recommend people to update as soon

24:54.960 --> 24:57.120
as possible.

24:57.120 --> 25:03.080
And Fedora 27 Atomic Coast did ship at the same time Fedora 27 did, which is good.

25:03.080 --> 25:08.840
But if somebody wanted to stay on Fedora 26, we essentially have something we call life

25:08.840 --> 25:14.720
support, which basically means all of the automated building and testing still happens.

25:14.720 --> 25:18.240
It's just not necessarily our priority to get it fixed.

25:18.240 --> 25:21.160
So Fedora 27 is our priority right now.

25:21.160 --> 25:28.400
And that seems like a much more manageable position for administrators to be in when

25:28.400 --> 25:36.300
your data is isolated off, your applications are in containers, and the updates are transactional.

25:36.300 --> 25:40.520
So the risk of upgrading, it's a totally different set of risks than it used to be.

25:40.520 --> 25:41.520
It's a whole new beast.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.520
It's not the same.

25:42.520 --> 25:45.060
It's not your dad's Fedora upgrade.

25:45.060 --> 25:46.060
It's a whole new thing.

25:46.060 --> 25:47.060
So what's the downside?

25:47.060 --> 25:48.360
Because it can't all be rainbows, right?

25:48.360 --> 25:54.280
There has to be things that are not as flexible or things that perhaps maybe might make it

25:54.280 --> 25:57.000
not as ideal for certain types of use cases.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.760
Right.

25:58.760 --> 26:04.120
So there are definitely corner cases that are tricky for us right now.

26:04.120 --> 26:11.600
We try to support pretty much being able to package layer every RPM that exists, but obviously

26:11.600 --> 26:16.840
there are corner cases where, for example, an RPM might install something into slash

26:16.840 --> 26:18.060
opt.

26:18.060 --> 26:22.820
And by default, we kind of want that to be a writable file system so that people can

26:22.820 --> 26:25.880
put software there if they want to.

26:25.880 --> 26:32.400
So if we have a particular directory that's covered under the tree, we want to make sure

26:32.400 --> 26:34.480
that that's read only.

26:34.480 --> 26:42.560
So there are small issues that we're tracking down and trying to make fully compatible.

26:42.560 --> 26:47.380
But it's one of those things that takes a little bit of getting used to, but as soon

26:47.380 --> 26:53.200
as you are in a world where you've got most things containerized, this type of operating

26:53.200 --> 26:55.400
system really makes sense.

26:55.400 --> 27:01.980
And to me, the most valuable thing is the fact that you can essentially look at the

27:01.980 --> 27:09.240
status on Atomic Host and you can see exactly what commit and corresponding version you're

27:09.240 --> 27:10.920
booted into.

27:10.920 --> 27:14.540
And you can go and say, hey, I'm seeing this bug.

27:14.540 --> 27:16.280
Can you guys reproduce this?

27:16.280 --> 27:21.600
And somebody can go deploy that exact commit and version and see if they have the same

27:21.600 --> 27:22.600
problem.

27:22.600 --> 27:28.160
And that also means that we essentially have a base operating system that is a base test

27:28.160 --> 27:31.280
line for CI in the future.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.280
Okay.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.960
Boy, that is a great point about being able to go to that specific version.

27:34.960 --> 27:39.760
I was messing around with it a little bit and I couldn't actually quite grok how it

27:39.760 --> 27:43.760
would work as a workstation, but people have been suggesting this to me.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.920
I've been getting emails into the show where people have said it's early days, but have

27:46.920 --> 27:51.240
you considered an Atomic Fedora workstation?

27:51.240 --> 27:56.760
Is this possible in this setup where applications are containerized and the base OS is supposed

27:56.760 --> 27:57.760
to be minimal?

27:57.760 --> 28:02.760
Is that even a possibility or is that somewhere where Fedora could go someday?

28:02.760 --> 28:06.960
I've seen the Fedora, I think there's an Atomic workstation testing image, correct?

28:06.960 --> 28:07.960
Yeah.

28:07.960 --> 28:14.160
So it's actually, sorry, it's something that's been around for a while, but it's been something

28:14.160 --> 28:17.580
that's kind of been a real side project for a while.

28:17.580 --> 28:23.120
For a long time, it wasn't necessarily getting proper updates because something would break.

28:23.120 --> 28:27.760
But now with Fedora 27, we officially came out and said, hey, we're going to ship updates

28:27.760 --> 28:29.840
every night.

28:29.840 --> 28:34.520
And so it's something that people can try out as a daily driver if they want to.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.080
It's still a little rough around the edges.

28:36.080 --> 28:41.480
For example, some of the integrations with GNOME software, for example, package layering

28:41.480 --> 28:43.800
packages don't exist.

28:43.800 --> 28:48.920
However, for flat packs, GNOME software does have integration for that.

28:48.920 --> 28:54.560
So anything that you want to install as a flat pack works great on Atomic workstation.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.960
We also just put out a blog post today.

28:56.960 --> 29:02.840
I linked to it in the IRC channel about Atomic workstation.

29:02.840 --> 29:09.160
And so if we want to link that to users that are listening today, they can check it out.

29:09.160 --> 29:12.080
You might be able to give it a spin and see what you think.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.480
So yeah, we're interested in having more people use it.

29:15.480 --> 29:20.400
It uses the same underlying technology as Atomic host, which basically means the more

29:20.400 --> 29:24.140
people we get hammering on it and using it, the better it'll be over time.

29:24.140 --> 29:26.120
Are the applications containerized?

29:26.120 --> 29:29.120
Are they part of the base OS tree?

29:29.120 --> 29:31.020
How does it work with the workstation?

29:31.020 --> 29:36.520
So with the workstation, it's essentially a different set of packages from Atomic host.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.480
So it's basically like Atomic host plus plus, right?

29:40.480 --> 29:46.380
So it's got Firefox installed as an RPM by default in the base OS tree, right?

29:46.380 --> 29:48.480
So that's delivered with the tree.

29:48.480 --> 29:52.400
It's got your full desktop environment that you might want.

29:52.400 --> 29:58.920
So it's basically Atomic host, but with extra RPMs on top that somebody would want on their

29:58.920 --> 29:59.920
laptop.

29:59.920 --> 30:00.920
Okay.

30:00.920 --> 30:07.280
And the intention is so far when 28 comes out to have a release of Atomic workstation

30:07.280 --> 30:08.800
28?

30:08.800 --> 30:09.800
That's right.

30:09.800 --> 30:13.040
Being able to rebase just the same.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.520
That's exciting.

30:15.520 --> 30:22.000
Do you feel like that this maybe puts Fedora back into a different category that traditionally

30:22.000 --> 30:29.280
CentOS and Ubuntu LTSs and distributions that had multi-year support cycles tended to hold?

30:29.280 --> 30:33.440
Because I would tell you, when you combine what you guys are working on with Project

30:33.440 --> 30:40.840
Atomic and cockpit and the server and cloud spins of Fedora that are super simple to spin

30:40.840 --> 30:45.560
up on a digital ocean droplet and then you load cockpit on top of that and in minutes

30:45.560 --> 30:49.680
you've got a graphical management system to Docker images where you're loading up Next

30:49.680 --> 30:52.880
Cloud and BitTorrent sync like nobody's business.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.880
I've done it.

30:53.880 --> 30:54.880
It's amazing.

30:54.880 --> 30:59.720
And the only thing that stops me is I know in about eight months or so I'm going to be

30:59.720 --> 31:05.460
upgrading that sucker to the next release of Fedora and even though for the last three

31:05.460 --> 31:07.840
or four releases it's been solid, it still gives me pause.

31:07.840 --> 31:12.560
I just want to set it and forget it like a toaster oven.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.720
Is that the intention with Atomic?

31:14.720 --> 31:17.360
Yeah, I believe so.

31:17.360 --> 31:24.320
People have always approached upgrades with pause for good reason and this transactional

31:24.320 --> 31:27.880
based approach will obviously help us do that.

31:27.880 --> 31:33.260
Another thing is if you're not necessarily on the workstation, if you have maybe some

31:33.260 --> 31:41.400
servers that you don't want to keep down for very long, the way it works for the updates

31:41.400 --> 31:44.080
are they kind of get pulled down in the background, right?

31:44.080 --> 31:50.880
So none of the software gets updated and is in a half updated state at any point and then

31:50.880 --> 31:53.580
on reboot you're basically into the new system.

31:53.580 --> 31:57.600
That would maybe be the only downside really is that you have to do the reboot to switch

31:57.600 --> 31:58.600
over.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.200
Yep, that's true.

32:01.200 --> 32:08.480
It's something that we've actually considered how we could possibly work around that fact.

32:08.480 --> 32:14.640
There are parts for example now when you package layer by default you need to reboot to get

32:14.640 --> 32:21.760
into the new tree but we have an experimental live FS feature which basically says if I've

32:21.760 --> 32:27.260
only installed new software then there's no chance that any software that exists is in

32:27.260 --> 32:31.440
a half-upgraded state so I'll just go ahead and apply that live to the tree, right?

32:31.440 --> 32:32.440
That's clever.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.440
Okay.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.440
Kind of bridged the gap a little bit there.

32:35.440 --> 32:38.000
It's interesting trying to do that between the, you know, it seems like a lot of that

32:38.000 --> 32:42.060
would work super well on the server side of things where you have maybe perhaps more automation

32:42.060 --> 32:44.600
and things and then trying to bridge that to the desktop world.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.600
Right.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.880
Yeah, needless to say I work with some really smart people.

32:47.880 --> 32:48.880
I'm very lucky.

32:48.880 --> 32:55.900
Well, I've been really kind of pondering where this is going because it seems like a really

32:55.900 --> 32:58.920
solid solution but what's next?

32:58.920 --> 33:05.480
What's next for Project Atomic and maybe specifically what's next for Fedora users?

33:05.480 --> 33:08.680
So I think what's next for Project Atomic.

33:08.680 --> 33:13.560
Obviously we have a lot of those corner cases that I mentioned before.

33:13.560 --> 33:16.840
Live FS is still experimental.

33:16.840 --> 33:25.800
There is actually a proposal by Colin who wrote OS tree and RPM OS tree to offer a different

33:25.800 --> 33:27.200
method for distribution.

33:27.200 --> 33:32.120
So for example, there are a decent number of people who mirror everything around in

33:32.120 --> 33:37.300
their infrastructures via like using RPMs, right?

33:37.300 --> 33:40.560
We've kind of got them in this model where all they need to do to deliver software is

33:40.560 --> 33:43.960
deliver RPMs everywhere, mirror those around.

33:43.960 --> 33:47.520
And then obviously now container images as well, right?

33:47.520 --> 33:50.080
So they've got RPMs to deal with.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.780
They've got container images to deal with.

33:51.780 --> 33:57.420
They don't need a third artifact to move around, which is OS trees, right?

33:57.420 --> 34:04.400
So there's a new effort by Colin to try to basically ship or transport part of this OS

34:04.400 --> 34:10.800
tree in an RPM too as just an alternative way to get it around and mirror things like

34:10.800 --> 34:16.640
for example, if you're in an environment that's not connected to the internet or something.

34:16.640 --> 34:17.640
That makes sense.

34:17.640 --> 34:20.720
I guess really, you know, I'm sure the Mumble Room may have some questions.

34:20.720 --> 34:24.280
So Mumble Room, if anybody has anything, just ping me in Discord if you want to ask.

34:24.280 --> 34:29.840
I guess sort of in the news, I would ask, what do you think the main contrast between

34:29.840 --> 34:34.680
Core OS's implementation for transactional updates and Project Atomic?

34:34.680 --> 34:39.600
As somebody who's just sort of aware that they both have a solution, can you clarify

34:39.600 --> 34:41.560
what the differences are for me?

34:41.560 --> 34:42.560
Yeah.

34:42.560 --> 34:51.760
Yeah, so I think at the highest level, what Core OS uses for container Linux is the update

34:51.760 --> 34:53.760
engine technology from Chrome OS.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.760
Oh, okay.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.760
That's right.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.760
Yeah, that's right.

34:56.760 --> 35:03.080
Yeah, that's basically like a block device level approach, whereas this is more of like

35:03.080 --> 35:05.200
a file system level approach.

35:05.200 --> 35:08.200
And there's benefits and negatives to each one.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.200
That's right.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.760
I forgot about that.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.280
In fact, I forgot about that whole connection.

35:13.280 --> 35:18.480
Well, guys, I know that we've been kicking this around for a while, so I really appreciate

35:18.480 --> 35:19.480
you making the time.

35:19.480 --> 35:22.300
People also don't know, but Dusty went above and beyond.

35:22.300 --> 35:23.300
He joined me.

35:23.300 --> 35:26.240
What time was it, local time, where you were at last night, Dusty, when we were chatting?

35:26.240 --> 35:28.240
It was only 11, not too late.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.240
Oh, yeah.

35:29.240 --> 35:30.240
Okay, sure.

35:30.240 --> 35:33.880
Yeah, so he joined me at 11 o'clock last night to just do audio setup and all of that kind

35:33.880 --> 35:34.880
of stuff.

35:34.880 --> 35:35.880
So I really appreciate it.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.800
I may pick your guys' brains in the future, but is there any other knowledge or tidbits

35:38.800 --> 35:41.640
you want to impart on the audience before we move on?

35:41.640 --> 35:49.520
Yeah, so I'm going to post a link to a lab that I did for a conference last year, which

35:49.520 --> 35:57.400
basically has fully encapsulated like a lab environment for you to run on your local laptop

35:57.400 --> 36:03.120
or desktop or whatever that will really let you go through and learn all the features

36:03.120 --> 36:06.300
of Atomic Host and what it's capable of.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.840
So I'll post that in the IRC channel.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.720
I'm not sure if you can grab that and put that in the show notes, but that would be

36:11.720 --> 36:12.720
really good.

36:12.720 --> 36:13.720
You bet.

36:13.720 --> 36:14.720
I'll definitely put that in the show notes.

36:14.720 --> 36:21.200
I'll also put in the show notes a link to devconf.us, DevConf US 2018, the first annual

36:21.200 --> 36:24.600
free Red Hat-sponsored technology conference, and it's in Boston.

36:24.600 --> 36:29.120
It's for projects, for project people, professional people, people that contribute to open source.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.160
They're in the Boston University area.

36:31.160 --> 36:35.120
It's going to be August 17th, which is a Saturday, and it'll run until the 19th.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.840
Sounds like a good time.

36:36.840 --> 36:37.840
Yeah.

36:37.840 --> 36:43.800
And this is a conference that we've had DevConf, but it's always been in the Czech Republic,

36:43.800 --> 36:46.080
close to one of our offices there.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.960
And it's been a really big success for us.

36:47.960 --> 36:53.600
A lot of people come from all over Europe to come and present on their open source project.

36:53.600 --> 36:57.440
So we decided to bring it over to the US and see how it runs there.

36:57.440 --> 37:03.040
It's not quite as big as something like FOSDEM, but it's definitely a significant conference.

37:03.040 --> 37:04.160
That's pretty nice.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.400
And I'd love to go to Boston.

37:06.400 --> 37:10.320
Boy, I have all these fantasies of just traveling around the world for a year and just visiting

37:10.320 --> 37:11.320
all these different events.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.660
And this would be one on my list.

37:12.660 --> 37:16.440
So it's in Boston if you're in that area, August 17th and the 19th of 2018.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.720
Check it out, DevConf.

37:17.720 --> 37:22.400
It's actually technically devconf.cz.us, but I assume devconf.us will take you there, I

37:22.400 --> 37:23.400
think.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.400
Anyways, we have a link in the show notes.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.400
It doesn't really matter.

37:25.400 --> 37:28.120
I think it does redirect there, yeah.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.880
It's not just for people to attend.

37:29.880 --> 37:35.040
There's a CFP, anybody can submit a talk to get accepted.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.560
So submit your talks.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.560
Very good.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.560
Very good.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.640
And Ian and Dusty, you guys are welcome to join us anytime you have an update on the

37:41.640 --> 37:43.600
project or anything you want to chat about here on the show.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.120
The Mumble Room is always open to you.

37:45.120 --> 37:48.320
So you're welcome to come back and you're welcome to hang out just for the rest of the

37:48.320 --> 37:49.320
show too.

37:49.320 --> 37:52.880
We'll keep chugging along here and you're free to chime in.

37:52.880 --> 37:53.880
Thanks, guys.

37:53.880 --> 37:54.880
Thank you.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.200
Ian, I'm sorry you didn't get a chance, but I'm glad you made it.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.320
I'm sure we'll chat more.

37:57.320 --> 37:58.320
If you stick around, I'm sure we'll get a chance.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.320
Dusty killed it.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.320
He did, didn't he?

38:00.320 --> 38:01.320
He sure did.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.320
Yeah.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.320
You were good support, though.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.800
I knew you were there like gnawing along like, that's right.

38:04.800 --> 38:05.800
That's right.

38:05.800 --> 38:06.800
That's what...

38:06.800 --> 38:07.800
It's a team effort.

38:07.800 --> 38:08.800
All right.

38:08.800 --> 38:12.120
Well, speaking of a team effort, I'll tell you what they would place it as an incredible

38:12.120 --> 38:13.320
team behind them.

38:13.320 --> 38:14.320
And that's DigitalOcean.

38:14.320 --> 38:18.580
Go over to digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

38:18.580 --> 38:20.640
One word, you get a $10 credit.

38:20.640 --> 38:21.940
This is really something.

38:21.940 --> 38:24.180
This is amazing at scale right here.

38:24.180 --> 38:26.720
You want to feel like one of the big players.

38:26.720 --> 38:30.400
You want to feel like you've got one of the big data centers, go spin up a droplet in

38:30.400 --> 38:32.400
less than 55 seconds.

38:32.400 --> 38:35.080
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.080
It's one word.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.080
You get a $10 credit.

38:37.080 --> 38:41.200
Now, my favorite system is three cents an hour, okay?

38:41.200 --> 38:42.200
Three cents an hour.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.800
You get a $10 credit.

38:43.800 --> 38:44.800
So that's great.

38:44.800 --> 38:48.520
If they got a $5 rig, and that $5 rig you can run two months for free, and they've just

38:48.520 --> 38:52.080
recently revamped their pricing, they're even more competitive than ever.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.080
You get...

38:53.080 --> 38:56.040
My favorite machine, I get four gigs of RAM now.

38:56.040 --> 38:57.040
Four gigs of RAM.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.040
What are you doing with that?

38:58.040 --> 38:59.040
You're just so wasteful.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.480
I actually don't really do anything with it.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.480
I don't even need it.

39:02.480 --> 39:06.200
But you know, it doesn't matter because it's so darn affordable.

39:06.200 --> 39:10.440
Right after they rolled out the upgrades, you go into your droplets, you turn them off.

39:10.440 --> 39:16.040
You can resize the disk, and they will automatically and dynamically resize the file system too.

39:16.040 --> 39:19.020
Or you can just say, just the memory, or you can choose.

39:19.020 --> 39:20.320
It's so cool.

39:20.320 --> 39:21.320
So what were we doing?

39:21.320 --> 39:22.320
Why did I have to do that?

39:22.320 --> 39:25.680
You know, you were doing some super-zigguratemic snap research.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.680
That's right.

39:26.680 --> 39:27.680
We were trying to...

39:27.680 --> 39:28.680
Wow.

39:28.680 --> 39:31.440
I probably should not say what we were doing now that I think about that, but it's another

39:31.440 --> 39:34.760
great use case for DigitalOcean, and if you listen to TechSnap, you might know what I'm

39:34.760 --> 39:35.760
talking about.

39:35.760 --> 39:36.980
Oh yeah, that's right.

39:36.980 --> 39:38.160
So we needed to upgrade the rig.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.160
We did, yes, we did.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.160
And that was great.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.160
It just, the timing worked out perfectly.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.160
It worked beautifully.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.320
Yeah, they also have new flexible droplets.

39:43.320 --> 39:47.240
So for $15, you can just mix and match the resources that are just most appropriate for

39:47.240 --> 39:48.240
your setup.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.240
That's nice too.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.240
So you can just...

39:50.240 --> 39:52.560
More memory here, less disk there, or vice versa, whatever.

39:52.560 --> 39:55.000
And now they have CPU-optimized droplets.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.080
Yeah, CPU-optimized droplets, which means basically you're just closer to the metal.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.080
You're right on there.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.360
They're great for highly active front-end servers.

40:02.360 --> 40:05.460
If you're seeing like strong adoption for developers signing up for like an application

40:05.460 --> 40:09.500
you're working on, you want to spin up workplace projects and you want to have a great performance,

40:09.500 --> 40:10.540
it's perfect for that.

40:10.540 --> 40:16.600
They also have really, really large memory systems, hundreds of gigs of RAM.

40:16.600 --> 40:17.880
It's a great setup.

40:17.880 --> 40:21.740
And again, just three cents an hour too, if you just want something that's pretty great.

40:21.740 --> 40:26.720
They have a beautiful interface, tons of different distributions, including Fedora and CoreOS,

40:26.720 --> 40:30.040
FreeBSD, Ubuntu, Debian, and more.

40:30.040 --> 40:34.760
And we even have a pretty fancy new URL you can go to where everything's just preloaded.

40:34.760 --> 40:37.080
You don't have to worry about promo codes or nothing.

40:37.080 --> 40:42.160
Just go to do.co.plugged, do.co.plugged.

40:42.160 --> 40:48.200
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean, do.co.plugged, or use our promo code, coder, or not coder,

40:48.200 --> 40:51.600
that's not the other show, that's do.plugged.

40:51.600 --> 40:52.600
It's pretty cool.

40:52.600 --> 40:57.040
I got to say, those CPU-optimized systems are pretty nuts.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.560
The thing is, the mix and match is probably the way I'll go from now on.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.560
It just seems so handy.

41:01.560 --> 41:06.040
Because it's slightly less than what I end up paying for the system, my most common system,

41:06.040 --> 41:09.720
and the mix and match is perfect because I don't need a lot of local disk, but I generally

41:09.720 --> 41:11.680
want either more RAM or more CPU.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.880
It was more RAM that we needed during the TechSnap experiment.

41:13.880 --> 41:14.880
Yeah, exactly.

41:14.880 --> 41:18.040
So that's just a really, it's really nice to have that flexibility, and plus they just

41:18.040 --> 41:21.960
lowered their pricing on stuff, and they keep adding new features, it just gets better and

41:21.960 --> 41:22.960
better.

41:22.960 --> 41:24.880
There's always new stuff for me to talk about with DigitalOcean.

41:24.880 --> 41:25.960
I freaking love that.

41:25.960 --> 41:26.960
You guys will love it too.

41:26.960 --> 41:33.200
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code, do.unplugged, or, I mean, go to their new fancy URL, do.co.plugged.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.400
I mean, it's kind of fun to say.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.400
It is fun to say.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.400
I'm enjoying it.

41:37.400 --> 41:38.400
The whole thing is fun.

41:38.400 --> 41:39.400
Do.co.plugged.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.240
They also have a really cool command line.

41:41.240 --> 41:44.320
All right, let's talk about other cool things.

41:44.320 --> 41:49.920
Mr. Martin Wimpress, you are really on my list of people that need a nice Christmas

41:49.920 --> 41:50.920
gift this year.

41:50.920 --> 41:55.760
I got to say, if 1804 turns out to be half as good, if the Ubuntu MATE 1804 release turns

41:55.760 --> 41:59.040
out to be half as good as I think it's going to be, I'm going to need to send you a Christmas

41:59.040 --> 42:01.240
card because this is looking fantastic now.

42:01.240 --> 42:03.100
There will be an official post tomorrow.

42:03.100 --> 42:04.820
This is a little bit early.

42:04.820 --> 42:09.400
We don't have all the details yet, but rumor has it that when you decided to implement

42:09.400 --> 42:12.600
high DPI support in Ubuntu MATE, you went all in.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.960
That's the rumor.

42:14.960 --> 42:21.040
The rumors are true.

42:21.040 --> 42:25.040
I've not been doing much of the coding on this.

42:25.040 --> 42:30.580
I did some of the groundwork and actually roped in people from the community.

42:30.580 --> 42:33.160
This has been sort of a two-year journey.

42:33.160 --> 42:39.280
First of all, there's the whole migration to GTK 3, and then there's the upgrading all

42:39.280 --> 42:45.080
of the themes to support the latest versions of GTK 3, and then there's going through every

42:45.080 --> 42:50.760
asset in all of those themes and making sure that there are scaled and non-scaled variants

42:50.760 --> 42:56.560
of all of the assets that are used throughout those themes, which is no insignificant amount

42:56.560 --> 42:57.560
of work.

42:57.560 --> 42:59.720
And we had had help from...

42:59.720 --> 43:03.760
Significant technical work, but I think also just I wanted to say significant political

43:03.760 --> 43:04.760
work.

43:04.760 --> 43:08.120
There is a certain amount of communication that you've had to do or other people have

43:08.120 --> 43:09.120
had to do.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.120
There's greasing the wheels.

43:10.120 --> 43:14.320
There's certain amounts of funding that's had to happen here to make all of this happen.

43:14.320 --> 43:22.520
You're rattling these off, but each one of these was a huge amount of work in of themselves.

43:22.520 --> 43:28.760
Each of these items is a multi-month effort, and each of them has been funded through the

43:28.760 --> 43:31.740
Ubuntu MATE crowdfunding.

43:31.740 --> 43:36.800
And then more recently, we've got to the actual meat and potatoes of this, which is to turn

43:36.800 --> 43:42.020
on the scaling within the MATE desktop itself.

43:42.020 --> 43:46.440
And I've spoken about that, I think this is the third time in five weeks we've spoken

43:46.440 --> 43:47.440
about this.

43:47.440 --> 43:51.120
I promise this will be the last time for some time now, because I'm sure some of the listeners

43:51.120 --> 43:52.880
are bored of hearing about it.

43:52.880 --> 43:59.560
But the big change now is today we've landed the fixes that mean that the high DPI scaling

43:59.560 --> 44:03.040
is completely dynamic.

44:03.040 --> 44:06.920
In other words, to say it automatically detects it and scales itself?

44:06.920 --> 44:07.920
Correct.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.680
See, I think we're not going to be talking about it because we'll be playing with these

44:10.680 --> 44:12.120
fancy new features.

44:12.120 --> 44:14.040
That is great.

44:14.040 --> 44:15.820
That is a big win.

44:15.820 --> 44:23.080
So from the Greta, that auto scales and then the desktop itself now detects if it's got

44:23.080 --> 44:27.000
a high DPI display, dynamically scales.

44:27.000 --> 44:32.680
That's the default, will dynamically scale to fit for high DPI.

44:32.680 --> 44:36.640
And then we've also been able to preserve, we've added, or rather Victor has added a

44:36.640 --> 44:44.160
new prioritization system to the settings daemon so that we can push environment variables

44:44.160 --> 44:47.680
into the session really early on.

44:47.680 --> 44:51.600
And the environment variables that we're interested in here are the ones that provide the high

44:51.600 --> 44:54.880
DPI hints to Qt applications.

44:54.880 --> 45:02.060
So the MATE desktop in GTK is detecting that this is a high DPI environment.

45:02.060 --> 45:06.360
It sets up GTK, but then it provides the hints to Qt.

45:06.360 --> 45:12.200
And that means when you run things like VLC or Kdenlive or whatever your Qt application

45:12.200 --> 45:18.640
is under the MATE desktop, that gets the right font and toolkit scaling hints.

45:18.640 --> 45:21.480
Alls I can say is a round of applause to that.

45:21.480 --> 45:25.780
So Qt applications will feel like first class citizens on the MATE desktop.

45:25.780 --> 45:27.800
That's as best as we can.

45:27.800 --> 45:30.720
Yeah, that's great.

45:30.720 --> 45:36.920
And getting it at the greater level too is a very smooth experience.

45:36.920 --> 45:38.120
That's top notch stuff there.

45:38.120 --> 45:43.600
I mean, this is like the MATE desktop is bringing full top notch high DPI support.

45:43.600 --> 45:47.200
This is as good as it gets on the Linux desktop.

45:47.200 --> 45:50.920
Yeah, it's as good as we can do at this stage.

45:50.920 --> 45:53.800
We can refine it a little bit in the future.

45:53.800 --> 45:58.080
I mean, if you're one of these people that really values all of those millions of pixels

45:58.080 --> 46:04.280
that you've got on your high DPI laptop, suppose you're Linus Torvalds, and you see this scaling

46:04.280 --> 46:09.680
happen, and you don't want that, then you can toggle a setting to change it between

46:09.680 --> 46:15.840
auto scale, a fixed one to one mapping or a fixed scale always.

46:15.840 --> 46:19.200
And if you toggle those settings, then the whole desktop will scale dynamically.

46:19.200 --> 46:21.000
So you don't need to log out or log in.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.920
You can actually flip those settings around in the session and it will just respond instantly.

46:25.920 --> 46:28.880
And this is all going upstream to MATE itself?

46:28.880 --> 46:31.200
This is all being done in MATE desktop.

46:31.200 --> 46:32.880
It's all an upstream project.

46:32.880 --> 46:38.800
It's all landed today, and we've just tagged the MATE 120 release, and that'll be coming

46:38.800 --> 46:40.280
out tomorrow.

46:40.280 --> 46:41.280
Hot dang.

46:41.280 --> 46:42.280
Wow.

46:42.280 --> 46:43.280
So what about the artwork?

46:43.280 --> 46:47.280
So once you get everything scaled up, then you also have the problem that all of your

46:47.280 --> 46:51.160
icons and your graphics also have to be higher resolution.

46:51.160 --> 46:56.400
Yeah, so this is what I was referring to with the work we've done on the theme assets, which

46:56.400 --> 47:03.200
we did about a year ago, and Michael Tunnell helped with that, and Daniel Foray helped

47:03.200 --> 47:04.200
with that.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.200
Oh, you guys.

47:05.200 --> 47:07.600
You guys are great.

47:07.600 --> 47:08.600
I love it.

47:08.600 --> 47:12.120
So the assets are already high DPI ready?

47:12.120 --> 47:16.960
All of the assets that we need to be high DPI are high DPI.

47:16.960 --> 47:24.360
There are a few instances in the code where we're using bitmaps rather than SVGs.

47:24.360 --> 47:29.560
So we haven't clobbered all of those yet, but we'll get to those in due course.

47:29.560 --> 47:32.280
But by and large, it's all done.

47:32.280 --> 47:40.200
And we've also been able to preserve the font DPI scaling, which I've mentioned before.

47:40.200 --> 47:42.320
And this gives us a nice halfway house.

47:42.320 --> 47:49.120
While fractional scaling isn't a thing, being able to scale the fonts independently of the

47:49.120 --> 47:58.200
DPI scaling of the toolkit means that if you've got, say, an XPS 13, you can turn on double

47:58.200 --> 48:02.760
scaling but scale down the font slightly and it gives you a nice halfway house while we

48:02.760 --> 48:04.080
wait for fractional scaling.

48:04.080 --> 48:05.080
Thank you.

48:05.080 --> 48:08.120
Thank you very much for that as an XPS 13 owner.

48:08.120 --> 48:09.120
Thank you.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.120
Wow.

48:10.120 --> 48:15.280
And I am very excited about all of this and this should all be landing for the 18.04 release

48:15.280 --> 48:17.240
of the Ubuntu MATE desktop?

48:17.240 --> 48:18.240
Yeah.

48:18.240 --> 48:25.960
So for Ubuntu MATE 18.04, all of this landed today as patch sets in our snapshot development

48:25.960 --> 48:32.840
packages and MATE 1.20 will come out tomorrow and some point over the weekend, those packages

48:32.840 --> 48:41.040
should hit the Ubuntu 18.04 archive, hopefully in time for Ubuntu MATE 18.04 Alpha 2, which

48:41.040 --> 48:42.600
is next week.

48:42.600 --> 48:43.600
Dang.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.720
Great, great, great work by everybody.

48:46.720 --> 48:48.320
That sounds like...

48:48.320 --> 48:51.000
That's so great that all of this is landing for the LTS.

48:51.000 --> 48:55.080
It's so good because that's the distro that you're going to be strapped with for the next

48:55.080 --> 48:56.080
five years.

48:56.080 --> 48:57.080
Exactly.

48:57.080 --> 49:03.000
And this was something that I really, really wanted to see happen for this LTS because

49:03.000 --> 49:05.280
as you know, they're long lived.

49:05.280 --> 49:09.720
And I felt that if we didn't get there with high DPI, because we're playing catch up,

49:09.720 --> 49:15.140
there's a number of the other desktops that have already got high DPI implementations.

49:15.140 --> 49:19.080
And I felt that if we didn't get there for this release, then we run the risk of losing

49:19.080 --> 49:25.640
users to other development environments, which in of itself is no big deal.

49:25.640 --> 49:30.520
But when you lose users, you lose developers and that's the thing we really wanted to retain.

49:30.520 --> 49:31.520
Good insight.

49:31.520 --> 49:33.280
I completely agree with you.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.920
So let's talk about retaining developers.

49:35.920 --> 49:42.400
And speaking of Mr. Daniel Foray, Dan, you posted a update about App Center payments.

49:42.400 --> 49:47.860
And if I understand it, the kicker here is that security updates, system updates, those

49:47.860 --> 49:52.120
are continuing to be distributed as they always have been in elementary OS.

49:52.120 --> 49:57.240
But now, applications that people have deferred payment on, like they bought for free, they'll

49:57.240 --> 50:03.280
pend in the update section while users have the option to pay for it or put in zero dollars

50:03.280 --> 50:04.880
and get the update for free.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.080
It's a pretty big post.

50:06.080 --> 50:10.500
In fact, you even subtitled it hashtag clickbait.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.500
How are you doing today, Dan?

50:11.500 --> 50:13.200
Are you doing okay?

50:13.200 --> 50:14.680
I'm doing great, man.

50:14.680 --> 50:15.680
I'm doing great.

50:15.680 --> 50:16.680
Glad to hear it.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.920
I mean, I've seen a wide range of reaction about this.

50:19.920 --> 50:24.040
I think understandably, when people hear that you're going to withhold updates and prompt

50:24.040 --> 50:29.720
people for payment, there is a visceral reaction that that's insane and you're money-grubbing.

50:29.720 --> 50:30.720
What's your response to that?

50:30.720 --> 50:31.720
Yeah.

50:31.720 --> 50:35.000
I mean, I got to follow Wimpy here, Santa Claus, followed by the Grinch.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.840
So, okay, so here's the problem.

50:38.840 --> 50:43.200
Let me frame the problem to get, like, this is where we're coming from.

50:43.200 --> 50:46.640
We set out to build out this App Center thing, right?

50:46.640 --> 50:50.980
And one of the goals that we wanted to do when we did that was we want to give third

50:50.980 --> 50:55.440
party developers, so developers that are not elementary, developers that are just like

50:55.440 --> 50:59.580
regular people writing their little open source apps, we want to give them a path to be able

50:59.580 --> 51:02.120
to make a living writing open source software.

51:02.120 --> 51:05.800
Because right now, if you want to write open source software for a living, you got to get

51:05.800 --> 51:11.560
lucky to be hired by like a handful of big corporations and that sucks.

51:11.560 --> 51:18.640
So we were seeking to kind of shift the paradigm and allow anyone to make a living writing

51:18.640 --> 51:21.120
open source software.

51:21.120 --> 51:22.760
But we're not quite there yet.

51:22.760 --> 51:28.040
And so we launched this store like a little over eight months ago, I think.

51:28.040 --> 51:32.240
And where we're at right now is that we have some developers who have made a few hundred

51:32.240 --> 51:37.120
dollars selling their apps, which is more than zero, but it's not enough for them to

51:37.120 --> 51:38.400
live.

51:38.400 --> 51:44.600
And looking at the data we have, it's that about 1% of people that are downloading these

51:44.600 --> 51:48.960
apps are actually paying for them, but it's a really small amount.

51:48.960 --> 51:51.080
And we wondered like, why is that, right?

51:51.080 --> 51:53.160
Like why is it so small?

51:53.160 --> 51:57.600
So we went and asked our users and they said a couple of things.

51:57.600 --> 52:02.080
One of the things they said is that a lot of them will skip paying upfront for an app

52:02.080 --> 52:07.200
because they've never used it or never heard of it before and they want to try it out first.

52:07.200 --> 52:11.700
And then they said that after they've downloaded the app and tried it out, if they did want

52:11.700 --> 52:15.580
to pay for it, now suddenly there wasn't really a way for them to go back.

52:15.580 --> 52:19.800
There wasn't a way for them to keep track of which apps they'd pay for or not.

52:19.800 --> 52:21.280
And there was no reminder.

52:21.280 --> 52:25.820
So even if they, yeah, they didn't think about it or they don't know which apps they've paid

52:25.820 --> 52:26.820
for.

52:26.820 --> 52:29.960
It's like the system wasn't catering for that workflow at all.

52:29.960 --> 52:37.880
So why not build in a limited five-day trial system versus withholding updates?

52:37.880 --> 52:44.060
So we definitely wanted to stay away from things like trials or like time bombs or things

52:44.060 --> 52:47.400
that are going to like get in your way, nag you while you're working.

52:47.400 --> 52:48.400
Yeah.

52:48.400 --> 52:50.800
Like that's the one thing we don't want to do is get in your way while you're trying

52:50.800 --> 52:52.140
to work or play.

52:52.140 --> 52:54.840
Like we don't want to be intrusive.

52:54.840 --> 52:58.760
So we're trying to find a compromise between what's a great user experience and what's

52:58.760 --> 53:00.480
going to help our developers make a living.

53:00.480 --> 53:01.480
Yeah.

53:01.480 --> 53:05.920
In fact, I think I really, really, really appreciate the respect you guys put in the

53:05.920 --> 53:10.160
decision process of what the cost is for interrupting the user's workflow.

53:10.160 --> 53:14.440
I know that was kind of a key thing that you guys thought about and holy crap, do I really

53:14.440 --> 53:15.440
appreciate that.

53:15.440 --> 53:20.000
I really, really hate it when I'm in the middle of trying to do a thought dump into a note

53:20.000 --> 53:23.960
document and all of a sudden a pop-up comes up and interrupts what I'm doing or a new

53:23.960 --> 53:28.100
Chrome extension gets updated and it opens up a new tab and it steals the input.

53:28.100 --> 53:29.760
It is the worst experience.

53:29.760 --> 53:34.880
And so I would never, ever be in a mood to want to pay money towards something when I

53:34.880 --> 53:35.960
got nagged like that.

53:35.960 --> 53:38.140
Like I'm just not in the buying mood.

53:38.140 --> 53:40.520
On the update screen, that's more interesting, right?

53:40.520 --> 53:44.760
Because I'm already going into the app center, I'm launching it and I'm clicking on the updates

53:44.760 --> 53:45.760
tab.

53:45.760 --> 53:48.560
I'm already kind of like dedicating myself to this task.

53:48.560 --> 53:50.100
So how did you strike the balance here?

53:50.100 --> 53:55.720
Like does it just default to like $10 for an app and I just click update and it charges

53:55.720 --> 53:56.720
me?

53:56.720 --> 54:01.360
Or is there a process like once I've decided I'm going to do updates?

54:01.360 --> 54:06.000
Developers who publish their apps in app center get to choose how much they're suggested prices.

54:06.000 --> 54:11.840
So for a given app, it could be $1, $3, $5, $10, it depends on what that developer sets.

54:11.840 --> 54:16.080
And what happens is you go into your updates view and you see all your apps listed.

54:16.080 --> 54:20.560
And if you hit the update all button, all the apps that you've paid for or any free

54:20.560 --> 54:23.400
apps or any system updates will get installed.

54:23.400 --> 54:28.180
But the ones that you haven't paid for will get kind of skipped by that process and they'll

54:28.180 --> 54:33.520
hang out with the regular, the little button that you get like you get on the install page

54:33.520 --> 54:37.920
where it shows the suggested price and then it has the dropdown where you can choose either

54:37.920 --> 54:39.440
a different price or zero.

54:39.440 --> 54:40.440
Right.

54:40.440 --> 54:45.840
So to be clear, these aren't packages from the upstream repo like LibreOffice.

54:45.840 --> 54:50.320
These are applications the developers have independently developed and published to the

54:50.320 --> 54:52.080
app center themselves.

54:52.080 --> 54:56.440
And then when the updates come out, those are suggesting whatever the developer says

54:56.440 --> 54:57.440
that you pay.

54:57.440 --> 55:01.640
But as an end user, you could blank it out and put zero in and hit the update button.

55:01.640 --> 55:02.640
Right.

55:02.640 --> 55:05.000
And you can put in zero indefinitely if you want.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.760
You can go in every time and never pay for the app.

55:07.760 --> 55:09.440
That's totally up to you.

55:09.440 --> 55:10.560
I like the implementation.

55:10.560 --> 55:11.560
It seems pretty clean.

55:11.560 --> 55:12.560
It just sort of fits in.

55:12.560 --> 55:16.600
And I'm curious on the back end, like at the code level, do you guys actually call this

55:16.600 --> 55:18.120
thing the humble button?

55:18.120 --> 55:19.480
Is that what you call it internally?

55:19.480 --> 55:20.480
The humble button?

55:20.480 --> 55:22.280
That's what the class name is.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.280
That's a good name for it.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.280
Because that's what it is.

55:24.280 --> 55:25.280
It reminds me of the humble bundle.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.240
It's sort of based around that idea.

55:27.240 --> 55:30.120
You pay what you think it's worth.

55:30.120 --> 55:33.800
Do you have any kind of early data on if people are actually doing this?

55:33.800 --> 55:36.100
Or is this even shipped yet?

55:36.100 --> 55:38.040
So this hasn't shipped yet.

55:38.040 --> 55:40.280
We wanted to post and talk about it.

55:40.280 --> 55:41.920
We merged the code into master.

55:41.920 --> 55:43.660
So we're testing it.

55:43.660 --> 55:48.040
And we wanted to kind of start the conversation and say, hey, this is what we're planning

55:48.040 --> 55:51.080
to do in the upcoming release.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.920
Let's hear some feedback.

55:52.920 --> 55:54.240
Let's hear some concerns.

55:54.240 --> 55:55.740
Let's answer some questions.

55:55.740 --> 55:59.800
And we've got great feedback from people already that are wondering about things like security

55:59.800 --> 56:00.800
updates.

56:00.800 --> 56:01.880
And so we've gone back in.

56:01.880 --> 56:06.680
And we've made sure that security updates always are included when you hit Update All.

56:06.680 --> 56:08.480
We don't ever withhold security updates.

56:08.480 --> 56:13.120
So that was one thing that user feedback made us go, oh, yes, this is an important case

56:13.120 --> 56:14.120
to cover.

56:14.120 --> 56:20.360
Well, Dan, I did see the typical responses when you do something kind of like this.

56:20.360 --> 56:26.100
But I think the positive thing that I saw was I saw more people coming to the defense

56:26.100 --> 56:31.040
of elementary OS than I've ever seen and more people calling out people that just go with

56:31.040 --> 56:36.800
the standard narrative, that just go with the sort of pre-baked opinion on R Linux.

56:36.800 --> 56:39.120
And more and more people were saying, no, that's wrong.

56:39.120 --> 56:41.480
You need to realize what this project is doing.

56:41.480 --> 56:45.320
There is a change in public opinion.

56:45.320 --> 56:48.480
There's like a wave of change that I see happening for your project.

56:48.480 --> 56:54.360
And I think the risks you're taking with the App Center have directly contributed to the

56:54.360 --> 56:55.540
momentum there.

56:55.540 --> 56:59.480
And I know this one's probably the riskiest change.

56:59.480 --> 57:03.200
This is almost riskier than the App Center itself in a weird way.

57:03.200 --> 57:09.080
But at the same time, I think it's you, the project, doing this is the very thing that's

57:09.080 --> 57:12.880
starting to change the tide of momentum that I've seen just an incredible amount of people

57:12.880 --> 57:17.840
saying, I really need to try that elementary OS or you don't understand what they're doing.

57:17.840 --> 57:20.200
This is their thought process.

57:20.200 --> 57:24.360
In the past, say like last year, say a year ago, I just basically see a bunch of assholes

57:24.360 --> 57:26.160
tearing down the project.

57:26.160 --> 57:32.280
Now I see a handful of assholes tearing down the project and way more people coming to

57:32.280 --> 57:36.800
the defense of the project and way more people saying, hmm, I ought to try that.

57:36.800 --> 57:39.800
So you guys are doing something right.

57:39.800 --> 57:43.880
And I really like that you're kind of collecting the feedback now before this ships.

57:43.880 --> 57:46.680
So what is the expectation here as an end user?

57:46.680 --> 57:47.920
When do I see this land?

57:47.920 --> 57:50.680
When do I expect my updates to start prompting me to pay?

57:50.680 --> 57:51.720
Is it the next release?

57:51.720 --> 57:53.080
Is it going to happen in the current version?

57:53.080 --> 57:55.480
Like what should users expect?

57:55.480 --> 58:00.400
At the moment, the plan is that this update doesn't happen until our next major release,

58:00.400 --> 58:03.640
the code name Juno elementary OS release.

58:03.640 --> 58:08.460
We are kind of toying around with the idea of some users have brought up to us, well,

58:08.460 --> 58:13.600
if I do an upgrade or if I have multiple installs or things like that, like how is this going

58:13.600 --> 58:19.840
to keep track of applications that I've already paid for on my current Loki release?

58:19.840 --> 58:24.100
And so there's some things to think through there about if we need to push out a release

58:24.100 --> 58:28.320
that includes some kind of online account or some kind of importer or exporter or some

58:28.320 --> 58:30.880
way that we can.

58:30.880 --> 58:34.960
There's some other concerns that our users have brought up to us.

58:34.960 --> 58:36.780
That's a challenging problem to solve, right?

58:36.780 --> 58:43.480
Because you don't really want to be in the business of storing user credentials, right?

58:43.480 --> 58:45.120
So there's a lot to talk about there.

58:45.120 --> 58:49.960
And there's some secure ways that we think that we can leverage like native features

58:49.960 --> 58:57.160
of Stripe that we'd be able to store it encrypted on their servers.

58:57.160 --> 59:01.360
But there's definitely a lot of discussion happening there, and like I said, that's the

59:01.360 --> 59:05.080
reason we put this out early, so we can get the user feedback and have them go, hey, well,

59:05.080 --> 59:06.080
what about this?

59:06.080 --> 59:07.080
It's funny.

59:07.080 --> 59:12.120
So Wes and I before this episode of Linux Unplugged just recorded TechSnap episode 355,

59:12.120 --> 59:16.500
and in there we talk about things to think about when you're building a user-based system

59:16.500 --> 59:19.740
like this where you're going to authenticate users and have user identities, sort of perfect

59:19.740 --> 59:23.840
timing because it is a very unique challenge, and I could kind of see why users would want

59:23.840 --> 59:24.840
that.

59:24.840 --> 59:28.760
You know, and Dan, I'll tell you this, and I'm probably unique, so it's not worth it,

59:28.760 --> 59:36.360
but if I knew that if I paid $30 that it would be saved forever wherever I went that I paid

59:36.360 --> 59:40.240
that $30, I'd be more inclined, whereas if I thought I'm going to have to redo it on

59:40.240 --> 59:43.280
every system, I'm going to pay $3 or $5.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.120
So there's something to it.

59:45.120 --> 59:50.360
Like if I knew it was a persistent payment that would benefit me across multiple elementary

59:50.360 --> 59:54.040
installs, I'd be more inclined to pay more, but I might be unique in that way.

59:54.040 --> 59:55.040
Yeah.

59:55.040 --> 59:56.040
But that sounds interesting.

59:56.040 --> 01:00:01.240
I'm really glad you guys are talking about this right now, and are you feeling like the

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.240
course is correct, you're going to continue down this path, you haven't been scared away

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.240
from it?

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:10.360
No, I think the feedback that we've gotten is super awesome.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:16.000
You know, the people that are going to be upset, we're still upset, you know, but from

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.680
the majority of the developers and the users that are using elementary OS, the familiar

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:25.760
faces that we've actively engaged with, it seems like people are excited about this change

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.600
and they think that it solves the problem in a fair way, and they're willing to try

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.720
it out.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.500
And I think that it should turn out good.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:38.280
And if it turns out that we did some wrong things, we'll take more feedback and judge

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.600
us the system and roll out a new one.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:44.600
Producer Michael, you have a question slash suggestion, maybe like a user preference type

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.600
setting?

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.200
Yeah, I was just curious if it was going to be possible in the future.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:52.760
You said that you'd have to manually choose to do the zero dollars every single time.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.200
And I was wondering if you have any thoughts on maybe in the future setting it so that

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.320
if you, I don't know, manually choose it for five times that it would automatically give

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.080
you an option to say, hey, would you like to set this permanent so it's, you know, continue

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.720
to update it but in the free or would it be like a manual every time?

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:15.000
I think at the moment we want to try the manual every time because kind of the idea of it

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.480
is that it's not as convenient.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.760
You know, we want to go, hey, like, you're still using this, the developer is still giving

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.720
you value, like, maybe you should consider throwing a dollar at him, you know?

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.320
Yeah, that kind of makes sense to me.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.320
And it seems sustainable.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:33.800
I hope that like, you know, this being risky and getting so much attention, I'm sure you

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.800
might lose people.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:40.680
But if the people who stay are down to help build this Linux paradise of, you know, a

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.360
supportable Linux ecosystem, it could be great.

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.720
There's two different audiences too.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.720
Go ahead.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.680
I can save my point.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:56.600
I'd still consider Rotten's suggestion on the basis of if it's a charitable organization

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.560
where they're using your system because it's convenient, it does help somebody.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:07.640
At that point, you know, that option is definitely something that does cost cuts on their maintenance.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.240
Yeah, it makes that experience more smooth.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.840
I think there are other ways to get the updates outside of the App Center too.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:20.320
But I think the idea is sort of worth trying, like, hey, this is the third or fourth time

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.740
you've skipped paying for this, but you're still choosing to update it.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.320
Maybe that means there is some value there.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.320
I see why you want to experiment with that.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:34.360
I guess moving after, well, the thing that I was going to mention before, just a second

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.620
ago, was there's two audiences here to this.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:41.800
The one audience obviously is the users, but the other audience is the developers.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.560
And you're essentially, Dan, messaging to the developers, we're really trying to work

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.800
something out for you that's going to make this profitable.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.760
In a way, it's sort of free advertising to developers about elementary OS.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:59.440
I know that's not the intention, but if I was a developer looking at monetizing my application

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.560
on the Linux desktop, I'd be watching this going, these guys get it.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.520
These guys get that I need to actually eat food.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:10.920
Yeah, we definitely want to be in the corner of our developers here and fighting for them.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:17.120
And we know objectively that there are developers of popular applications on other platforms

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.960
that have said, hey, we're not going to write for Linux because we can't make a living there.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.920
And we want to remove that reason.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.280
We don't want anybody to be able to say that.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.600
Yeah, I've really seen that a lot.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.000
On the Coder Radio program, we get these emails that come in, and it's these exasperated developers

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.200
who are writing me these basically rage quits.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.080
They're rage quitting the Linux community because they've tried to make an application

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.940
and they tried to sell it on Linux and it just blew up in their face and it was nothing

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.520
but criticism.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:53.520
It really is, in a way, I can kind of understand where they went wrong and I can kind of see

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.960
it from their perspective.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.500
But it's just not all the pieces are there yet when you compare it to other platforms.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:03.240
And elementary OS is getting as close as I think anybody has to really just putting all

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:06.920
of the pieces in there that make it easier for developers to ship and understand there'll

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.680
be a sustainable revenue model.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.080
A cohesive experience, a target to develop for, and a place to get revenue.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.040
And here's what I would say to people that are like, this isn't for me.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.560
This isn't anything I'm ever interested in.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.880
It's good that somebody's trying it because one of the things that I really have learned

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:28.400
to appreciate recently about the open source world is that all of these different efforts

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.800
that are happening in the open are free R&D for all of us.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:38.240
So we all get to sit back and watch elementary OS try this crazy ass experiment of trying

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:43.880
to monetize applications and help people monetize their programs when people are upgrading and

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.160
see how it goes.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.280
And it doesn't cost me a thing, unless I buy an app.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.200
It doesn't cost me anything.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.580
And I get to watch them try this.

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:57.280
And so I really appreciate that you guys are doing this because somebody needs to.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.240
And I can't think of a better project.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.120
So good luck, Dan, and I will definitely be trying it out when Juno ships.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.120
I'll 100% give it a go.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.880
I think it's worth giving it a go.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.560
And I'm happy to throw a couple of bucks to developers that are making native Linux applications

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.120
any day of the week.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.120
You know?

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.880
And I'll pay for those upgrades because I want to see more of that.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:22.000
That's why I buy every damn release of Crossover Office for like the last decade.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.680
I don't even use the damn thing more than a couple times a year.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:28.080
But I'm just so thankful that somebody's making native applications and contributing code

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.680
upstream.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.680
Just go for it, Dan.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.120
So good on you.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.440
And keep us updated, won't you?

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440
Good luck.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.440
Thanks.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.440
All right.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:43.160
So the one thing that I've been building towards all day is this perfect workstation that I'm

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.520
trying to get to.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:49.360
And I've had this massive, massive awakening.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.920
You know, I should have listened.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.620
People tell me to stay woke.

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:55.080
And they tell me to reclaim my time.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.920
And I finally woke up.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:02.580
Like Neo, I woke up from the matrix and I realized everything I knew was wrong.

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:04.400
You heard it a little bit last week.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:08.520
Like the beginning of the awakening happened last week.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:11.840
But so much more has developed in the week since last episode.

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:14.000
We'll get to that in just a moment.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.560
But first, let's talk about skilling up.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.760
Let's talk about your mind.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:22.000
Let's talk about Linux Academy, a platform to learn more about Linux and everything around

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
it.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.080
Linux Academy is a full featured training library with everything you need to learn

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.480
new skills and advance your career.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:33.580
It's all of the stuff that's core to Linux and the things bolted on top like OpenStack

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:37.000
and Docker and Azure and AWS.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.240
Everything you need to learn to get hands on experience with self-paced in-depth video

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.520
courses and every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.520
It's incredible.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.520
It's almost too much.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.600
You're a little intimidated, but they make it so easy.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.200
It makes it brings a tear to me.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:53.720
I got to tell you, because as an old man, I would have I probably would have gotten

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.680
street fights with hobos if I knew it could lead to Linux Academy.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.920
I'm just saying I would have got my butt kicked every single time and I still would have done

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:00.920
it for Linux Academy.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.200
Are you saying those kids today just have it so easy?

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.280
That's exactly what I'm saying.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:09.000
And they're on my lawn with hands on scenario based labs to where you get real experience

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.120
on servers, which there is nothing that beats that except for maybe the fact that they have

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.640
human beings, real instructors, full time humans at Linux Academy who will answer your

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.880
questions and give you advice when you get stuck.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.360
They'll spin up cloud servers on demand as you need to learn more.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:30.480
They have course schedulers to help you pick a time frame and actually stick to your goals.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.000
Somehow they do this with computers.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.540
Turns out they're good at these kinds of things.

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:38.040
And if you just need a specific career track refresher or you're ready to go get a cert,

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:41.960
they have learning paths, which are series of courses and content planned by their instructors

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.600
for specific career tracks.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.080
And of course, they've got training and preparation for certs.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:51.960
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged with comprehensive study tools and much, much more.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.960
You got to check it out.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.760
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:58.720
Go there, support the show and sign up for a free seven day trial.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.280
Big thanks to Linux Academy, Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:06.160
OK, so I know Crazy Chris is switching desktops again.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.160
All right.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.160
What's happening?

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.160
Get your laughs out, everybody.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160
Shake it out.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.160
Ha, ha, ha.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.160
It's so funny.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.160
Except for this is the real deal.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.160
I know this is this is the real deal.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.160
Maybe like I've heard this before.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.160
I know.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.160
I know.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.200
I've had a I've had a kind of blame Wimpy to Wimpy kind of started this whole thing

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.200
with this.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.680
Hey, you ought to try Plasma on Wayland.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.680
Yeah.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.680
What have you done?

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.720
I know the reckoning.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:35.240
And since then, I've installed KDE neon user edition on all of my systems.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:39.280
I've just I just went I went for it because I really, really wanted to put it to the test

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:43.480
because I'm sick and tired of switching distros and sick and tired of switching desktops.

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.600
I just want one thing that works.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:51.720
And so I thought, I'm going all in on this to put it to stress tested as much as possible.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:57.560
And let's make things harder by doing it right in the middle of an upgrade from KDE 5.11

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:02.520
to 5.12, which, you know, it's always fun to just completely update the desktop environment.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.100
And I did a lot of discussions with people online and one of the most influential people

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:11.200
that I talked to was producer Michael who said, just try KDE neon.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:15.280
And he described it in a way that perfectly suited my needs.

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.820
And producer Michael, I don't want to steal your thunder because you did such a good job

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:23.520
describing the reason why KDE neon has been the perfect Linux setup for you.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520
And I'd love you to share it with us.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.900
Well, I don't remember exactly what I said, but it was probably somewhere along the lines

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:35.560
of it's at a point where I was, you know, you know, you're moving to the system and

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:40.140
you're just frustrated with all the problems and the updates constantly break things and

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.840
stuff like that.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:47.160
Since moving to neon, I've used the same install for almost two years.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:54.400
And it's while it does have quirks because every system has quirks, I can be safe knowing

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.800
that when I update my system, it's not just going to crash everything.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.200
It's like I'm going to have all the settings that I wanted, all the applications, like

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.240
loading and where I want them to load, all that stuff is exactly where I left it when

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:14.200
I updated or prior to updating and that that reliability is just so nice.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.200
Yeah.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.680
And you, you like tailored it directly to me.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680
Like you weaponized it.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:24.840
You said, um, KDE neon user edition is the perfect blend of a stable LTS base with the

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:29.560
rolling user land because you know that gets me, you know that gets me.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:37.160
And so it is my entire reason for wanting, like I've been wanting this exact setup for

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.360
like a decade of a system that has all the stuff I want, the applications and the DE

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.960
and all that stuff to roll.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.220
But I don't really care if the kernel and the display server and all that stuff rolls

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:48.360
with it.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:52.600
But like for the entire time, it's always been, you either have a stable base or you

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.800
have a rolling base and I'd rather have that little hybrid approach.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.480
And that's exactly what neon does for me.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480
Yeah.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480
Yeah.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.600
And then you combine it with flat packs and snaps and it's, it's sort of, it's sort of

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:12.920
this perfect blend of modern user applications, modern desktop environment, but stable old

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.920
reliable base.

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.480
So when I open up my bash terminal, everything's like it's been for like the last couple of

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.480
years.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.480
Ooh.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.480
Yeah.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.480
The stable Unix workstation.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:28.760
And the other really, really great thing about plasma is there is uniquely new stuff that

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:34.200
gnome isn't doing and windows isn't doing and macOS isn't doing.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.200
Yeah.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.960
They really are pushing ahead in their own direction.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.880
And I've noticed direct benefits.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:47.080
And I don't know how much this is attributed to plasma desktop versus light DM and SDDM,

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:50.920
but my machines with neon wake way faster.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.600
Like the screen is up and my desktop is up.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.720
I turned off locking because I'm lazy and I open up my screen and it's my home machine.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.080
It never leaves the RV.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:06.160
I open up the screen and I, my desktop is up on my screen before I have finished positioning

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.600
my laptop screen.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.320
It's immediate.

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.560
And then it takes a, another beat for the network to actually connect, but it's instantaneous.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.800
My screen wakes up now.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.840
I feel like my boot is faster.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.440
It just, Oh, it sounds like your life is better, honestly.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:21.440
That's what this is.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.440
It's infatuation.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.220
Well, or is it real?

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:25.220
This is always how it starts.

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.220
Church of neon.

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:31.640
It does start like this, but I am happy to report that I did go through a five 11 to

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:36.760
five 12 upgrade and if I didn't know that's what I was doing, I wouldn't have even known

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:37.760
the upgrade took place.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:42.920
It was, I've, I've done it on several machines before the show and nothing, nothing.

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:43.920
I just noticed nothing.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.920
It just was fine.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.920
Exactly.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:46.920
Yeah, it was easy.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:52.160
I've gone, I'm on five 12 now and I've, I mean the first time I started was five six.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.160
Wow.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.160
Wow.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.320
Maybe it was five five, I'm not sure, but it was, it was somewhere around there.

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.400
You've been upgrading for a while.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:07.520
So I, I've, I've been looking for a desktop that has better tech, technical fundamentals

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:14.360
than gnome shell and I've been looking for a desktop that is more prepared for Wayland

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:20.080
and I've been looking for something that feels like it takes advantage of my hardware and

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.480
I've been looking for something that doesn't slow down after four or five days of uptime

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:30.200
because all of my systems are a feature we borrowed from windows.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.200
Yeah.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.420
Well, that's really where I got to with gnome shell is I got to the point where I needed

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:39.120
to load a certain set of extensions to make it usable, but that seems to bring a certain

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:46.760
level of instability and I thought back to when I used to use Mac OS system six and I

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:52.440
was installing extensions that would rip code out of memory and inject their own code and

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:58.480
I, and I thought about how things didn't, didn't properly have isolated processes and

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:07.800
I started to get angry because that was 1987 and we knew those problems existed and somehow

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:14.040
when gnome shell was invented years later, when we knew about all of these mistakes,

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:19.240
they repeated the same sins because they needed to punt on bigger issues that they didn't

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:27.400
have answers to certain security issues and IPC issues and it has led to a desktop that

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:33.320
honestly like we have this super computer operating system underneath it and it is,

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:40.280
it is crashy as, as windows 98 se and I'm not windows 98 se was a great release of windows

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:46.240
and if you put the plus pack on there, that shit was choice, but it still would crash

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.640
like a bitch and gnome crashes like a bitch all the time.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:57.280
Before this show started, we dumped our live stream because the gnome shell crashed on

01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.280
us.

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.440
It's just sad and true.

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.920
It's too much.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.920
It's too much.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:08.400
Like what is the point of all of these years of open source innovation just to straddle

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:15.200
ourselves to a technically incompetent desktop environment and I just got angry as I thought

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.020
about this and I came to a realization that I could no longer come on the air and I could

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:26.040
no longer recommend that people try out desktop environments based on gnome shell.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.000
I just couldn't honestly do it.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:34.400
I would feel like a phony if I told you that's a desktop environment you should be using

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:41.160
and that's pretty fucking scary for me because I 11 years into this, this is the first time

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.400
I've ever felt this way.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:52.640
I have to say Chris, having used Unity for six, seven years and then when we switched

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:58.280
to gnome in Ubuntu, I was kind of surprised at the instability of it.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:05.680
I was impressed at how fast the Ubuntu desktop team turned around from Unity by default to

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.040
gnome by default and having something that was prettier than I expected it was going to

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040
be.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:18.200
I agree with you it is a bit crashy and I know that there is some work going on upstream

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:23.160
to fix that in the gnome project and in Wayland and mutter and so on but it looks like that

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:29.200
stuff is kind of some way out, those fundamental architectural changes that are going to be

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:35.440
required to make it rock solid seem a little bit further out than I'm happy with.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.760
So I decided to join you on your journey with KDE Neon.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.280
I'm really excited about that.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:46.280
You're welcome.

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:50.440
I keep getting pings from Wimpy saying hey so how are you liking that KDE Neon?

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.440
How are you liking it?

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.240
I'm curious how are you liking it?

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:57.320
So do you want the full beans or just the high level?

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.640
I want the full beans because I have a feeling both you and I are going to have a totally

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.200
different perspective by next week.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.840
That's my sense of it right now.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.560
There's been a couple of frustrations, niggles, and one of them I filed a bug upstream in

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:13.400
KDE to let them know there's a bug there.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:19.000
It was all jolly fun downloading the ISO at the gate at the airport in Seattle.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.200
We tried over the airport Wi-Fi and it was just too slow so I downloaded the ISO image

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:31.480
over 3G roaming on my phone and then Wimpy dragged the ISO off my phone and put it onto

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.560
a USB stick and we tried the install at 30,000 feet on the flight bell.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:41.680
I'm installing it on a ThinkPad T450 that's had Linux on it for ages so I know Linux works

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.320
perfectly fine on this thing.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:48.240
Unfortunately we discovered a bug that you can't install KDE Neon offline.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:51.200
It refuses to install the grub bootloader.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.600
Noah ran into that same problem too.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:56.440
I think if you have an EFI system, if you have a legacy boot system I think it'll work

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.440
okay.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.360
Right and I couldn't do that.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.800
I couldn't even get it to boot with legacy mode.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:08.600
I don't know how many times we tried but we tried a lot of different options in the BIOS

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:14.360
in order to get it to boot and when we got it to boot it wouldn't install so Wimpy after

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:20.780
we sat there and ruminated over a glass of wine on the flight, I know right, he said

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:24.080
I think I know what this is, you need to be online for that to work because the message

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.600
doesn't indicate that's the problem, it just says I can't install this package and sure

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:33.680
enough when I got home I put the same USB key in, connected it to the LAN, did exactly

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.320
the same steps, the install succeeded perfectly fine.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:41.360
So that out of the way, I filed a bug and I'm sure they'll fix that and that's great.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.480
Yeah I know they know about it, that won't affect everyone because most people are connected

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.480
these days.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.080
Not on the plane.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:53.840
Right but that aside and one other niggle with the trackpad that's been irritating the

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.360
hell out of me, you can't turn the trackpad off.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:02.360
I was wondering about that, I had not tried that yet.

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:07.480
You kind of can, there is an option where it tries to be smart and say turn the trackpad

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:11.280
off when there's a mouse plugged in to say oh well he's got a mouse, he doesn't need

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:18.120
the trackpad but it's not smart enough and my ThinkPad has a nipple obviously and it

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:23.200
thinks that's a mouse so there's a set of exceptions where you can say turn the trackpad

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:29.940
off if there's a mouse connected but not if there's a touch point or nipple connected.

01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:33.840
So if I remove all of those exceptions I can force it to disable the trackpad which is

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.800
what I want, I personally don't use trackpads but then it wakes itself up every so often.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:43.080
I don't know whether it's waking up from suspend or on a reboot but sometimes the trackpad

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:47.960
just turns itself back on again and it's so infuriating because I find I end up clicking

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:53.120
buttons that I didn't intend to because I've got fat thumbs that rest on the trackpad right.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.820
So those two issues aside and those are the only two issues I've had really to speak of,

01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:59.320
the others are just tiny little niggles.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.720
I've been really impressed with it, it's really really nice, it's quick like you say it wakes

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.720
up nice and fast.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.720
You've noticed that too?

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.920
Yep definitely, the battery life feels longer but I've only had it installed for a couple

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:14.880
of days so I can't really say but I'm speaking to you from a snap of a mumble on KDE Neon.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:15.880
That is awesome.

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:16.880
There you go, it works.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.960
How do you all feel about the efficiency of it?

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:22.840
I mean in terms of KDE resources?

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:28.260
In terms of like if you looked into the applications that you previously run on a difference DE

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:32.440
then run it inside of Plasma and see that there's actually improvement on pretty much

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.440
everything.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:35.560
Especially if you're a QoS user.

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:40.920
So I have switched to Firefox here because I'm using as many of the default apps as I

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:45.920
can but I also had to install some other things so I installed the Telegram snap, the Slack

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:51.760
snap, the mumble slap, VS Code snap, but on top I haven't really installed anything from

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:57.880
the archive, I've only installed snaps on top of KDE Neon and that's kind of where I

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.040
am right now but it's working really well.

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:04.540
If you go grab the user edition, there's two versions of the user edition, user edition

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:05.880
and user edition LTS.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.000
That's the one I got.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.600
And producer Michael, do you know when does the LTS version of Neon get the new LTS of

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:16.760
Plasma desktop which just came out today?

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.600
It's not as quick as the regular user version but they haven't specified exactly an ETA

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.600
yet.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:23.600
It eventually lands there though.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:28.120
Yeah, the issue is that this is the first time there's been a switch from an LTS to

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:32.200
an LTS on the Neon existence.

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.920
And then there's an 1804 switch coming up too so it's kind of interesting times.

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:40.040
But Popey, you know how you were having that Dropbox menu issue?

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:44.880
I think the difference between that is that I'm on 5.11 and now 5.12 whereas you're on

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.880
5.8.

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:53.520
Yeah, I think I'm happy to test it, whatever version I've got and when I come to upgrade,

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.520
maybe we'll see.

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.200
Well, you should get 5.12 pretty soon I would think.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.920
So you and I will be in sync pretty soon.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.480
Yeah, I'm not going to force it.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.320
I'm going to keep what's on here on here because that's the experience that I got through downloading

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.760
the ISO and installing it.

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:08.280
But I am quite happy with what I've got.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:12.220
I've been able to customize it a little bit, tweak the theme, change the mouse cursors

01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:14.640
and stuff like that.

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.320
I'm pretty happy with it.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.320
It's a nice setup.

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.320
Me too.

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:19.320
I did Breezedark.

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.600
I went to Breezedark and here's the thing.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:23.280
So I want to invite the audience to try this too.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.400
Go get KDE Neon and grab one of the user editions.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.080
I'm on the main user edition.

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.720
They're still using the LTS base.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:35.860
So if you get user edition, it's the stable version of Plasma with a Ubuntu LTS base.

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:41.640
If you go get the Neon LTS, you're getting Ubuntu LTS as well as the Plasma LTS, which

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.440
is what like Popeye is on and Noah is using that as well.

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:52.560
I'm on user edition, which is just today got Plasma 5.12, super smooth upgrade, really

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.240
great desktop.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:59.560
Once you put on Breezedark mode and I invite you to also go into the GTK application settings

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:06.480
and turn on dark mode stuff there, I tell you what, I've never in – using KDE since

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:13.080
version 2, I have never had an experience where GTK applications and Qt applications

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:19.360
look so close to the same look and design.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:24.440
It's better than when I have a GNOME desktop or a Unity desktop and I pseudo an application

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:29.800
like the NVIDIA settings and then the NVIDIA settings launches and its theme doesn't – that

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:32.280
doesn't happen anymore under my Plasma desktop.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:37.440
Like my GTK applications are actually more consistent under my Plasma desktop than they

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.520
were under my GNOME and Unity 7 desktops.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:45.680
One of the things I used to be kind of resistant to KDE was like the plethora of settings and

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.360
I know some people love to be able to twiddle and tweak everything.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.200
I'm not – I don't do that so much.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.360
When I would find some of these like billion dialogues with loads of radio buttons and

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.600
sliders and stuff, I would find that overwhelming and I didn't really like it.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:05.200
But the way that some of the things have been presented like if I click on the battery,

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:09.280
this laptop has two batteries and if I click on the battery icon, I see the gauges for

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:13.320
both of them really easily and clearly and if I click on the network thing, I can see

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:18.240
the network I'm connected to and the up and down network traffic and stuff like that.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.560
It's just – it's really classy.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.200
I really like the exposing those details without it being overwhelming.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.920
Yeah, exactly.

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.920
And there's a system tray.

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:31.640
Yeah, that is nice to have all of my icons in the system tray just work.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.640
That is really nice.

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:33.640
Yeah.

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.080
There's actually – you can customize the system tray too so that you can say – let's

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:41.520
say an application shows up in the tray that you don't want it maybe for whatever reason,

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.600
you can just go in and individually hide any application you don't want to show.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.880
It will still be accessible through the tray but it won't be on the panel.

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:52.560
I really appreciate the smoothness of Kaywin so the installation that I'm presenting

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:57.480
right now on screen, this has been running now for about eight days, nine days without

01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.480
reboot.

01:24:58.480 --> 01:24:59.480
It's just been super solid.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:05.120
It's just – because one of the things I was running into is about four days of uptime,

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.840
I was having just this grinding performance.

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.440
I shared a video in the Jupiter Broadcasting Telegram group and where even my – just

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.100
everything ground to a halt.

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:14.100
And so now –

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.100
The system is just unusable.

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.280
Now I've doubled that time so far and it hasn't run into that issue.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.280
I'm the same hardware.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.280
Same –

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.600
For that same reference, I've done a month and a half without rebooting.

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:24.600
Oh!

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:25.600
Okay.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:26.600
Mr. Fan.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:27.600
Yeah.

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.600
I'm not a fan of rebooting.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.640
I like to leave my systems up a lot.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:37.640
And one thing that I haven't – are you using KD with Wayland or are you on X11 because

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.640
I didn't make – there didn't seem to be an option.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.640
No, I don't know.

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:41.640
I didn't choose anything.

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:42.640
Yeah.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.440
But I know I'm on X11 because I've seen the environment set up.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.120
So I don't know why.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.840
My version is mainly X.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:48.840
Okay.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.960
So if I upgrade, maybe I'll get Wayland.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:51.960
Right.

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.320
You'll have the ability to use Wayland.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:57.880
I wouldn't say that Wayland is ready really to be as a primary anyway.

01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.600
It's more ready than Gnome's feature but –

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:07.000
Wayland is already the worst kept secret in the world.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.520
I was just saying like there is some kind of like – some misstatements about the Wayland

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.560
support in Plasma.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:17.640
It's a lot better than pretty much anything else I've tried.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.200
But it's still Wayland.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.040
I'll look forward to trying it when I get the upgrade.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.040
If I get the upgrade.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.480
Well, so I wanted to just say I do feel like there's still quite a bit of defaults I

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.920
change but my perspective on it has changed a bit because I feel like I go through it

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:35.080
once when I set up a system and then I just set them all.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.080
Like I run Dolph.

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.080
I just go through console.

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.680
I just run everything and I set it once.

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.160
And once I've set it, it sticks.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.800
And that's been really nice.

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:43.800
It won't lose it.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:49.000
I've – after years of using, I've been using Plasma itself for – since like five

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.280
years now and I have not lost any of my settings.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:56.120
As long as you save the files that they're put in, you're good to go.

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.560
Well, except for my touchpad setting but we'll gloss over that one.

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.560
Yeah.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.560
Actually, I'll talk to you about the show.

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.560
I think I might have a solution for that.

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.560
Excellent.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:04.560
Good.

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.640
So I invite you guys to try it out and just give it a shot.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:08.000
You know, change the defaults as you need.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.240
Maybe put the dark theme on there.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.680
It's all pretty nice and play with it.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:17.040
I – you know, to the point that you asked about resources, I actually noticed a pretty

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:22.000
huge improvement which directly translated to more battery life on a laptop that's three

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.040
years old.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.400
And I went from getting an hour and a half battery life now to four hours of battery

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:33.140
life with a combination of switching to Plasma but also I dropped Chrome and tried Vivaldi

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:41.280
for a bit and then just settled on Firefox, significant performance impact difference

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.280
on my machine.

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.080
I get better battery – I get significantly better battery life with Firefox.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.080
Is that right?

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:47.080
Yeah.

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.080
And the combination of Plasma.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.080
30% lighter browser.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.080
It's huge.

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:51.080
That's their benchmark.

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:57.920
Well, I mean, I go from two hours to four hours with the combination of Chrome and Plasma

01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.920
and Firefox.

01:27:58.920 --> 01:27:59.920
It's much better.

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:00.920
It's a whole new you.

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.200
That's their marketed percentage.

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:06.160
Maybe it's actually better depending on your structure of how you set it up.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.960
But the other thing that's kind of nice is certain notifications from Firefox or whatnot

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:14.680
integrate in with Plasma's native notification system.

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.680
So like download notification.

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:18.680
It really does feel like a consistent experience and I'm impressed.

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:19.680
Yes.

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:20.680
Firefox –

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:23.160
Just so you know, in the future, that's actually getting better.

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.840
Yeah, like download status, right?

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.840
And media playback controls and whatnot?

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:27.840
Yeah.

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.880
The playback – you have a YouTube video playing.

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:32.600
It'll be connected to the media player inside of the panel.

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:33.600
So you can just like –

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.600
Right.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.840
Everything – the best thing about it is that you can have custom shortcuts to that

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:38.840
media panel.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:42.680
So you can be a global like play and pause for YouTube anywhere.

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680
Yeah.

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.960
So just if you didn't catch that, what he's saying there is literally like you could have

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.200
a YouTube video playing and you could click on like the volume controller and hit pause.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.640
It'll pause the YouTube video in a tab somewhere.

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.520
And that's super nice when you have like a multi monitor setup and you have YouTube

01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:57.600
thrown up on one of the screens.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.760
And the other thing – I'll just leave it with this and then we'll move on because

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.160
the Ask Noah show is just coming up.

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:06.440
But I – the thing that pushed me over to try this was – and maybe you remember the

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:09.800
details, Michael, but I forgot the names.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:11.680
I think it was Deal Moto but I can't remember.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.200
There was a semi-critical review.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:19.440
It was basically a review of Plasma 512 and it said, here's all the rough edges that

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.520
I perceive and these are the things that I would do differently.

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.440
And if you've watched The Gnome Project, you've witnessed how they handle that kind

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.000
of feedback a few times.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:35.040
And so I kid you not, I popped my popcorn, I got myself my beverage, I sat down in front

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:41.240
of my computer, I brought up the planet.kde.com page and I thought, okay, let's watch their

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.600
responses to this.

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.600
This should be a shit show.

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:51.920
And what I saw was developers in the Plasma project that took point by point the reviews,

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:56.760
critiques of the Plasma desktop and either pointed them to existing bugs or converted

01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:01.800
them to new bugs and ideas and was completely receptive to the feedback to the constructive

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:05.480
criticism and turned it around into things that they're going to implement into the

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:09.040
Plasma project or things that they're already working on.

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:14.920
And when I saw that, it really clicked with me that there's a different level of interaction

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.200
with what the community wants.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:20.360
There's a different level of weight put on what the community wants.

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:23.480
You can hear that's why the dogs are barking because they believe it too.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.840
They're barking for Plasma.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:29.980
So if that sounds appealing to you, if you want to bark for Plasma, I recommend going

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:34.080
to neon.kde.org, go get the user edition, try it out.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.080
Become a Plasma puppy.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:39.180
Yeah, become a Plasma puppy, you're a Plasma puppy.

01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:44.740
And just give it a go because there's interesting new things happening there and I've really

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:45.740
been enjoying it.

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:48.680
I'll come back next week and I'll tell you if something's gone wrong, you know I'll tell

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.680
you about it.

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:52.880
But I don't know, I'm pretty impressed with it.

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:53.880
I'm really enjoying it.

01:30:53.880 --> 01:31:00.800
I think one statement is if you're new to the Plasma experience, you should know that

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:05.680
Neon is kind of like a minimal approach to a distro.

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:09.060
You're not going to get, LibreOffice is not included, you're not going to get any kind

01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:14.040
of office suite or you're going to get the only media player you'll get is the VLC, things

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.040
like that.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:20.020
So if you don't know what you want, it's not meant for the base level beginner.

01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:23.520
But if you have a rough idea of what applications you want, then it's great.

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.360
Yeah that's a more minimal approach, which is kind of how I prefer it.

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.360
It's kind of awesome, yeah.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:28.360
Yeah, I prefer that.

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.880
LTS base, install whatever I want.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:34.360
So you loaded on your rig before the show started and you've been sort of tweaking it

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.720
a little bit as the show's gone on.

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:36.720
What do you think?

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:37.720
What are your initial impressions on it?

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:39.660
And how will this machine give us a benchmark?

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.660
It's like four years old?

01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:41.660
Yeah.

01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:43.720
Yeah, so it's not the BPS, but it's been great.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.720
The install was super simple.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:52.520
It got all of my EFI things sorted out without any issues, which was a surprising delight.

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.520
A delight, you say?

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.520
A delight.

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.520
Yes, absolutely.

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:59.160
And that's been kind of my weak spot is not having a ton of plasma experience, so not

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:01.560
necessarily knowing where all the settings were.

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.280
And I was really comfortable with a default GNOME.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:08.640
I was not a huge GNOME plugin user, so I had somewhat less, I mean a couple plugins, sure,

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:11.180
but somewhat less issues with crashing or stability.

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.480
And I also tend to reboot my system.

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:17.440
So I have basically none of your problems, but I'm still having a fantastic time.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.360
It's super consistent.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:24.880
It's really fast and smooth, and maybe a couple pastimes a couple years ago, like when I was

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:30.760
last doing a dedicated plasma try, I did try to give it time, but I didn't get it to a

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:34.240
place where the default or where the time I had made it a system that I really liked

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.800
compared to what I had in GNOME.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.200
But right now, I mean, I think I can just keep using this.

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.200
Really?

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:42.040
I'm going to try to convince the KD18 to let me change the defaults.

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.440
Yeah, because it's not that I don't like it.

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:47.360
I actually really appreciate the ability to tweak things.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:50.320
I just don't always, you know, I want to be able to fresh install and just work.

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:56.720
The fact that there's so many like silly defaults that like, you know, like just like a couple

01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:00.800
months ago was the first time they introduced the folder view as by default, so you have

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:04.360
desktop icons like that, you know, okay, it's been a decade.

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:08.080
You know, and I know, I think there's already a bug open about this, but there's others.

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.360
There's like low hanging fruit.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:13.440
Like when I'm on a high DPI display and I open up Dolphin or I open up system settings

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:19.640
and it's like taking 10% of my screen up in the corner and like I have to like resize everything

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:20.720
for the first day.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:24.000
I'm resizing all of the windows for the first day.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.560
And you know, the one thing I'll say is it remembers the size.

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:31.520
God dang it if I don't love that about console.

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.080
Console is the same place, the same size.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:34.520
I open it every single time.

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.440
Man, oh man, do I appreciate that.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:41.160
So I only have to resize it once, but every single thing gets resized every time I open

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:43.220
it for the first time on the plasma desktop.

01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:50.280
Here's one quick, super cool tip about the window, the Kwin structure in plasma is the,

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:53.960
when you, let's say for example, you'd like to maximize windows, but you don't want the

01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:59.080
title bar to take up space, you can remove the decorations from any application at any

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:00.080
point.

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.080
Oh, interesting.

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.720
So whether it's maximized or not, you just go, you just right click it, choose more options

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:06.600
to right click the title bar, choose more options and then click no border.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:10.840
And it just removes the decoration so you can maximize and you know, use as much screen

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:11.840
as possible.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.840
I'm trying that out right now.

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.840
Oh my God.

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.840
That's amazing.

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:15.840
Wow.

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:16.840
Nice tip.

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.160
You can actually also script it so it automatically does it on individual applications and make

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.400
them specific sizes and all kinds of stuff.

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:24.400
Yeah.

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.580
I've been taking advantage of like window rules too.

01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:29.080
So that way Spotify, if I've launched that, always opens on desktop four cause I don't

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.680
want that crap anywhere near me.

01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:32.880
So I always open that up on desktop four.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.080
So I invite you guys to try it out too.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.400
Give it a go and let us know.

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.120
We'll give you our followup conclusions if we're sticking with it or not in next week's

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:41.120
episode.

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.720
Our conversation doesn't end here either.

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:46.960
In fact, Ask Noah is coming up just a little bit after the show and Noah is all in on the

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.880
big plasma experiment too.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:49.880
Are you ready?

01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:50.880
Are you ready Noah?

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:51.880
Have you loaded your systems?

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.840
Have you done the mass formatting, the nuke and paves like I have?

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:55.840
Yeah.

01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.840
Yeah.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:57.840
Caught your infection.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.320
We're all infected.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:00.320
Yeah.

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:01.320
Yeah.

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:04.280
Well I got home and I was like, wow, I give this a shot and I put it on a, you know, on

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.280
the bench machine, right?

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.280
The one that doesn't matter.

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.280
The one that it's powerful.

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:10.400
I can play with it, but that's just, I try it for a little bit and then I move back to

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:15.760
what I know will work, except they didn't went and did my work computer.

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:20.760
And then I actually, so my, the machine downstairs, I, and I hate to admit this, but it's the

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:21.760
truth.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:24.260
It, you know, it's been running for fedora for so long.

01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:28.580
It's run every, that, that position, not the same physical hardware, but has run every

01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:31.680
single version of fedora since fedora core one.

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:35.400
And after it, well how it took me, it took me the entire week and took me three days

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.840
to get everything moved off of there.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:38.840
Yeah.

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.280
And now that's running plasma as well.

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.280
Really?

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.280
Wow.

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.280
Yeah.

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.280
I went to Katie and neon.

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.280
I have a sense.

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.120
This might be a topic in today's episode of the ask Noah show.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.520
I might, we might mention, we might talk about it just a little bit.

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.040
I'm really enjoying it.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.520
I mean, I, so far this could all, you know, this is the funny thing is the, if the first

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:59.560
week or so, it's always like that new relationship, you're like, Oh, this is great.

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:00.560
As is so great.

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.720
Like when you get a new car, it still smells like you haven't figured out what you hate

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:03.720
about it.

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:04.720
Yeah.

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:05.720
Like the dog hasn't crapped in my new car yet.

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:09.100
You know, once the dog craps in the car, the smell changes and that may happen over the

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:13.120
next week, but I don't think we've ever tried anything like this where so many of us are

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:16.120
giving it a go because not only are several of us here in the mumble room giving it a

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:20.380
go, but, and it's, uh, Noah's giving it a go and it's, it's, this is transpiring across

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:24.880
the ask Noah show, but also there's a whole bunch of people in the telegram group and

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.080
on Twitter that are also giving this a go.

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.640
So if you want to join in, you still can.

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.340
We have a week that we're trying it.

01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:33.560
Just give me a hashtag so that way I can filter all of this.

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:36.220
And we are trying to solve the shit show that is the desktop.

01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:41.080
So give me your feedback either in telegram, discord or on Twitter, whatever it is, and

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:47.440
then append it with hashtag shit show one word that way we can find it and we'll review

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:48.440
everybody's thoughts.

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:52.820
So this is going to be a meta review like we've never done on any of our shows before

01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:57.800
crossing multiple shows, crossing multiple communities and multiple different people

01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:03.400
that are, have tons of different preferences who will hold out, who will be the final plasma

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:05.240
user after all of this.

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:07.000
And what will the reward be?

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.800
Stay tuned and find out.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:13.120
But in the meantime, that does bring us to the end of this week's broadcast.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.120
Hope you enjoyed it.

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.680
I encourage you to join us live.

01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.400
It's really like a Linux sandwich.

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.400
Yeah.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.600
And probably if you do, you'll end up getting switched to Katie and neon.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.880
So just do it today.

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:23.880
Yeah.

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:24.880
Go over to jblive.tv.

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:30.160
It kicks off at 2 PM Pacific, really one 30 ish, but just go to Jupiter broadcasting.com

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.160
slash calendar.

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:34.060
Cause everybody knows that you got your own unique time.

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:35.480
You got to solve that problem.

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:36.520
It's weird.

01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:38.080
Go get more of poppy and wimpy.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.300
They have a podcast.

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:41.440
Will it come back?

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.440
Nobody knows.

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.760
But in the meantime, you can check the back catalog, Ubuntu podcast, go check out Daniel

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:46.760
over at elementary OS.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.700
And of course the ask Noah show coming up right after this, and we'll see you right

01:37:49.700 --> 01:38:06.800
back here next week.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:34.720
All right, Mr. Payne, man, you know, it's great.

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:35.720
Katie neon.

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:36.720
Yeah.

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.640
That has been pretty great, but no, after this, you and I are going to go do a massive

01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:41.840
upgrade to the Jupiter broadcasting networks.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.400
It all go up in flames.

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:44.400
Who knows?

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.400
Who knows?

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:46.400
We'll report on the text net program.

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:47.400
I will listen to ask no while we do it.

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:48.400
All right guys.

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.400
Thank you very much.

01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:52.640
You can go to jbtitles.com and you can bang, suggest anybody in the mobile room have a

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:53.640
title suggestion.

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:54.640
Feel free to throw it out too.

01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:57.320
We got to name this thing before the ask no show.

01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:03.080
How about bang suggest the ending line is see you back here next Tuesday, not next week.

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:09.480
You know, a lot of people listen on Wednesdays now I've realized, you know, oh really?

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:10.480
Yeah.

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.480
Cause we put it out.

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.480
What's their fault?

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.160
Well, no, it's cause you know, we're in West coast.

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.260
So you know, I'm just, we're behind everyone and actually get done listening to the ask

01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:19.260
Noah show live.

01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:21.760
Like you're going to go download it, you know, you're spent.

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:22.760
There was something.

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:23.760
There was plasma something.

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:25.760
I like to suggest a title.

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:26.760
Yeah.

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.620
This is like, it's like a running joke.

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:32.560
How about the church of neon?

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.900
Now we did have the, we did have the guys on from red hat.

01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:35.960
So maybe the, yeah.

01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:42.200
Or I appreciated how about the Linux Grinch, the Linux Grinch that was good too.

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.860
Worshiping at the church of neon.

01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:45.540
There was something about that's good.

01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:53.940
The church of neon the plasma wave plasma.

01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:57.160
I'm no longer the guy telling people to try out plasma.

01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:01.600
Well, everybody has been, you know, a beard was, you know, I've tried it.

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:04.320
This isn't actually, I will say I should have said this in the show too.

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:08.160
The fact that I've tried it before made trying it this time a lot easier because I knew like

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.680
how to enable high DPI support.

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:10.960
But yeah, you're right.

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:12.760
You've been on there for a while now.

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:17.220
The thing is, is the, is the gnome keeps having, the gnome keeps having this, the gnome keeps

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:20.720
having these big headlines like, Oh, you know, canonical shipping it.

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:25.520
And now, and then, and then that translates into Dell and system 76 shipping it and all.

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.280
So it's just, there's so much momentum there that if, if you were to sit back and just

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:34.720
legacy problem, I think if you look at about it, like gnome has had the, the people got

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.680
attention to gnome, but it's, it's always had similar issues.

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:39.680
Yes.

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:44.680
And the thing is what I'm realizing is there's certain people that have been hip to these

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:45.960
technical issues.

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:50.300
It's like, it's been, it's been the biggest public dirty secret that we're only now talking

01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.900
about that we're this far into it.

01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:58.520
But there's certain, you realize you look back at you go, Oh, that's why company X did

01:40:58.520 --> 01:40:59.520
Y.

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.520
Oh, that's why this group did this.

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:05.480
There's actually something hilariously I recently just found out about the gnome's website.

01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:10.400
So you know, the you know, that gnome tweak, you could install the extensions from the

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.400
zip files.

01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.400
Yeah.

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:17.680
There's, there was a, I was talking to someone and they said that canonical had removed that

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.680
ability in Ubuntu.

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.480
They were like, why do you want us to install things?

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.040
And I was like, that seems weird.

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.340
I don't think they would do that.

01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:30.480
So I looked into it, gnome removed that feature from gnome tweak tool in 326 didn't make a

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480
fuss about it.

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:35.720
I never really noticed it except for people started blaming canonical because that was

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:41.600
the first version that was in 1710 and they just kind of made an assumption.

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:49.080
But what's funny is that if you go to the extensions dot gnome website there for a longest

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.960
time, there was no way to download extensions from that website.

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:55.720
I even created a script that you could download it and make that work because they make the

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:58.000
downloads that just don't let you download them.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.640
Now you can download them and not use them.

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:03.080
That's perfect.

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.080
That's exactly what I want.

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.080
Yeah.

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.080
Oh good.

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:10.960
So I think the hardest thing for me in this transition is that it seems like gnome just

01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:12.720
got the windows 10 style.

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:17.120
Like when you have a snap, yeah, well the snap and then like the, the middle resize

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:18.560
and I've been loving that.

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:21.320
There's some good, there's like, it's got like multidimensional snapping, like check

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:22.320
this out.

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.440
So here I grab, I'll grab the window here, right?

01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:25.920
Are there keyboard shortcuts for the snap?

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:26.920
Oh yeah.

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:27.920
Oh, there's keyboard shortcuts.

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:31.880
So you can do like, like I can do just this quadrant or I can do the full thing or I can

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:35.960
do the whole thing or I can again just do this lower quadrant, this upper quadrant.

01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:36.960
Like that's pretty nice.

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.000
You can have to do a 50 50 horizontal like, like, uh, like so, right?

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Like boom.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.040
And then if I had another window open, I could plug it right there.

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:46.040
That's pretty good.

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.040
And see how it's sticking.

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.260
See, I do like, you see it sticking right there.

01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:49.260
It's sticking.

01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:52.440
I just got so hooked on that, like being able to drag and have them both resize at the same

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.440
time.

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.440
Yeah.

01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:55.440
That is super nice.

01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:58.480
Windows 10 actually does pretty well.

01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:01.000
Here's something that actually might make that even better.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.720
You know how, uh, this is like a not, I guess it's not really a power user thing, but you

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:08.680
know how the alt, uh, left click where you can like move a window.

01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:09.680
Yeah.

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:10.680
I love that.

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:12.280
You can alt right click and resize a window.

01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.280
Oh, good to know.

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.280
Oh yeah.

01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.280
Look at this.

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.280
Oh, thank you.

01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:17.280
Thank you for telling me that.

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:18.280
That's actually really handy.

01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:22.280
So you can do it from like, as long as you're like, if you're on like anywhere remotely

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:24.760
near a corner or a side, it works.

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:25.880
Oh, that's hot.

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:55.480
Thanks as another producer, Michael Hott.
