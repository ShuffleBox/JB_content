1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Look at them reaching out saying, hey, look at this cool box.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,320
What are they running, Linux?

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,840
Yeah.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,040
What though?

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,880
Ubuntu.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,200
Look at that, 100% open source.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,800
So it's got an Odroid 1.7 gigahertz U3 quad core processor

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,320
powered by Ubuntu full specs.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,600
Let's go check that out.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,320
So it's imp.computer.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,200
Two gigs of RAM, eight gigabytes of storage on board,

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,120
Ubuntu 14.04, and Cinnamon, Chrome, and Firefox.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,480
Interesting, they say Office.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,040
They say, oh, look at this.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,840
Office, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, online, Google Docs, Apple,

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,160
and iCloud.

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,080
Screenshot.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,680
I think it's like Chromebook style Chromebox kind of thing.

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,280
But it also talks about being a media hub.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,320
It's pretty interesting.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,600
So they're doing a fundraiser?

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
Yeah, they're going to do one.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,440
I haven't said when.

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,640
Continuity, imp supports full continuity.

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,720
Now you can pick up any task you were doing

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,360
or move what you're watching on your mobile

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,680
and then continue it on your desktop.

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,360
It looks about the size of a NUC,

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,040
only even maybe a bit smaller, I bet.

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,280
Yeah, well, if you look at the size of an Odroid,

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,640
they're quite tiny.

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,120
That makes sense, huh?

33
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,320
And it looks like they're going to tie in with some sort of app

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,000
that you can use on Android, iOS, or Windows.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
Interesting.

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,560
Good find, Poppy.

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,160
I wonder if maybe somebody in this room

38
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,160
has heard of this new TrueCrypt remake that's

39
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,600
called, it's better than TrueCrypt, it's called Vericrypt.

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,680
It's like an alternative.

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,880
They say that they've gone in and cleaned a few things up,

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,360
fixed a few problems.

43
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,960
Anybody heard of it?

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,000
Anybody trust it?

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,040
Anybody found a good TrueCrypt?

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,760
I've heard of it.

47
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,120
I ran across the story yesterday,

48
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,840
and I don't know what to think about it.

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,560
Yeah, I don't know if I can trust it yet.

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,120
What does it take to trust something?

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,160
What did it take to get me to trust TrueCrypt?

52
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,760
It's just been around a while, I guess.

53
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,080
Edward Snowden.

54
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,400
Do you know if the audit that was being done on TrueCrypt

55
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,720
is going to publish their findings at some point?

56
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,480
Well, they've published the first phase.

57
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,320
And now they're like, I thought we were

58
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,960
supposed to see the second phase binding.

59
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,600
Well, this is what I'm referring to, is the follow up, yeah.

60
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,200
Yeah, I don't think we've seen that.

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,040
And nobody's really talked about it

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,600
since the project shut down.

63
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,560
No, and I think until we see that,

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,240
we can't say for any certainty whether we trust anything

65
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,640
that's derived from it.

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,360
That must be it.

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,720
Because what if there's a fundamental flaw in there?

68
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,920
Now that they gave up like this, that whole thing's

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,120
still very unsettling.

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,080
I don't really understand what happened there.

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,920
I don't know.

72
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,880
And now, looking back, it's so weird,

73
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,600
all the things that have happened since TrueCrypt

74
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,920
threw in the hat.

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,960
That was pre-Harpley.

76
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,080
That was pre-Shellshock.

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,240
And all these essential open source utilities

78
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,920
have had these vulnerabilities in them now.

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,280
Makes you wonder what the state of TrueCrypt really is.

80
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,160
And so if there's anything based off it.

81
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,480
You know, that's the other thing.

82
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,440
Remember, the developers said, don't base your future stuff

83
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:03,960
off ours.

84
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,760
Just start from new code.

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,360
Quite.

86
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,880
Yeah, that's another risk.

87
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,720
That's weird when the developer says, yeah,

88
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,320
you don't want to use what I know.

89
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,400
So I realize why they said it.

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,400
They said it because when you start going and, well,

91
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,440
that one thing.

92
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,760
But to go in to take something and then try and slap things

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,840
on top of it, as soon as you start slapping things on top,

94
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,800
that's just another point where you can poke at.

95
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,760
Yeah, you end up with a Windows release.

96
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,360
Exactly.

97
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,600
Yeah.

98
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,400
Nobody wants that.

99
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,560
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,160
that's powered by a cup of coffee and two energy drinks.

101
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,720
My name is Chris.

102
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,480
My name is Matt.

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,840
I might have a heart attack during today's show, Matt.

104
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,160
So if you hear something that sounds like my face smacking

105
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,600
into the microphone, just spring into action.

106
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,520
Make sure you close out the show and remind people

107
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,600
about all the stuff I always remind people about.

108
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,100
And then we'll just clean up the mess later, OK?

109
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,320
Because there doesn't even have to be a video

110
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,700
show in here until Thursday.

111
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,160
So if you think about it, if I'm dead, you got time.

112
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,120
Don't even rush down.

113
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,480
You can just get down here and clean me up

114
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,800
when you get a chance, OK?

115
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,280
There you go.

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,840
I think if we can get past the bloat

117
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,880
and not get a hand truck in there, I think we're OK.

118
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,760
Yeah, and actually, it'd be a good time, too,

119
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,160
because I just got the new Borderlands prequel just

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,920
came out for Linux this morning installed.

121
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,800
So I'll have that up on my machine.

122
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,960
So you could just play that when you get here.

123
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,880
So it's worth the trip, too.

124
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,320
There you go.

125
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,000
So you're welcome.

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,280
Nice.

127
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,920
Yeah.

128
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,800
All right, well, coming up on today's episode,

129
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,200
we got a couple of topics that I want

130
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,720
to throw in everybody's faces to get some discussion going.

131
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,560
Not only did we get some great emails,

132
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,920
which I think will get us going on a few things,

133
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,120
I'm really looking forward to that.

134
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,640
I want to talk about some of the next generation

135
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,780
apps coming to Ubuntu that we got a sneak peek at today.

136
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,020
And then we've heard a lot of times

137
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,240
it's hard to develop applications for Linux.

138
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,160
It's too fragmented.

139
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,280
It's changing too much.

140
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,360
How do you write for an operating system that's

141
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,440
constantly changing underneath you?

142
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,560
Well, we actually have a real world example

143
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,600
of how that affected something that I think you've probably

144
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,960
heard of before.

145
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,220
It didn't all end badly, but it does give us

146
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,560
a little perspective on some of the challenges writing

147
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,560
a major enterprise-grade application for Linux can face.

148
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,720
So it should be a good show.

149
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
Why don't we bring in the Mumble Room with us

150
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,200
so we start off the email?

151
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,160
Hey there, Mumble Room.

152
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,520
Time appropriate greetings.

153
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,480
Time appropriate greetings.

154
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:16,980
Evening.

155
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,520
Hello.

156
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,160
What?

157
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,400
I like that somebody always gets a little singing in there.

158
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,120
That's good.

159
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,720
All right.

160
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,880
So PM wrote in and wanted to pick up

161
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,200
on our discussion regarding Netflix

162
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,320
and how Linux users are all in on DRM now that Netflix is

163
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,940
here.

164
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,760
He says, hello, Chris Matt, Mumble Room chat room.

165
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,720
I just wanted to offer my opinion on the Netflix

166
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,600
equals Linux users are fine with DRM thing.

167
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,280
I personally don't like DRM.

168
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,360
And I'm certainly not all in on it, but let's be honest.

169
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,720
The fact that Netflix now works on the desktop for Linux

170
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,720
is a coincidence, not an intention.

171
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,680
Netflix, Google, et cetera, pushed DRM into HTML5

172
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,240
because they want to offer content on Roku, Android

173
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,680
devices, et cetera.

174
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,160
Because this DRM scheme is now part of HTML5,

175
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,400
Linux users can enjoy it as well.

176
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,080
But it wasn't put there because of us.

177
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,160
That's for sure.

178
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,680
Now we can do two things.

179
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,560
We can be angry at Netflix, not watch it,

180
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
and they're going to continue business as usual

181
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,320
because, quite frankly, they don't care much about us.

182
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,060
The DRM will still happily remain baked into HTML5

183
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,720
because it wasn't put there because of us

184
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,880
in the first place.

185
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,000
It was put there for smart TVs and set-top boxes

186
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,400
that they'll continue to sell regardless.

187
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,280
We as Linux users can cry all we want, but DRM is now in.

188
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
And it's up to us whether we at least use it

189
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,880
for some benefit to us, like Netflix on the desktop,

190
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,640
or cry about it and have none of the benefit with no one

191
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,720
listening to our cries about DRM anyways.

192
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,880
So nailed it.

193
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,680
So nailed it.

194
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,160
Oh, man.

195
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,280
Wow.

196
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,320
Wow, that is.

197
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,040
I almost stood up and applauded.

198
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,680
It kind of is a bit of a reality check.

199
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,720
Eric, do you think Netflix maybe has a little responsibility

200
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,240
to bear here?

201
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,820
I think they have some responsibility,

202
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,240
but I don't think they are the main reason.

203
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,240
They've come out and said if they could skip the DRM,

204
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,360
they would because it's a headache on them.

205
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,440
It's something they don't want to have to deal with.

206
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,760
It's the MPAA, the Motion Picture Association of America,

207
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,120
that is forcing this on them.

208
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,400
So it's all of the copyright holders

209
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,120
that are forcing this on them because they don't want

210
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,920
any chance of piracy.

211
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
They say that.

212
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,600
They say that.

213
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,840
But the thing is, it's going to happen regardless.

214
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,440
But how come House of Cards and Orange

215
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,160
is the New Black also are still wrapped up in DRM?

216
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,480
Netflix made those whole cloth.

217
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,960
They own them.

218
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,640
Yes, they did.

219
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,560
Because they already had it developed.

220
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Yeah, I suppose.

221
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,120
I mean, I just, whatever.

222
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,760
I mean, I think PM nails it.

223
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,400
It's like it's not even for us.

224
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,280
Our protests matter nothing.

225
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
Like, we're just shouting into the wind

226
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,160
because it really is more about Chromebooks and tablets

227
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,400
and Android devices and Rokus than it is Linux users.

228
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,280
Aren't all these examples Linux-based anyway?

229
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,840
So inherently, they are looking at it.

230
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,480
They might not care as much.

231
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,760
Right.

232
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,960
It's not like we just happen to luckily get it.

233
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,440
I mean, they're focusing on devices that support Linux.

234
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,900
Yeah, is that what you think, Wizard?

235
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,560
You think it's like they are focusing on Linux,

236
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,020
but it's not the desktop Linux user?

237
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,160
Absolutely.

238
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,960
They do care about Linux as a platform.

239
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,120
They don't care about the Linux users.

240
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,440
As far as they're concerned, they said,

241
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,680
we need a platform that we're going to put out there.

242
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,480
But we don't care about those users.

243
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,680
We want the users that are going to be using our Roku,

244
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,640
our solution on top of it.

245
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,200
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,040
Good point.

247
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,860
Yeah, and you know what?

248
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,780
This is just sort of the benefit of Linux

249
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,520
becoming one of the general technology platforms,

250
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,640
is we get to go along for the ride sometimes.

251
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,760
And I think that's totally fine.

252
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,840
Yeah, it's a good thing.

253
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,280
My point is we need to be pointing the finger,

254
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,640
blaming the people who deserve the blame.

255
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,240
I think Netflix is an easy scapegoat.

256
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,880
You're saying, Eric, show me the money.

257
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,440
Show me the money!

258
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,520
Follow the money back to the content creators,

259
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,240
and they're the ones pulling the strings.

260
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,080
Yeah.

261
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
Mm-hmm.

262
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,920
All right, Nathan writes in.

263
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,600
Get ready for this one, Popeye and Wimpy.

264
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,320
He has questions about a software store.

265
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,000
He's got some ideas and some concerns.

266
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,820
Hello, Chris Matt, chat room, mumble room, et cetera.

267
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,720
I was thinking long and hard today about Linux users

268
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,880
and purchasing software.

269
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,000
I know about the struggles large companies have

270
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,800
when thinking about moving over to Linux

271
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,600
and how there is not really a good way

272
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,160
to get their software purchased on end users' computers.

273
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,760
The one package for all thought comes to mind,

274
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,200
though it isn't exactly easy to get distros on board,

275
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,340
especially when you don't have a track record

276
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,280
of anything like this really working that well at all.

277
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,240
So I was thinking about these software stores.

278
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,840
Something could almost be like the way the AUR works,

279
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,780
where the front end knows how to build the program

280
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,160
for that specific distribution,

281
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,960
and you as the user just have to click download and install,

282
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,780
and the app store in the background does the building.

283
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,720
From there, all you have to do is get the payment system

284
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,000
working and you're off to the races.

285
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,840
Since compiling applications between distros

286
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,140
is more or less the same,

287
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,180
everyone could just follow tar.gz instructions,

288
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,000
a software store could just do all of the work

289
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
on the back end for you.

290
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,320
So this leads me to my question.

291
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,140
If you were to make a software store,

292
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,360
what would you do to help this process go smoothly?

293
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,920
This type of store will only gain traction

294
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,200
and help the Linux desktop if it worked across distros,

295
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,520
so let's keep that in mind when discussing this.

296
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,080
Also, I'm a Mac guy.

297
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,920
I love Linux, but I only know so much,

298
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,720
so maybe I'm completely off on this concept,

299
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,220
but as a Mac user, he seems like this is something we need.

300
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,960
So I wanted to start with Popey and Wim

301
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
because you guys were sort of kicking around some ideas

302
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,480
of what could work for an app store,

303
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,540
and I know you guys definitely weren't thinking

304
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,940
something that builds software,

305
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,040
and I don't even think you were thinking

306
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,020
something across distro.

307
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, in fact, it's quite interesting

308
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,680
that the way he describes how a store should work,

309
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,120
that the back end builds the software

310
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,360
and then you just click a button and download a binary,

311
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,960
that is exactly what the Ubuntu Software Center does.

312
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,680
It builds it in a PPA, they're private PPAs,

313
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,360
and when you buy a piece of software,

314
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,280
you are allowed access to a private PPA

315
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,460
where that software was built

316
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,560
and it downloads to your machine.

317
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,400
So-

318
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,240
I think he's talking about compiling them, right?

319
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,560
It's only for one, yeah, and it does that.

320
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,400
Oh, okay. It does that.

321
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,780
Okay. So that bit, yeah,

322
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,080
he's got that completely nailed,

323
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,560
but what he's talking about is building

324
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,880
for multiple platforms, so you have one store

325
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,360
where you click a button and it figures out

326
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,120
that you're on Fedora, so it builds and gives you an RPM.

327
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,440
That would all be magical,

328
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,160
getting buy-in from everyone, tricky.

329
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,840
That's harder.

330
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,240
You think?

331
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,240
So it seems to me that it would almost be, in a sense,

332
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,520
the burden would be on the software center

333
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,240
or whatever you want to call it, to figure out that magic,

334
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,560
but for these developers-

335
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,560
It depends whether you're talking about free software,

336
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,520
open source software, or proprietary software,

337
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,600
because some developers want to put their free

338
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,880
and open software and, okay, they build it in the cloud

339
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,520
and download, works for that,

340
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,680
but what about those developers

341
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,840
who are running proprietary software?

342
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,800
So the individual developers or the app developers

343
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,560
who are creating applications,

344
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,720
they will build it locally on their machine

345
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,100
and then upload a binary.

346
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,640
So it doesn't work for every use case.

347
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Well, I'm also now thinking

348
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,260
of the OpenSUSE build service, right?

349
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,760
Where it builds- Yeah.

350
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,240
Go ahead. Go ahead, Wimpy.

351
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,840
Well, yeah, I was just gonna say the build from source idea

352
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,040
is fine, but you would need somebody

353
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
to actually put the effort in to create the packaging

354
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,920
for the different end distributions.

355
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,000
So I have some experience in packaging

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,280
on Arch Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu,

357
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,080
and I can't directly take my packaging from Arch

358
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,160
and apply it in dev files

359
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,940
because the concepts are totally different from one another.

360
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,000
So you have to do whole cloth implementations

361
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,360
and the packaging for each distribution separately,

362
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,560
and also spec files from RPMs are different to devs

363
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,560
and different to Arch PKG builds.

364
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,840
So you could build it from source,

365
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,040
but somebody would have to be the package maintainer

366
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,880
for all of the things.

367
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,840
This is why I think the way that we've done it

368
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,160
with the phone, which is the developer builds it

369
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,160
and they upload a binary, is the better way forward.

370
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Because then you make, as you as a developer,

371
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,240
make sure that your thing works,

372
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,040
and if it works and you can build it locally

373
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,320
and you can test it in an emulator

374
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,720
or test it on your device or desktop or whatever,

375
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,600
and then once you've built a compiled version,

376
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,120
you upload that into the store

377
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,640
and make that available to people.

378
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,080
So iogogo, you mentioned the magic Docker word

379
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,160
that seems to be the buzz phrase

380
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,000
that everybody uses to solve problems like this.

381
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,480
What were you thinking in terms of how Docker

382
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,520
could solve this?

383
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,800
Well, from what I've read in places,

384
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,520
I've heard that Docker basically emulates

385
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,520
distros on top of an existing software or kernel.

386
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,560
But you could use, companies could use that to,

387
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,840
I can't talk with this echo.

388
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,160
So you're thinking that companies

389
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,320
could deliver their applications.

390
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,520
Close your mic, I'll summarize.

391
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,040
You're thinking people could deliver their applications

392
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,560
through Docker, and they are kind of starting to do that.

393
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,840
Like I deployed Smokeping on my Arch setup over that,

394
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,680
and I found it to be really simple and straightforward.

395
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,040
And of course, it means I'm kind of running

396
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,560
an Ubuntu machine in a container.

397
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,280
And that, that makes me go back to that.

398
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,560
Do you make that sound bad?

399
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,400
Well, no.

400
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,240
You're like, oh God, I'm running an Ubuntu in a container.

401
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,120
No, it seems like a lot of extra overhead

402
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,360
to run a single application.

403
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,680
Like a lot of extra stuff has to be updated

404
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,920
and maintained now, but in the long run,

405
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,360
I'm not convinced it's not, it might be better.

406
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,080
I mean like, build it in a Docker container,

407
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,400
and then you give out the binary from the Docker container,

408
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,640
and like you have different registers

409
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,560
in the Docker containers.

410
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
With all the thousands of gigabytes of storage

411
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,800
that you need to be on the server side for these companies

412
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,360
in order to get all the combination of phones fixed

413
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,240
and figured out and relatively bug free,

414
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,800
either they can do it and host 50 different binaries

415
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
for 50 different things that they know

416
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,440
should cover most phones.

417
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,040
It's very hard to go and just give the software store

418
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,080
the source.

419
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,960
Then you can use your phone to chug through it

420
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,400
and compile it straight up on your phone

421
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,760
because you're gonna need some serious power cord usage

422
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,680
after that.

423
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,320
Otherwise, like they need to make sure

424
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,420
that all these programs, apps are compiled

425
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,840
for their target operating system in a runtime environment.

426
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,460
And in order to get all that,

427
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,480
it's a lot of space used up on their servers.

428
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,440
Rotten, I wanna hear your grand vision

429
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,000
of one app store to solve all,

430
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
because this is exactly what Nathan's going after.

431
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,240
What do you think?

432
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,400
Yeah, a universal app store for Linux

433
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,680
would be the perfect option

434
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,120
because it would be a structure more in the sense

435
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,240
that every single app, every single distro

436
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,880
can keep doing whatever they wanna do.

437
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,000
They can use RPM, they can use Deb or whatever.

438
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,120
And this software center or store or whatever

439
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,760
just gives you the packages that are for your distro.

440
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,600
And based on which it's installed to,

441
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,640
it can tell what distro it has.

442
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,480
So it knows what packages to give you.

443
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,840
So it'll give you an RPM if you need RPM,

444
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,020
Deb if you're on Debian, stuff like that.

445
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,860
I don't know.

446
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,800
I feel like this problem is already solved

447
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,680
by our friends over at Valve.

448
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,780
I mean, we all have different distributions.

449
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,140
All of us have Steam installed.

450
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,920
We're all downloading and installing applications.

451
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,620
They don't have to only deliver desktop games.

452
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,560
They could also deliver desktop productivity applications.

453
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,400
They already have some in their store.

454
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,240
Well, they do.

455
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,060
Right.

456
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,120
And they do what I suggested,

457
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,160
which is the developer uploads a binary.

458
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,680
They don't build it in Steam.

459
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,520
Right.

460
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,720
The developer builds the binaries

461
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,280
and uploads a Windows binary, a Mac binary,

462
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,960
a Linux 32-bit binary, and that works.

463
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,480
So we have, I see in front of us,

464
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,700
we have Lenart and the Known Team's version

465
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,200
of distributing software through like a ButterFS,

466
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,320
you know, a Delta.

467
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,960
You have delivering applications through Docker.

468
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,800
You have delivering applications through an App Store,

469
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,900
Steam, the openSUSE build service.

470
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,740
Obviously, I think it's pretty clear

471
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,440
that even though this is,

472
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,640
we're working towards something,

473
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,480
and we just haven't,

474
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,000
we still haven't figured out what it is.

475
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,280
It's kind of crazy.

476
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,560
It kind of is over the top.

477
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,720
But I feel like we're getting somewhere,

478
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,000
and I kind of feel like containerization

479
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,920
and all this stuff is almost going to maybe

480
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,500
start nullifying all these differences.

481
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,120
And we might look back at a time

482
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,920
where developers and package maintainers

483
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,000
know what all of these little things are,

484
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
but it's been pretty well abstracted away from the end user.

485
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,840
So that's my vision.

486
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,640
Steam plus OBS would be awesome.

487
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,720
My long-term vision is distros will keep

488
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,800
their distro-specific tools that they use

489
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,680
to manage their software and build their distribution.

490
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,080
But long-term, it's almost abstracted away

491
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,000
from the user in all cases.

492
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,800
I mean, you see it today

493
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,160
where now the GNOME Software Center,

494
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,440
it's the same way to install Transmit on Fedora

495
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,840
as it is on Arch now.

496
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,400
And they are hugely different under the hood

497
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
in terms of installing packages.

498
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,520
But that's ginormous, right?

499
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,160
And that's one instance of it.

500
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,480
And that's maybe just a little glimpse into the future.

501
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,680
I don't know.

502
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,100
I just really, really think it's going to change eventually.

503
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,480
It has to change eventually, I think.

504
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,320
Because it's something that does keep coming up.

505
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,800
If you don't move forward, you're moving backward.

506
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,600
Well, and it's something that never goes away,

507
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,280
especially when people switch to Linux.

508
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,120
So it's always an email that's coming in our inbox

509
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,240
because people are switching over to Linux.

510
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,860
And they're like, what a mess!

511
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,100
You know, because on Windows and Mac,

512
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,480
when you want to download something,

513
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,640
even though it's a little more archaic than how we do it,

514
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,280
to the end users, it makes a lot of sense.

515
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,320
You Google the name of the thing, Skype.

516
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,240
You click on the Skype download Google results,

517
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,040
like the second or third result, right, every time.

518
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,360
You download it to your desktop and you double click it.

519
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,120
And that's how they think software is supposed to work.

520
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,280
And so the idea to them that you download something

521
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,440
for Linux and it could work on one Linux

522
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,120
and not work on another Linux, that's broken to them.

523
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,040
That is fundamentally flawed.

524
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,280
That's a flaw to them.

525
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,560
And I can see it that way.

526
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,440
So I think eventually it's going to have to be abstracted out.

527
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,080
Something smarter is going to have to happen.

528
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,380
Well, and you say that it's archaic,

529
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,680
but I mean, the reality is if all the software existed

530
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,000
in every software repository, I would agree with you.

531
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,080
But since it doesn't, depending on which distro I'm using,

532
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,280
drastically varies.

533
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,800
Yeah, it can still happen.

534
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,360
Yeah, I mean, it drastically depends

535
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,080
on what software is available to me, right?

536
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,560
But what I mean, they get all their software that way, right?

537
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,720
For Linux users, we have in repos, we can download it.

538
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,140
But for them, they go hunt and peck

539
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,980
and download from the web.

540
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,860
And that's why sometimes they download the wrong thing

541
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,080
and they get malware, like it's not a safe,

542
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,720
like trying to get printer drivers for something that,

543
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,520
yeah, it's very different than how you do it under Linux.

544
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,640
And to them, it's totally, it doesn't make any sense

545
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,200
how you do it under Linux, how you install software.

546
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,840
I specifically, I know I've mentioned this a lot,

547
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,360
but watching Chase try to install a few applications

548
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,680
for the first time on Ubuntu,

549
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,840
and other people I've had try it too.

550
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,440
Every time I tell them, okay,

551
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,640
now let's install some software,

552
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,060
even though I intentionally kind of introduced them

553
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,040
to the software center and then close it

554
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,120
and make sure we move on and say,

555
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,660
okay, now let's install some software.

556
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,100
I swear, every time they open up the browser

557
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,240
and they go to Google, they don't even think about it.

558
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,480
They don't even think about packages.

559
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,320
No, they don't.

560
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,200
I think you're also combating muscle memory.

561
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,040
People have it wired into their,

562
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
it's like, people that are analytical,

563
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,520
they're dealt with a certain situation,

564
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,140
they instantly go into solving mode,

565
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,800
whereas someone else just goes into freak out mode.

566
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,160
I think it's the same sort of thing.

567
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,640
These people have been wired to find software

568
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
in this fashion, and you're having to unlearn that.

569
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,480
Yeah, exactly.

570
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,300
And then it may take some time.

571
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,140
It's all training.

572
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,640
Yeah, yep, yep, it doesn't, yeah, exactly.

573
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,120
You can teach, trust me, you can teach an old dog new tricks.

574
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,280
Hey, speaking of new tricks,

575
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,480
let me tell you about DigitalOcean.

576
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,360
They got a few new tricks I'd like to tell you about.

577
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,320
Oh, you're not familiar with DigitalOcean, my friends?

578
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,640
Now's the time to go to DigitalOcean.com,

579
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,480
because we've got a promo code for the month of October.

580
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,920
They'll get you a $10 credit.

581
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,880
Hey-oh, unplugged October, all one word lowercase,

582
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,720
$10 credit.

583
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,700
So what is DigitalOcean?

584
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,560
It's like a warm cloud blanket.

585
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,640
You just want to wrap up it,

586
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,120
and you set up all kinds of droplets,

587
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,400
because it's a simple cloud hosting provider

588
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,760
dedicated to offering the most intuitive

589
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,460
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

590
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,080
Users can get started in less than 55 seconds, trust me.

591
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,880
And pricing plans start at only $5 a month

592
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,480
for 512 megabytes of RAM.

593
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,920
A 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU,

594
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,760
and a terabyte of transfer for $5.

595
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,100
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York,

596
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,480
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and up in London.

597
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,080
Why not get some global diversity?

598
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,840
That's what I always say.

599
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,740
In fact, I've been doing that.

600
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,280
I actually have done it just for performance purposes,

601
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,000
because we have a lot of folks that are syncing

602
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,760
to some of our resources from other parts of the world.

603
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,420
So I thought, okay, let's have a server in their area.

604
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,260
That just makes sense.

605
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,920
But then I later realized,

606
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,520
hey, I just distributed my data across the world,

607
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,240
and now I have regional backups.

608
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,060
That's great.

609
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,720
So that's also great from that standpoint as well.

610
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,320
So you can do it for performance or for data purposes.

611
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,960
And I think the other thing that's really awesome

612
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,160
about DigitalOcean is,

613
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,060
I know that because their interface is so great,

614
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,800
I can really get up and get something running

615
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,840
in pretty much no time.

616
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,360
So getting the server part ready, spun up, backed up,

617
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,320
whatever I need to do before a project,

618
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,160
DigitalOcean makes that crazy easy.

619
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,900
So that's never the barrier to getting started,

620
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,880
which I really appreciate,

621
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,280
because their interface is super simple and intuitive,

622
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,840
and you can replicate the functionality

623
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,960
on a larger scale with their API.

624
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,200
But something new DigitalOcean's doing.

625
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,640
Now it's your chance to make a little cash on the side.

626
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,200
If you're an expert in something,

627
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,920
you want to deploy, if you've deployed something

628
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,560
and you want to write a tutorial for it,

629
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,040
DigitalOcean can pay up to $200 for your tutorial,

630
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,000
and they have editors that will work with you,

631
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,120
so don't worry, the burden's not all on your shoulders.

632
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,960
They just need somebody that really knows their stuff,

633
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,400
because DigitalOcean wants to get their community tutorials

634
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,000
beyond anything else that anybody else has,

635
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,960
and that's why they're willing to pay the good 200 bucks.

636
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,200
That's some good money for writing.

637
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,500
Yeah, that's actually, in most circles,

638
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,640
for just a standard article,

639
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,840
it's outlining how to do something.

640
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,760
That's the going rate.

641
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,600
That's not bad, right?

642
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,820
I mean, especially if it's something you already know.

643
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,600
If it's something you already know,

644
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,720
and you know what I would have done, Matt,

645
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,720
is I think like, even if I already had,

646
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,460
if I just wanted a little play money,

647
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,120
I mean, I could take those credits or something,

648
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,520
put them on my DigitalOcean account,

649
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,720
and have my droplet pay for for a long time,

650
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,560
because they're talking it's $5 a month.

651
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,880
But even if I, I kind of kick myself,

652
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,220
because I think I probably could have taken advantage

653
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,200
of this when I first deployed OwnCloud 7.

654
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,560
I had that up and running the night it came out,

655
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,480
and then I had a whole bunch of people asking me

656
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,720
how I got OwnCloud 7 running,

657
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,480
and I thought, you know what?

658
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,400
I could have written that up,

659
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,840
worked with one of the DigitalOcean editors,

660
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,280
and potentially made $200.

661
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,480
So I'll have a link in the show notes

662
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,280
if you want to find out more information about that.

663
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,240
It's an initiative that DigitalOcean's really excited about,

664
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,160
because they're trying to get that just better than anybody.

665
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,280
They've already got amazing tutorials, a great community,

666
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,720
now they're trying to make it better than ever.

667
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
DigitalOcean.com, check them out.

668
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,240
Unplugged, October, we'll get you that $10 credit.

669
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,060
Find out why Matt and I have got like droplets

670
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,160
coming out of our ears these days.

671
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,700
Well, and just to touch on that whole writing thing

672
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,280
one more time, what I'm saying is that

673
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,360
most places that you go to seek out freelance work for,

674
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,040
you're not getting paid anywhere near that.

675
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,000
This is unusual.

676
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,520
This is more closer to pro-level pay.

677
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,560
It's a good opportunity.

678
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,880
I know. It's a great opportunity.

679
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,760
I know, right? It's good money.

680
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,280
And especially, I know people in our audience,

681
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,040
there's stuff out there they know a lot about.

682
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,520
Definitely. They can make a little extra money on.

683
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,780
All right, so we've got a couple more emails

684
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,120
that I think are really gonna get us going

685
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,440
on a couple of topics.

686
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,640
So let me jump back into the emails here.

687
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,440
First email that we're gonna talk about is Peter's,

688
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,480
and he wants to know, this is a question I get all the time.

689
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,120
He says, hey Chris, the other day I was watching

690
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,720
one of the episodes of LASS,

691
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,180
and you jumped into a terminal

692
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,700
when you were installing an app.

693
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,840
While you were using the terminal,

694
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,080
I noticed a kind of auto-completed helper tool

695
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,200
that would suggest your next command.

696
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,160
I tried searching for bash in the search input field

697
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,640
on your site, but it returned a bunch of shows

698
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,960
where I could not easily find any mention of the tool.

699
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,840
And if you're watching on the video version here,

700
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,400
I'll bring up my terminal on, here's a big fonts.

701
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,920
And if you'll notice, if I start typing packer or ping,

702
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,920
you see how it's starting to automatically suggest

703
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,760
commands for me.

704
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,400
And I could hit over error and it'll complete the command

705
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
and then it'll run a search.

706
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
That is Fish Shell.

707
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,040
That's the Fish Shell.

708
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,380
And I like it a lot.

709
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,320
It's just in the Arch, it's in probably every distro package.

710
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,080
It's in the Arch packages too.

711
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,000
And I installed Fish a while ago because I'm a lazy person.

712
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,720
And I mostly run the same, I run about the same 10, 15,

713
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,820
20 commands on the command line over and over again.

714
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,320
Systemctl, restartplex, pacman-syu, you know,

715
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,360
those kinds of things over and over again.

716
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,880
And so the nice thing about Fish is it not only

717
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,240
is really smart about figuring out what directory

718
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,080
you're trying to get to.

719
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,360
Like here, I'll show you another one back on my screen here.

720
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,800
In the mornings, I'm constantly, right before I go on live,

721
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,440
I'm downloading like an old retro tech commercial

722
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,960
for Tech Talk Today.

723
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,280
So a lot of times if I just type in CD,

724
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,800
now it's automatically suggesting the path

725
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
that I might wanna go to.

726
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,320
In this case, it's Dropbox slash Jupiter remote host

727
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,160
slash today.

728
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,360
It's a fairly lengthy path.

729
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,680
And instead of me having to type in there,

730
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Fish Shell's saying, well, you know,

731
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,880
you type this one a lot.

732
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,560
Because I pretty much type that every single morning.

733
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
So if I hit the over arrow,

734
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,240
it just completes that whole path for me.

735
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,560
And then I hit enter.

736
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,760
And I also like the way it displays my current,

737
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,120
my present location, all that kind of stuff.

738
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,000
So I know Fish Shell isn't the best.

739
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,840
Any Shells in the Mamba Room anybody wants to call out

740
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,940
that you love besides Bash?

741
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,600
Any Bash alternatives?

742
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm just saying, Chris, I saw that one on that show

743
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,240
and I changed my default to Fish having seen it.

744
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,680
Just for the few seconds I saw it on your screen.

745
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,080
It's handy, right?

746
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,960
Yeah, it's awesome.

747
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Yeah.

748
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,840
I know a lot of people like ZSH, but I like Fish better.

749
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,920
Yeah, ZSH, I think, is I also see recommended the most.

750
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,880
And I think Fish and, oh, Heaven, so Heaven,

751
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,840
do you know ZSH, so Fish and ZSH are related?

752
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,040
I'm pretty sure that Fish was created from ZSH.

753
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,600
ZSH, uh-huh, that makes sense.

754
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,960
Because, you know, Shells aren't exactly the most easiest

755
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,480
thing in the world to, you know, come up out of thin air.

756
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,760
So all of the Fish beauty is built on top of ZSH's awesome

757
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,520
built-in stuff.

758
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,720
And Fish just knew how to use ZSH.

759
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,840
Blaster, you have a Shell you like.

760
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,880
Yeah, I've come to like TCSH, actually,

761
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,960
after working on some of the BSD servers that I have access to.

762
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,320
Very nice, very nice.

763
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,160
So there you go.

764
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,480
There are some Shells you can check out besides boring old

765
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,640
Shell Shocked Bash.

766
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,320
I kid.

767
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,640
All right, Mike writes in.

768
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,120
And guess what Mike wants to stir the pot on?

769
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,360
System D. But I thought it was actually a good email.

770
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,560
So we'll go into this.

771
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,720
Not to get the whole System D discussion going again,

772
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,320
but he says, I finally identified

773
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,160
why I've disliked System D for so long.

774
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,360
And now that I identified that, I'm actually OK with System D.

775
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,160
I have a feeling that my situation also

776
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,520
applies to many other who have disliked System D.

777
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,760
What frustrated me the most about System D

778
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,520
is that it had an awful product positioning,

779
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,320
for lack of a better term.

780
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,960
When it first came out, it billed itself

781
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,960
as a simple init replacement, plus a syslog replacement,

782
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,160
plus a cron replacement, which in my mind

783
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,640
makes it about as much sense as putting alcohol, tobacco,

784
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,000
and firearms under a single agency.

785
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,880
But at least I could get my head around it,

786
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,840
and I was fine with it.

787
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,160
But then it started taking control of login

788
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,360
and managing my temp mount, among other things.

789
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,440
I became confused and frustrated.

790
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,000
This wasn't part of the agreement.

791
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,960
What kind of cancer is this System D?

792
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,320
I've since realized that even though System D still describes

793
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,340
itself as just being an init replacement,

794
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,000
it's actually designed to become an entire operating system

795
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,800
layer.

796
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,080
It wants to be in charge of everything

797
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,560
that happens between the kernel and X11.

798
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:58,480
Udev, Dbus, login, DHCP client, WPA supplicant, et cetera.

799
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,600
If there's a job that runs before the display manager

800
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,340
starts, System D wants to provide it.

801
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,680
Now that I know what System D's true purpose is,

802
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,640
it no longer confuses and frustrates me.

803
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,360
In fact, I'm kind of OK with it.

804
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,320
I could even go ahead and replace mount NFS

805
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,800
tab for all I care.

806
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,440
I mean, that's what it's designed to do, right?

807
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,120
Is he right, guys?

808
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,920
Is System D designed to just manage

809
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,040
all of the things between the kernel and X?

810
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,800
Yeah.

811
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,960
Yeah, I think it kind of is, Tim.

812
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,360
I think it's providing that kind of abstraction.

813
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,360
That's my impression.

814
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,860
Yeah.

815
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,200
All right, Otter, you have something to say.

816
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,040
Go ahead.

817
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Yeah, I was just going to say this idea has occurred

818
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,480
to other people as well.

819
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,520
Upstart was also going to replace

820
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,760
cron and auto mounting and things like that.

821
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,520
The difference is Upstart had a limited budget,

822
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,800
whereas System D had Red Hat behind it.

823
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,920
Well, OK, yes.

824
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,120
I want to go back up.

825
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,080
So System D, Michael Dominic on Quota Radio,

826
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,280
if you haven't listened to this week's Quota Radio,

827
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,920
he goes after me the entire episode.

828
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,800
And he got on me about System D and was really

829
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,180
trying to get to the root of it.

830
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,840
And one of the things that he sort of stressed

831
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
was like, wait a minute.

832
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,320
When you describe it, it sounds almost like some

833
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,560
of these things are necessary.

834
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
And I'll give you an example of one of the things

835
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,880
that System D does for me on my servers that, to me,

836
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,360
feels like something that has to be in Linux for it

837
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,400
to stay competitive.

838
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,960
And that is that System D manages my NFS mounts.

839
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,880
And the reason why I find that to be important

840
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,920
is because I've had networking issues here at the studio

841
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,680
because of Comcast.

842
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,000
And we reboot things like our router and even the switch

843
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,440
just to be safe sometimes.

844
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,000
And my network connections go up and down.

845
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,440
And System D recognizes that and is intelligent enough

846
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,240
to re-establish my NFS mount after the network connection

847
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,520
is live again, which makes all of the server software that

848
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,760
runs over that NFS mount continue to function

849
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,560
without me having to do anything.

850
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,560
Now, that's handy just here having a server that

851
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,400
never leaves the studio.

852
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,660
But on a laptop or a phone or a tablet

853
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,680
where you're moving between cellular and Wi-Fi

854
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
and different Wi-Fi networks, that's

855
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,620
a must-have critical feature.

856
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,360
And that's just one thing that System D now

857
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,920
manages that is extremely I just I don't even

858
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,200
think it's a nice-to-have feature.

859
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
I think it's like we've got to have that now.

860
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,920
The operating system has to be more cohesive.

861
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,560
It has to be more intelligent.

862
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,200
It has to be communicating with each other to stay competitive.

863
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,560
And I mean competitive in a way where people actually continue

864
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,600
to use it because if it doesn't do these things,

865
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,000
it'll start to look old and not appropriate

866
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,840
for modern-day tasks.

867
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,760
And I recognize that we're kind of betting a lot on System D,

868
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,600
but I don't see anybody else really.

869
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,180
I guess that's part of it is I don't really

870
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,280
see any other alternatives really kind of stepping up

871
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,960
to do the whole thing.

872
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,160
Well, that's the key is that nobody else is doing it.

873
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,960
And it seems to be a great solution.

874
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,800
It's worked for me.

875
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,040
It's worked for a lot of people.

876
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,120
PC Wiz, you think it's more it's not what System D does.

877
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,840
It's how it does it.

878
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,680
What do you mean?

879
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,720
I think just the way they're not using standard Unix pipes

880
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,480
and things to communicate between the different utils

881
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,000
is what's upsetting most people.

882
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,160
Because if they just set it out like standard Unix utilities

883
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,840
and used pipes to communicate between them,

884
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,600
then I don't think people would have such a problem with it.

885
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,480
But because it's doing its own custom thing

886
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,760
and outputting the binary files, that's

887
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,520
the problem people have with it.

888
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,120
Not particularly that all this stuff shouldn't be there

889
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,680
and shouldn't be unified under one set of things,

890
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,320
but it should be in different bits

891
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,240
that talk in a standard Unix way.

892
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,920
All right.

893
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,400
All right.

894
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Very good.

895
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,760
Now we're going to open up something special.

896
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,680
We're all done with the System D debate.

897
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,960
We've got to talk about Ubuntu and the future

898
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,080
and some really flashy stuff that I saw today.

899
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
And I'm glad that Popeye is here,

900
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,880
because maybe I think we'll get this straight with Popeye.

901
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,760
We won't make it awful.

902
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,640
Popeye will save us, I'm told.

903
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,320
I'm told.

904
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,360
Hopefully.

905
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,060
Hopefully.

906
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,280
Because I want to discuss, we've got some great visuals

907
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,780
of the next generation apps that we'll probably

908
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,480
be able to get our hands on in Ubuntu 14.10

909
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,800
just to play around with.

910
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,520
And I want to see what you guys think

911
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,160
and kind of get your take on if you

912
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,320
think they're going to get the job done for you

913
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,640
and if you're excited about them.

914
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,920
I actually watched a video, I don't know who posted it.

915
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,440
I'll have to get that before we go on, this morning.

916
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,680
And some of those apps are looking pretty damn good,

917
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,940
especially the movies and videos app look really good.

918
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,640
So before we get to that, I want to tell you

919
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,600
about our next sponsor, and that's Linux Academy.

920
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,960
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to get the 33% discount

921
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,040
and to check out the brand new website.

922
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,600
Man, Linux Academy just really spruced it up.

923
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,100
Go over there just to check that out.

924
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,560
These guys, I got to talk to them.

925
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,400
I got to talk to them to redesign the Jupyter

926
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,320
Broadcasting website because I tell you, this is how you do it.

927
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,120
I could see this look working for us.

928
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,880
I could see that.

929
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,860
So what is Linux Academy?

930
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,000
It's probably where you should go right now

931
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,700
if you're ready to take your Linux skills up

932
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,120
to the next level, make yourself a little more competitive,

933
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,360
maybe get that checkbox on the next review

934
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,120
or just sort of test yourself, find out

935
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,400
what you're interested in.

936
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,120
Linux Academy has a whole range of courses,

937
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,160
and your subscription gets you access to all of it

938
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,960
and all of the new stuff they're adding.

939
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,320
DevOps stuff, AWS classes, basic Linux classes

940
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,840
to expert level Linux classes, OpenStack.

941
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,420
And they have seven plus distributions

942
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,360
you get to choose from when you're

943
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,600
taking any of these courses.

944
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,280
The courseware will modify itself

945
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,760
to match that distribution.

946
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,960
They have downloadable comprehensive study guides.

947
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,600
You can take those offline.

948
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,080
That includes media like audio and video files as well.

949
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,520
I've heard from many listeners who now use those downloads

950
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,740
as sort of like supplemental podcasts.

951
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,240
So when they're out listening to the shows,

952
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,680
they get a lecture learning in.

953
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,360
And Linux Academy also has the ability

954
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,120
to generate a learning course, a learning plan,

955
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,600
just based on your availability.

956
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,440
You go in there and plug in the information you've got.

957
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,840
They'll build a plan that fits your schedule.

958
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,320
When you open up the dashboard, you

959
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,560
get an immediate snapshot of right where you're at,

960
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
what you have, how long each section is going to take.

961
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,360
You can do recaps.

962
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,440
You can test yourself.

963
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,400
You can re-watch video introductions.

964
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,840
And if you get to a spot, you can also seek instructor help.

965
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,820
They also have an active community and live streams

966
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,780
of events where you can talk right to the educators.

967
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,400
They're constantly adding new stuff.

968
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,440
A lot of these are scenario-based training courses.

969
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,640
That way you go end to end with the technology.

970
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,960
For example, if it's an AWS course,

971
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,440
you'll implement things on EC2 and S3.

972
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,040
They'll spin up the instances for you

973
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,640
as the courseware requires it.

974
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,040
That's really awesome.

975
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,840
And now these servers have public addresses

976
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,260
so that way other people can log in

977
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,480
and you can work in a group.

978
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,640
It's pretty awesome stuff.

979
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,080
And they're adding new things all the time.

980
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,840
So head over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

981
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,520
You'll get a 33% discount.

982
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,480
And this is a school put together

983
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,640
by Linux enthusiasts and educators who

984
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,840
had the know-how to do something like this, who

985
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,700
wanted to give Linux users a spot to go and actually learn

986
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,640
something, and not this stuff that you

987
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,040
go to that's sort of like cookie cutter Linux

988
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,760
material that's been put together by some industry.

989
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,040
This is from stuff from folks who work in the industry.

990
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,280
They really know their stuff and they're experienced educators.

991
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,080
It's an experience that's custom crafted for Linux users.

992
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,560
And you can find it linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

993
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,760
Check out all of their awesome stuff.

994
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,480
It's another great way to go if you just

995
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,940
want to spruce up your skills.

996
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,200
I've mentioned before they've got courseware on rsync

997
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,720
and backup scripts, bash scripting, things like that,

998
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,280
Android development, PHP, the entire LAMP stack, all of that.

999
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,280
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1000
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,360
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

1001
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,200
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

1002
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,520
OK, so I'm not going to play a lot of this video

1003
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,840
because a lot of people listen to the show

1004
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,720
in the audio version.

1005
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,960
But Popeye, I assume you've seen this video that

1006
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,600
was posted online, the Ubuntu next gen apps for 14.10.

1007
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,760
Have you seen this?

1008
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,080
No.

1009
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,760
No, I have.

1010
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,240
OK.

1011
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,400
I've only briefly, I haven't actually watched the whole thing.

1012
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,960
So I've never seen the movies app.

1013
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,520
This is the first time I've, I think

1014
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,920
maybe I've seen screenshots of it,

1015
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,520
but it's like the first time I've ever seen the UI resizing.

1016
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,160
Is that Flashback?

1017
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,880
I don't know.

1018
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,120
It just says movies in the title bar.

1019
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,760
Yeah, Flashback.

1020
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,080
Right.

1021
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,800
Is that the name of it?

1022
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,360
Flashback?

1023
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,960
Yeah.

1024
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,680
Cool.

1025
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,480
So this is the one that gets shown.

1026
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,200
Then also music gets shown quite a bit.

1027
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,960
What we're seeing is it's obviously,

1028
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,680
like for those of you listening, I mean,

1029
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,080
this is clearly a touch UI.

1030
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,040
And that makes sense at this stage, too.

1031
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,440
But it's fully usable on the desktop.

1032
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,160
And the rescaling has surprising functionality on the desktop.

1033
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,680
Like there's actually like, I always

1034
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,600
pictured that dynamic rescaling really just for like going

1035
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,520
from phone to desktop.

1036
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,480
But it actually works really well on the desktop,

1037
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,600
too, just depending on where you position the window.

1038
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,440
It all looks pretty slick.

1039
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,400
Most of the apps actually in that video

1040
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,280
haven't been optimized for desktop.

1041
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,200
I could imagine that.

1042
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,680
Most of them are actually tuned for phone and tablet.

1043
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,640
And we're not even begun to work on them for the desktop.

1044
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,840
We've done the absolute minimum to get them working

1045
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,200
on the desktop.

1046
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,000
And some of them actually look really good.

1047
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,280
So I mean, kind of what like I'm going

1048
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,800
to take an optimistic road here.

1049
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,560
And I'm going to go like way down the road,

1050
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,040
like even maybe past 1604.

1051
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,360
But we're going way down the road here.

1052
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,680
Is really what we would have is at that point,

1053
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,520
the Ubuntu desktop is almost entirely an ecosystem

1054
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,040
of its own in terms of apps, right?

1055
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,960
So it's got presumably Unity 8 by that point.

1056
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,400
It's got its own terminal app, its own file manager,

1057
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,280
all these things.

1058
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,120
So that's a lot.

1059
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,280
In one sense, it's a big burden for Canonical

1060
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,080
to maintain all that stuff.

1061
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,120
But in the other sense, it's nothing not different

1062
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,880
than what the GNOME project itself is doing,

1063
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,760
or elementary OS is doing, with potentially a lot less

1064
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,040
resources.

1065
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,000
And it seems to be maybe this is kind of becoming the trend,

1066
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,960
is just to create your entire own ecosystem under Linux?

1067
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,480
Not really.

1068
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,440
We didn't create everything from scratch.

1069
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,320
I mean, worth noting that most of the apps that

1070
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,240
are in that video were created by people in the community.

1071
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,320
They weren't actually created by Canonical.

1072
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,080
The projects were started by Canonical.

1073
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,600
Pretty much 80%, 90% of the code,

1074
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,240
if not more, in some of those projects

1075
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,800
was written by community people, volunteers.

1076
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,680
And they're the people I work with every day.

1077
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,400
And they're not all written from scratch, either.

1078
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,560
So for example, you happen to mention

1079
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,720
the two apps which build upon existing frameworks.

1080
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,360
So for example, the terminal app builds on a console plugin,

1081
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,760
the KDE console plugin.

1082
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,680
And the file manager builds on some modules

1083
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,880
that give us the basic file manager functionality.

1084
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,080
And on top of that, we built a QML interface.

1085
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,520
So what you're kind of saying is a lot of this functionality

1086
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,520
kind of comes for free.

1087
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,400
And then you have to kind of build maybe something

1088
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,800
on top of it, in a sense.

1089
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,200
So it's not like it's a massive.

1090
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,800
Yeah, we have to build the QML UI on top, yeah.

1091
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,760
So there really is a potential for Ubuntu

1092
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,440
to have some pretty good first class grade applications that

1093
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,880
are kind of exclusive to the Ubuntu desktop touch platform.

1094
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,280
Well, they don't have to be exclusive.

1095
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,320
I don't mean intentionally exclusive.

1096
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,040
Right, I mean, they're all free software.

1097
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,160
So if you wanted to run them on your platform,

1098
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,520
as long as you've got the necessary dependencies, which

1099
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,280
for most of them is have you got Qt 5.3, which

1100
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,960
is in Debian and various other distros.

1101
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,560
I'm sure it's already in Arch.

1102
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,240
You could probably run most of this stuff.

1103
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,440
So it's not intentionally specific to Ubuntu.

1104
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,480
Yes, it uses the Ubuntu look and feel, uses our toolkit,

1105
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,440
uses our branding.

1106
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,360
And we target Ubuntu as the first platform.

1107
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,720
I'm picturing 17.04, 18.10 releases,

1108
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,240
like the amount of features, because at that point,

1109
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,960
there will be so many applications that

1110
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,120
get updated as part of an Ubuntu desktop update.

1111
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,720
Looking at where 14.10 is at today versus where something

1112
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,480
like 18.10 would be at, there is going

1113
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,520
to be a whole new suite of applications

1114
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,060
that are shipped in those updates that

1115
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,240
don't even exist today on the Ubuntu desktop.

1116
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,200
Right, and those don't have to be created by us.

1117
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,160
We've created this store where you can upload your own apps.

1118
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,740
I'll give you a good example, actually.

1119
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,200
This week, I saw someone tweet about a calculator app

1120
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,720
for Firefox OS.

1121
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,640
And I found it on GitHub, and I grabbed the code,

1122
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,680
and I packaged it up.

1123
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,840
It's an HTML5 app, and I stuck it in the Ubuntu click store.

1124
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,000
And now that's available for people on the phone.

1125
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,280
And in the future, that will be available on the desktop.

1126
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,320
And that took me minutes to take a piece of code that

1127
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,040
had already been written, turn it into a package.

1128
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,560
The package consisted of like three files,

1129
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,440
three plain text files that are easy to do.

1130
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,080
In fact, I copy and pasted them from another one

1131
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,840
on my projects.

1132
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,560
So it's like near zero effort to take a piece of code

1133
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,960
that you've created and make it available.

1134
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,040
And in the future, yeah, we'll have

1135
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,600
the store that will allow you to deploy those click

1136
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,040
packages to desktop, tablet, phone, Gmail.

1137
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,280
So what do you think about the fact

1138
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,320
that some Linux users will be coming to Ubuntu

1139
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,700
from a different distro, and it's

1140
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,200
going to be like an entirely, they're

1141
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,240
going to have, they'll have to learn an entirely

1142
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,760
different suite of applications.

1143
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,400
Right.

1144
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,160
And look how awesome they already are,

1145
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,640
and we're nowhere near ready for those people yet.

1146
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,120
Right.

1147
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,560
Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying it's going to be a bad thing,

1148
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,760
but it's going to be, for me, it's

1149
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,080
weird because like right now, if I

1150
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,360
learn how to use like a file manager, like say,

1151
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,160
Dolphin or whatever, it's the same Dolphin

1152
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,000
on all versions of Linux that I installed KDE on.

1153
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,600
It's just going to be a different thing.

1154
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,440
I'm not saying it's bad or good.

1155
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,880
It's just something that's new, I think.

1156
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,680
Yeah, but these are default applications.

1157
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,480
I mean, look what elementary are doing

1158
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,880
with their default applications.

1159
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,000
They're setting themselves aside and having their own brand,

1160
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,560
their own style, their own theme to set themselves aside.

1161
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,120
They're not necessarily forking Linux or anything like that.

1162
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,240
They're making a statement that this is what elementary OS is.

1163
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,580
And when you come to elementary, you

1164
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,160
get slightly different applications.

1165
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,800
OK, the file manager looks like a file manager,

1166
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,340
and just the same as our file manager

1167
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,760
looks like a file manager.

1168
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,800
The music app will have different features, maybe more,

1169
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,160
maybe less.

1170
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,760
So do you think the biggest challenge will be factoring

1171
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,400
these in a way where they seem a little more

1172
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,560
native to a desktop interface going forward?

1173
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,840
Do you think that's going to be the?

1174
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,920
I don't think that's the biggest issue.

1175
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,440
It's one of the issues.

1176
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,200
The design team haven't focused on the desktop.

1177
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
That's why Unity 8 isn't finished yet.

1178
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,880
Unity 8 is a preview remix CD you can get.

1179
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,560
It's not the default desktop.

1180
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,480
We're not going to make that mistake again.

1181
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,680
Yeah, I'm looking forward to at least trying

1182
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,480
to get to play around with them a little bit.

1183
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,280
I just think it's.

1184
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,400
Well, you already can.

1185
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,360
They're all available.

1186
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,440
They're all free software.

1187
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,360
You can grab them and play with them.

1188
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,120
Yeah, the code is all on Launchpad.

1189
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,320
We build devs.

1190
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,120
So yeah, you can install them, or you

1191
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,280
can play with them on a phone.

1192
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,000
It's impressive to see how far they've come already, really.

1193
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,160
I've seen people, I mean, people seem to really not

1194
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,280
get past the fact that like, oh, you know,

1195
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,760
I've seen a lot of people complain about the file

1196
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,400
manager has a huge header bar up top and things like that.

1197
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,600
They're obviously not accepting the fact

1198
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,960
that they really haven't focused on the desktop UI yet.

1199
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,840
Right.

1200
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,360
But even on the phone, it has that quite big header.

1201
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,280
And we're looking at improving that.

1202
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,160
So next week, as I've mentioned to you before,

1203
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,520
I'm going to be in Washington, DC.

1204
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,000
Yeah, I've heard that, DC, yeah.

1205
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,240
And a bunch of the people who wrote those apps that

1206
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,280
are in that video, a whole bunch of them are coming with us.

1207
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,680
And we're going to work on all kinds of things,

1208
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,680
whether it's design, or fixing bugs, performance, feedback

1209
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,800
from users.

1210
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,960
So we're going to look at comments on those videos,

1211
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,260
comments on Reddit threads, and see

1212
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,160
what people think of those apps, and see

1213
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,440
what we can do to improve them, and how people use them.

1214
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,240
So yeah, it's an open source project.

1215
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,000
So we take feedback and we improve them.

1216
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,280
And I will have the video that was posted,

1217
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,240
if you guys are curious.

1218
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,560
It's a great video, and we'll have it linked in the show

1219
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,240
notes.

1220
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,160
And you can just search YouTube for Ubuntu next gen apps

1221
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,880
on Ubuntu 14.10, as well, just search YouTube.

1222
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,600
And you get to see some of these apps in action here.

1223
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,920
Do you know what populates this TV and movies?

1224
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,600
What did you call it, Fire or something?

1225
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,400
Yeah, that one's called Flashback.

1226
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,220
It's written by a guy called Necklash, who's

1227
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,880
actually the same guy who wrote the clock app that's

1228
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,280
on our phone, that's also in that video.

1229
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,640
Is it doing a TVDB search here?

1230
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,160
It uses, I think it's called Tracked.

1231
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,360
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1232
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,440
Oh yeah, an online service for tracking the TV program,

1233
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,240
if you like, yeah.

1234
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,680
And he's one of the first.

1235
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,560
I mean, he's blazing a trail.

1236
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,240
Because we haven't even written massively convergent apps.

1237
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,480
We talk about convergence as this ultimate goal by 1604.

1238
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,960
But he's blazing a trail.

1239
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,440
He's created a convergent app that works on the phone,

1240
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,640
works on a tablet, and works on a desktop,

1241
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,280
and adapts itself to the space that's available.

1242
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,920
And we're learning from him.

1243
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,760
And he gave so much feedback to the SDK developers

1244
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,920
at the last summit that we had in Malta.

1245
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,480
That's why we have these community people developing

1246
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,940
apps, because it helps to further the platform

1247
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,400
and give us feedback on what we're doing right

1248
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,120
and what we're doing wrong.

1249
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,360
Yeah, that's really cool to hear that they're

1250
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,560
having a direct impact like that.

1251
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,560
Because it's one thing to say community's involved,

1252
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,440
but that sounds like community's actually.

1253
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,520
Oh, directly, yeah, really directly involved.

1254
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,240
That's pretty neat.

1255
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,980
I'm looking forward to at least getting it.

1256
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,400
But if I install 1410, do I just add a PPA and I get those?

1257
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,640
Or how would I get those today if I wanted to play around

1258
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,520
with some of that stuff?

1259
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,200
So we have a core apps PPA that all the devs

1260
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,920
have built for 1410.

1261
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,880
So yeah, if you install 1410 and added the core apps PPA,

1262
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,720
just Google core apps PPA, you'll find it.

1263
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,680
And there are daily builds of all those apps.

1264
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,360
I think I'm going to play with that.

1265
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,400
Cool, all right.

1266
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,640
Yeah, and again, keep in mind, like Poppy said,

1267
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,320
they're not yet fully set up for the desktop.

1268
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,400
So don't get all judgy.

1269
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,560
It's just for playing.

1270
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,960
And you know.

1271
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,480
Yeah, we get a bit twitchy when we see videos.

1272
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,520
I mean, it's great to see people showing off

1273
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,760
what the community guys are doing with these apps.

1274
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,400
But equally, we get a little bit scared because we

1275
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
know they're not finished.

1276
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,520
And people need to be aware of that.

1277
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,680
Yeah, and if there's one you really like,

1278
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,920
buy that dev a beer, and maybe he'll implement a feature for you

1279
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,200
if you ask him very nicely.

1280
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,800
You never know.

1281
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,840
Or contribute code.

1282
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,440
Yeah, Patchy's welcome, as always.

1283
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,640
Always great, too.

1284
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,100
All right, well, so I wanted to, while we're

1285
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,560
talking about developing software,

1286
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,600
I wanted to talk about some speed bumps

1287
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,440
that the Lightworks developers ran into.

1288
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,180
You know the editor that Matt and I talked about quite a bit

1289
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,580
on last, Lightworks?

1290
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,040
They ran into a major issue caused

1291
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,000
by a Linux kernel update that just sort of blindsided them

1292
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and took them a while to sort of track it down.

1293
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,320
And it's just kind of a good snapshot of sometimes

1294
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,840
some of the problems developers face while writing

1295
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,760
a major application for Linux.

1296
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,800
And how it happened, it's all kind of interesting.

1297
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,880
So I'll tell you about that.

1298
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,500
But first, I want to tell you about Ting.

1299
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,600
Go to linux.ting.com.

1300
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,080
Won't you?

1301
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,680
linux.ting.com lets them know that you appreciate them

1302
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,080
supporting Linux Unplugged.

1303
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,120
And it's a good way to go check them out and get a $25 discount

1304
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,760
on your first device.

1305
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,200
And if you already have a device,

1306
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,260
you can get a $25 credit for Ting.

1307
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:48,880
So what is Ting?

1308
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,160
It's my mobile service provider.

1309
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,340
It's mobile that makes sense.

1310
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,960
It's mobile with no contract.

1311
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,400
It's mobile where you only pay for what you use.

1312
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,640
Ting doesn't have prepaid plans and packages like that.

1313
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,000
It's just your usage.

1314
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,320
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

1315
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:02,880
They add them up.

1316
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,080
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay.

1317
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,780
It's a flat $6 for your line.

1318
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,640
So you can have unlimited devices with no contract

1319
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,080
and no early termination fee.

1320
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,380
And Ting has a rocking dashboard where

1321
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,840
you can manage your account, get a snapshot of exactly where

1322
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,560
you at.

1323
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,880
And they also work on the Android or iOS devices

1324
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,560
with their app.

1325
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,360
Plus, they've got no hold customer service.

1326
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,440
You can call them at 1-855-TING-FTW

1327
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,240
any time between 8 AM and 8 PM business hours

1328
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,240
and an actual human being, a real one.

1329
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,440
Somebody said, please stop saying an actual Canadian.

1330
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,240
It makes us feel bad.

1331
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,000
I'm including everyone on the planet now.

1332
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,200
I don't know if everyone working at Ting is a Canadian or not.

1333
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,960
But I do have a pretty good suspicion

1334
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,720
that everyone answering the phone is a human being.

1335
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,040
I have not personally verified that.

1336
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,160
But based on the folks I've talked to,

1337
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,620
they seem quite human to me.

1338
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,920
So I'm going to vouch for them.

1339
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,880
And you can find out by calling them at 1-855-TING-FTW.

1340
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,800
Find out for yourself.

1341
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,920
They'll probably answer you and any other questions

1342
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,220
you have because they're empowered

1343
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,200
to solve your problems.

1344
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,920
And now is a great time to switch to Ting.

1345
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,760
Go to linux.ting.com to get the discount and give us credit.

1346
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,880
They have a warehouse sale.

1347
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,180
Ting is upgrading their warehouse.

1348
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,040
And they'd rather give you these devices for a crazy great price

1349
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,040
than have to move them.

1350
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:10,960
Can't say I don't blame them.

1351
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,480
That sounds like my style of moving.

1352
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,400
Take it.

1353
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,520
I don't want it.

1354
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,280
I don't want to have to move it.

1355
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,560
I hate moving stuff.

1356
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,000
Ting feels the same way.

1357
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,320
Right now, I can't imagine they're

1358
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,120
going to have many more of these in stock.

1359
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,600
But you can pick up the Sierra 4G Tri-Band LTE

1360
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,640
hotspot for $63 with Ting's warehouse sale.

1361
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,680
$63 plus a $20 Ting credit.

1362
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,600
And you're going to get our $25 Ting credit.

1363
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,120
Now, hold on and think about this.

1364
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,320
You only pay them for what you use with this bad boy.

1365
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,420
So that's a $6 hotspot because it's $6 for the line.

1366
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,680
And then that $20 credit is going to last you a while.

1367
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,380
So you can have a hotspot, Tri-Band LTE, like if I was Popey.

1368
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,320
And I was going to go to that fake Washington.

1369
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,200
I would pick up one of these just for while I was here.

1370
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,600
And I wouldn't be able to use the whole thing.

1371
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,760
And I'd have data with me the whole time.

1372
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,680
Every time I came to the States, I'd turn it on.

1373
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,800
And with Ting's dashboard, you can turn things on and off

1374
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,760
when you need them.

1375
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,440
So it's another great way to save money.

1376
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,620
They've got a bunch of great devices

1377
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,840
right now, including just straight up feature phones.

1378
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,800
Hey, maybe you just want to make a phone call.

1379
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,560
I know, right?

1380
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,720
You want to use your phone to make calls.

1381
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,920
And you just want a really great battery,

1382
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,360
like a three-day battery life.

1383
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,280
Well, you can pick up a feature phone

1384
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,400
right now for a ridiculously low price.

1385
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,360
$43 plus $20 in Ting credits with no contract and no early

1386
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,280
termination fee.

1387
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,800
And you're just paying for your usage

1388
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,960
for a feature phone that's going to get

1389
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,400
like three days of battery life.

1390
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,000
Plus, it still has a decent camera.

1391
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,320
So if you get in a car accident and you

1392
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,440
need something for the insurance,

1393
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,200
you can still at least take a picture of it.

1394
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,600
So you're not like a total caveman.

1395
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,240
But it's mostly going to be for making calls.

1396
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,720
And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

1397
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,760
If that's how you rock, that's how you rock.

1398
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,760
I respect that.

1399
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,360
linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com.

1400
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,000
And a big, big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux

1401
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,560
Unplugged.

1402
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,800
Go check them out.

1403
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,120
All right, so now this isn't going to be a pity party.

1404
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,280
But I wanted to cover this.

1405
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,040
I think it's legit that we talk about this.

1406
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,760
And this doesn't have anything to do with packaging.

1407
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,680
This doesn't have anything to do a system D

1408
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,680
or anything like that.

1409
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,480
But Lightworks developer on a Red Shark blog,

1410
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,000
that's the blog that tracks the Lightworks development,

1411
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,680
talked about the problems he ran into

1412
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,400
and the eventual positive side of it by developing for Linux.

1413
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,960
He says, in recent weeks, some of the Lightworks Linux users

1414
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,040
started to report reduced performance of both new

1415
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,760
and old versions of the software.

1416
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,960
It's like, hmm, multiple versions are affected.

1417
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,960
After some investigation, it appeared to slow down

1418
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:29,080
was only affecting systems with Linux kernels newer than 3.13.

1419
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,120
In tests, kernel performance in 3.14

1420
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,300
did seem to be slightly worse than earlier versions.

1421
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,880
But nothing could explain the symptoms

1422
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,760
that were being experienced by Lightworks users.

1423
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,680
So what could possibly explain the sudden change in behavior?

1424
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,880
Many of the media files that editors use,

1425
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,600
you have to understand this part of it.

1426
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,280
Many of the media files that editors use are compressed,

1427
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,040
like H.264 and stuff like that.

1428
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:57,680
Well, these compressed files have a massive downside.

1429
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,520
And it's something that we try to avoid here

1430
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,020
at the Jupiter Broadcasting Studios.

1431
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,200
We actually record in lossless, with the exception of BSD

1432
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,880
Now, because they're recording it

1433
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,520
on the east coast of Canada.

1434
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,200
So we have one show where we edit a compressed file.

1435
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,800
All our other shows are uncompressed.

1436
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,160
So media editors, when they're working with compressed files,

1437
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,960
have to deal with this thing where

1438
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,120
there's these gaps in the frames, where the editor is just

1439
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,680
supposed to figure out the frame numbers that go in between.

1440
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,680
And it's just sort of assumed you figure it out.

1441
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,880
And the problem with that is these editors

1442
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,560
have to open up every single frame in between these gaps

1443
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,600
to count them all.

1444
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,000
And that can take megabytes and megabytes and megabytes

1445
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,980
and megabytes of memory per clip.

1446
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,640
Because it has to open them all up in a memory to count them,

1447
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,300
to figure out the number of frames

1448
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,120
in between these gap markers.

1449
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,600
And that takes tons of RAM.

1450
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,880
That's why you need a lot of RAM in an editing system.

1451
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,280
And so what started happening is when

1452
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,200
you had tens of hundreds of files open at once,

1453
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,640
you start running into low memory.

1454
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,960
OK, not a problem.

1455
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,160
That's why we have great memory management.

1456
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,040
And in fact, Lightworks handles this

1457
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,560
by constantly monitoring the system's memory usage.

1458
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,020
And then it automatically limits and ultimately empties

1459
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,560
its various caches when it notices

1460
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,560
the amount of free memory is starting to get low

1461
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,800
and staying low.

1462
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,960
This technique relies on being able to ask the operating

1463
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,000
system, ask the Linux kernel, to report how much memory is

1464
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,520
available in total and how much has been used

1465
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,840
and how much is available right now to use.

1466
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,400
Starting with Linux kernel 3.14, free memory

1467
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,880
is being reported entirely differently,

1468
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,340
differently enough that it causes Lightworks software

1469
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:38,920
to start believing that there is no free memory left at all

1470
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,200
when in fact there was.

1471
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,720
As a result, the memory monitoring code

1472
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,000
responded as it was designed to by ensuring

1473
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,680
that all the frames and file caches were completely empty

1474
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,960
all the time.

1475
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,700
So as you might imagine, that had

1476
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,660
a major detrimental performance effect on the Lightworks

1477
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,400
editor.

1478
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,520
Every time a frame or file was added to the cache,

1479
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,840
it was then having to be immediately purged.

1480
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,880
Well, that could happen 30 times a second, right?

1481
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,320
Or 60 times a second, depending on what you're editing.

1482
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,340
So it was forcing this constant recompressing decompressing

1483
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,080
of the media file every time you access that area of the file.

1484
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,500
So they immediately didn't leap to the idea

1485
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,120
that it was the kernel though, right?

1486
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,140
So tracking down the problem became kind of an endeavor,

1487
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,760
because it kind of seemed like the culprit would be probably

1488
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,060
a piece of their code that wasn't running properly

1489
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,900
anymore, rather than a piece of code in the Linux kernel that

1490
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,840
was different.

1491
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,400
That wasn't what they expected.

1492
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,140
Thankfully, they say once they did track it down to the way

1493
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,880
3.14 was reporting its memory usage,

1494
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,800
rectifying the issue was not a majorly time-consuming process.

1495
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,600
And it actually afforded them an opportunity

1496
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,400
to rewrite the code in such a way

1497
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,120
that it made it immune to further possible kernel changes

1498
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,480
like this in the future.

1499
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,640
So it sounds like maybe they weren't doing something

1500
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,480
quite the right way.

1501
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,680
But at the same time, it sounds like a pretty key piece

1502
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,000
of the Linux kernel kind of just changed right out

1503
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,960
from underneath them.

1504
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,600
You wouldn't think it would happen so suddenly like that.

1505
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,600
But I've seen, and this is over the course of many years,

1506
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,760
that sort of thing happen.

1507
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,560
And it's rare.

1508
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,920
But when it does, usually it's like a real punch to the face.

1509
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,280
And usually I see this with wireless devices.

1510
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,280
Every three or four years, they just

1511
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,120
do something stupid with the one device that you depend on.

1512
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,800
I've learned to have multiple devices.

1513
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,880
And to see that in something like software in this space

1514
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,600
to where it's like somebody could, as a professional,

1515
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,600
be relying on this application.

1516
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,240
Oh, hey, by the way, screw you.

1517
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,280
You're out of luck.

1518
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,200
Through no fault of anyone's, it still sucks.

1519
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,120
Derek Devlin, is it Lightworks' responsibility

1520
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,400
that their developers have an open dialogue

1521
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,080
and relationship with the kernel team?

1522
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,400
What are your thoughts?

1523
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,440
Definitely.

1524
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,440
One of the things Linux is always talking about

1525
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,440
is that they won't break user space.

1526
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,360
So unless people are saying, look,

1527
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,600
this will break user space for me, they won't know.

1528
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,720
So they will have to break user space.

1529
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,440
And sometimes it's inevitable.

1530
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,760
So in the overall, your algorithm

1531
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,280
is really bad if it relies on always one functionality,

1532
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,160
has no fallback of that functionality.

1533
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,560
So if I was doing a predictive algorithm,

1534
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,880
I need to make sure that my prediction works.

1535
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,480
So I have to put some heuristics that say, OK,

1536
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,640
this is changing too fast.

1537
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,640
I'm going to start using constants.

1538
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,920
And just be a performance hit that it's guaranteed.

1539
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,280
Because otherwise, the software becomes unreliable.

1540
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,760
That's kind of design.

1541
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,160
You make decisions.

1542
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,720
They made one that was bad.

1543
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,280
I think so.

1544
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,120
But kernel Linux isn't this is, but this problem

1545
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,000
has sort of already been solved by the marketplace in a sense.

1546
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,480
If you're a media production shop

1547
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,200
and you're working on Hollywood's next blockbuster,

1548
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,120
chances are you're probably not running

1549
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,360
Debian, Unstable, or Fedora, right?

1550
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:41,880
Right.

1551
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,760
And we're in this boat.

1552
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,360
We use Lightworks professionally.

1553
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,080
And this is the first I'm hearing about the problem.

1554
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,660
And probably the reason is because the production machine

1555
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:52,680
is still on 1204.

1556
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,400
Right.

1557
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,900
Yeah, wouldn't that be your best bet?

1558
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:55,640
And why not?

1559
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,480
Because the primary purpose of the machine

1560
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,820
is nothing to do with what the operating system can do.

1561
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,760
It's all about running that application.

1562
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,560
Well, yeah, exactly.

1563
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,160
For us, the machine boots up and Lightworks takes over.

1564
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,200
And if you've used Lightworks, then you

1565
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,000
know that Lightworks essentially behaves almost

1566
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,640
like an independent operating system, right?

1567
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,640
That's a monster.

1568
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,800
It essentially captures the screen and everything.

1569
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,280
You have essentially a little desktop to work on.

1570
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,240
So the operating system kind of fades to the background.

1571
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,240
Yeah.

1572
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,240
And it's exactly why we have, you know, obviously,

1573
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,740
the guy that's always talking about Arch and rolling releases.

1574
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:33,320
This is exactly the use case for a long-term stable distro

1575
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,520
right here in a nutshell.

1576
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,400
Because it isolates you from these kinds of things.

1577
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,280
Now, that said, I still elect for my systems to go rolling.

1578
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,700
Now, I'll be the first person to tell you, though,

1579
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,800
if our editing was done under Linux, which I wish it were,

1580
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,160
if it was, I think absolutely we'd probably be LTS.

1581
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,700
We'd probably be Ubuntu, because I

1582
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,840
think that's probably what the Lightworks guys are targeting.

1583
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,800
And that would be the end of it.

1584
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,120
And I would not probably want to upgrade from 12.04

1585
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,140
until I had to.

1586
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:02,640
Makes sense.

1587
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,680
Unless there was some kernel feature I had to have

1588
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,240
or something like that.

1589
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,520
But when it comes to the systems that I'm

1590
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,880
browsing the web and gaming on and show research,

1591
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,000
yeah, I want rolling.

1592
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,640
I think, I think that's, I don't know.

1593
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,520
Daredevil not, oh, go ahead, Matt.

1594
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,960
No, I was going to say, I think there's inherent logic to that.

1595
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,480
I mean, it's like, of course, I'm not using Lightworks

1596
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,320
on a regular basis.

1597
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,120
I use other applications for video editing

1598
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,680
because I'm much lower level stuff.

1599
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,500
But if I was to experience that, I

1600
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,040
think it would definitely kind of jolt my chair a little bit.

1601
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,620
And it would probably make me re-evaluate

1602
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,420
the distro I'm using almost instantly based

1603
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,640
on what you described.

1604
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,760
Oh, man, you know what?

1605
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,280
Wizard just totally made me reconsider my whole position.

1606
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,240
Go ahead.

1607
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,160
Yeah, so I can totally understand, because I

1608
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,320
do deal with this fairly often.

1609
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,000
I still deal with my high school sometimes.

1610
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,400
And the one thing that always changes is I'm updating FFmpeg.

1611
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,480
And FFmpeg moves so fast.

1612
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,120
And something small, they could say, oh, well,

1613
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,720
we just found out we've been wasting CPU cycles here.

1614
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,840
And there's a 10% increase in speed.

1615
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,720
And when you're trying to get something

1616
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,720
a quick, like I'm sure you do, Chris, then you're going to go

1617
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,480
and you're going to say, oh, geez, 10%,

1618
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,120
that's like another five minutes off my time.

1619
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,440
And I understand.

1620
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,300
In fact, that's one of the areas where the Mac is kind of handy

1621
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,560
in terms of media production is the user space remains

1622
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,760
fairly consistent.

1623
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,360
They trickle out updates to Final Cut.

1624
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,280
But Rekai, I believe, and I'm not totally positive about this,

1625
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,800
because I'm not really involved with that aspect of it,

1626
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,900
but I believe Rekai uses something called Brew, which

1627
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,760
is kind of like app.get for the Mac.

1628
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,400
And Brew just keeps FFmpeg up to date.

1629
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,240
So he's always got a fresh FFmpeg,

1630
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:45,520
but his editing tools remain fairly stale,

1631
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,960
or however you want to put it.

1632
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,600
That's a nice combo.

1633
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,240
Homebrew, but yeah, you're close.

1634
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:48,760
Homebrew?

1635
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,120
Yeah, OK, yeah, yeah.

1636
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,000
So there you go.

1637
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,680
And that's a nice system.

1638
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,280
And so there's ways you can do it on any box.

1639
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,200
What I used to do when I had an old Ubuntu machine that

1640
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,440
was my primary driver is I'd custom build FFmpeg.

1641
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,880
And that worked, too, so there's always an option.

1642
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,760
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

1643
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:06,480
All right.

1644
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,160
Well, people have asked if there's any updates

1645
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,520
to Ohio Linux Fest.

1646
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,000
I'll just mention right before we wrap up, it's still on.

1647
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,040
When is that?

1648
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,680
It's at the end of October.

1649
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,440
And so far, I believe the crew from Jupiter Broadcasting

1650
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,920
includes Mr. Kernel Linux and Mr. Q5.

1651
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,400
And Kernel Linux, you're getting down there Thursday night.

1652
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,240
Is that right?

1653
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,560
Well, I might actually be there Tuesday or Wednesday.

1654
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,600
What?

1655
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,320
Yeah, it's a long story.

1656
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,360
OK, OK, I feel bad because I'm not getting there till Friday.

1657
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,120
Now I kind of wish I was getting there on Thursday.

1658
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,680
But you know, it's kind of, we know, kids.

1659
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,400
Did you just say he should feel bad?

1660
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,520
Yeah, he did, he did, yeah.

1661
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,000
OK.

1662
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,120
So if you're going to be in the area on October 24

1663
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,600
to the 26th, Jupiter Broadcasting will be rocking.

1664
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,600
Kernel Linux will be there.

1665
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,680
Q5 will be there.

1666
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,280
Angela and I will be there.

1667
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,160
Blaster, of course.

1668
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,760
Anybody else in the Mumba room going to be at Ohio?

1669
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,880
That's it, right?

1670
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,600
That's just who is here.

1671
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,000
And Eric, you're going to be where and when

1672
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,720
if people want to see you.

1673
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,280
I am going to be at Seagull, which

1674
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,920
is the Seattle GNU Linux conference at Seattle Community

1675
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,160
College.

1676
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,400
Right, and not Seagull like the bird, right?

1677
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,520
How do you spell it?

1678
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,760
S-E-A-G-L. You can find out more information

1679
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,280
at Seagull, Seagull.org.

1680
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,320
OK, yeah, and that's going on at the same time

1681
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:29,200
right there in Seattle, October 24 and 25.

1682
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,080
And so you could go down there if you're in the area

1683
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,240
and say hi to Eric.

1684
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,160
And this is their second year?

1685
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,480
Yes, this is their second year.

1686
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,620
It's kind of interesting because they've

1687
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,600
got some big names like Karen Sandler is

1688
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,480
going to be doing the keynote.

1689
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,400
And there's quite a few people who will be there,

1690
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,280
such as Valerie Zimmerman of Kabuntu,

1691
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,760
as well as Albert Baca of KDE.

1692
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,160
So there's quite a few people.

1693
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,680
Also, Mark Terranova from the Fedora Project

1694
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,680
is rumored to be there.

1695
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,280
So there's going to be quite a few people.

1696
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,960
Oh, man, so we're going to have double-covered conference

1697
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,640
coverage at the same time.

1698
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,040
So while you're in Ohio, you're going to be in Seattle.

1699
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,200
And that's going to be, that's nuts.

1700
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,080
That's getting.

1701
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,600
My interview microphone just arrived in the mail,

1702
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,200
and I just did a quick test on it while we were on the air.

1703
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,840
I haven't tested the sound, but it's working pretty good.

1704
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,040
Is that a euphemism for something?

1705
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,320
I don't know what that is.

1706
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,160
Tested his mic?

1707
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,720
Yeah, he's testing his mic while on air.

1708
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,000
I'm not sure what he means by that.

1709
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,480
All right.

1710
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,600
Oh, in a separate system.

1711
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,080
I kept myself muted here.

1712
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,560
Oh, Wizard, you know about somebody

1713
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,160
who's visiting which one?

1714
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,440
So there's actually going to be another big one at Seneca

1715
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,320
College in Toronto.

1716
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,080
And anyway, it's going to be fairly big.

1717
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,440
There's going to be a Red Hat founder there,

1718
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,640
as well as a couple other pretty important people.

1719
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,320
In fact, I believe Mad Dog's going to be there, too.

1720
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,720
Yeah, this is the 23rd, I believe.

1721
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,080
And where again?

1722
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,960
This is at Seneca College in Toronto.

1723
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,600
Wow.

1724
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,100
Wow.

1725
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:57,000
Talk about a crazy great weekend and open source going-ons.

1726
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,320
And what's nuts about that is a couple of days

1727
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,560
after that MeetBSD down in California,

1728
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,840
Alan and Chris Moore will be down there held

1729
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,640
at the Western Digital headquarters put on by IX

1730
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,040
Systems, and they'll be doing live streaming from that.

1731
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:14,240
So I guess this must be fest season,

1732
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,160
and we're getting into it.

1733
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:16,840
Absolutely.

1734
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,880
I guess you got to get all out of the way

1735
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,040
before the holidays and before it gets too crappy outside.

1736
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,080
Yeah, no kidding.

1737
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:22,600
All right.

1738
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,840
Just quickly getting there.

1739
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,960
I think we're all wrapped up.

1740
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,760
I think we got everything I wanted to cover.

1741
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,960
One last just little plea for Linux Action Show is I'm,

1742
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,800
I got some in the queue right now,

1743
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,720
but I need more of your runs Linux.

1744
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,840
It could be just like you with a selfie in front of your Linux

1745
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,720
box, I guess.

1746
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,400
I don't know.

1747
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,560
It could be your own runs Linux.

1748
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,400
It could be something you find in the wild.

1749
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,080
Send it to linuxactionshow at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1750
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,640
Include a picture or a link to a YouTube video, if you would.

1751
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,920
And in the subject, put runs Linux.

1752
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,680
You can also use the contact form

1753
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,160
over at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact,

1754
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,800
and put runs Linux in that subject.

1755
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,960
And that's also where you'd go to give us any kind of feedback.

1756
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,160
We love reading your feedback.

1757
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,720
Every single episode of Linux Unplugged,

1758
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,080
it's a big part of our lug.

1759
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,920
If you can't make it to the Mumble Room, which

1760
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,920
is an open Mumble Room you can join for any episodes,

1761
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,440
our virtual lug, we'd love to hear your thoughts in email.

1762
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,400
Also, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1763
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,700
You can go there and get more show throughout the week

1764
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,500
and help us make the show a little bit better

1765
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,560
by commenting on stuff.

1766
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,160
I often look to that subreddit to see

1767
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,080
what you guys are talking about to see

1768
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,320
what might get some good conversation going in Linux

1769
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:22,820
Unplugged.

1770
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,520
So even just sharing your insights and your votes

1771
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,240
helps a lot.

1772
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,000
And of course, submitting stories and things like that.

1773
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,560
Matt, this weekend, if all goes as planned,

1774
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,960
if we get all of our ducks lined up,

1775
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,080
it's the big Ubuntu review, and it's

1776
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,840
going to be a blowout like nothing else,

1777
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,040
including Eric and I are going to be

1778
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,400
doing traveling and all kinds of things to make this happen.

1779
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,560
It's going to be a big one.

1780
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,280
So I'll see you on Sunday, OK?

1781
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,200
All right, see you then.

1782
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:45,720
All right, everyone.

1783
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,960
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux

1784
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:48,960
Unplugged.

1785
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,960
Be sure to join us every single Tuesday.

1786
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,920
And if we don't see you on Tuesday,

1787
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,620
hope to see you on Sunday for the big show.

1788
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,400
See you right back here next week.

1789
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:13,960
So until then, thanks for tuning in, and we'll see you next week.

1790
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:36,280
Just want to punch Comcast in the throat.

1791
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:36,780
That's all.

1792
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,960
I just want to punch him in the throat a little bit.

1793
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,440
Yeah, so Matt, if you don't have an Ubuntu 14.

1794
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,160
1 from me as well, if you don't have a 14.10 machine loaded up,

1795
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:45,760
get her going.

1796
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,120
We'll share our thoughts on Sunday's show and kick the tires.

1797
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,880
I got a rig that I've got it running on right now,

1798
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,880
and I'll tell everybody more about that on Sunday's show.

1799
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,440
I've got it running on a rig, not only Ubuntu, but Kubuntu

1800
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
and Ubuntu Mate.

1801
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,920
It's going to be a good one.

1802
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,360
So go ahead.

1803
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,720
JBtiles.com, that's all I was going to say, JBtiles.

1804
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,000
And I was thinking about putting Lubuntu with the LXQT

1805
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:11,500
on there.

1806
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,480
What about Lube?

1807
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,560
You pervert.

1808
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,240
What about Lube?

1809
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,640
Lubuntu?

1810
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,280
That sounds like the adult version.

1811
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,640
Lubuntu.

1812
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:20,600
Fish and chips.

1813
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,560
Exactly, Lubuntu.

1814
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,920
Yeah, I think that really exists.

1815
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,360
Unifying Linux software is not bad.

1816
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:25,880
That's good.

1817
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,480
I want to thank Dunder for Fish and Chips.

1818
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,600
He gave me the idea.

1819
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,840
Comcast Unplugged, no kidding.

1820
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,800
The master distribution.

1821
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,440
Systemd ain't so bad.

1822
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,400
JBtitles.com.

1823
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,560
Yes?

1824
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:43,440
Thank you for spending a lot of time on those core apps, those

1825
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,960
QML apps, because the guys worked really hard on that.

1826
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,920
And it's really nice for them to get a bit of exposure.

1827
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,680
I think it shows.

1828
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,880
Yeah, I thought it showed.

1829
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,080
And it's neat to see it.

1830
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,160
And I don't know how much we'll, since they're not really

1831
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,840
necessarily production ready, I don't

1832
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,680
think we'll spend too much time on them in the review.

1833
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,720
So it seemed like a good chance to give them an exposure

1834
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,680
without working them in to review themselves.

1835
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,960
Because I don't think they deserve being reviewed.

1836
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,400
No, they're not ready yet.

1837
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,720
And following on from last week's discussion,

1838
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,480
it was a nice bit of positivity.

1839
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,960
Yeah, that's true.

1840
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,800
Yeah, you bastards.

1841
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,680
Positive Ubuntu news.

1842
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,040
Yay.

1843
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,080
All right, are we going to get a title out of this?

1844
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,800
Not just Ubuntu, but generally.

1845
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,720
Probably not.

1846
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,440
Well, we've got unifying Linux software at the top.

1847
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,080
It's interesting.

1848
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,520
So it was a holiday here in the States Monday.

1849
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,440
And it's the Apple event on Thursdays.

1850
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,000
And I think having a holiday at the beginning of the week

1851
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,440
and an Apple event at the end of the week, the news cycle

1852
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,520
just goes like a dead fish.

1853
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,000
Like it's just dead.

1854
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Because A, people weren't working

1855
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,160
at the beginning of the week.

1856
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,240
And B, nobody wants anything they announced

1857
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,240
to be completely clobbered up by whatever

1858
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,680
Apple craps out on Thursday.

1859
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,000
So nothing's going on this week.

1860
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,960
It's Android L as well on Thursday.

1861
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,480
Yeah, I actually thought it was tomorrow.

1862
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,720
And it's final release for Ubuntu 14.10 as well.

1863
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,680
Final release candidate.

1864
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,800
Yeah, which obviously eclipses anything

1865
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,240
Apple or Google do.

1866
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:05,800
That's right.

1867
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,280
That's right.

1868
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,440
It's all anyone's going to be talking about.

1869
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,000
Yeah.

1870
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,200
Yeah, it's pretty speak.

1871
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:11,880
Yeah.

1872
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,800
Speaking of both Apple and Lightworks,

1873
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,840
you know what you should do, Chris?

1874
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,640
You should install Lightworks on your beloved Mac.

1875
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,440
And then you could start editing in Lightworks.

1876
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,600
And then maybe at some point down the future,

1877
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,800
I could pry you privately.

1878
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,440
I love your underhanded, backhanded compliments.

1879
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,520
I have it right now.

1880
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,800
I have one of my bonobes right now, actually.

1881
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,160
Oh, yeah?

1882
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,360
You haven't done anything on it yet?

1883
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,880
I edited a couple of our OSCON.

1884
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,360
Actually, I edited those a while ago.

1885
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,880
But yeah, I edited a couple of our OSCON videos.

1886
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,320
Oh, really?

1887
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:41,320
Yeah.

1888
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:41,840
OK.

1889
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,480
Maybe I need to give you more credit.

1890
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,960
I think Noah forgot something.

1891
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,960
I think you should do is put Lightworks on Mac

1892
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,960
and then play it at HTML5.

1893
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:49,440
Nice.

1894
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,720
Well, OK.

1895
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:56,080
I just clearly like the way I convert people to Linux

1896
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,440
is I get them using their software

1897
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,240
that they're comfortable with on the platform

1898
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,040
or the software on the platform.

1899
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,480
So I figure I can baby step Chris away from his Mac and trash.

1900
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,320
You should, Noah, you should listen to this week's Coda Radio

1901
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,960
because Dominic was on me the whole time about that.

1902
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,120
And here's the thing is I think one thing to kind of remember

1903
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,720
is I don't edit anymore.

1904
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,240
So it's kind of a thing.

1905
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:21,360
Yeah, so I mean, for me, that's why I can use Lightworks now

1906
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,240
because the editing I do is much.

1907
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,120
So you don't use a Mac anymore.

1908
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,480
You pay someone else to use a Mac for you.

1909
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,360
Yes.

1910
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:28,960
Yes.

1911
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:29,480
Yes.

1912
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,440
But you know what?

1913
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,240
Here's the thing.

1914
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,880
He bought the Mac and set it in front of him

1915
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,400
and said, here's the editing rig you're going to use.

1916
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,200
Well, yeah.

1917
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:42,520
I mean, you know, we've had this conversation a few times.

1918
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:46,800
I will stand by the claim that the tools are not just like,

1919
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,880
boy, it's just a lot easier.

1920
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,800
No, it's more like the tools are like.

1921
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,800
Yeah, Chris, you should stop using Skype as well.

1922
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,840
Years ahead.

1923
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,600
Here's the thing.

1924
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,280
I don't have a link to stand on when

1925
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,440
it comes to live production.

1926
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,600
As far as editing goes, I think if you

1927
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,640
are willing to change your workflow a little bit,

1928
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,180
you could get away with doing it.

1929
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:31,840
Probably, probably.
