WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
Before we start the show, Brent, I wanted to share this story with you.

00:02.700 --> 00:06.540
It's not Linux related, but it's it raises so many questions.

00:06.540 --> 00:10.180
And it is kind of related to our whole PeerTube conversation we had last week

00:10.440 --> 00:11.880
and we'll be having this week.

00:11.880 --> 00:15.140
I don't know if you saw this, but Sony Pictures

00:15.580 --> 00:21.280
accidentally uploaded an entire movie to YouTube instead of the trailer.

00:21.520 --> 00:26.660
Instead of the trailer, they uploaded the whole one hour and 29 minute file.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.020
I know what you're thinking. How did this happen? Right.

00:29.020 --> 00:33.000
It starts with Kai the Killer, but then at first in the description,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.840
they say coming to VHS or DVD or something like that, probably not VHS.

00:37.100 --> 00:40.040
But then later in a press release, they say coming to theaters.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.840
And you got to wonder.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.880
Was this large movie file just in the same folder as the trailer?

00:48.220 --> 00:53.420
Was this some rogue intern who has as equal access to trailers

00:53.420 --> 00:55.880
as the final movie?

00:55.880 --> 00:58.860
Did they not notice how long it took to upload?

00:59.260 --> 01:02.060
Why haven't they replaced it with a trailer yet?

01:02.320 --> 01:05.300
This is so weird.

01:05.560 --> 01:10.500
And why even release it at all on the US channel if it's not a US movie?

01:10.500 --> 01:12.940
The entire thing is completely bizarre.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.180
It's some sort of Sony conspiracy.

01:15.180 --> 01:17.080
Maybe they've been hacked by North Korea again.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.380
We got to look into it, Brent.

01:18.380 --> 01:20.280
So do you think they need PeerTube?

01:20.280 --> 01:22.320
Yeah, I think they definitely need PeerTube.

01:22.320 --> 01:27.700
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 256, for July 3rd, 2018.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.780
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

01:41.780 --> 01:45.880
that's still trying to get that whole Linux powered fireworks display figured out.

01:45.880 --> 01:46.880
My name is Chris.

01:46.880 --> 01:47.880
And my name is Brent.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.160
Hello, Brent. Good to chat with you again.

01:50.160 --> 01:53.960
Mr. Payne is out one more week, and I confirmed it.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.460
He is being a suave world traveler.

01:56.460 --> 01:57.460
Can't even stand it.

01:57.460 --> 02:01.700
But coming up on this week's episode, we're going to get into that big sale of SUSE.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.460
There's huge news for you elementary OS users.

02:04.460 --> 02:07.300
And then we'll break down a whole bunch of community news

02:07.300 --> 02:12.400
from Switch hack stories to Linux Mint 19 and much, much more.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.440
And then towards the end of this show,

02:15.440 --> 02:20.280
we'll settle the whole mystery around true OS and Project Triton

02:20.280 --> 02:24.320
and what's happening with FreeBSD's user first desktop.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.520
And then I've got some great news to share.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.960
Last week, I put out the call to help set up a PeerTube instance

02:30.960 --> 02:32.960
for Jupyter broadcasting.

02:32.960 --> 02:37.460
Within a few days, we got not only one, but two,

02:37.460 --> 02:41.480
one for the network and one for the community setup rocking.

02:41.480 --> 02:45.840
And we've got tons of thoughts about what could actually be

02:45.840 --> 02:49.080
the first serious YouTube competitor.

02:49.080 --> 02:53.380
An open source solution powered by BitTorrent on the back end.

02:53.380 --> 02:54.380
And we've tried it out.

02:54.380 --> 02:55.620
We've kicked the tires.

02:55.620 --> 02:58.720
We've put some Jupyter broadcasting content up on there.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.360
And man, do I have some thoughts about PeerTube.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.000
So that'll be the highlights of what we're getting today.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.540
But before we go any further, let's bring in the essentials of today's episode.

03:08.540 --> 03:09.540
And that is our Mumble Room.

03:09.540 --> 03:10.540
Time appropriate greeting.

03:10.540 --> 03:11.540
Virtual log.

03:11.540 --> 03:12.540
Hello.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.540
Hello.

03:13.540 --> 03:14.540
Hello.

03:14.540 --> 03:15.540
Happy Independence Day.

03:15.540 --> 03:16.540
Hey.

03:16.540 --> 03:17.540
Yeah.

03:17.540 --> 03:18.540
Happy America's birthday, everybody.

03:18.540 --> 03:21.540
And Canada just celebrated their Independence Day.

03:21.540 --> 03:24.540
So belated Independence Day to you too, Brent, up there in the Canadiens.

03:24.540 --> 03:25.540
Thank you.

03:25.540 --> 03:26.540
You're welcome, sir.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.560
So let's start with a little breaking news this week on the program.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.560
We don't get to do this too often because, you know,

03:31.560 --> 03:33.560
we've got the whole Linux action news program these days.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.560
But right here.

03:34.560 --> 03:37.560
This is CNN breaking news.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.560
A little breaking news just after we wrapped up land this week.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.560
Go figure.

03:41.560 --> 03:48.560
Seuss has been sold again, and this time for a pretty penny, $2.5 billion.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.560
Now, this isn't the first time Seuss has been passed around.

03:52.560 --> 03:55.560
And it's a pretty substantial company at this point.

03:55.560 --> 04:00.560
Over 14,000 employees all over the globe with, at least according to its floss,

04:00.560 --> 04:08.560
a sales range of $320 million in the months ending October 2017.

04:08.560 --> 04:14.560
And it appears that they got a pretty healthy profit for this sale.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.560
I think they went for a pretty good chunk of change this time.

04:17.560 --> 04:23.560
It ended up being like 26.7 times the adjusted operating profit of the Seuss software unit.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.560
That's a pretty good deal that they got.

04:26.560 --> 04:34.560
Now, you may recall in 2003, US-based software company Novell acquired Seuss for $210 million.

04:34.560 --> 04:41.560
So the fact that they went this time for $2.5 billion when you consider in 2003,

04:41.560 --> 04:44.560
they were going for $200 million, that's a pretty big difference.

04:44.560 --> 04:49.560
And then in 2010, you may require that Novell was acquired for $2.2 billion

04:49.560 --> 04:52.560
by another US-based company, the AttachMate Group.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.560
The AttachMate Group at that time was backed by Microsoft,

04:55.560 --> 05:00.560
and Microsoft got like 800 of Novell's patents, which is really what they wanted,

05:00.560 --> 05:04.560
which is reminiscent of the good old patent wars that were now thankfully mostly passed,

05:04.560 --> 05:06.560
or have at least normalized.

05:06.560 --> 05:15.560
And then in 2014, AttachMate was merged into the British software company Microfocus for $1.2 billion.

05:15.560 --> 05:23.560
And then this week, Microfocus sold the Seuss software business to a company called EQT for $2.5 billion.

05:23.560 --> 05:26.560
You know, EQT is like an investment firm.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.560
It's not the oil company, it's an investment firm.

05:29.560 --> 05:36.560
And the general consensus here is that this is a better sponsor, a better home for Seuss.

05:36.560 --> 05:44.560
Microfocus had shifted gears in the last years and was more of a milk a company until it's worth nothing kind of model.

05:44.560 --> 05:52.560
And whereas EQT has made some big promises about potentially giving Seuss a supercharge

05:52.560 --> 06:01.560
with other acquisitions and resources, so it seems to be a pretty good turn of events for the Seuss company.

06:01.560 --> 06:08.560
Now, the OpenSeuss project is going above and beyond to make sure you don't worry about the future of OpenSeuss.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.560
They really want you to stay calm.

06:10.560 --> 06:15.560
In fact, in Richard's and others' frantic attempt to make sure everybody stays calm,

06:15.560 --> 06:19.560
they almost come across as that meme with the guy in the middle of a fire stand there saying,

06:19.560 --> 06:22.560
everything's fine, everything's fine here.

06:22.560 --> 06:26.560
But if you think about it, this is good news for OpenSeuss.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.560
Because OpenSeuss' sponsor is essentially Seuss.

06:29.560 --> 06:35.560
And now Seuss' sponsor is EQT instead of Microfocus.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.560
It's a huge story that everybody's talking about.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.560
It's getting tweeted constantly right now.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.560
It's all over all the different outlets.

06:42.560 --> 06:49.560
Did you have any initial impressions, Brent, when you saw this big sale, $2.5 billion for Seuss?

06:49.560 --> 06:51.560
I was a little shocked at the dollar amount.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.560
I mean, I'm no expert in valuing this kind of stuff.

06:55.560 --> 06:59.560
But I thought, geez, this feels good for OpenSeuss, doesn't it?

06:59.560 --> 07:03.560
Yeah, it does too because it's not even, I mean, I apologize for framing it this way,

07:03.560 --> 07:08.560
but it's not even like OpenSeuss' largest success story, right?

07:08.560 --> 07:12.560
I mean, that you might go more towards Red Hat.

07:12.560 --> 07:16.560
So this is a pretty good amount for Seuss.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.560
In fact, just another data point.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.560
Again, I think it's a great distribution.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.560
Used to use Sless in production for years.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.560
Lots of our audience uses it.

07:25.560 --> 07:30.560
But probably one of the top comments I saw in non-Linux forums like Hacker News

07:30.560 --> 07:33.560
and other outlets where people are aware of these things but they don't,

07:33.560 --> 07:35.560
maybe they're daily drivers.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.560
One of the most common questions I saw is who's using Seuss?

07:38.560 --> 07:40.560
Who's still using Seuss?

07:40.560 --> 07:41.560
Who uses Seuss?

07:41.560 --> 07:43.560
Where is Seuss used?

07:43.560 --> 07:44.560
I saw a lot of that.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.560
A lot of people trying to wrap their heads around what Seuss is still doing.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.560
How is it valuable?

07:49.560 --> 07:52.560
Where does it still fit in the overall ecosystem?

07:52.560 --> 07:57.560
Because everybody's so focused on cloud and containers and VPSs.

07:57.560 --> 08:01.560
And Seuss is over here going, oh, we could do Kubernetes.

08:01.560 --> 08:06.560
Hey, guys, we could do Kubernetes.

08:06.560 --> 08:11.560
And so it's maybe going to be a good thing for them if EQT is willing to invest

08:11.560 --> 08:14.560
in some other acquisitions, maybe hire some additional people,

08:14.560 --> 08:16.560
or at least give them the funding to do so.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.560
Who knows?

08:17.560 --> 08:18.560
It's early days.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.560
But it is an interesting change.

08:20.560 --> 08:24.560
And it does kind of remind us, and I think, JJ, you might agree,

08:24.560 --> 08:27.560
that there's more than just a Seuss or I'm sorry,

08:27.560 --> 08:30.560
there's more than just an Ubuntu Red Hat dynamic out there.

08:30.560 --> 08:31.560
Yeah.

08:31.560 --> 08:35.560
And this sort of begs the question, what sort of assets does Seuss have

08:35.560 --> 08:39.560
compared to canonicals Ubuntu and a bad large organization?

08:39.560 --> 08:43.560
Because me as a ultra, ultra beginner,

08:43.560 --> 08:47.560
even though I'm still a dual booter in my progress,

08:47.560 --> 08:52.560
what sort of value proposition does Seuss have versus canonical?

08:52.560 --> 08:55.560
I think it depends on the perspective in which you take.

08:55.560 --> 08:59.560
It's a hard question for me to give you a good answer for other than

08:59.560 --> 09:02.560
if you have a lot of momentum in certain industries,

09:02.560 --> 09:06.560
Seuss seems to be a good role or a good fit there.

09:06.560 --> 09:10.560
I don't particularly, like if you were going to hire me to come in

09:10.560 --> 09:13.560
and help you build an infrastructure based on Linux,

09:13.560 --> 09:16.560
Seuss would not be on my recommendation list.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.560
Just from a, and this is probably a states heavy perspective.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.560
I mean, of course, what else do I have?

09:22.560 --> 09:28.560
But just from a maintainability and sustainability standpoint,

09:28.560 --> 09:32.560
I would want to deploy something that was based on RHEL or Ubuntu or Debian.

09:32.560 --> 09:37.560
So that way, once I left, they could bring in talent that would know

09:37.560 --> 09:40.560
what the hell they were even looking at or they could find documentation

09:40.560 --> 09:43.560
or they could go hire a contractor.

09:43.560 --> 09:47.560
And I feel like Seuss, at least in the States, again,

09:47.560 --> 09:52.560
is esoteric enough that if you came in cold to an environment

09:52.560 --> 09:55.560
and it was running Seuss, that would be an unusual thing.

09:55.560 --> 09:59.560
And so I don't have a great answer for you other than, well,

09:59.560 --> 10:02.560
there are some places that have momentum in that direction

10:02.560 --> 10:10.560
and it's a pretty sound technical distribution, so people have chosen it.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.560
I know this is going to sound crazy to a lot of you,

10:12.560 --> 10:14.560
and I mean no offense to the Seuss people.

10:14.560 --> 10:19.560
I would be more inclined to run Arch before I would be inclined to run Seuss,

10:19.560 --> 10:22.560
simply because if I'm not going for Ubuntu or RHEL,

10:22.560 --> 10:25.560
which are going to have the widest industry and commercial support,

10:25.560 --> 10:30.560
then I'm likely going for software availability, which is the AUR.

10:30.560 --> 10:35.560
But, you know, they got 26.7 times their adjusted operating profit,

10:35.560 --> 10:37.560
so that seems like a pretty good sale.

10:37.560 --> 10:41.560
And from what I understood from when I was like researching Linux

10:41.560 --> 10:44.560
in my younger years, I remember there was this website

10:44.560 --> 10:47.560
where you could actually make your own custom version of Seuss.

10:47.560 --> 10:48.560
Oh, yeah.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.560
I'm not even sure what the name of the website is,

10:50.560 --> 10:52.560
but if anybody can remember and put it in the chat room,

10:52.560 --> 10:53.560
I'd really appreciate it.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.560
Yeah, fortunately they've spun that down.

10:56.560 --> 11:01.560
So, yeah, that recently was spun down earlier this year.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.560
That was a neat feature of it.

11:03.560 --> 11:07.560
So let's shift gears and let's talk about the desktop side of things.

11:07.560 --> 11:13.560
Our friends over at elementary have a huge bit of news today.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.560
The Juno Beta 1, remember this is pre-release software,

11:16.560 --> 11:21.560
but the Beta 1 of Juno, which is based on 1804, is out,

11:21.560 --> 11:23.560
and Mr. Daniel Foray is here to tell us about it.

11:23.560 --> 11:27.560
Dan, first of all, congratulations on the big release.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.560
I think this is huge for you guys.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.560
Thanks. I'm super-duper excited about it.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.560
Yeah, it was sort of in the works for a while, rumor has it.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.560
Maybe this has been brewing for a few months.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.560
And it's funny, now that you've finally landed the Beta,

11:40.560 --> 11:44.560
and I totally understand why, but the Beta post about the new release

11:44.560 --> 11:47.560
doesn't really talk about a lot of the new features,

11:47.560 --> 11:52.560
because you guys have been, in a way, so forward with some of those features are,

11:52.560 --> 11:53.560
what they already are.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.560
But maybe just off the top of your head,

11:55.560 --> 11:58.560
what are a couple of the big things that are new in Juno

11:58.560 --> 12:00.560
and especially in the areas you guys want testing?

12:00.560 --> 12:05.560
Sure. I mean, there's so much new in Juno, right?

12:05.560 --> 12:09.560
But the kind of overarching themes that we've been working on

12:09.560 --> 12:13.560
are productivity features, refinement, and improving our developer platform.

12:13.560 --> 12:18.560
So we've got tons of improvements throughout all the apps, really.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.560
We've got some big changes to the way payments work in App Center,

12:21.560 --> 12:23.560
which we talked about in a previous show.

12:23.560 --> 12:28.560
We have the new elementary code, which replaces Scratch,

12:28.560 --> 12:32.560
which is a huge update and redesign and just huge feature dump

12:32.560 --> 12:35.560
into what used to be just a plain text editor.

12:35.560 --> 12:36.560
It's so good.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.560
We've got the new shortcut overlay.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.560
We've got Night Light.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.560
We have new style schemes in Terminal.

12:43.560 --> 12:47.560
We have a lot of changes to the way shortcuts,

12:47.560 --> 12:49.560
keyboard shortcuts are handled and configured.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.560
We have improvements to the camera app,

12:52.560 --> 12:55.560
the latest version of Epiphany with Firefox sync.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.560
It just goes on.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.560
Full color emoji.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.560
There you go.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.560
There's the big one.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.560
Full color emoji.

13:03.560 --> 13:04.560
All right.

13:04.560 --> 13:08.560
So you guys always are very careful with these releases,

13:08.560 --> 13:10.560
but I've been using it for a few days.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.560
And I got to say, it seems super solid to me.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.560
And it also is a hard thing to judge.

13:15.560 --> 13:19.560
And it's a bit of your own perception.

13:19.560 --> 13:24.560
But to me, this feels like the fastest Linux desktop I've ever used.

13:24.560 --> 13:30.560
Like for example, Epiphany opens up faster than it has any right to open ever.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.560
And this is on the Librem 15.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.560
I've tried out just about every distro under the sun on this thing.

13:34.560 --> 13:38.560
I'm comparing a lot of fresh installs against this install.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.560
So it's not like it's just because it's a new install.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.560
I'm always doing new installs on this thing.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.560
Epiphany opens up super fast.

13:45.560 --> 13:49.560
The system settings opens up before even one bounce is done in my dock.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.560
Things just flies up.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.560
Everything flies.

13:53.560 --> 13:58.560
Is there some secret performance tweak that you guys have learned?

13:58.560 --> 14:00.560
And what do you attribute this to?

14:00.560 --> 14:04.560
Because it's notably faster than almost every other desktop I use.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.560
I mean, we've been doing a ton of work under the hood.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.560
And we've been kind of blogging about some things that we've been doing.

14:10.560 --> 14:14.560
And there's been a huge focus on just massive amounts of code cleaning.

14:14.560 --> 14:22.560
There's like something that I've personally been working on for the past few months is just going through the music app.

14:22.560 --> 14:28.560
And I think that we've, without removing any features, it does all the same things that it did before.

14:28.560 --> 14:32.560
But since that time, we've removed like 20,000 lines of code.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.560
Well, it shows. It shows.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.560
And everything looks a little crisper.

14:36.560 --> 14:40.560
I swear, maybe it's just new eyes, but the icons look a bit better.

14:40.560 --> 14:45.560
Even like the little loading swirl thing in the app center to me, I swear it looks smoother.

14:45.560 --> 14:49.560
There must have been a lot of little tweaks to a lot of the art stuff too.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.560
Yeah, definitely.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.560
We have a new color palette that we've been working with.

14:53.560 --> 15:01.560
We've kind of gone through and tried to tidy up some places where styles had diverged between icon families like MIME types, for example.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.560
The file type icons should all look a little more similar.

15:04.560 --> 15:11.560
We also benefit from a lot of work that's been done from GTK 318 to now we're shipping 322.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.560
Ah, okay. Yeah, it pays off.

15:14.560 --> 15:20.560
And to shift gears a bit, I think my new favorite feature so far, I mean, I kind of like each day I've had a new pet feature.

15:20.560 --> 15:26.560
But my favorite one over the weekend was the super slick integration of Night Light.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.560
I love the UI to set it up. It was right where I expected it to be.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.560
It just has been perfect.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.560
Night Light is a great feature.

15:34.560 --> 15:39.560
Does that come too as part of the later version of GTK or is that something you guys wrote from scratch?

15:39.560 --> 15:47.560
The under the hood part that talks to the window manager and changes the color profiles is part of the GNOME settings daemon.

15:47.560 --> 15:55.560
But all the UI stuff, the indicator in the panel and in the system settings and all that, those are all our applications.

15:55.560 --> 16:03.560
I also appreciate and this isn't I don't think new to Juno, but I just appreciated when I was going through the app center to do updates.

16:03.560 --> 16:11.560
There's little annotations in there about like what the actual changes in in user readable speak.

16:11.560 --> 16:17.560
So like there was an update to the file manager that adjusted the way it displayed 12 hour and 24 hour times.

16:17.560 --> 16:24.560
And it's I guess I just appreciate that because, you know, you visualize this, dear audience, you're looking at an app center screen full of updates.

16:24.560 --> 16:33.560
And next to it are little annotations about the actual things that are going to change in your software instead of like updated because of CVE 2018 1605.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.560
It's fixed the way 24 hour time is rendered and things like that.

16:37.560 --> 16:39.560
So there's small touches in there.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.560
I like but let's talk about app center.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.560
What's the state of app center right now in the Juno beta?

16:43.560 --> 16:44.560
How is that all coming together?

16:44.560 --> 16:46.560
Because there's been a lot of work there this cycle.

16:46.560 --> 16:53.560
One thing that people will notice when they download the beta because they didn't ring the blog post is that app center is pretty much empty.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.560
There's like four apps in there right now.

16:55.560 --> 17:05.560
And that is because we are moving to a completely new release from the old Xenial base to the new bionic base.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.560
And so the repo has to get filled up again.

17:08.560 --> 17:17.560
So that's one of the major purposes of releasing the beta is so that our third party developer community can come in and they can update their apps and then publish them.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.560
That makes sense.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.560
Yeah, that definitely makes sense.

17:20.560 --> 17:26.560
So the beta ISO is out right now, but maybe not at daily driver status.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.560
What's your opinion on that?

17:27.560 --> 17:30.560
Not necessarily the official word, but what's what's your opinion?

17:30.560 --> 17:35.560
I haven't found it to be too too bad for a daily driver, but I got the vibe from the blog post.

17:35.560 --> 17:40.560
It's kind of like, don't really run this unless you really want to help us and are willing to submit some bugs.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.560
Yeah, we definitely don't recommend it as a daily driver.

17:43.560 --> 17:48.560
Like this is this release is totally meant for developers to be run on non-production machines.

17:48.560 --> 18:00.560
And something that I think is really important mentioning that a lot of people expect and ask about is if they just installed the beta and keep hitting update after the stable release comes out.

18:00.560 --> 18:18.560
Won't they have that release? And the answer is probably not. There's oftentimes things that we find out in terms of fixing bugs that can't be fixed through an update that they're like considered part of user settings and they won't be overwritten when a new package comes down.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.560
Sure. Yeah, it makes sense.

18:20.560 --> 18:24.560
So definitely this is a release that you shouldn't expect to keep.

18:24.560 --> 18:29.560
You should expect to blow it away and replace it with a stable install when that comes out.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.560
I also like the fancy report a problem.

18:32.560 --> 18:38.560
You go to system settings about and then I guess there's a way I haven't tried this yet because I actually haven't had a need to.

18:38.560 --> 18:42.560
But I understand there is a way to actually maybe submit an issue from within system settings.

18:42.560 --> 18:56.560
Yeah. So what we did there is that previously we used to host all our code on Launchpad and we just kind of had a button in about and you could click it and it would open a big page on Launchpad that had like a list of all these projects.

18:56.560 --> 19:00.560
Then it was like try to find the one, you know, that you wanted to report against.

19:00.560 --> 19:09.560
But what we did in this release now that we're all over on GitHub is we've built out a little dialog and kind of divided it up into categories.

19:09.560 --> 19:13.560
And we tried to display everything in like human readable terms.

19:13.560 --> 19:27.560
So when you want to report a bug against the repository Gala, which is kind of like our window manager, you would open up this report a problem dialog and you'd see that there is a category that's desktop components.

19:27.560 --> 19:33.560
And then you can report an issue with notifications or multitasking or window management.

19:33.560 --> 19:39.560
So we try to like break it down as like a feature level, something that you can understand without knowing code names.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.560
And then we'll link you to the correct repository.

19:42.560 --> 19:50.560
OK, now I think I recall, too, there's some super sweet improvements to notifications in this release, especially for those of us that are stuck using electron apps.

19:50.560 --> 19:59.560
Remind me about that. So we did some work a while ago and submitting some patches upstream into electron, which added a bit about it on the show, I think.

19:59.560 --> 20:07.560
Yeah. And I'm not sure what the timeline is for third party app developers who are writing electron apps to be able to take advantage of those patches.

20:07.560 --> 20:20.560
But that was one of the big changes that's coming in this release is that in notification center, we no longer try to guess where an application is coming, sending notifications from.

20:20.560 --> 20:26.560
And we now expect it to report its ID. So those should be much more accurate.

20:26.560 --> 20:31.560
But it does require that developers are correctly reporting the idea of their application in their notifications.

20:31.560 --> 20:43.560
So that seems like an area that could potentially need some testing in this beta cycle. Any other kind of any other kind of like surface level things like, you know, custom CSS, things like that that need to be tested in this cycle?

20:43.560 --> 20:51.560
Yeah. For developers updating their applications, there's been tons of changes in GTK Plus and especially with GTK CSS.

20:51.560 --> 20:56.560
So if you have custom styling in your app, you should definitely make sure that that still looks as intended.

20:56.560 --> 21:05.560
And we're going to have a follow up blog post pretty soon talking about all the differences between the way apps were built for Loki and the way they're built for Juno now and how to upgrade smoothly.

21:05.560 --> 21:11.560
Smart. OK, so I just let's shift gears for a second. And I want to just talk about the base.

21:11.560 --> 21:21.560
And I know this isn't unique to Juno necessarily, but so when Juno ships ish, we may have from canonical eighteen oh four dot one out.

21:21.560 --> 21:30.560
How does that work? Because I assume Juno is based on stock eighteen oh four. Will there then be, you know, a few weeks, a few months go by and then a big update?

21:30.560 --> 21:35.560
Is it is it going to ship with dot one if that's out by then? Like, how does that aspect of this work?

21:35.560 --> 21:49.560
So when Ubuntu rolls out these point releases, we try to build a new image based on that as soon as possible because we want to make sure that when people are downloading from our website that they're getting the latest hardware enablement stack

21:49.560 --> 21:59.560
and making sure that we have regular security updates or pre-installed things like that so that you can have a download image that doesn't have a bunch of out of the box updates.

21:59.560 --> 22:06.560
So we'll definitely be tracking that. But these days, the long term hardware stack is a rolling release.

22:06.560 --> 22:16.560
So if you install when Juno first comes out, then you can expect that your hardware enablement will continually upgrade throughout the lifecycle of the operating system.

22:16.560 --> 22:23.560
I love it. That's a great answer. That's awesome. Wow. This is a big moment just because we've been talking about this for quite a while.

22:23.560 --> 22:28.560
So is there anything else like at this point in time we should mention today's like release day for this?

22:28.560 --> 22:31.560
So I'm sure it's probably like it's just totally scattered in your head.

22:31.560 --> 22:37.560
But is there any other like noise that you want to or anything, any signal you want to get above the noise before we move on?

22:37.560 --> 22:47.560
Yeah, definitely. The major things for the beta is we want to make sure that third party developers know that this is like the best time for them to update their applications.

22:47.560 --> 22:56.560
And we want to help them with that. So if they need help, they can go to jump into our community slack, which I believe we've linked from the release blog post.

22:56.560 --> 23:02.560
Also, this is a great time to get involved with developing the actual system itself, submitting patches and things like that.

23:02.560 --> 23:09.560
So you can go to elementary.io forward slash get dash involved to do that and also translators.

23:09.560 --> 23:15.560
So we need help with translations. We've just declared a string freeze. So none of the strings are going to change out from underneath you.

23:15.560 --> 23:20.560
And we've also update updated to the newest web late instance.

23:20.560 --> 23:26.560
So our translation tools are all up to date. And so we're we're ready to help you localize elementary OS.

23:26.560 --> 23:34.560
This is going to be kind of the first big release since the App Center released and all of these native apps were created.

23:34.560 --> 23:40.560
And now it's a bit of a test to see if developers keep up. Are you concerned at all?

23:40.560 --> 23:43.560
Do you feel like you can build momentum there pretty successfully?

23:43.560 --> 23:48.560
I'm definitely interested to see if there's like any kind of leg or whatever. What would that be?

23:48.560 --> 23:59.560
Like an attrition or, you know, right. But so far, you know, just on day one, I'm refreshing our developer page and I already see him ticking in.

23:59.560 --> 24:06.560
So I'm pretty excited to see, you know, how fast that goes up and seeing if we can get back up to 100 relatively soon.

24:06.560 --> 24:12.560
Yeah. Well, congratulations. We'll have a link to the post with all the details about Juno's first beta,

24:12.560 --> 24:21.560
including their handy how to help us fix problems guide, which I think is it is probably a must read before you submit a bug.

24:21.560 --> 24:28.560
It's it's exciting. I've been enjoying the beta and I can't wait for the final release dance to keep us updated on how it goes.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.560
OK, will do. All right, sir. Thank you, sir. Thanks for coming on and sharing that. That looks great.

24:32.560 --> 24:37.560
Very excited. I can't wait. This is going to be the one I've got to I got to I got to update the Sun's computer to this.

24:37.560 --> 24:47.560
This is this is so far been just a great beta. OK, so I want to update everybody on the state of Linux on the Nintendo switch.

24:47.560 --> 24:51.560
This is one of the coolest things. Dan, you've got a Nintendo switch because I've seen you play it.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.560
I don't know if you've tried. Have you tried this at all?

24:53.560 --> 25:01.560
This hack for the Nintendo switch where you put in like one of these manufactured little jumpers and you put that in the right card slot

25:01.560 --> 25:06.560
and then you can over time get Linux on there, get custom ROMs. Have you tried any of this with your switch, Dan?

25:06.560 --> 25:15.560
I haven't tried it, but I am super curious because I would love to be able to sideload some of my totally legit backup copies of games.

25:15.560 --> 25:21.560
Absolutely. Especially the retro ones that I've had for ages now and all of that. I would love to get that on there.

25:21.560 --> 25:28.560
And you got to figure eventually Nintendo is going to make some sort of physical fix for this hack.

25:28.560 --> 25:35.560
Now, we covered this before on the show. We also covered in technical details how the hack actually works on the tech snap program.

25:35.560 --> 25:40.560
But let's do a little bit of an update. First of all, as you probably already assumed, yeah, they got Arch running on it.

25:40.560 --> 25:52.560
Arch Linux is running on the Nintendo switch. But a bigger deal now is it appears that hackers have tracked down the cause of a rather nasty battery issue

25:52.560 --> 26:02.560
under Linux on the switch. And it was actually a pretty simple fix. All they had to do was change a value set by Linux for a certain register status

26:02.560 --> 26:10.560
to the same value that the switch OS is setting things. In other words, it was all on software. And now that they've made this change,

26:10.560 --> 26:16.560
things such as hardware acceleration for the GameCube emulators will now become a reality.

26:16.560 --> 26:25.560
So we will have good battery life under Linux and old game emulators that have hardware acceleration. It's happening pretty fast.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.560
You're not a switch owner, are you, Brent?

26:27.560 --> 26:30.560
You know, I admit to be behind on some of the retro stuff.

26:30.560 --> 26:36.560
You got to get it now, Brent, before they take out the Linux. They're going to fix it. It's a limited time.

26:36.560 --> 26:43.560
But with how much sort of energy this is getting from some of the homebrew stuff, do you think they have an incentive to get rid of it?

26:43.560 --> 26:56.560
Oh, well, so here's the thing is with all good things comes the bad. And a lot of porn and really inappropriate stuff is showing up on the

26:56.560 --> 27:05.560
Nintendo online network because Nintendo uses software side filtering to like prevent you from putting a vagina as your profile picture

27:05.560 --> 27:12.560
or a dong. And when you hack it, you can bypass those filters and you don't have to have a hack switch to see it.

27:12.560 --> 27:19.560
So you can be logging in to go play a game and say you want to do a match. And you go and all of the people you're going to be fighting

27:19.560 --> 27:26.560
against show up on the screen and it's it's dongs and vaginas all day long because people can do that now.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.560
And would you say most people are hacking their switches to do this?

27:28.560 --> 27:38.560
No, no, no. But I bet it's just enough. And, you know, if it causes a couple of really upset parents or a lawsuit or or really just a few headlines,

27:38.560 --> 27:43.560
Nintendo is going to have to respond. I think it's a I think it's a it's a narrowing window of time.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.560
What can we do that's more positive than vaginas?

27:45.560 --> 27:55.560
It's dongs all the way down. It always it always leads to dongs. It really does. It's it's it's a hot dog, not hot dog.

27:55.560 --> 27:59.560
Oh, why do they have to ruin it with dongs, you know?

27:59.560 --> 28:05.560
But this is a good move. I really like the aspect of being able to sideload stuff, especially when you got kids.

28:05.560 --> 28:13.560
It's just such a better way to do it. And it's nice. They actually they actually fixed an issue where the switch would randomly shut down

28:13.560 --> 28:15.560
when the battery would just drop below 50 percent.

28:15.560 --> 28:23.560
You'd be like in this range where something could go wrong and you just they call it the battery desync issue.

28:23.560 --> 28:30.560
Your battery desyncs with the operating system and your device powers off. It sounds horrible.

28:30.560 --> 28:36.560
But it's so I cover this story because you've got why you've got dongs on profile pictures.

28:36.560 --> 28:40.560
You've also got great battery life and hardware accelerated emulators coming to the switch.

28:40.560 --> 28:47.560
So it's a good and bad thing. And thankfully, that Tegra flaw is built in to switches.

28:47.560 --> 28:53.560
So if you already own one, there's no software update that they can do to fix that, which is my favorite kind of flaw.

28:53.560 --> 28:58.560
Now, continuing now in our community news segment, let's talk about Fedora for a moment.

28:58.560 --> 29:06.560
I had the unique experience this past week of messing around with Amazon's new Linux powered workspace,

29:06.560 --> 29:13.560
which is a virtual desktop up on AWS. And you set up an AWS desktop instance.

29:13.560 --> 29:19.560
You now can choose Amazon Linux, too. And then you can go download their proprietary remote connection client,

29:19.560 --> 29:22.560
which doesn't work on Linux. And you can connect into a Linux desktop.

29:22.560 --> 29:27.560
And they have a rel based Mote desktop for you to use.

29:27.560 --> 29:34.560
And it's interesting because it's. On their super fast infrastructure, I gave a bit of a review on Linux

29:34.560 --> 29:40.560
Action News 60, but it's also limiting because it's Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

29:40.560 --> 29:48.560
which is great if you don't want to use software, but it's not so great if you want to install software.

29:48.560 --> 29:52.560
Now, I was able to load the extra repository and get a few things installed.

29:52.560 --> 29:57.560
But the first thing I noticed about it was there was no DNF.

29:57.560 --> 30:04.560
It's using a version of rel that still uses yum, no DNF. And so it's kind of with a bit of a smile on my face

30:04.560 --> 30:11.560
that I cover this next story about Fedora 29. The next version of Fedora will be dropping yum altogether.

30:11.560 --> 30:18.560
Yum is dead in Fedora. And you know what? DNF has been great. Its original introduction was in Fedora 18.

30:18.560 --> 30:25.560
It became the default in Fedora 22. And now the time has come to just remove yum

30:25.560 --> 30:32.560
and related packages like yum utils, yum metadata parser and things like that from Fedora.

30:32.560 --> 30:37.560
There is a plan out on their Wiki right now, and there's a few things they still have to work out.

30:37.560 --> 30:43.560
But if all things shape up as planned, Fedora 29 is going to be a pretty big update.

30:43.560 --> 30:47.560
And there's a lot of changes in there, including the dropping of yum.

30:47.560 --> 30:51.560
And it's currently scheduled to be released by the end of October.

30:51.560 --> 30:57.560
It's kind of funny. In one world where you can have the most expensive,

30:57.560 --> 31:02.560
enterprise-grade Linux distribution in the markets out there, and it's still using yum.

31:02.560 --> 31:08.560
And then what it's based off of, the young pup Fedora, is so far past using yum,

31:08.560 --> 31:14.560
they're dropping it from their distribution. It's this weird, to me, as not a daily Red Hat user,

31:14.560 --> 31:22.560
it's this weird kind of mismatch between using Fedora and RHEL, where a lot of times,

31:22.560 --> 31:27.560
and Alex, you maybe have heard this, a lot of times people will say,

31:27.560 --> 31:33.560
oh, I use Fedora because it's so much like RHEL, which is my server OS.

31:33.560 --> 31:38.560
That just doesn't check out for me. What do you think, Alex? Am I way off target here?

31:38.560 --> 31:46.560
Maybe. I don't know. Definitely maybe. It's one of those head scratches for me, I think.

31:46.560 --> 31:52.560
I mean, I have made the switch to DNF, and it's now muscle memory.

31:52.560 --> 31:59.560
So when I go back to RHEL, it's a bit janky sometimes for me to have to use yum again.

31:59.560 --> 32:05.560
But at the end of the day, whether I type DNF or whether I type yum, there's a lot of functionality crossover.

32:05.560 --> 32:10.560
It's really not a big deal. A lot of the same syntax. It's not a big deal at all.

32:10.560 --> 32:15.560
It's just this strange dichotomy that RHEL and Fedora find themselves in, I feel like.

32:15.560 --> 32:22.560
It's almost like they're doing, I hate to say it, but an apple with getting rid of the ports just a little bit too early,

32:22.560 --> 32:27.560
just to push things forward, just to push the agenda. I suppose that is Fedora's job, right?

32:27.560 --> 32:34.560
I guess so. I mean, it's certainly one of the spins of Fedora's jobs, whether it's the main Fedora's job, I don't know.

32:34.560 --> 32:38.560
Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right. I'm buying what you're selling, actually.

32:38.560 --> 32:45.560
I think for me, it is sort of like, well, what if we changed our view and thought about it in this way?

32:45.560 --> 32:47.560
Sort of like a thought experiment for me.

32:47.560 --> 32:55.560
When I use Ubuntu LTS 1804 on my machine that I'm recording the show on right now,

32:55.560 --> 33:05.560
it is the same exact Ubuntu that I load on my server, that I load in my VMs, that I put in a container.

33:05.560 --> 33:13.560
It is Ubuntu 1804. There isn't like some sort of special privileged enterprise version.

33:13.560 --> 33:20.560
And then like the version for us Peebs, there is one Ubuntu.

33:20.560 --> 33:25.560
And then if you want to pay for support, you can go get a nice contract with Canonical and pay for support.

33:25.560 --> 33:29.560
Or you can just deploy it for free, infinitum.

33:29.560 --> 33:36.560
And it to me seems like a much more logical, organic layout.

33:36.560 --> 33:42.560
You have one distribution. It reminds me of those phony, although it's not quite the same,

33:42.560 --> 33:48.560
those phony baloney differentiators that Microsoft still does between Windows Desktop and Windows Server

33:48.560 --> 33:52.560
and Apple used to do and just gave up on because they don't care about the Mac anymore

33:52.560 --> 33:55.560
between Mac OS Server and Mac OS Desktop.

33:55.560 --> 33:59.560
It's product differentiation for product differentiations purposes.

33:59.560 --> 34:04.560
It doesn't actually serve the organic needs of the end user and the market.

34:04.560 --> 34:08.560
And I think it's what's contributed to Ubuntu's success on the server,

34:08.560 --> 34:12.560
is the same bits I load on my desktop and on my laptop and on my development machines

34:12.560 --> 34:16.560
are the same exact bits I can load on a $50,000 server.

34:16.560 --> 34:21.560
And I think that really matters to some people, not everybody, obviously, because Red Hat's doing great.

34:21.560 --> 34:28.560
But I think the cracks in this paradigm show in these particular instances.

34:28.560 --> 34:33.560
And it's not necessarily even a bad thing. I just think it demonstrates these cracks.

34:33.560 --> 34:34.560
What do you think of that, Alex?

34:34.560 --> 34:39.560
Yes, I agree. We're moving to different worlds, though.

34:39.560 --> 34:48.560
With snap packages, for example, most people in a desktop world aren't going to be using apt anymore.

34:48.560 --> 34:56.560
Obviously, most people will still use it for a long time, but you skate to where the puck is going.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.560
It's that sort of mentality.

34:58.560 --> 35:07.560
But for me, if you look at the different use cases that a server distro has versus a desktop distro,

35:07.560 --> 35:11.560
I think Ubuntu is very good at being all things to all people,

35:11.560 --> 35:17.560
whereas Fedora is very much focused on being a desktop distro with some server capabilities,

35:17.560 --> 35:23.560
whereas RHEL, we all know, is industry standard server OS.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.560
It's not a desktop operating system, in my view.

35:25.560 --> 35:28.560
Yeah, it makes sense. I think that's completely fair.

35:28.560 --> 35:34.560
I wonder if in a few years, with a little more road traveled,

35:34.560 --> 35:39.560
if this won't seem like an older way of doing things, like maybe it's a model of the 90s,

35:39.560 --> 35:40.560
but I could be completely wrong.

35:40.560 --> 35:44.560
It seems like to me, the more modular, everything's the same base,

35:44.560 --> 35:48.560
and then you just have modules or layers that you load up on top of that.

35:48.560 --> 35:52.560
Well, if you go back to last week when you were talking to the Fedora guys,

35:52.560 --> 35:54.560
that's what they're thinking, I think.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.560
Yeah, I wonder if we'll see that reflected in RHEL at some point.

35:56.560 --> 36:00.560
Maybe we will. Maybe that's where things are going, especially with the integration of core OS and whatnot.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.560
Maybe we will.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.560
Could be really interesting times.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.560
Well, Red Hat see OpenShift as the next RHEL,

36:07.560 --> 36:13.560
so I think a lot of their focus and decisions are based around containers at this point.

36:13.560 --> 36:19.560
If you offset what we've just had as a discussion against that backdrop,

36:19.560 --> 36:22.560
I think some of the decisions start to make a bit more sense.

36:22.560 --> 36:23.560
Yeah, I agree. That's a good point.

36:23.560 --> 36:28.560
Speaking of desktops, I should probably mention while we're in the community news section here,

36:28.560 --> 36:34.560
Linux Mint 19 is out, the Cinnamon edition, and I think the XFCE edition, not sure, are out,

36:34.560 --> 36:42.560
and this is going to be supported until 2023, and it's got lots of new features,

36:42.560 --> 36:49.560
but the one that's kind of like the big headline feature you may have heard people talking about already is Timeshift.

36:49.560 --> 36:52.560
Yeah, Timeshift is the star of the show, really.

36:52.560 --> 36:57.560
It was introduced with Linux Mint 18.3, and then it was backported to all other Linux Mint releases.

36:57.560 --> 37:03.560
It's now the center of Linux Mint's update strategy and communication, as they put it.

37:03.560 --> 37:09.560
They write, thanks to Timeshift, you can go back in time and restore your computer to the last functional system snapshot.

37:09.560 --> 37:15.560
If anything breaks, you can go back to the previous snapshot as if the problem never happened.

37:15.560 --> 37:21.560
And as a result, they've made some changes to their rather often criticized update manager

37:21.560 --> 37:26.560
that would avoid installing important updates because they now have snapshots.

37:26.560 --> 37:32.560
So they write, the update manager no longer promotes vigilance.

37:32.560 --> 37:37.560
One man's vigilance is another man's ignorance.

37:37.560 --> 37:43.560
The update manager no longer promotes vigilance and selective updates.

37:43.560 --> 37:50.560
It relies on Timeshift to guarantee the stability of your system and suggests that you apply all available updates.

37:50.560 --> 37:57.560
That reminds me a bit, Brent, of when they rolled out system snapshots in Windows ME,

37:57.560 --> 38:00.560
they also rolled out Windows Update.

38:00.560 --> 38:07.560
And so it was like, have at it, update your system, and if anything goes wrong, you can just restore your box.

38:07.560 --> 38:13.560
And I still don't know anybody who really relies on that too heavily when it comes to Windows.

38:13.560 --> 38:19.560
So I'm not totally sure I'm sold here, and I don't think they're using file system level snapshotting, though I'm not sure.

38:19.560 --> 38:26.560
Would you consider giving this a go if this kind of functionality was, let's just say,

38:26.560 --> 38:30.560
for the sake of argument, Brent, let's just say that this Timeshift thing worked flawlessly,

38:30.560 --> 38:35.560
that you knew if you installed Linux Mint 19, you would have this Timeshift recovery feature.

38:35.560 --> 38:38.560
Would that move the needle for you?

38:38.560 --> 38:40.560
So maybe I can give you a little bit of background.

38:40.560 --> 38:47.560
So I've actually helped a lot of people move to Linux as a professional sort of offering.

38:47.560 --> 38:55.560
And this is for regular users, and so often it's because of their frustration with other systems.

38:55.560 --> 38:56.560
Sure, yeah.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.560
And I've seen a lot of users.

38:57.560 --> 39:02.560
So Linux Mint was generally what I would recommend, actually, for a few years.

39:02.560 --> 39:06.560
And up till really recently, I'm thinking of suggesting other things.

39:06.560 --> 39:13.560
But so I was looking at this yesterday, this Timeshift, and I saw it come in the previous version of Linux Mint.

39:13.560 --> 39:20.560
And what I heard from several users that I've helped in the past move to Linux is that,

39:20.560 --> 39:24.560
oh, yeah, I have a time machine, and so I don't have to worry about anything.

39:24.560 --> 39:25.560
Oh, yeah, sure.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.560
And that, I think, is a really dangerous mindset, right?

39:27.560 --> 39:33.560
Because not worrying about anything means that you're opening yourself up to a whole bunch of stuff.

39:33.560 --> 39:37.560
So if this works flawlessly, that's a big assumption.

39:37.560 --> 39:42.560
But if it works flawlessly, then it's a good crutch, I think.

39:42.560 --> 39:47.560
But to rely on it 100% for everything feels dangerous to me a little bit.

39:47.560 --> 39:52.560
Yeah, maybe it's part of a belt and suspenders kind of thing, where maybe this is your first shot.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.560
You have an update installed, and it breaks something.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.560
This is your first shot.

39:57.560 --> 40:01.560
I kind of wish, though, I don't know what, I don't know.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.560
Maybe it's just too hard of a problem to solve.

40:03.560 --> 40:07.560
But I wish we could just focus on updates not breaking shit.

40:07.560 --> 40:08.560
How about that?

40:08.560 --> 40:12.560
How about Linux Mint comes up with a way to deliver solid updates?

40:12.560 --> 40:15.560
Rollbacks don't feel like the way to do it.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.560
It's possible.

40:16.560 --> 40:21.560
But if you think about it, you got to snapshot system settings, software state.

40:21.560 --> 40:28.560
There's so many things that you have to be able to collect and store and do in a way that doesn't take hours

40:28.560 --> 40:31.560
and doesn't take up gigs of storage space.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.560
It's a really hard problem to solve.

40:33.560 --> 40:37.560
And it'd be a lot better if we could just say, oh, yeah, just install the updates.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.560
It'll be fine.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.560
Linux has been architected in a way where you're protected.

40:40.560 --> 40:43.560
That would be a better answer, I think.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.560
I suppose in the meantime, we have time shift, though.

40:45.560 --> 40:48.560
Looks like a pretty solid update for Linux Mint users.

40:48.560 --> 40:53.560
So if you still are a Linux Mint user out there, I think it's, you know, it's a pretty good update.

40:53.560 --> 40:56.560
They now have gotten all of their tools up to GTK3.

40:56.560 --> 40:59.560
So they support high DPI if that's how you roll.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.560
It's yet another iteration of their Xapps.

41:01.560 --> 41:07.560
And they have the MintBox Mini 2 now, so the MintBox continues to roll.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.560
I don't know if it's actually available just yet.

41:09.560 --> 41:10.560
I think you can preorder.

41:10.560 --> 41:16.560
I don't know if it's shipping until about the 15th of this month or the 18th of this month.

41:16.560 --> 41:24.560
But the MintBox Mini 2 Pro is a little teeny tiny, almost looks like a car pewter,

41:24.560 --> 41:30.560
quad core Intel Celeron box with eight gigs of RAM, 120 gigabyte M.2.

41:30.560 --> 41:33.560
It's got Intel AC wireless.

41:33.560 --> 41:36.560
It comes with Linux Mint 19 preinstalled.

41:36.560 --> 41:41.560
And it's got passive cooling heat fins on the top of it.

41:41.560 --> 41:44.560
So it first of all, it just looks great.

41:44.560 --> 41:47.560
But second of all, should actually run pretty quiet.

41:47.560 --> 41:52.560
I'm not actually positive, but I'm fairly certain there's not a fan in the thing.

41:52.560 --> 41:54.560
So you can get this tiny little box.

41:54.560 --> 41:57.560
It's got a couple of USB ports on it.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.560
It's got a couple of Ethernet ports on it.

41:59.560 --> 42:02.560
It's got mini display port, HDMI out.

42:02.560 --> 42:06.560
It's got connectors externally for Wi-Fi antennas.

42:06.560 --> 42:09.560
It's not really built to be a desktop, but it certainly does the job.

42:09.560 --> 42:13.560
And it's got a metal housing with these cooling fins on it.

42:13.560 --> 42:20.560
And it's going to be around $400-ish, kind of depending on where you're buying it from.

42:20.560 --> 42:24.560
So there's an actual box you could buy preloaded with Mint.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.560
That's pretty cool.

42:25.560 --> 42:26.560
That is pretty nice.

42:26.560 --> 42:29.560
So congratulations to the Mint Project for getting version 19 out.

42:29.560 --> 42:37.560
And if you give it a go, go over to linuxunplug.com.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.560
And let me know what you think, because this is one I haven't had a chance to kick the tires.

42:40.560 --> 42:44.560
I've been trying out the new elementary OS, so the timing didn't work out.

42:44.560 --> 42:46.560
So maybe you could be my reviewer.

42:46.560 --> 42:47.560
Let me know what you think.

42:47.560 --> 42:52.560
And if you're like me and you've been switching over to Firefox recently, I've got great news there.

42:52.560 --> 42:58.560
The next version of Firefox is going to begin rolling out a service to help you monitor your passwords

42:58.560 --> 43:02.560
using the rather famous Have I Been Pwned service.

43:02.560 --> 43:09.560
Mozilla will begin integration between Have I Been Pwned and Firefox to make data breaches searchable

43:09.560 --> 43:12.560
in a new tool called Firefox Monitor.

43:12.560 --> 43:18.560
It's a pretty big deal because it's going to bring the install base of hundreds of millions of Firefox users

43:18.560 --> 43:23.560
to the Have I Been Pwned feature, which is a great service to check to see if your user accounts

43:23.560 --> 43:26.560
have been leaked online if you haven't looked at it yet.

43:26.560 --> 43:30.560
So desktop users, got a few nice things coming to them this week.

43:30.560 --> 43:34.560
And one last thing in the whole Firefox category before we move on,

43:34.560 --> 43:39.560
bit of a public service announcement, stylish browser extension is total trash,

43:39.560 --> 43:42.560
and you have to uninstall it immediately if you've been using it.

43:42.560 --> 43:47.560
It's a real bummer because I have years ago mentioned it on the show because it was a great way

43:47.560 --> 43:50.560
to make Firefox look like a first-class GNOME application.

43:50.560 --> 43:56.560
But things change, ownership changes, and now it steals all the sites you visit

43:56.560 --> 43:59.560
and sends them back up for them to monitor.

43:59.560 --> 44:07.560
So really a bit of unfortunate news this week, the stylish browser extension is now spyware.

44:07.560 --> 44:11.560
And if you have that installed in your browser, it is stealing all of your internet history.

44:11.560 --> 44:13.560
Sorry about that.

44:13.560 --> 44:18.560
You know, that's one of those where we do a lot of app pics, Brent.

44:18.560 --> 44:23.560
It's not very often I have to come back and say, delete that, it's stealing all of your history.

44:23.560 --> 44:28.560
But stylish browser extension is one of those. It happens from time to time.

44:28.560 --> 44:31.560
This is a neat example of what the community is good at, right?

44:31.560 --> 44:34.560
Is someone recognizes this and spreads it around.

44:34.560 --> 44:37.560
And so we can get the news out quite quickly that, wait a second,

44:37.560 --> 44:41.560
someone you may have trusted in the past, maybe they've changed their game a little bit.

44:41.560 --> 44:46.560
And so everybody can hopefully as quickly as possible just kind of make a decision

44:46.560 --> 44:51.560
on whether they trust this with the new discoveries, right?

44:51.560 --> 44:53.560
Yeah, and all of those anti-extension folks are like,

44:53.560 --> 44:56.560
you see, I've been telling you these extensions are no good.

44:56.560 --> 45:00.560
Now they have yet another example to go to.

45:00.560 --> 45:05.560
All right, well, I have this story in here that I've been considering covering for a little bit

45:05.560 --> 45:09.560
because I keep hearing from folks about Chrome OS

45:09.560 --> 45:13.560
and about how, hey, I tried out Chrome OS and it's great, you should give it a go.

45:13.560 --> 45:18.560
And to that I always go back, why would I bother? I've already got Chrome on Linux.

45:18.560 --> 45:21.560
And then they always say, no, give it a go, it's really, really good.

45:21.560 --> 45:26.560
Well, over at androidcentral.com, there is a story about a Mac user who made this very switch.

45:26.560 --> 45:31.560
He was considering going to the Linux desktop and decided to try out a Chromebook in the meantime.

45:31.560 --> 45:34.560
And now he's sticking with Chrome OS.

45:34.560 --> 45:37.560
He says it's got a lot of the features he likes,

45:37.560 --> 45:40.560
but something that stuck out to him is how great updates are handled.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.560
I thought this was interesting following up on our Mint discussion.

45:43.560 --> 45:47.560
I absolutely dreaded seeing that I've got updates to install.

45:47.560 --> 45:53.560
Even though I know I probably shouldn't, I became that person that kept pressing try again later

45:53.560 --> 45:56.560
whenever I saw the pop-up about updates coming in.

45:56.560 --> 46:00.560
But in Chrome OS, this has been a non-issue.

46:00.560 --> 46:04.560
Any big system updates are downloaded in the background.

46:04.560 --> 46:08.560
And then, when they're ready to install, all I have to do is click a button

46:08.560 --> 46:13.560
and my system is completely rebooted and back up and running within a matter of seconds.

46:13.560 --> 46:15.560
It's something that's been around for a while in Chrome OS,

46:15.560 --> 46:21.560
but it is a feature that I have constantly appreciated as new software rolls out.

46:21.560 --> 46:25.560
Now, there's limitations he talks about, like a crappy built-in file manager and stuff.

46:25.560 --> 46:30.560
But with our recent conversation about Linux Mint and how they're changing their updates

46:30.560 --> 46:37.560
and their new time machine feature, I kind of wonder if this kind of update solution

46:37.560 --> 46:39.560
isn't the direction we just need to go.

46:39.560 --> 46:45.560
And it just means, and this is a serious question, we'd have to be okay with rebooting.

46:45.560 --> 46:50.560
Now, I put that out there because a lot of us, we like to brag about our uptime.

46:50.560 --> 46:53.560
You know, we like to claim, oh, I haven't rebooted for weeks.

46:53.560 --> 46:56.560
I was doing it earlier. I haven't rebooted these server systems for over a month.

46:56.560 --> 47:00.560
Look at me. And then, of course, this week I ended up rebooting them.

47:00.560 --> 47:02.560
I don't know, Eric, I'm going to toss this one to you.

47:02.560 --> 47:07.560
If you could have flawless updates every time you update your system,

47:07.560 --> 47:12.560
but it meant that also every time you update your system, you had to reboot,

47:12.560 --> 47:14.560
would that be a trade-off, honestly, you'd be willing to make?

47:14.560 --> 47:16.560
Or do you prefer the existing system?

47:16.560 --> 47:23.560
You know, to be honest, as a user who is heavily in Windows for years,

47:23.560 --> 47:28.560
I still haven't really broken the, I just ran my update, so I'm going to reboot my system.

47:28.560 --> 47:32.560
I'm not really that dependent upon my systems being up that often.

47:32.560 --> 47:36.560
So I'd usually do a reboot as just something to clear out all the processes that are running

47:36.560 --> 47:41.560
and then make sure that I haven't screwed something up on a configuration.

47:41.560 --> 47:44.560
Yeah, I have gone the other route over the years.

47:44.560 --> 47:48.560
I became sort of this guy that, oh, I got five minutes to kill.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.560
I think I'll update my packages real quick.

47:50.560 --> 47:52.560
And I would just have a terminal open, do a quick update.

47:52.560 --> 47:55.560
Oh, look at that, five new packages, all right, let's go ahead and install those.

47:55.560 --> 47:58.560
I think I developed it as an Arch user because really with Arch,

47:58.560 --> 48:01.560
the more up-to-date you stay, the better things tend to be.

48:01.560 --> 48:02.560
And so I would almost do it daily.

48:02.560 --> 48:05.560
Oh, let's do a little Pac-Man, you know.

48:05.560 --> 48:15.560
And I've had to kind of make a transition as an Ubuntu user to now isn't the best time for me to do updates.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.560
Maybe I should wait.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.560
And then I find that I just do that a lot.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.560
I wait and I wait, and then weeks go by.

48:20.560 --> 48:23.560
Oh, I guess now is a good time to do it.

48:23.560 --> 48:26.560
And almost every time, you know, there's some small update that I think,

48:26.560 --> 48:29.560
yeah, that's probably worth doing a reboot after that upgrade.

48:29.560 --> 48:31.560
That's so true about being an Arch user.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.560
It's like crack.

48:33.560 --> 48:39.560
But so I went to a talk at FOSDEM maybe two years ago now with Brian Redbeard,

48:39.560 --> 48:41.560
the guy who is one of the leaders of CoreOS.

48:41.560 --> 48:44.560
This was obviously well before Red Hat bought them.

48:44.560 --> 48:49.560
And I remember being absolutely blown away by hearing how CoreOS did their updates.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.560
They update the partition that you're not booted to.

48:51.560 --> 48:54.560
So they have a partition A, partition B.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.560
They update partition B.

48:56.560 --> 48:58.560
You reboot into partition B.

48:58.560 --> 49:01.560
So if you need to fall back, you just reboot into partition A again.

49:01.560 --> 49:03.560
And it is amazing when that works.

49:03.560 --> 49:05.560
That is absolutely the future of updates.

49:05.560 --> 49:07.560
Yeah, absolutely.

49:07.560 --> 49:10.560
And there's been some talk about containers and stuff like that in the chat.

49:10.560 --> 49:15.560
And because your hosts are now immutable and they can do stuff like that

49:15.560 --> 49:20.560
and you don't care whether they are long-lived or not anymore,

49:20.560 --> 49:23.560
the workloads are not server-specific is what I mean.

49:23.560 --> 49:28.560
I just think, going back to our DNF discussion as well,

49:28.560 --> 49:32.560
package management is becoming a lot less relevant in this sort of world.

49:32.560 --> 49:36.560
Yeah, it's just it takes more disk, it takes more time, and it takes the reboot.

49:36.560 --> 49:38.560
So what? Disk is so cheap.

49:38.560 --> 49:40.560
Yeah, I agree.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.560
I completely agree.

49:42.560 --> 49:44.560
And I think this is how Chrome OS pulls this off.

49:44.560 --> 49:48.560
And would you ever see a future where elementary could have an update style like this?

49:48.560 --> 49:51.560
It seems like it would be a pretty big engineering effort.

49:51.560 --> 49:53.560
We totally talk about it all the time.

49:53.560 --> 49:57.560
And actually, that's kind of what we're investigating

49:57.560 --> 50:00.560
for how release upgrades might happen on elementary OS.

50:00.560 --> 50:04.560
And I think Pop OS might end up going in this direction as well,

50:04.560 --> 50:12.560
especially because the new installer operates kind of based on the assumption of a recovery partition.

50:12.560 --> 50:16.560
So we could do something like that where we're downloading the image to basically a recovery partition,

50:16.560 --> 50:20.560
and then you reboot into that, and then it does the big disk upgrade,

50:20.560 --> 50:23.560
and then you reboot back into the new container.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.560
Oh, yeah, that is a sweet way to do it.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.560
Oh, man, I would love that.

50:27.560 --> 50:29.560
That does seem like the future.

50:29.560 --> 50:30.560
And I hope we get there.

50:30.560 --> 50:34.560
And I hope we beat Windows and Mac OS to that.

50:34.560 --> 50:37.560
I don't know why that's an arbitrary goal of mine, but that's just what I've said.

50:37.560 --> 50:40.560
I want us to get there before them, those bastards.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.560
Well, okay, you've convinced me.

50:42.560 --> 50:43.560
It's the way to go.

50:43.560 --> 50:45.560
You know, the OS3 folks feel that way.

50:45.560 --> 50:47.560
I mean, it's a lot of different ways of solving this.

50:47.560 --> 50:50.560
I think Ubuntu Core has something similar to this.

50:50.560 --> 50:57.560
So it is being worked on at several different approaches that are all trying to basically accomplish the same thing,

50:57.560 --> 50:59.560
kind of the standard open source fare.

50:59.560 --> 51:04.560
But hopefully in the end, the strongest methodology will sort of emerge.

51:04.560 --> 51:08.560
And I feel like that's kind of what's brewing in the background right now.

51:08.560 --> 51:09.560
That'd be really cool.

51:09.560 --> 51:13.560
I do have one last bit of community news.

51:13.560 --> 51:16.560
I just want to toss out there before we get out of the community news section.

51:16.560 --> 51:23.560
The Ubuntu Studio folks have a handbook to help you get started on creating content on Ubuntu Studio.

51:23.560 --> 51:27.560
It looks like it's going to be a PDF download as well as an audio handbook.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.560
I'll have a link in the show notes.

51:29.560 --> 51:33.560
If you go to linuxunplug.com slash 256, you can get a link to it there.

51:33.560 --> 51:35.560
It's getting started.

51:35.560 --> 51:38.560
It's an overview of the out of the box tools and effects.

51:38.560 --> 51:42.560
There's some really good stuff in here about a couple of tools that come with Ubuntu Studio.

51:42.560 --> 51:48.560
Also, the basics of recording under Audacity could be useful if you just want to get started podcasting

51:48.560 --> 51:53.560
and an overview of how to use VSD plugins, when you might have to install wine,

51:53.560 --> 51:56.560
that kind of stuff that honestly took me a year to figure out.

51:56.560 --> 51:59.560
And they've got it all listed here in their book.

51:59.560 --> 52:03.560
Also, ways you can share stuff like a rundown of Creative Commons,

52:03.560 --> 52:07.560
things you need to consider about if you want to go down the copyright act,

52:07.560 --> 52:10.560
royalty collections, things like that.

52:10.560 --> 52:14.560
And then also a bunch of other little tidbits here and there that I just didn't even really mention.

52:14.560 --> 52:16.560
So it's a pretty neat idea.

52:16.560 --> 52:21.560
And when I was talking to somebody about this earlier today, they said,

52:21.560 --> 52:25.560
their response was, oh shit, Ubuntu Studio is still going?

52:25.560 --> 52:26.560
Yes.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.560
What, are you not listening to the show?

52:28.560 --> 52:31.560
Yes, Ubuntu Studio is still going, and they've got a handbook available now,

52:31.560 --> 52:33.560
which is pretty, pretty cool.

52:33.560 --> 52:35.560
I wonder, let's see, audio handbook.

52:35.560 --> 52:39.560
Can I download it? I don't know how I download it, but they do have a PDF as well.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.560
These might be the kind of things you want to read.

52:41.560 --> 52:46.560
So we have links to all that stuff as well as I'll include a bonus link in the show notes

52:46.560 --> 52:54.560
where some entrepreneur hacker right now is trying to take the Chrome OS display manager

52:54.560 --> 53:02.560
that Google built to kind of break out Chrome's rendering from Wayland or the Mac OS or from Windows,

53:02.560 --> 53:06.560
and they're turning that into a full-fledged display server.

53:06.560 --> 53:11.560
And it comes with things like, if you're on Intel hardware, accelerated video playback,

53:11.560 --> 53:15.560
full OpenGL acceleration, and improved battery life.

53:15.560 --> 53:19.560
Really crazy project that's not going to go anywhere, but it's a fun idea,

53:19.560 --> 53:23.560
and I'll put a bonus link in the show notes if you want to check that out.

53:23.560 --> 53:27.560
If you also want to get some stories into our community news section,

53:27.560 --> 53:30.560
linuxunplugged.reddit.com is where you go.

53:30.560 --> 53:33.560
linuxunplugged.reddit.com, submit that over there,

53:33.560 --> 53:37.560
and that helps inform what goes into our community news section

53:37.560 --> 53:40.560
because we do actually still check that subreddit.

53:40.560 --> 53:44.560
Now, I do want to tell you about TrueOS dropping their desktop

53:44.560 --> 53:52.560
and JB's experiments with PeerTube, which have been bananas.

53:52.560 --> 53:54.560
So before we get to that, let's talk about our sponsors

53:54.560 --> 53:58.560
that are making this week's show actually possible.

53:58.560 --> 54:03.560
Let's start with Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com.

54:03.560 --> 54:06.560
This is a massive month for them.

54:06.560 --> 54:09.560
Their biggest content launch in history.

54:09.560 --> 54:15.560
Over 150 new courses, hands-on content, and challenges.

54:15.560 --> 54:20.560
Linux Academy is doing a live stream next week to try to cover just some of it,

54:20.560 --> 54:23.560
and they're streaming on the OBS Linux box that I set up for them.

54:23.560 --> 54:28.560
So what else am I going to do? I'm flying down there.

54:28.560 --> 54:32.560
Crazy Chris is going back to Texas next week.

54:32.560 --> 54:35.560
Only this time I'm flying, and you guys know me.

54:35.560 --> 54:40.560
When's the last time I came on this show and told you I'm flying anywhere?

54:40.560 --> 54:43.560
I'm the crazy guy who got in a subcompact car

54:43.560 --> 54:47.560
and drove that thing to New York for the Ubuntu rally.

54:47.560 --> 54:49.560
But I did the math, and I'm just looking,

54:49.560 --> 54:53.560
and I'm like, I can't set them up with a Linux-powered OBS stream

54:53.560 --> 54:57.560
for their biggest content launch in history and be like,

54:57.560 --> 55:00.560
all right, have at it, guys, good luck.

55:00.560 --> 55:05.560
So I've decided that the best thing, like, I got to go down there and help them out.

55:05.560 --> 55:07.560
So they're going to pay for my flight, but I'm going to go down there.

55:07.560 --> 55:09.560
I'll be in Dallas next week.

55:09.560 --> 55:11.560
If you want to tune in and hang out with us,

55:11.560 --> 55:17.560
July 10th, Tuesday, July 10th at 10.30 Chicago time,

55:17.560 --> 55:20.560
I'll be live with the Linux Academy folks,

55:20.560 --> 55:23.560
covering the DevOps and Linux section of the new courseware.

55:23.560 --> 55:25.560
Of course, they've got a bunch of new stuff.

55:25.560 --> 55:30.560
And to that end, I've gotten the word that they're looking to hire a bunch of experts,

55:30.560 --> 55:32.560
particularly in our audience,

55:32.560 --> 55:36.560
because they're spinning up coursewares on containers and Azure,

55:36.560 --> 55:39.560
which has been standard affair for them for a while.

55:39.560 --> 55:44.560
But they are looking for experts in those things that may want to help create courseware.

55:44.560 --> 55:47.560
But specifically, something that I think could be really appealing to our audience

55:47.560 --> 55:51.560
is they're also looking for experts in Python and security,

55:51.560 --> 55:54.560
because they're really expanding both those areas right now.

55:54.560 --> 55:59.560
And don't tell anybody, but I have reason to believe that down the road,

55:59.560 --> 56:02.560
they're also going to need a BSD courseware author.

56:02.560 --> 56:08.560
So if you have an expertise in BSD and feel like you could write some courseware,

56:08.560 --> 56:11.560
maybe come up with a few educational challenges, things like that,

56:11.560 --> 56:14.560
it would behoove you to contact Linux Academy.

56:14.560 --> 56:19.560
Container expert, Azure, security, Python, or BSD.

56:19.560 --> 56:22.560
I've been hanging out with these guys, seeing the work they're putting into this,

56:22.560 --> 56:25.560
and I can tell you these are the next areas they're going to need people.

56:25.560 --> 56:28.560
So I said, I'll put the word out, go create an email address,

56:28.560 --> 56:31.560
and I'll have people email you with their resumes.

56:31.560 --> 56:36.560
So this is a hotline for my audience, training at linuxacademy.com.

56:36.560 --> 56:38.560
If you think you might be able to help them out,

56:38.560 --> 56:42.560
if you're a BSD expert, a Python expert, if you're really into security,

56:42.560 --> 56:44.560
training at linuxacademy.com.

56:44.560 --> 56:48.560
They do support remote work as well, so it's something you could consider.

56:48.560 --> 56:52.560
And it's an area that they're going to be expanding into rapidly,

56:52.560 --> 56:55.560
so they could definitely, definitely use your help.

56:55.560 --> 56:57.560
Training at linuxacademy.com.

56:57.560 --> 57:01.560
Get in touch with them if this is an area of expertise that you have,

57:01.560 --> 57:04.560
because Linux Academy is growing like crazy right now.

57:04.560 --> 57:08.560
150 new ways to learn in July alone.

57:08.560 --> 57:12.560
And you can get started at linuxacademy.com.

57:12.560 --> 57:15.560
And you can sign up for a free seven-day trial.

57:15.560 --> 57:19.560
And if you are a courseware expert, maybe you're a BSD guy,

57:19.560 --> 57:24.560
maybe you write Python all day long, maybe you're an Azure nut,

57:24.560 --> 57:27.560
you should let them know. Training at linuxacademy.com.

57:27.560 --> 57:30.560
And thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring this year's show.

57:30.560 --> 57:33.560
Thanks to all of you guys for going to linuxacademy.com.

57:33.560 --> 57:39.560
And wish me luck, because this is going to really be the first production test

57:39.560 --> 57:44.560
of this new system that I built, and it's kind of going all in.

57:44.560 --> 57:47.560
So, yeah. And if you're in the Dallas area,

57:47.560 --> 57:51.560
I may try to do a few lunches or dinner while I'm down there,

57:51.560 --> 57:55.560
join our Telegram group, jupitabroadcasting.com.

57:55.560 --> 57:58.560
That's the real reason you're going for the barbecue.

57:58.560 --> 58:01.560
You know it, dude. You know it. It's so good.

58:01.560 --> 58:06.560
Oh, man. Alex, they have been throwing a party all day long at Linux Academy.

58:06.560 --> 58:08.560
And of course, I follow a bunch of those folks on Twitter.

58:08.560 --> 58:12.560
So I'm just seeing pictures all day of all these different things

58:12.560 --> 58:14.560
that they're getting to celebrate, like food.

58:14.560 --> 58:16.560
They brought food trucks out.

58:16.560 --> 58:20.560
All of the remote staff also got food delivered today.

58:20.560 --> 58:23.560
So it's a company-wide party for reaching this milestone.

58:23.560 --> 58:28.560
And I'm looking at that going, I'll be all right. I'll be okay.

58:28.560 --> 58:31.560
I'm going to get my eat on for sure. You know it.

58:31.560 --> 58:33.560
All right. Well, let me also thank Ting.

58:33.560 --> 58:36.560
Go to linux.ting.com. It's smarter than unlimited.

58:36.560 --> 58:38.560
If you use less, you pay less.

58:38.560 --> 58:42.560
Your average Ting phone bill is just $23 per phone per month.

58:42.560 --> 58:45.560
It's simple. It's just $6 for the line,

58:45.560 --> 58:48.560
and then your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

58:48.560 --> 58:51.560
A fair price for however much you talk, text, and data you use.

58:51.560 --> 58:55.560
Now, these crazy Canadians are always doing really fun things.

58:55.560 --> 58:58.560
And they have the hashtag Ting Summer Photo Contest,

58:58.560 --> 59:02.560
where you can share a photo with them on your favorite platform

59:02.560 --> 59:05.560
and get entered to win one of those cool Moto Z2s

59:05.560 --> 59:07.560
that support like the modules.

59:07.560 --> 59:10.560
And they're going to include the true zoom camera

59:10.560 --> 59:12.560
that snaps onto the back of that thing

59:12.560 --> 59:15.560
just for you taking a picture and doing a hashtag.

59:15.560 --> 59:17.560
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

59:17.560 --> 59:19.560
They have a CDMA and a GSM network.

59:19.560 --> 59:21.560
You pick whatever works best in your area,

59:21.560 --> 59:24.560
and then it's just $6 a month for the phone.

59:24.560 --> 59:26.560
If you got Wi-Fi and you don't use any data that day,

59:26.560 --> 59:29.560
you don't pay for any data. It's pretty awesome.

59:29.560 --> 59:34.560
They've also recently posted a review of the Moto G6 Play.

59:34.560 --> 59:38.560
This sucker is going to be top of my list if my phone breaks.

59:38.560 --> 59:41.560
It's going to be out on June 28th.

59:41.560 --> 59:43.560
So I guess it's out now, actually.

59:43.560 --> 59:47.560
For $199, and that's before you even go to linux.ting.com

59:47.560 --> 59:49.560
and get a $25 discount,

59:49.560 --> 59:52.560
you can get a phone that takes amazing pictures.

59:52.560 --> 59:55.560
It stays powered all day and all night with its crazy great battery,

59:55.560 --> 59:59.560
13 megapixel shooter on the back, 5 megapixel on the front,

59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.560
5.7 edge-to-edge display with an 18.9 aspect ratio,

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.560
a great battery, and of course on the Ting service,

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.560
you get updates directly.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.560
You don't have to worry about them getting in the way

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.560
for their quote-unquote experience,

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.560
and you just pay for what you use.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.560
It's a great service.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.560
And you can get started by going to linux.ting.com.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.560
Take $25 off a device.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:24.560
Bring your own, and they'll give you $25 in service credit.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:29.560
And the best part is, once you get all kumskies, as my daughter puts it,

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.560
with your Ting service,

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.560
you can take advantage of their great control panel

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.560
and their fantastic customer service.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.560
And of course, if you want to buy a device from Ting directly,

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.560
they've got so many great devices for all those different price points.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.560
It truly is a reboot of the mobile industry,

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.560
and you can vote with your wallet.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.560
You can keep the mobile industry sane here in the States.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:57.560
Go to linux.ting.com.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.560
Oh, yeah. Oh, right.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.560
And DigitalOcean.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.560
DigitalOcean, d-o dot c-o slash unplugged.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.560
If you go to that URL, you will get a $100 credit

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.560
when you sign up with a new account,

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.560
and I have to warn you, you're not going to know what to do with yourself.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.560
There's so many things you could do.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.560
Maybe set up a PeerTube instance.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.560
Why not go with one of their high-performance CPU droplets?

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.560
In fact, DigitalOcean has these great droplets

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.560
where you can mix and match resources

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.560
or go with my favorite system.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:29.560
Three cents an hour gives you four gigabytes of RAM,

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.560
two CPUs, 80 gigabytes of SSD storage,

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.560
and three terabytes of transfer for three cents an hour.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.560
Everything is SSDs, enterprise-grade SSDs,

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:42.560
40-gigabit connections coming into them hypervisors,

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.560
monitoring and alerting so that way you always look like a boss,

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.560
and simple DNS management that makes you realize

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.560
DNS didn't need to be such a pain in the butt all these years.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.560
Then you combine that with their easy, well-documented,

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.560
super straightforward API, global data centers all over the world,

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.560
99.99% SLA uptime, and cloud firewalls

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.560
so they block traffic at the network level

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.560
instead of letting that traffic hit your rig.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.560
It's a pretty slick system.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.560
And then they wrap it all up with great documentation.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.560
In the show notes, I will link you to a guide

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.560
on how to secure NGINX with Let's Encrypt

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.560
on something called FreeBISTI.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.560
FreeBISTI.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.560
Sounds new, never heard of it before.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.560
Probably just got launched.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.560
But they've already got a tutorial on it.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.560
It's probably some distribution of Linux, FreeBISTI.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.560
And they've got a guide on how to set up Let's Encrypt

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.560
and NGINX on that, as well as, of course,

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.560
Ubuntu, RHEL, a bunch of other distributions.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.560
They support so many different Linux distros and FreeBSD.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.560
Plus, they have block storage,

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.560
and they have many, many other features.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.560
It's a great platform.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.560
It's our go-to when we want to try something out.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.560
And now, because it's been around for a little while,

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.560
it comes with all these great benefits,

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.560
like people in the community know how to work with it.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.560
They know how to use the team account functionality.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.560
And when it's somebody new, somebody like, you know,

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.560
the one outsider in the group that hasn't used it before,

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.560
it's no big deal, because it's so simple,

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.560
it's so straightforward, that they get up to speed right away.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.560
So get started by going to do.co slash unplugged.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:16.560
That'll give you a $100 credit when you sign up with a new account.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.560
That's do.co slash unplugged.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.560
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.560
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.560
Here we go. We got it. We got it.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:30.560
And I'm happy to say that the feedback has been mostly positive

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.560
about consolidating the sponsors down into one block in the show.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.560
I like it because it gives me one spot in the show notes

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.560
for you guys to find all the links to the stuff

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.560
I talk about with our great sponsors,

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.560
especially when it's an opportunity like getting a job

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.560
or saving $100 or a new tutorial on how to set up Let's Encrypt.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.560
So thank you, everybody, who's continuing to send in your feedback.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:52.560
Linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.560
Now, Brent, let's shift gears here for a moment.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.560
Have you ever experimented with any of the BSDs that are desktop focused?

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.560
You know, you've got, in the past, you had, what do they call it,

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.560
PCBSD, and then they changed it to true OS.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.560
And a friend of the show, Chris Moore, was involved

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.560
with each one of those projects to make like a user-friendly BSD.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.560
Have you ever even been tempted by it?

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.560
Hmm, temptations.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.560
So as you and I, Chris, are getting to know each other,

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.560
I will say, yeah, temptations for sure.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.560
I've seen the T-shirts.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.560
But I haven't quite tried it myself.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.560
And Alan, of course, being a fellow Canadian,

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.560
has a thing or two positive to say about it.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.560
So yeah, it's certainly on the list of things to try.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.560
And there's some amazing features in there.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.560
But I will admit to not having done it quite yet.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.560
No, I'm in the same boat.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.560
You know, there was a feature in there, though,

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:51.560
while we're just talking about backups and time machine

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.560
and time shift and those kinds of things,

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.560
that Chris Moore and his brother built into their desktop environment

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.560
that I thought was pretty slick.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.560
They took advantage of ZFS snapshots

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.560
and integrated a slider in the file manager

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.560
where you could slide back in time

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:12.560
to previous ZFS snapshots, like backups.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.560
Now, again, it's all on one disk.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.560
So if your disk goes out, you're screwed.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.560
But it did get me thinking about guys like you

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.560
who might have a workflow where you're working on some photos,

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.560
you make an edit, and then you come back the next day

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.560
and you're like, oh, shit, I didn't save the original version

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.560
or I don't like this edit.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.560
You could, in theory, although it might be kind of expensive,

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.560
but in theory, you could go into the file manager

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.560
and sort of scroll back in time

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.560
and get that photo that wasn't modified.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.560
So there is some appeal.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.560
Like there's a workflow advantage, you know what I mean?

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.560
I wonder if this is an advantage for all workflows.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.560
For me, certainly in photos, I can see that as being handy.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.560
But anyone who's even creating,

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:51.560
they're doing text accounting, for instance,

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:55.560
that's a super niche, but any history is super helpful.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.560
And that is, I would say, as far as the research I've done,

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:05.560
the main reason to look at or maybe to get introduced to BSD,

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.560
it seems like they've really got some good advantages there.

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.560
Oh, here's your final answer, though.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.560
XMN in the chat room says that Darktable is not necessarily on BSD yet.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.560
Well, that ruins it, doesn't it?

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.560
No Darktable, no Brent.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.560
Well, key is you said yet.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.560
That's true.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.560
Who knows what's coming, right?

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.560
So let's talk about TruOS.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:30.560
TruOS is BSD unplugged, episode 34 for April 1st, 2014.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.560
Oh, that was a while ago now.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560
I miss Chris.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:37.560
So TruOS is focusing on a core operating system.

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:42.560
It's not changing its name, but it's pretty much changing everything else.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.560
And they say, they write over on the TruOS.org blog,

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.560
today we're announcing that TruOS is shifting our focus a bit

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.560
to become a cutting-edge operating system

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.560
that keeps all of the stability you know and love from OpenZFS

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.560
and FreeBSD and adds additional features

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.560
to create a fresh, innovative operating system.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:05.560
Our goal is to create a core-centric operating system

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.560
that is modular, functional, and perfect for do-it-yourself

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.560
and advanced users alike.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:19.560
TruOS will become a downstream fork that will build on FreeBSD

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:25.560
by integrating new software technologies like OpenRC and LibreSSL.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.560
My mind when I read this was blown

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:31.560
because TruOS to me was always known as BSD's attempt

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.560
to essentially make a Linux distribution,

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.560
to make a Linux desktop environment.

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.560
And they even have their own Qt-based desktop environment.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.560
I didn't know what to make of any of this.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.560
I've been trying to process this for a while

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.560
because to me this seems like a massive shift.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.560
And I did wonder if perhaps there was more to the story,

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.560
perhaps something with IAX,

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.560
something like, you know, going on behind the scenes.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.560
I wasn't quite sure.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.560
I had a chance, however, to talk with Alan,

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.560
I think it was, it came out this week,

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:04.560
episode 281 of Tech Talk today, Tech Talk.today slash 281.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:07.560
I had a chance to chat with one Mr. Alan Jude.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.560
And he was on for an extended edition of the Tech Talk program.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.560
And I grabbed a clip from that episode 281 of our conversation.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.560
And this is where we talked about TrueOS and PCBSD

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.560
and where this is all going and how Project Trident fits into all of this.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.560
Thank you.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:28.560
So what is now, what we have, Project, is it Trident and TrueOS,

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.560
which sounds like TrueOS now is going to be less of a desktop-focused BSD

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.560
and more of maybe like something that might be more server-side.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.560
And Project Trident will continue the desktop version

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.560
of what was TrueOS with the Illumos desktop.

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.560
What is, do I have this right and what's going on?

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.560
Illumina desktop, Illumina is the Solaris work.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.560
Anyway, so yeah, so Ike Systems had been sponsoring

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.560
PCBSD and TrueOS for a long time,

01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:01.560
but they really need to focus on building the bits that are,

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.560
become FreeNAS and TrueNAS and other appliances.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.560
So what they've done is spun off the desktop side

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.560
into a separate project and took TrueOS back to,

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:16.560
so when PCBSD was still called PCBSD, there was a project called TrueOS

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.560
and that was basically the modified version of FreeBSD

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.560
that runs FreeNAS and TrueNAS.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.560
Right, okay.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.560
And then when they wanted to rename PCBSD, they were like,

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:29.560
well, we just reuse this other name because we already own the trademark.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.560
And that's kind of creating the confusion.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:37.560
But basically now they're going back to TrueOS being that base for the appliances.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:42.560
But what they've added to it is a toolkit with these manifest.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.560
So if you want to make your own distro, you take TrueOS,

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.560
you write this manifest and say, I want these bits on, these bits off

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:54.560
and these packages and you press a button and blammo, you have Project Trident.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.560
That's awesome.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.560
Or the other one is, so they hired the developer from GhostBSD,

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.560
which is a FreeBSD desktop based on GNOME instead of Illumina or KDE.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:08.560
And he's rebased that on TrueOS as well.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:12.560
So they already have two examples and there will probably be a couple more coming soon

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.560
where it's just, you know, take this toolkit that is TrueOS

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.560
and make your desktop OS or make your appliance OS or whatever.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.560
That's nice.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.560
That's actually going to be real.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.560
And is it, it's actually appropriate to call them a distro?

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.560
That's allowed?

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.560
Basically, yes.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:33.560
So it turns Trident and GhostBSD and so on into distros of TrueOS.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.560
Oh, okay.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.560
Or spins maybe is a slightly better word because they're not that different like a distro.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.560
I'm calling them distros.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.560
I'm officially calling them distros.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.560
Alan June gave me permission.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.560
I'm calling them distros.

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:46.560
I love it.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.560
I love that they're working on a system D replacement.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.560
I love that they're working on a way to build distributions.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.560
I just think the whole thing is a very fascinating development.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:59.560
And so we'll have Project Trident exist still as a BSD desktop

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:04.560
and then you'll have TrueOS which is really being built possibly to run NASes

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.560
and other modular functions.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:12.560
So it's kind of complicated but when you hear Alan explain it all kind of makes sense I think.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.560
So that's what our cousins are up to over on the BSD side of things.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.560
It's a bit of a mess right now but I think this transition is going to make a lot of sense

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.560
when everything is all said and done.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.560
And the value of this is negative.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.560
I disagree.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.560
I disagree.

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.560
I think it's pretty positive.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:28.560
Get it out of here.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.560
Gosh, that guy.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.560
That guy.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.560
Yeah.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.560
And also happy 25th birthday to FreeBSD.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.560
Alan and I talked about that in our chat in Tech Talk 281.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:44.560
We also talked about like what it's like for him to go from being a project outsider

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:49.560
to now being one of the core members of FreeBSD and like what that transition is like

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.560
and what does that actually mean in terms of responsibilities.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.560
Like what is his job?

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.560
What does he have to do now that he's a core member of the FreeBSD team?

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560
We talk about that.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:02.560
But probably my favorite part of the show was there was this hilarious story

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:09.560
where Alan's entire town lost power and then over time like everybody's power

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.560
but Alan's house was restored.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.560
And so in the process of all this like Alan ends up with a new phone.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.560
He ends up going around to different stores.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.560
Like it was a great story.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.560
It was good to catch up with Alan and that was in the Tech Talk dot today slash 281.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:29.560
But maybe one day when Darktable gets moved over you'll be a Project Trident user, yeah?

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.560
I mean you could always kick the tires.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.560
Give us a little report from the field.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.560
It's always worth tire kicking, right?

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.560
No one should be scared of that.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.560
What is your daily Linux driver though?

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.560
Like what's the go-to?

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.560
Like say your drive died tonight and you got a new one tomorrow

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.560
and you just had to get back up and running.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.560
What would you install right now?

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.560
No judgment.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.560
Whatever it is, it's fine.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.560
So I'm playing with a few things.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.560
So every day here I'm using Arch with Plasma.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.560
But you mentioned if my laptop, for instance, got ran over by a dump truck.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.560
Yeah, the bus back.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.560
So in that case, I actually think you and I tested this a little bit

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:08.560
when I was down there seeing you for Linux Fest.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.560
And so I would say Kubuntu would get me up and running the fastest.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.560
However, I have to say I was testing it earlier and there's just a few little things

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.560
that were a little different for me.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.560
But that would get me out of a jam for sure.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.560
I mean, you seem to get by pretty well.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.560
Do you remember what those things were?

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.560
I didn't complain, did I?

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.560
No, not once.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:30.560
I think it's probably that I spend so much time building muscle memory

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:37.560
on what I have on my particular system that it was mostly little tiny.

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:44.560
So definitely one of the things was Dropbox's interface is super buggy

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.560
on KD for some reason.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.560
Yeah, like you left click, you get one result, you right click,

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.560
you get another result.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.560
I hate that.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.560
Or it drops down so you can only see, you know, it's awful.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.560
And maybe that doesn't matter because I'm trying to move away from Dropbox.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:02.560
So maybe it's just another little tick to get me to get motivated.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.560
Whatever the click is that causes the menu to show up below the bar,

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.560
use the other click and you don't ever have that problem.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.560
The problem is, as you can tell, I never remember if it's a right or a left click.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.560
But yeah, I feel the same way.

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.560
It's kind of been slowly moving me over to Nextcloud.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.560
Exactly.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.560
And actually just to iterate that point again,

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.560
I was literally needing to right click on the Dropbox icon five to seven times

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.560
for the menu to come up again after having that do.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560
And that's completely unacceptable.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560
I'm just trying to get stuff done.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.560
So that was one little thing.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.560
That's not a Kubuntu problem, I don't think.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.560
But it was like, you know, apps grouping,

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.560
which it's all little tiny usable stuff, usability stuff.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:50.560
But if I can get my system up and running after getting run over by a dump truck,

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.560
those would be very small things and I'd be smiling.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.560
You could make do.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.560
So that's interesting you say that.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.560
So I think the Plasma Desktop has a couple of challenges.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.560
I am a pretty tolerant guy to esoteric little things.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.560
I'm not so tolerant at other areas, but I can be pretty tolerant.

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:12.560
Like if I see upward momentum,

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:15.560
project seems like it's moving in the right direction and those kinds of things,

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.560
I can be forgiving on that kind of stuff.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.560
That's why I don't think I've even groused about that Dropbox problem once

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.560
because it's like I have faith having watched the Plasma Desktop over time

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.560
that either this is going to get solved or something else will change to solve that.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.560
But I think there is merit in what you're saying in that you could load

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:39.560
SUSE's implementation of Plasma and you get a whole set of defaults.

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:44.560
You can load KDE Neon and get pretty close to stock SANE defaults.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.560
And you can load Kubuntu and you get pretty close again,

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.560
but there's a few things that are different.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.560
There's a few things over here that are a little different.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:58.560
And that leads to, I think, a much slower adoption cycle.

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:03.560
It took me three solid tries of giving the Plasma Desktop a go

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:07.560
for multiple months at a time before it really stuck.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:10.560
It took the third switch for it to actually really stick.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.560
And one of the philosophies I adopted was,

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:21.560
the moment I notice a default or a setting is wrong, I have to change it.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.560
And I have to change as many of them as I can think of at that time.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.560
I know that sounds a little chaotic, but what it essentially does is,

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:35.560
it adds 5 to 20 minutes of overhead to the first week of using the Plasma Desktop.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.560
But then after that, it's pretty solid.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.560
Yeah, I'm just like you.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:44.560
I was working alongside someone earlier today when we were running into these things.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.560
And that's exactly what happened.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.560
I would dive immediately into sort of problem-solving mode

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.560
because I didn't want to have to deal with that ever again.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:58.560
And it's just little stuff, but it adds minutes and minutes and tens of minutes.

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.560
You just got to like swallow it for a bit.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.560
It's like the medicine you have to swallow for a bit, I think.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:06.560
But then once you get past that week, then it's like all of a sudden you're cruising.

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.560
Yeah, that's how I feel at least.

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:13.560
And if you had your choice, would your base be a rolling base

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.560
or would it be like an LTS stable base for your perfect desktop?

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:21.560
So I've been toying with a rolling, so I'm with Antargos.

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.560
I should roll the R there.

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.560
Yeah, Antargos.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.560
Antargos.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.560
And so maybe it's not fair to say that I'm running Archcache.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.560
I should give them some credit as well.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:38.560
And so I have really liked that implementation and that kind of rolling.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.560
It's that feeling you were talking about earlier, right?

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.560
Of just updating whenever you feel like it

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:46.560
and feeling like you're constantly sort of attached to the mothership somehow.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.560
Yeah, always getting the fresh stuff.

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.560
Yeah, it's nice.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.560
There's like little tiny things that you run into here and there

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.560
that you need to do little fixes sometimes that's, you know,

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.560
for maybe some of our audience is maybe okay.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:06.560
So I think for me that actually gives me just enough of a nudge to problem solving

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.560
to learn even more about Linux and how everything works.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.560
I think I'm at that stage.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.560
But for a recommendation that I make to users

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.560
that I'm either switching from other platforms

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.560
or who are moving from, you know, something like Linux Mint,

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.560
an older version of Linux Mint and looking for some options,

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:28.560
then I hesitate to certainly suggest the rolling release.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.560
But for me, it's a nice learning tool.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:32.560
Actually, I'll call it that.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.560
That makes a lot of sense.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.560
I like your philosophy on that.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.560
I just like to ask, you know, as I get to know people,

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.560
I like to kind of start to ask them like, so how are you using your computer

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.560
and why do you use it that way?

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.560
Because it often makes me reflect on the choices I've made.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.560
So I like asking those questions.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.560
I'd like to thank you for pushing Plasma so gently upon me.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.560
I switched to Plasma after coming back from Texas,

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.560
and I must say it is fantastic 5.13.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:18:59.560
You did.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.560
Yeah, it's wonderful.

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.560
It is wonderful.

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:05.560
On the desktop, on the laptop, it's wonderful.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:06.560
That is neat.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.560
On top of Arch as well.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.560
Yeah.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.560
All the latest freshness.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.560
Yeah.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.560
Yep.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.560
I'll save it because I've gone off on it enough.

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:21.560
But I was telling Noah how happy I am that I was able to leave the studio

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.560
for a month and everything worked.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.560
That's at Linux, yo.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.560
That's a huge benchmark for me.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.560
And you thought I wouldn't make it 30 days, dude.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:31.560
Did I say that?

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:34.560
Yeah, you actually said, you said, I'm not even going to clean these wires up

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:38.560
because I know in 30 days I'll be back here reloading all of this.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.560
Well, and so here's the thing.

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:44.560
I know it's weird because I feel like I live in two alternate realities sometimes.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.560
So the thing is simply restarting these machines would take the entire show

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.560
offline.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:52.560
And I do probably 50% of my shows outside of the studio.

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:56.560
So I needed an operating system that I could count on 100% of the time that is

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.560
always going to work.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.560
And so Linux has done that great for me.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.560
And at the same time that I'm living in that reality where the stakes are much,

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.560
much higher because I don't have anybody here to do anything if I'm not here,

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.560
at the same time I'm also living in a reality where it seems like we'll put

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.560
something in and I'm there.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.560
You're not doing anything different than I'm doing.

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:17.560
And I just watch weird, crazy problems that I've never seen before in my life

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:21.560
that other people, I will ask people like producer Michael Tonello, I'll say,

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.560
hey, this is what's happening.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.560
You ever seen this happen?

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.560
He'll say, no, never seen that.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.560
You found the magic smoke, man.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:28.560
I mean, that's, you know, and so I watched that and I don't know.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.560
So basically what I've come to the conclusion is I think you'd agree with

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.560
this is that JB one is cursed.

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.560
Yeah, it was, it's solar flares.

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.560
Yeah, we have, there's a hole in the, yeah, over the ozone right above the

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.560
studio and solar flares get in.

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.560
Yeah.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.560
So that, that like the physical location is cursed.

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.560
And so for that reason alone, I thought, well, it works everywhere else, but

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.560
if there's a one place it's not going to work, it'll be here.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.560
Yeah.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.560
Computers only do what you tell them, Noah.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.560
Come on, you know that.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.560
Yeah, everybody knows that.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:58.560
You say that, but we have three identical machines, identical builds.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.560
And at the moment, one of them is we swapped two of them, identical builds

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.560
and one of them works in one location and the other one, as far as I know,

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.560
is working upstairs in the other location.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.560
Well, you do have a show called User Error.

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:11.560
I mean.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.560
Yeah, that was, we can blame that one on Rekai though.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:16.560
He was part of that.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.560
Hey, User Error's not dead.

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:19.560
It's just, it's just on vacation.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.560
Hiatus.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:21.560
Yeah.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:22.560
I agree.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.560
I agree.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.560
I couldn't explain it either.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.560
However, now we've seemed to have landed on the right recipe.

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.560
Perhaps it's LTS across the board.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.560
Perhaps it's the maturity of plasma.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:35.560
Perhaps Chris is not in the studio anymore.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560
No.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:39.560
I've spent more time in studio than out of, so I don't think it's that.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.560
But yeah, it's been great.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.560
It has been so, so great.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:48.560
And I am super happy for everybody that's rocking XFCE or Unity or Cinnamon

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.560
or whatever your preference is.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:55.560
But if you're looking for a professional grade desktop environment that is adding

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.560
features that you see and you go, shit, how come nobody else has ever done that?

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.560
Well, that's Plasma Desktop.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.560
And now you can say it's also extremely stable.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:08.560
And I'm, you know, I'm using this thing daily across multiple machines, 24-7.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.560
It's just been fantastic for me.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.560
I have the same experience.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.560
I have it on three machines, and I've not had a single crash in two weeks.

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.560
That's, you know, compared to GNOME 3, that is like night and day.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.560
Yeah.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.560
And if you're out there using GNOME 3 going, God, I don't have any of these problems,

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:23.560
that's great.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.560
It is so great.

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.560
I wish I was you, actually.

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.560
So, Noah, since you and I got together on a Tuesday and did a podcast,

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:34.560
a lot of things have changed here at JB1.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:38.560
I put out the word saying, hey, I would like to try out PeerTube,

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.560
because YouTube sucks.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.560
YouTube is a horrible platform.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.560
It's only getting worse.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.560
And this PeerTube thing looks like it could actually work.

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:53.560
And holy crap, holy crap, if I didn't get more than a few people

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:54.560
taking me up on that offer.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:01.560
I spent Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday responding to people

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.560
offering to help us set up a PeerTube instance.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:05.560
And so we created a telegram group.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.560
I think it's like t.me slash PeerTube if you want to get involved.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:16.560
And Eric and a few others worked basically for the last three or four days

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:22.560
to set us up, not one, but two PeerTube instances,

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.560
one for the community to submit their own stuff,

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:29.560
and one that's like all JB shows, and the idea is going to be

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.560
a dedicated channel for each show.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.560
So there will be a Linux Unplugged channel,

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:36.560
Linux Action News channel, an Ask Noah channel,

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:40.560
and you can just subscribe to the channels that you enjoy.

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:44.560
And it's all based on peer-to-peer video streaming,

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.560
assuming other people are watching it.

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.560
Oh, man, it's been awesome.

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.560
It's been so great.

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.560
It's been so cool.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.560
We did the production installation,

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.560
so that way it's all running physically on the box.

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.560
It's not like a container.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.560
It's so great.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.560
If you want to check it out, in fact, check it out right now.

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.560
Tell me what you think.

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.560
Go to getjupiter.com, and we already have the domain set up.

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.560
I'm trying to decide.

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.560
I don't want to screw up.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.560
Okay, all right.

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.560
We'll go to getjupiter.

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:10.560
Wow, this is really cool.

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:11.560
What?

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.560
This is really amazing.

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:13.560
What, you already signed?

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.560
You already signed?

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.560
I may or may not have been chatting with Eric about this

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.560
since you guys set it up, but I don't want to ruin the show.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.560
I don't want to ruin the show, so this is amazing.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.560
This is so responsive, and you know what my favorite thing is?

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.560
There's no ads on the site.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.560
I click on a move, and instantly, boom, I'm watching Linux Action News.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.560
Yeah, so it has all of the advantages of YouTube

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.560
without all of the de-advantages of YouTube.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:34.560
Yeah, you are listening, aren't you?

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:35.560
It is.

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.560
It's clean.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.560
It's simple.

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.560
It's all the stuff you used to like about YouTube

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:40.560
without all the stuff you don't like.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.560
So, Eric, I've talked a lot about it,

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.560
but you did a lot of the behind-the-scenes work,

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.560
managing the Droplet,

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:49.560
setting up the Linux Rocks instance as well.

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:50.560
What have been your initial takeaways

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.560
of working with PeerTube on the backend?

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:55.560
Yeah, I mean, it was an amazingly easy setup.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.560
A couple of us spent a good portion of Wednesday and Thursday

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.560
putting off our day jobs to go in and install this thing,

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.560
and I think the biggest issue we had was

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:08.560
proxying NGINX on the backend to support a certificate

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.560
so we could do HTTPS.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.560
Oh, yeah, I bet.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.560
I hadn't even really noticed that,

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.560
but that slickness is already happening.

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.560
That is pretty good.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.560
And resources-wise, like setup time-wise,

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.560
give me an idea, like, what do you think?

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.560
Could you just throw this on a Raspberry Pi

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.560
or maybe does it take something a little more powerful?

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.560
And even using a high CPU Droplet,

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.560
easy for me to say,

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.560
we've seen that it's really, really slow transcoding

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.560
the first time through, but once it's up there,

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.560
it's amazingly quick.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.560
But I wouldn't use a Raspberry Pi.

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.560
In fact, we're looking at potentially tracking down

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.560
some physical hardware for the GitJupyter,

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:50.560
the official JB instance.

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:54.560
Yeah, yeah, that's sort of, I mean, big surprise, everybody.

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.560
Turns out running YouTube is not easy,

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.560
and when you build your own YouTube,

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.560
you have to solve some of the same problems like storage.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.560
And it's not just storage for the source video,

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.560
but it's also storage for all of the different iterations

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.560
that you might want to transcode for, like,

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.560
low bandwidth, high bandwidth.

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:12.560
So you have to store each one of those copies.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.560
And then how do you make those transcodes?

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.560
With CPU time.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.560
So when you upload a video,

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:21.560
it is a huge job for that server to transcode

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.560
three or four different versions of that video.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.560
And so you've got to build this thing in a way

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.560
in which your website remains responsive

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.560
while your CPU cores are burning away video.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.560
And we got through this, and I'm like,

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.560
oh, yeah, oh, yeah, running YouTube's hard.

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.560
That's what my first thought was, like,

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.560
oh, we're going to need way more CPU and way more bandwidth

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:44.560
and way more storage to pull this off.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:47.560
It's okay. It's all right. We have the means.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.560
But it did kind of make me, for a brief moment,

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.560
appreciate the hard work that Google does

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:54.560
to make YouTube actually function.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.560
And then one of my videos got flagged

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.560
as inappropriate for advertising,

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.560
and then I asked for it to be reviewed,

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.560
and then they told me it's still inappropriate for advertising

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:05.560
because I'm a bad person and I should feel bad.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:07.560
So then it reminded me why we're doing this.

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:10.560
And the player's been nice. It's worked really well.

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:13.560
I don't think we're quite at the embedded on the JB site yet,

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.560
but we're trending in that direction in one week.

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.560
We went from, hey, guys, I kind of want to do this thing

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:22.560
to I could see in the near future

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:25.560
we start swapping out YouTube embeds

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.560
for frickin' PeerTube embeds.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.560
That's a big deal. That's a really big deal.

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:35.560
And if you're, if you've, if your head's spinning like mine is,

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.560
this could be a game changer.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.560
They're doing an AMA.

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.560
FrameSoft and PeerTube are doing an AMA

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.560
over on the free software subreddit.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.560
It's probably to the day you're listening to this,

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.560
so you got to go get your questions in.

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.560
Is this something that I can donate

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.560
some of my spare compute cycles at home to?

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.560
Yeah, I don't think that's super easy to do yet.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.560
Like, you mean like just offload the CPU rendering for the video?

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.560
Right, yeah, I have 12 cores out here

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.560
doing not a lot most of the time, right?

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.560
Yeah, that's a good question.

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.560
I feel like it's not super easy

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.560
to break this thing out the way I'd like.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.560
I'd like to have one server responsible for the storage,

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.560
one server responsible for the transcoding,

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:12.560
and one server responsible for the website.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.560
And right now it's all kind of like one box.

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:17.560
Because if you can offload things like the CPU rendering

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.560
to like an auto scaling group or something,

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.560
maybe on Amazon or something,

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.560
maybe that's a way to do it.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.560
But, you know, you can engage the listeners,

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.560
and if there was some automation they could run

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.560
that would spin up, you know, some special thing on their,

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.560
like, container on their machine maybe

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:34.560
that just did transcoding as a worker just for you,

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:37.560
then I don't know if that's thinking quite outside the box maybe.

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.560
I like that idea.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.560
Initially, that's how it sounded,

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.560
but the more we dove into this, the more it sounds like

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.560
all the content is in one place.

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.560
And the distributed part,

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.560
where the torrent technology kicks in,

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.560
is while you're actually viewing the content.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:56.560
So if everyone went out and watched

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:58.560
this week's Tech Talk today at the same time,

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.560
then you'd really see the power of what PeerTube can do.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.560
But over the past week, it's mostly been one person here

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:07.560
and one person there watching the video.

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:11.560
So we haven't really seen the real power that this can bring us,

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.560
although I think a lot of us would agree

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.560
that if you take the same file off of YouTube

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.560
and put it onto PeerTube,

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.560
I think the quality is a lot better, both visual and audio.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.560
What about if you distributed the file system underneath or something?

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.560
I don't know, there's a lot of ways you could solve this.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.560
I think so.

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.560
I think there are particular,

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.560
back-end tricks we could do.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.560
But it is interesting to note that, and not too surprising,

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.560
the least intensive thing this system does is serve up video.

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.560
When a few of us are watching video

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.560
and you say you have HTOP going on the terminal,

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.560
I mean, you see a couple of NGINX processes,

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.560
but it's nothing because it's all client-side.

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.560
The work is being done client-side.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.560
So that part, like Eric was saying, is really cool.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:58.560
And definitely, to my eye,

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.560
although it could be the free software

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:03.560
roast into glasses that I sometimes have on,

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:06.560
but to my eye, the videos look crisper.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:12.560
When I upload the same source MP4 file to PeerTube and to YouTube,

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:16.560
the version that PeerTube publishes, to my eye, looks better.

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:17.560
So that's also awesome.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.560
I didn't even expect a quality improvement

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.560
when we started talking about this.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:23.560
So it's positive in the freedom dimension, is it?

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.560
It is.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.560
Yeah, and if you were doing something small

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:29.560
for like an office or yourself, friends and family,

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:33.560
like the stuff we're talking about, like CPU time and storage,

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.560
are way less of a consideration.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:39.560
If you're not publishing eight videos a week

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.560
and putting them out to tens of thousands of people,

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:47.560
it's really no big deal to wait an hour for a video to render.

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.560
You don't have to put it on a super fast box.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:51.560
It's really no big deal to store 50 or 60 videos

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.560
because you can accommodate for that.

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:58.560
So PeerTube, I think, is totally at the individual level right now,

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.560
small groups, projects.

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:02.560
If you have an open source project out there

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:04.560
and you've got four or five videos that you want to share with the world

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.560
and you'd like to embed them on your website,

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.560
you could be using PeerTube today.

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:10.560
You don't need to use YouTube.

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.560
That's massive.

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.560
That's a massive achievement.

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:17.560
We now have a video platform that is accessible and available

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.560
to free software projects today,

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:23.560
and they have a total end-to-end solution for publishing videos,

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:28.560
embedding videos, sharing videos, comments, all of it.

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.560
PeerTube is really impressive.

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.560
It's way further along than I expected.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.560
It did take some fiddling, so I really appreciate, Eric,

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.560
you taking the time to sort of spearhead that

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.560
and working with the rest of the group to make sure it happens.

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.560
It's been a team effort there, and I really appreciate it

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:45.560
because you guys have had the opportunity

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.560
and also the motivation to fiddle with it,

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:50.560
where for me it was like, okay, I can see this has promise,

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.560
but I don't think I can take it any further.

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:55.560
But since you guys did, I really see the promise now, so thank you.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.560
Yeah, I mean, it's been a great project,

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:00.560
and for someone like me who doesn't have the time or the resources

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:04.560
to build up an entire broadcasting chain like JB has

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.560
or like ASNO has developed,

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:09.560
it's an interesting chance to kind of test the waters

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:11.560
as a potential content creator myself.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.560
On the Linux Rocks PeerTube instance,

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:18.560
I uploaded a couple of the podcasts that I recorded in November

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:21.560
before my wife had our baby,

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:24.560
and so just throwing it up there just so someone can see it,

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.560
just so I have it linked somewhere that's not YouTube.

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:29.560
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.560
So if you guys want to check out what we've got so far,

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560
there's two URLs.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.560
There is getjupiter.com,

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:39.560
which I think will be eventually like the official release channel

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:42.560
of Jupiter Broadcasting and PeerTube videos if we get there,

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.560
and I think we're going to get there.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.560
And then there's peertube.linuxrocks.online,

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:49.560
peertube.linuxrocks.online.

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:52.560
That is, unless I'm wrong, Eric,

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.560
that's still allowing community signups, right?

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.560
So once you sign up, you can upload a video.

01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:00.560
Yeah, we're doing community signups on Linux Rocks,

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:04.560
but getjupiter is locked down to official content only.

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:09.560
And a cool plug for the Mastodon side, the Linux Rocks side,

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:14.560
is there is experimental functionality to tie PeerTube

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.560
into the Mastodon software.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.560
So we're eventually going to tie Linux Rocks

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.560
and peertube.linuxrocks together.

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.560
Yeah.

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.560
So I'm not exactly sure what all the functionality that brings,

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:28.560
but it's going to be really cool.

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.560
An open source Kumbaya.

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.560
You could see that, right?

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:34.560
Because what YouTube really gives you is audience.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.560
It gives you a platform for people to come see your stuff.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:41.560
But if PeerTube can solve that with integration and a Mastodon

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:45.560
and federation and whatnot, I think it makes a pretty big difference.

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:47.560
Like it doesn't completely solve the problem,

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:50.560
but it goes a large way of solving the problem.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:54.560
So I would totally encourage you guys, go to getjupiter.com.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.560
Try out the few videos we have there.

01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:57.560
Let us know what you think.

01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.560
And check out the Linux Rocks instance,

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.560
peertube.linuxrocks.online.

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.560
Maybe try creating an account and upload it.

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.560
Get your feet wet.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:05.560
See what could happen.

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:06.560
Chris, I have a question for you.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:07.560
Yeah.

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.560
How many domain names do you own?

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.560
You know, it's funny you ask me that,

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.560
because I just went through the other day and checked,

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.560
and it's something like 50-something domain names.

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:16.560
50-plus.

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:17.560
Oh, geez.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.560
I used to have GoDaddy as a sponsor.

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:22.560
So I would just buy them all the time.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.560
And then whenever Danica would call me,

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.560
I'd be like, I just got this new domain, baby.

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:28.560
She'd be like, really?

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.560
I'd be like, oh, yeah.

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:30.560
Oh, yeah, it's.com.

01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:32.560
It always was a good conversation starter.

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:35.560
Hey, Mr. Noah, what's coming up on the Ask Noah program today?

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:36.560
We get all sorts of stuff.

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:40.560
Obviously, we're going to dive into this Google's announcement

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:46.560
that they are going to get into the game streaming, I guess, platform.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.560
What?

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.560
Yeah, it's going to be – it's kind of crazy.

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.560
You like that?

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.560
You just picture my face fat slapping around as I do that.

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.560
No, I need an audio.

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.560
I need an – you know, if I ever – I tell you what, I'll make you a deal.

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:02.560
You ever get me a high-wave sample audio, and I'll put a soundboard in it.

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.560
You've been asking me to do that since day one.

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.560
That has to be – that's clip one.

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.560
I'll do a soundboard.

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:10.560
Yes, anyway, we're going to talk about the Google hardware platform for

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:13.560
streaming because I think that streaming games is going to be the future

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:15.560
of how gaming is done.

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.560
Of course, I'm sure you guys talked about this.

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.560
Soos got bought out.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.560
And, you know, that's exciting.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.560
And let me get a couple other things, too.

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.560
I want to talk about privacy.

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:31.560
I had an interesting discussion on YouTube, as it were, coming full circle

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.560
with some of the people that are viewers on there.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:37.560
And they kind of gave me a hard time for my take on privacy.

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:41.560
I'm going to make an audacious claim, and that is that mining user data

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:48.560
and collecting user data and looking at user data and analyzing that can be a

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:52.560
really good thing for users if it's done properly and with respect.

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.560
And I think that we're so predisposed to just think of data collection

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:57.560
as a bad thing.

01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.560
And I think, as users, we kind of screw ourselves out of the benefits that

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:04.560
can be brought if companies do that responsibly.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.560
Oh, man.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:06.560
That's a great one.

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:07.560
That's a good conversation.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:09.560
You got to wonder, too, like, what did you expect?

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.560
Like, all these years, you know, we've been advocating for the adoption

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.560
of the Linux desktop.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.560
We've been proponents of people switching to Linux.

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:16.560
Right.

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:19.560
Well, when you start to arrive there, you've got to have real numbers

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.560
and data for software companies and vendors to go off of.

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.560
Like, what did you expect once you get there?

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:25.560
Exactly.

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:29.560
And one of the comments was the real reason for forced reporting is that

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:32.560
even if you uncheck the telemary boxes, it reports that you installed Ubuntu.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.560
And that's a number that you get to show in small business meeting.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:37.560
My question back is, so what?

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.560
So what?

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.560
Interesting.

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.560
Yeah.

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.560
There's obviously, yeah, that's a good conversation because there's

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.560
obviously some dynamics to that, some, you know, some edge cases.

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:48.560
And there's, of course, all of the horrible things we hear about with

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.560
Windows 10 and spying on Google.

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:51.560
Yeah.

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:52.560
Oh, yeah, for sure.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:53.560
Yeah, boy.

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:54.560
So where is that?

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.560
Where is that sweet spot?

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.560
Well, sounds like I need to tune into the Ask Noah program to hear the

01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:58.560
rest of that conversation.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:36:59.560
I have good news for you.

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:00.560
I have great news for you.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.560
It's coming up right after the Linux Unplugged program.

01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:05.560
It's like people should just show up on Tuesday and they get a little unplugged.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.560
In fact, if you got here around 1.30-ish, I think today the pre-show

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.560
technically started around, like, 1.10.

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.560
So, I mean, like, you show up a little early, you get quite the Linux

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.560
afternoon over at jblive.tv.

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:19.560
All of that converted to your local time at jupitabroadcasting.com

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:20.560
slash calendar.

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:25.560
Links to everything we talked about today at linuxunplugged slash 256.

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:28.560
Brent, is there anywhere you'd like to send folks to, maybe a Twitter handle

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.560
or something like that if they want to get a little more Brent during the day?

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.560
Yeah, sure.

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:34.560
Twitter, so I'm not super active there, but I'll certainly see if anybody

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.560
wants to say hi.

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:41.560
That's at Brent Gervais, so B-R-E-N-T-G-E-R-V-A-I-S.

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.560
And I've got a neat little website, BrentGervais.com.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.560
Yeah, we have all that linked in the show notes as well if you want lazy

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:48.560
links for that.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.560
Thank you to the Mumble Room for making it today.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.560
You are welcome to join us as well.

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.560
It's all available.

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:55.560
If you just search for like Jupyter Colony Mumble Guide, you'll actually get

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.560
a whole guide that producer Michael wrote up.

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:02.560
But the lazy way is just to head over to our IRC room, and then you just do

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.560
Bang Mumble, and then the J-Bot will just give you all the instructions you

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.560
need to hang out with us right there.

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.560
Talk about making it as easy as possible.

01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:11.560
So you have all the details you need.

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.560
You know how to get a hold of us.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.560
You know where to find the links.

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.560
You know how to participate.

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.560
The rest is just all up to you.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:21.560
You can listen or get as involved as you would like.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:23.560
It's kind of the beauty of the Unplugged program.

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:26.560
We have a space for you if you want to get into the conversation, you want to

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:27.560
get your voice heard.

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:28.560
It's open.

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.560
But if you just want to sit back and get every single episode when they come

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:35.560
out, go to linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe, and then we'll make that

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:36.560
possible.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.560
We'll work to make that possible.

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:41.560
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:51.560
And if you didn't know, we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:20.560
Unplugged.

01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.560
Oh man, what are we going to title this thing?

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.560
Oh, this is going to be impossible.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.560
This is the show that cannot be titled.

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.560
We covered way too much stuff.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.560
We got to just keep it to like one topic and then we could just easily title.

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.560
We'll make like a 15 minute show and then we'll just call it whatever we

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.560
talk about for that 15 minutes.

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.560
Before we get out of here, I do want to mention, probably should have included

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.560
this in the community news.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.560
It just didn't really kind of fit.

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:51.560
But the Humble Bundle folks have a big DRM freedom sale up to 90% off and a

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:52.560
bunch of these games.

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:53.560
Let's see.

01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:58.560
The first row, the second row, the third row, all of them.

01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.560
Wow.

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.560
Wow.

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:02.560
All of the games, at least on the front page, have Linux versions.

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:05.560
So there's a big Humble Bundle sale up to 70.

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:06.560
No, 90.

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:07.560
Look at this one.

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:08.560
This one's 75% off.

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.560
This one's 85% off.

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.560
This one's 90% off.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:13.560
Holy crap.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.560
So Humble Bundle's got a huge sale going.

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.560
That's nice.

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:18.560
Check that out.

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.560
More games for my list of shame.

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.560
I know.

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560
Just make your list larger and larger.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:26.560
Chris, have you ever played Factorio?

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.560
No.

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:28.560
Oh my God.

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.560
Factorio is the best game in the world.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:34.560
So we had a consultant over the weekend that was working on some projects

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:37.560
with us, and he's a huge gaming guy.

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:39.560
He loves Factorio.

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.560
And so I had him over at the house, and he got my son into it.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:46.560
And we blew most of Saturday sitting around playing Factorio,

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:47.560
and now I'm addicted to it.

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:50.560
I have 500 plus hours in that game.

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:51.560
What?

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:52.560
It's so addicting.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:53.560
It's unbelievable.

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.560
It's so addicting.

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:55.560
Have I not heard of this?

01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:57.560
If you ever play it, it just ruins marriages.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:58.560
Factorio.

01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.560
I believe that.

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.560
And your parent relationship.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.560
I haven't seen my two daughters.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.560
I think I just don't remember what they look like, but I haven't seen them.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.560
Because they're not playing Factorio.

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:08.560
Is this a math game?

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.560
What is this?

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.560
No, no, no.

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.560
It's the best game ever.

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.560
You build a factory.

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:13.560
That's it.

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.560
Kind of, yeah.

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.560
So imagine this.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.560
You know, in Minecraft or any of these other games you like,

01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.560
you would mine copper or whatever, right?

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:20.560
Okay.

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.560
But that takes a lot of work.

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.560
So isn't it cooler to build a drill and then fill it with coal

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.560
and have the drill mine the copper ore?

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:27.560
Oh, but wait.

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:28.560
It gets better.

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:31.560
Because what if you had a drill that was powered by coal that mined the coal?

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.560
And the way it could get even better though,

01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:37.560
because what if we had a machine that was powered by coal that generated electricity

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:40.560
and instead of all these drills that run on coal, they run on electricity.

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.560
So then you only have to maintain your electrical plant

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.560
and then all of these other things that could be mined.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.560
Oh, wait.

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.560
It gets better.

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.560
Because why would you want to do all that by hand?

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.560
You can put belts between them all.

01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:52.560
So the drill can automatically mine the coal and the coal can go by belt

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.560
over to the electric.

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:54.560
You can see how this gets really interesting.

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:57.560
And then there's the trains and then there's, oh my goodness.

01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:00.560
So you have this whole supply chain and you think, right,

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.560
I want to make this many rockets per minute or whatever,

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:06.560
which is the end game goal.

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:09.560
And then you think, right, well, I need more iron plates to do that.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:12.560
And to do that, I need more of this and more of that.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.560
So when you think you want to do one small, simple thing,

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:18.560
it's a four-hour refactor of your entire base.

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:20.560
It's just amazing.

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.560
That sounds like real life.

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:22.560
That's awful.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.560
But it's amazing.

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:27.560
It's available on Steam as early access.

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:30.560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:31.560
You can get it.

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.560
You can get it DRM free from Humble Indie Bundle.

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.560
And it gets even better.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.560
They'll give you a key to redeem it on Steam after you buy it from them.

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:39.560
So you get it both ways.

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.560
Yeah, I love that.

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:41.560
And they never ever put it on sale.

01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.560
It's been 20 bucks for the entire time.

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:48.560
And the dev team are the most amazing people.

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:50.560
It has really good reviews.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.560
So, huh.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.560
Yes, Mr. Cheese Bacon, I do love street and highway planning.

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:55.560
That is true.

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:58.560
I couldn't imagine.

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.560
But I could definitely get into one of those games.

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:06.560
But I kind of would have to do it like maybe like next week when I'm traveling

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:09.560
and I'm just stuck in a hotel room with nothing to do.

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:10.560
God, it sounds horrible.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.560
It's amazing for a flight.

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:13.560
It's really good for a flight.

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:14.560
Oh, sure.

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:15.560
Yeah.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:16.560
You'll go, oh, I have to miss.

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:17.560
I have to get on my plane.

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:19.560
Oh, no, I guess I'll take the next one because I'm busy

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.560
and I have to redo my electrical plant.

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.560
Yes.

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.560
I miss meals over this.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:24.560
Yes.

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:26.560
I now hate you all.

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.560
I just bought it.

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:30.560
You'll hate us more next week.

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:33.560
And next week there is no Linux unplug because Chris has been sucked into a game.

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:34.560
Thank you for bringing that up, Noah.

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:36.560
It is my favorite game of all time.

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.560
All right.

01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.560
I was used to it.

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.560
There's literally only one game I ever played.

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:41.560
It was Counter Strike.

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:44.560
And then I got sucked into Factorio and I haven't found my way back out.

01:43:44.560 --> 01:44:01.560
Factorio, Sim City 4, and Transport Tycoon are my top three.
