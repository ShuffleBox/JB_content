00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is BSD Unplugged, episode 34, for April 1st, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.880
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show that's too busy getting actual

00:40.880 --> 00:44.160
work done to care about what your silly display server.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.160
My name is Alan.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.160
Get it out of here.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.160
What?

00:47.160 --> 00:48.160
How did that guy get in there?

00:48.160 --> 00:49.160
No, that's not what we're doing this week.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.160
We're just having a little fun.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.160
Hello, everybody.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.160
Welcome to Linux Unplugged.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.160
Hey there, Matt.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.160
Hey, how's it going?

00:54.160 --> 00:55.160
Oh, good.

00:55.160 --> 00:59.160
You know, it is April Fools, and so this week we're going to stick it to a little bit of

00:59.160 --> 01:00.320
an April Fool.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.600
We're not talking about BSD, but we had to let those guys give us a little bit of a poke,

01:04.600 --> 01:05.600
right?

01:05.600 --> 01:07.220
How great was Alan's intro, too?

01:07.220 --> 01:08.220
Check it out.

01:08.220 --> 01:12.320
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show that's too busy getting actual work

01:12.320 --> 01:14.880
done to care about what your silly display server.

01:14.880 --> 01:15.880
My name is Alan.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.680
I like his enunciation on actual work.

01:17.680 --> 01:23.400
Yeah, you can feel a little bit of BSD superiority in it.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.840
Well so this week, we're going to talk about somebody that I have actually quite a bit

01:27.840 --> 01:28.840
of respect for.

01:28.840 --> 01:34.360
Not only did I watch him when I was a youngster on ZDTV and then later TechTV, but also I

01:34.360 --> 01:39.040
really respect him for what he's done for the podcast industry, quote, unquote.

01:39.040 --> 01:45.200
But this last week, this Saturday, Mr. Leo Laporte went on his national radio show and

01:45.200 --> 01:50.120
trashed Linux kind of in a bad way, and he kind of trashed it for things that actually

01:50.120 --> 01:51.660
aren't strengths.

01:51.660 --> 01:55.440
So I want to play those clips, and we'll use that as an opportunity to kind of do a little

01:55.440 --> 02:00.680
FUD debunking here on Linux Unplugged and discuss maybe what he got wrong and maybe

02:00.680 --> 02:04.320
what he could have said instead, because not everything he said was incorrect.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.960
So we're going to discuss that, and then if we have a little bit of time left over, I

02:07.960 --> 02:12.880
want to discuss Ubuntu dropping the Amazon lenses from the default search.

02:12.880 --> 02:18.740
So not in 14.04 necessarily, but starting in Unity 8, whenever that lands on whatever

02:18.740 --> 02:24.360
device you run it on, when you search in the dash, it won't by default query Amazon for

02:24.360 --> 02:25.560
shopping results anymore.

02:25.560 --> 02:29.520
Now technically, I don't think it's going to really query any scope particularly, but

02:29.520 --> 02:32.200
it's kind of a reversal on a position that Canonical's had for a while.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.600
So if we have time, we're going to discuss that as well.

02:34.600 --> 02:38.000
But first, Matt, a little bit of business we have to take care of.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.320
We generated a ton of feedback last week when we were talking about the whole mirror Wayland

02:42.320 --> 02:46.640
situation again, and I got a lot of heat.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.280
People really stuck it to me.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.800
I guess they didn't like it when I went on to rant.

02:51.800 --> 02:55.480
So I want to cover a couple of those things because we got a couple of different, I mean,

02:55.480 --> 03:01.600
seriously, it was probably 55, 60, you know, individual emails that address this topic,

03:01.600 --> 03:03.240
and I'm not going to put all of them in the show.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.240
Wow.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.240
Yeah.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.240
Oh my.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.160
We would need a feedback show for our feedback show if I covered all that feedback.

03:08.160 --> 03:12.440
So what we're going to do is, I couldn't even read all of them, although I will try to make

03:12.440 --> 03:15.480
sure to get to all of them before the next Linux action show, but what I want to start

03:15.480 --> 03:21.440
with is the few that I did put aside that I thought represented maybe a larger majority

03:21.440 --> 03:22.440
of the opinions.

03:22.440 --> 03:26.760
And our first one came in from Merlin and he says, uh, dear Chris, sorry, Matt, but

03:26.760 --> 03:28.560
this one's for Chris.

03:28.560 --> 03:32.320
Your breathless rage against me really blew me away, but not in a good sense.

03:32.320 --> 03:36.840
I share your views on a lot of the topics, but not on this one.

03:36.840 --> 03:41.760
Even if I would share your views, I would never express them so bluntly.

03:41.760 --> 03:46.040
I am very grateful that Popey was able to react so civil and polite to your rage.

03:46.040 --> 03:50.480
I admire that you try to show both sides of the story, but this time you failed.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.800
Again, thanks to Popey for showing the other side of this subject.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.200
You're very passionate about making the Linux desktop breakthrough to the masses.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.760
You see, we're very close to that point and you are very afraid that something will go

04:01.760 --> 04:02.760
wrong.

04:02.760 --> 04:06.680
You direct that fear to Ubuntu, while Ubuntu is the one, is one of the reasons we've even

04:06.680 --> 04:07.980
gotten this far.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.840
Why don't you have more faith in Ubuntu?

04:09.840 --> 04:14.800
How long until you see that all the dumb choices Ubuntu makes are the kind of choices Linux

04:14.800 --> 04:15.800
needs?

04:15.800 --> 04:16.800
I support Ubuntu completely.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.520
I am part of the community and Ubuntu did not alienate me at all.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.760
In fact, the opposite is true.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.520
Ubuntu is the reason I am excited about Linux.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.880
Ubuntu is the reason I'll stick with Linux.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.920
The direction Ubuntu is taking is the direction I want Linux to go.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.720
With kind regards, Merlin.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.280
That's definitely...

04:34.280 --> 04:40.360
So to recap, I think what I'm mainly concerned about is Mirror and Wayland creating such

04:40.360 --> 04:45.160
technical differences at the core level of Linux that you'll have application inconsistencies

04:45.160 --> 04:47.360
across desktops and distros.

04:47.360 --> 04:53.680
Even if it was maybe Gnome on an Ubuntu machine after you installed Wayland or something like

04:53.680 --> 04:54.680
that.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.680
It could still be an Ubuntu base.

04:55.680 --> 04:59.000
Maybe it's Mint and they go with Wayland and they have Cinnamon running on top of Wayland.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.680
Well, so when you're on Mint with Cinnamon and Wayland, maybe Thunderbird doesn't pop

05:03.680 --> 05:04.680
up a new mail notification.

05:04.680 --> 05:09.520
And when you're on Unity on Ubuntu, you get the new mail notification or vice versa.

05:09.520 --> 05:14.200
That kind of inconsistency, I argued, is once again Linux not bringing its A game to now

05:14.200 --> 05:18.040
a fight that is being dominated by Google and Apple who not only bring their A game

05:18.040 --> 05:21.600
but bring it to a level we have never seen it before in the technology industry.

05:21.600 --> 05:27.160
Now Merlin feels that perhaps, you know, I think what I'm kind of extracting from Merlin's

05:27.160 --> 05:32.280
email is the other distributions, the community as a whole, is never going to have a chance

05:32.280 --> 05:34.560
to succeed entirely on its own.

05:34.560 --> 05:39.600
And you need a standout player to rise above the noise, choose the best, build where there

05:39.600 --> 05:45.400
isn't something that does the job, and maybe perhaps at the cost of the others, but at

05:45.400 --> 05:50.040
least one true Linux will stand alone and have users.

05:50.040 --> 05:57.400
The problem is, if you have a long perspective on Linux, and Matt I know you totally are

05:57.400 --> 06:01.940
in this camp with me, when you have the long tail perspective on Linux, you know that things

06:01.940 --> 06:04.260
come and go in Linux.

06:04.260 --> 06:08.400
There are some things that have been around for a while, but no distro is necessarily

06:08.400 --> 06:13.840
forever, even if it's maybe still around, it's not maybe as popular as it once was.

06:13.840 --> 06:20.080
So to bet everything on one particular commercial entity is sort of negating the benefits of

06:20.080 --> 06:26.320
having this open community where things are being developed freely amongst multiple stakeholders,

06:26.320 --> 06:33.140
yes I said stakeholders, that is actually, even though it's this weird organic evolutionary

06:33.140 --> 06:39.080
growth that doesn't have awesome ass keynotes where we just are blowing everybody away with

06:39.080 --> 06:44.560
a great demo, it means that there is this general purpose computing platform that is

06:44.560 --> 06:48.520
being worked on by thousands of people with thousands of different reasons to work on

06:48.520 --> 06:53.800
it, and together in harmony they're moving something incredible forward that's like nothing

06:53.800 --> 06:54.880
else.

06:54.880 --> 07:00.620
And when you silo all of that up into one distribution, you're kind of negating some

07:00.620 --> 07:01.620
of those benefits.

07:01.620 --> 07:07.560
I mean that distribution is able to build on top of the shoulders of those giants, but

07:07.560 --> 07:11.080
it's also sending a ton of risk to one particular silo.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.680
What do you think of that?

07:12.680 --> 07:17.160
I think that's absolutely correct, especially when you consider the fact that the biggest

07:17.160 --> 07:21.640
strength that Linux on the desktop has is the fact that there's so many different options

07:21.640 --> 07:23.040
out there.

07:23.040 --> 07:28.960
Historically there have been very popular Ubuntu-like distributions that honestly a

07:28.960 --> 07:35.160
few people thought were really it, and things change, priorities go a different direction.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.540
Anything could happen, you never know, and to put all your chips in that one basket is

07:38.540 --> 07:42.120
incredibly short-sighted, so I agree with you there.

07:42.120 --> 07:47.000
Now coming back to his original point, I would stand with him in the idea that I'm going

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
to wait and see.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.180
I don't necessarily think it's going to completely go to hell until I actually see it do that.

07:51.180 --> 07:54.000
I think that we're maybe jumping the gun just a little bit.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.480
I have faith in Ubuntu to at least give them enough – I'm going to give them a chance

07:57.480 --> 08:01.540
before I completely just write them off as screwing everything up, but at the same time

08:01.540 --> 08:07.400
I would agree with you in that putting all your balls in that basket, into one distribution's

08:07.400 --> 08:10.520
basket, is incredibly short-sighted, very, very short-sighted.

08:10.520 --> 08:14.160
I think Colby is going to kind of fall in line here.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.100
He says, hey there Chris and Matt.

08:16.100 --> 08:19.200
I just finished listening to episode 33 and I just thought I'd share my perspective on

08:19.200 --> 08:20.200
this issue.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.280
I agree completely with your assertion that the amateur hour handling of small details

08:23.280 --> 08:25.800
on Linux desktop is a problem for future adoption.

08:25.800 --> 08:30.760
However, while you admonish Ubuntu for making the situation worse, I actually praise them

08:30.760 --> 08:33.000
for getting things done.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.360
I envision the following scenario happening, and I like this Matt, so put on your theater

08:37.360 --> 08:38.360
of the mind cap.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.360
Okay.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.720
He says, imagine a table full of Linux celebrities sitting around arguing about the future of

08:42.720 --> 08:43.720
the Linux desktop.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.040
You've got Gnome and KDE guys, they're going back and forth as they've been for

08:47.040 --> 08:51.080
a decade now, and you've got the GPL 2 and the GPL 3 guys, they're bantering back

08:51.080 --> 08:52.080
and forth.

08:52.080 --> 08:55.280
Of course the video driver binary blob camp versus the open kernel driver camp and the

08:55.280 --> 08:57.240
dev versus RPM advocates are there.

08:57.240 --> 09:01.200
The rolling versus non-rolling release crew and the system D versus upstart folks are

09:01.200 --> 09:05.040
also there, all sitting around yelling at each other about how someone is killing the

09:05.040 --> 09:06.740
desktop Linux.

09:06.740 --> 09:11.360
At some point, Canonical pushes back their chair, stands up and says, look, you guys

09:11.360 --> 09:16.020
can sit here and argue about almost literally everything in the Linux ecosystem if you want.

09:16.020 --> 09:17.120
Have that at Haas.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.160
While you do that, we're going to go over here and start building software in a platform

09:20.160 --> 09:22.020
that actual people use.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.260
All of you guys do good work.

09:24.260 --> 09:27.960
But it's a shame that instead of actually accomplishing something tangible, you spend

09:27.960 --> 09:31.600
all this time and energy spinning your wheels in all of these academic discussions.

09:31.600 --> 09:37.240
If you need us, we'll be over there, in the corner, making and selling actual products.

09:37.240 --> 09:44.480
Later, AC goes on to say, I too have given up on the greater Linux community and have

09:44.480 --> 09:46.640
adopted a more practical philosophy.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.720
The first group that actually releases something that works and is widely supported is the

09:49.720 --> 09:50.720
so-called winner.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.100
I'll let others have all the academic discussions about the future of Linux desktop because

09:54.100 --> 09:58.440
quite honestly, the only practical Linux desktop that has any chance of doing anything in the

09:58.440 --> 10:02.680
marketplace is to build an ecosystem and build an ecosystem is Ubuntu.

10:02.680 --> 10:06.540
The broad Linux ecosystem is far too fragmented to ever have a chance.

10:06.540 --> 10:09.200
It's always been that way and it doesn't look to change anytime soon.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.200
Keep up the good work.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.720
At this point, Jupiter Broadcasting has a monopoly on my media consumption.

10:13.720 --> 10:14.720
Thanks, Colby.

10:14.720 --> 10:15.720
Nice.

10:15.720 --> 10:21.200
You know, and it kind of makes me think back to what Alan was saying there during the intro.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.200
It really kind of brings it home.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.840
You know, it's an interesting point because I think that the unification is going to have

10:25.840 --> 10:27.280
to happen at some level.

10:27.280 --> 10:31.700
That's not to say other distributions can't perhaps come to a group think mentality to

10:31.700 --> 10:36.240
maybe where we get two or three that are able to come on board, maybe picking up with what

10:36.240 --> 10:37.240
Ubuntu is doing.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.240
Who knows?

10:38.240 --> 10:43.040
But you know, I've come to the realization that I think Ubuntu, like anybody, is going

10:43.040 --> 10:45.640
to make – as a group, they're going to make mistakes.

10:45.640 --> 10:50.840
But historically, again, looking long term, they have been pretty darn good about rectifying

10:50.840 --> 10:51.840
them.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.520
I don't know for my taste, but they do rectify those mistakes.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.520
Yeah.

10:55.520 --> 11:00.760
And I think, too, that there's a valid point in actually going off and making something,

11:00.760 --> 11:05.320
but I think you have to underscore that the foundation in which they will be making that

11:05.320 --> 11:11.720
something under is QT, the Linux kernel, GNU Utils, the GPL itself, the community that

11:11.720 --> 11:15.340
Linux itself brings, the advocacy that that group brings.

11:15.340 --> 11:18.000
It is not something created out of whole cloth.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.120
It is something that is created because all of these groups that he said are arguing with

11:21.120 --> 11:23.440
themselves all the time actually do produce things.

11:23.440 --> 11:29.480
But the thing is, it is certainly seeing the entire – the trees amongst the whole forest

11:29.480 --> 11:32.760
where when you are standing in the forest, all you just see is a whole bunch of trees

11:32.760 --> 11:34.720
right in front of you having fights.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.320
You know, stick fights.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.320
You know, right?

11:37.320 --> 11:38.320
Tree stick fights.

11:38.320 --> 11:41.480
Well, and also, not only that, but I think like QT and all these sort of things, they're

11:41.480 --> 11:42.480
fighting.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.800
You see these groups fighting amongst themselves, and a lot of times, the things they're fighting

11:45.800 --> 11:48.600
over may not make sense to the casual user.

11:48.600 --> 11:52.400
It's lots of low-level stuff that most people are rolling their eyes thinking, God, who

11:52.400 --> 11:53.400
cares?

11:53.400 --> 11:54.400
In reality, we should care.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.400
We've established this.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.720
But again, visually, it doesn't seem that appealing.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.200
It doesn't actually execute the solution right now.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.520
I think people see Ubuntu as coming along and saying, look, we're going to take a

12:03.520 --> 12:04.520
step back.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.520
We'll do our thing.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.920
We'll watch them do theirs, and at the end of the day, we'll probably use what's

12:07.920 --> 12:08.920
best for us.

12:08.920 --> 12:13.920
I think the point I was trying to make last week is that I think that's absolutely reasonable

12:13.920 --> 12:16.320
and a rational position to take.

12:16.320 --> 12:21.800
The flip side is I wanted to argue, and I hope I successfully argue, that there are

12:21.800 --> 12:27.040
some components within the Linux user land that our resources are so scarce, and the

12:27.040 --> 12:34.560
expertise required to work those things is so high that it can literally be maybe a handful

12:34.560 --> 12:40.840
of people, five, six, a dozen people in the entire industry that know how to do this work.

12:40.840 --> 12:47.120
When you split our focus at that level, that split reaches from the beginning of that expertise

12:47.120 --> 12:52.200
to create a display server and reaches all the way up to developers making desktop applications.

12:52.200 --> 12:58.160
What it essentially creates is Ubuntu, or let's just call it, it essentially creates

12:58.160 --> 13:00.040
a mirror versus Wayland.

13:00.040 --> 13:04.080
The competition for Ubuntu becomes the other Linux distributions in some sense.

13:04.080 --> 13:08.800
Not completely, not outright, because there's still an all rising tide boats thing happening.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.960
But there is a sense where developers will have to make the choice.

13:12.960 --> 13:17.120
What is the primary platform I want to target?

13:17.120 --> 13:22.080
That kind of competition internally is not something that I am fully convinced Linux

13:22.080 --> 13:23.080
can sustain.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.840
However, and we're going to have an email that makes a point about this, I think in

13:26.840 --> 13:32.680
the long run it's not going to be as bad as it sounds right now, but honestly the only

13:32.680 --> 13:36.320
way to make it not as bad as we're all fearing it's going to be is to hammer these things

13:36.320 --> 13:40.460
out and figure them out and talk about them and figure out what the actual problems are

13:40.460 --> 13:41.840
in these scenarios.

13:41.840 --> 13:45.580
So that's part of this process in the open source community too is it's a little bit

13:45.580 --> 13:49.160
of airing our dirty laundry, but at the same time it's also coming to a group consensus

13:49.160 --> 13:50.160
on this stuff.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.360
Well, I would have one closing thought on it and I would put it this way.

13:53.360 --> 13:57.500
Whatever side of the argument someone may fall onto, the one thing that drives me nuts

13:57.500 --> 14:00.520
is when they take the argument to a low level point.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.740
If it's like, let's say you're pro QT, okay, that's fine.

14:03.740 --> 14:06.520
Show me why not using it breaks blank.

14:06.520 --> 14:11.400
Show me, identify exactly where it messes with my life and I think the arguments become

14:11.400 --> 14:12.400
much stronger.

14:12.400 --> 14:17.680
The problem I see within the Linux community is that the arguments are so low level, so

14:17.680 --> 14:23.200
bottom of the barrel complicated that the average folks don't care because they can't

14:23.200 --> 14:24.200
identify.

14:24.200 --> 14:27.700
You say, look, you go GTK and this is what's going to break like you brought up with the

14:27.700 --> 14:32.400
alerts and things like that as far as not being able to unify that when APIs and whatnot,

14:32.400 --> 14:36.920
all this other stuff, I think you start nailing those individual actionable things to where

14:36.920 --> 14:39.800
you can point to and say, that's going to break because of this, that's going to break

14:39.800 --> 14:41.120
because of that.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.800
Then people like me start to care.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.800
Right.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.800
Then you bring it home a little bit.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.800
Right.

14:45.800 --> 14:46.800
And you know what?

14:46.800 --> 14:49.300
It's the truth for anything that's extremely complicated and abstract.

14:49.300 --> 14:54.520
You could make the same argument about NSA spying and anything that's really complex

14:54.520 --> 14:55.520
like that.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.520
That's why no one's complaining about it.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.940
That's why no one complains about it because it's still low level.

14:57.940 --> 15:02.800
It may be complicated arguments, absolutely, but at the end of the day, if you don't, it's

15:02.800 --> 15:03.800
not dumbing it down.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.840
You got to identify how it affects things in your life you care about.

15:06.840 --> 15:07.840
That's so important.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.640
You just have to connect it to something that people care about.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.640
Right.

15:11.640 --> 15:14.380
And I'll tell you about something I care about and that is our first sponsor this week.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.380
That is Ting.

15:15.380 --> 15:19.600
Go over to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com is where you want to get started.

15:19.600 --> 15:25.000
And let me tell you, Ting is a mobile service that has zero BS, no contracts, no early termination

15:25.000 --> 15:26.760
fee and you only pay for what you use.

15:26.760 --> 15:31.120
Have you ever been on your phone and you've gotten a text message from your carrier and

15:31.120 --> 15:35.440
it's like, hey dog, you're about to go over your data limit, I just wanted to let you

15:35.440 --> 15:36.440
know.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.440
What?

15:37.440 --> 15:38.440
Data limit?

15:38.440 --> 15:40.280
How about you just let me pay for what I actually want to use?

15:40.280 --> 15:41.280
Oh, guess what?

15:41.280 --> 15:44.560
That's exactly how Ting works and it's never been a better time to be a Ting customer because

15:44.560 --> 15:45.560
guess what?

15:45.560 --> 15:50.560
Today, April 1st, Ting has announced the new Ting Android skin.

15:50.560 --> 15:51.560
That's right.

15:51.560 --> 15:52.560
Nice.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.160
Yeah, you see, you can go get yourself a custom Ting carrier skin.

15:54.160 --> 15:58.600
Now by the way, a little bit of a heads up, if your Ting device isn't running Ice Cream

15:58.600 --> 16:02.200
Sandwich, don't worry, the installer will automatically migrate your device running

16:02.200 --> 16:07.000
Jelly Bean or Kit Kat over to ICS so you can get that nice downgrade, super smooth.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.160
And if your phone can't run Ice Cream Sandwich, you've got 30 days to buy a new phone if you

16:11.160 --> 16:13.620
want support from Ting, real nice.

16:13.620 --> 16:17.520
And another, they have some developers testing stuff for Jelly Bean, so they might have a

16:17.520 --> 16:21.600
Jelly Bean version out in Q1 2015, so you can check that out.

16:21.600 --> 16:22.600
Here's what you get.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.800
You get the Ting splash screen, you get the Ting music store, you get the Ting app store,

16:25.800 --> 16:30.460
you get the Ting wallpaper store so you can buy wallpapers, you get the Ting ring tone

16:30.460 --> 16:34.000
store and of course the Ting remote and the Ting splash screen.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.280
Now Ting music, you get the latest hits from artists of yesterday because Ting, as Ting

16:38.280 --> 16:42.920
grows in popularity, they'll be able to sign up more artists, but right now, nobody's using

16:42.920 --> 16:44.320
it so it's all cover bands.

16:44.320 --> 16:49.500
You can download hundreds of songs with it and they're just $2 per song, Ting apps, who

16:49.500 --> 16:50.840
needs Google Play?

16:50.840 --> 16:52.200
Ting has gotten rid of the Google Play.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.520
I've listened to you guys.

16:53.520 --> 16:57.500
The Ting app store offers a huge selection of almost 1,000 apps.

16:57.500 --> 17:04.040
You can choose from favorites like MySpace or AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ, MSN Live, Bing

17:04.040 --> 17:06.320
and a few hundred other ones, yeah.

17:06.320 --> 17:07.320
And guess what?

17:07.320 --> 17:08.320
I can get MySpace right on.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.480
You don't have to worry about a credit card map.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.920
They're just going to build this stuff directly to your Ting bill.

17:11.920 --> 17:12.920
Yeah.

17:12.920 --> 17:13.920
Oh, nice.

17:13.920 --> 17:19.080
Yeah, and if you want to get a Ting retinal wallpaper, they're called Ting retinals, you

17:19.080 --> 17:23.800
can get stunning high-resolution wallpapers to completely customize your home screen.

17:23.800 --> 17:28.180
And by the way, more than 20% of songs available in the Ting music store, so that's almost

17:28.180 --> 17:31.080
a dozen, are also available as a ringtone.

17:31.080 --> 17:34.360
So you got to pay like 50%.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.480
I want to get Bieber on that, bad boy.

17:36.480 --> 17:41.080
This is one of the best April Fools ever.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.080
And you know what?

17:42.080 --> 17:45.080
The reason why I love this, because it shows you, Ting knows how much all this crap is

17:45.080 --> 17:47.000
just crap.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.840
They totally see it.

17:48.840 --> 17:52.640
So I thought this is, and apparently a few people in the comments thought this was serious,

17:52.640 --> 17:55.640
and so Ting actually had to make a disclaimer.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.640
Ting is so awesome.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.640
Wow, wow.

17:57.640 --> 18:01.840
So here, listen, this is why I've been a Ting customer, because not only is the Sprint Network

18:01.840 --> 18:06.200
rolling out LTE like crazy these days, they have the Sprint Vision plan, which is awesome.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.440
They've got tri-band LTE, LTE now in 400 markets.

18:09.440 --> 18:13.120
If you haven't checked out the service coverage lately, go over to linux.ting.com and check

18:13.120 --> 18:14.120
out their coverage map.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.640
If you haven't tried out their savings calculator, plug that in there.

18:16.640 --> 18:21.200
Go put your minutes, go put your megabytes and your messages in your bill total and see

18:21.200 --> 18:23.160
how much you'll save over two years with Ting.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.820
And every device you buy from Ting, you own it outright.

18:25.820 --> 18:29.840
That's your device, and Ting's only going to charge you for what you use.

18:29.840 --> 18:30.840
I love it.

18:30.840 --> 18:34.560
So go to linux.ting.com, see what I've been talking about, and a big thank you to Ting

18:34.560 --> 18:36.920
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.240
Happy April Fools, Ting.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.240
That's pretty good.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.600
That was great.

18:40.600 --> 18:44.680
So John wrote in, he's got a different angle on this display server thing, so this is one

18:44.680 --> 18:46.280
of two last emails we're going to read here.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.680
He says, hey Chris and Matt, I want to keep this short.

18:48.680 --> 18:53.800
The display server problem is proof that Ubuntu is changing from a Linux distro or a Linux

18:53.800 --> 18:57.940
variant to a completely standalone OS.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.760
That's really what Canonical wants, wouldn't you think?

19:00.760 --> 19:04.600
Ubuntu will become closer to what Android is, an OS created from whole cloth.

19:04.600 --> 19:08.420
They have a competitive advantage over basically every other Linux distro, and though it might

19:08.420 --> 19:14.480
be cheap, Mirror is one way of ensuring that people don't switch to something else.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.320
So in my opinion, your frustrations are completely valid.

19:17.320 --> 19:20.160
I think the free software world is justified in feeling taken advantage of.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.520
They piggybacked on all of the goodies that Linux provides, and they took a huge chunk

19:23.520 --> 19:27.280
of the user base, and now they're creating something completely different.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.520
This isn't going to cause problems.

19:28.520 --> 19:31.600
Oh, he says this is going to cause problems.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.920
But because of Ubuntu's market share, I think there will come a time that other Linux issues

19:34.920 --> 19:38.640
will be forced to work with Canonical just to stay competitive.

19:38.640 --> 19:42.760
Then again, maybe they crash and burn and Mirror sucks, so they will switch back to Wayland.

19:42.760 --> 19:43.760
Cheers, John.

19:43.760 --> 19:44.760
Cheers.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.040
That's a nice ending, just kind of, eh, whatever.

19:47.040 --> 19:50.960
You know, or it could be completely opposite of what I'm talking about.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.720
Always nice to, you know, you learn from my monkey suit debacle, you know, always keep

19:53.720 --> 19:54.720
your butt covered.

19:54.720 --> 19:55.720
Yeah.

19:55.720 --> 19:59.200
The monkey suit lesson, it lives on in our audience.

19:59.200 --> 20:04.560
All right, our last email on this topic, it comes in from Netlore, aka James.

20:04.560 --> 20:08.560
He says, hey Chris and Matt, I completely failed to get on mumble for the last Linux

20:08.560 --> 20:09.560
unplug.

20:09.560 --> 20:14.820
You know, we do loop in our virtual lug, and if you join us live on Tuesdays at 2pm Pacific,

20:14.820 --> 20:16.600
you can take part in that.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.560
He says, because there's a point I wanted to bring up.

20:18.560 --> 20:22.240
If there are things which have no, okay, so this is a point he would have made if he's

20:22.240 --> 20:23.720
going to be on the mumble server.

20:23.720 --> 20:27.040
If there are, and this is the point I wanted to kind of hold on to make so he could make

20:27.040 --> 20:28.700
it, because I think this is a great point.

20:28.700 --> 20:33.000
If there are things which have no abstraction, which the applications have to hit the display

20:33.000 --> 20:36.920
server directly to solve, those things need to be abstracted.

20:36.920 --> 20:41.200
This in itself will make Linux more mature and quote-unquote better, and it will solve

20:41.200 --> 20:46.000
the issues with all of the machines still running X11, including BSD and Solaris, etc.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.400
For a long time, as we all are going to be solving these mainland mirror issues now.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.840
Not to mention the possibility down the road of X12.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.440
Also, what happens if we go through this again?

20:57.440 --> 20:58.440
Really?

20:58.440 --> 21:01.040
I mean, Linux has always been into playing the long game, and Wayland will be old and

21:01.040 --> 21:06.740
obsolete at some point, or maybe just need to be updated, so making sure we abstract

21:06.740 --> 21:11.280
all of those functions benefits us now and benefits the maintenance of all display servers

21:11.280 --> 21:15.560
over time and makes it easier to migrate to something new in the future when things change

21:15.560 --> 21:16.560
again.

21:16.560 --> 21:20.640
Finally, it's my understanding that part of the reason MIR was created was a failure

21:20.640 --> 21:23.960
of the Wayland developers to work with Canonical to help them use Wayland.

21:23.960 --> 21:28.040
Surely, if the project alienates one of its largest potential users by refusing to work

21:28.040 --> 21:32.360
with them, then surely complaining when they decide that they need to do their own thing

21:32.360 --> 21:33.840
is somewhat disingenuous.

21:33.840 --> 21:41.800
Overall, I agree that having this fragmentation will hurt Linux a little in the short term,

21:41.800 --> 21:43.000
but it's already happened.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.880
It's not going to go away, and if we embrace it, we can make Linux stronger, so why not

21:46.880 --> 21:47.880
do that?

21:47.880 --> 21:50.720
I think that's really the best option.

21:50.720 --> 21:55.280
And I know that for the people that actually have to do that work, aka the developers out

21:55.280 --> 21:58.680
there who are raising heck right now, to them they're like, well yeah, screw you guys, of

21:58.680 --> 21:59.680
course you say that.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.600
But in reality, that's kind of what has to happen.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.720
Well, that's kind of what has always happened, I think, at some level.

22:05.720 --> 22:06.720
I don't know.

22:06.720 --> 22:11.040
I mean, I think history will end up dictating how all this works out, but I think right

22:11.040 --> 22:16.160
now we just need to focus on the positive, let go of the negative, and let's just see

22:16.160 --> 22:17.160
where it all falls down.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.160
Boombayah, Matt.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.160
Let's see.

22:19.160 --> 22:22.120
Let's make Linux stronger where we can, and we'll keep following it.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.120
You know, as things develop and we start to get a sense of what direction things are going,

22:25.120 --> 22:26.120
we'll talk about it.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.640
You know, and we'll just keep an open dialogue as we go.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.640
There you go.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.640
Oh my goodness.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.640
Uh oh.

22:31.640 --> 22:36.400
We have a little breaking news right here on April 1st, 2014, Matt.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.840
I don't know if you caught the headline.

22:38.840 --> 22:42.600
It's taking the internet by storm, but Jupiter Broadcasting announces they have bought Linux

22:42.600 --> 22:44.720
Gamecast weekly.

22:44.720 --> 22:48.560
The new media tycoon, Chris Fisher, owner of Jupiter Broadcasting and Hairstyle Extraordinaire,

22:48.560 --> 22:54.040
has reportedly bought Linux Gamecast for approximately $14.4 billion.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.040
Holy cow.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.040
You've been holding out.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.040
Or two Bitcoins.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.040
Yeah.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.040
Yeah, I bought it in Bitcoins.

22:59.040 --> 23:04.360
So, oh, rootgamer.com had a little fun today, poking a little fun at us.

23:04.360 --> 23:08.000
I thought that was a great one, those Linux Gamecast guys.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.360
They just got done reviewing the goat simulator.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.360
Have you seen that?

23:12.360 --> 23:13.840
Oh, I was playing it all day today.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.600
As a matter of fact, I tagged then.

23:15.600 --> 23:20.380
Dude, it's like if you've ever wanted to take Barnyard Action and bundle it with Postal,

23:20.380 --> 23:21.380
that's this game.

23:21.380 --> 23:23.400
Now, is this the game where the goat gets a jet pack?

23:23.400 --> 23:24.400
Does he get a jet pack?

23:24.400 --> 23:28.140
Oh, dude, it's like, it's literally, the goal of the game is, I mean, obviously to level

23:28.140 --> 23:32.440
up and stuff, but basically, I just run around running people over, bowling them over.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.680
It's literally like Postal minus the shovel.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.360
And you're a goat the whole time, right?

23:36.360 --> 23:37.360
Yeah.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.360
That's crazy.

23:38.360 --> 23:39.360
It's fun.

23:39.360 --> 23:40.360
Oh, my God.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.360
Did you get this on Steam?

23:41.360 --> 23:42.360
No, no, no, no.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.360
I found the executable.

23:43.360 --> 23:44.360
Oh, okay.

23:44.360 --> 23:45.360
I got you.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.360
I got you.

23:46.360 --> 23:47.360
I got your gist, Matt.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.360
I got your gist.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.360
Yeah, my gist.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.360
But yeah, anyway, yeah.

23:50.360 --> 23:51.360
You can do it on Steam, though.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.360
The same principle applies.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.360
You're still going to have to do it with Wine, though.

23:53.360 --> 23:58.120
I want to get to our topic du jour today, but first I want to thank DigitalOcean for

23:58.120 --> 24:00.160
sponsoring this episode of Linux Unplugged.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.160
What is DigitalOcean?

24:01.160 --> 24:03.480
Man, you need to find out.

24:03.480 --> 24:07.720
First of all, we're going to get you two months for free if you use the promo code UnpluggedApril.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.560
Let me tell you why you want to try out DigitalOcean.

24:09.560 --> 24:13.760
It's simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive way and easy way to spin

24:13.760 --> 24:15.020
up a cloud server.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.880
Users can create a server in 55 seconds.

24:16.880 --> 24:20.180
I think our audience record right now is 47 seconds.

24:20.180 --> 24:22.640
If you beat 47 seconds, let me know.

24:22.640 --> 24:26.680
And pricing plans, or maybe it was 44, and pricing plans start at only $5 per month,

24:26.680 --> 24:27.680
and this is key.

24:27.680 --> 24:33.920
For $5 a month, think about, think about what that, $5, that's less than, that was less

24:33.920 --> 24:37.520
than the KFC I got today on my way back from the studio, okay?

24:37.520 --> 24:43.680
$5 a month gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, 20 gigabytes of SSD, a CPU, and a terabyte

24:43.680 --> 24:44.680
of transfer.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.180
That's a quantifiable cost.

24:46.180 --> 24:50.760
You know, it's a fixed cost every single month for a tier one cloud server that you have

24:50.760 --> 24:56.800
root access over running on Linux on top of KVM and with any distribution you want with

24:56.800 --> 25:00.480
a full-fledged snapshotting and droplet system that lets you deploy applications with one

25:00.480 --> 25:04.400
click, make a backup before you make any big changes, and DigitalOcean has data center

25:04.400 --> 25:08.160
locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Singapore.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.840
Their interface is simple.

25:09.840 --> 25:14.640
Their control panel is intuitive, and power users can replicate that control panel with

25:14.640 --> 25:15.640
their straightforward API.

25:15.640 --> 25:20.420
So you want to do a little automation, boom, they got a great API for it, it's beautiful,

25:20.420 --> 25:25.920
and listeners of Linux Unplugged can get that $10 credit by using the new promo code, brand

25:25.920 --> 25:28.080
new Unplugged April.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.920
Brand new promo code for this month, Unplugged April gets you a $10 credit, lets you kick

25:31.920 --> 25:32.920
the tires.

25:32.920 --> 25:37.920
Let me tell you, I have every single thing I have set up on my DigitalOcean machine,

25:37.920 --> 25:41.480
my droplet, has made that $5 worth it.

25:41.480 --> 25:45.280
And right now, my latest favorite is, we got Rekai working for us now, he's like, Chris,

25:45.280 --> 25:49.000
I know you like the Quasl client, I'm like, yeah, I like Smuxy a little bit more, he's

25:49.000 --> 25:51.960
like, well, did you know that Quasl has a server component, I'm like, yeah, I've heard

25:51.960 --> 25:52.960
of that.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.200
He's like, but have you used it?

25:54.200 --> 25:56.040
No, I've never tried it.

25:56.040 --> 26:02.360
IRC is amazing, IRC is the legit social network, so now on my DigitalOcean droplet, I have

26:02.360 --> 26:08.280
a Quasl connector server that keeps me logged in to several IRC servers and several rooms

26:08.280 --> 26:10.880
related to Jupyter broadcasting at all times.

26:10.880 --> 26:18.040
I now can connect from a tablet, from my Nexus 5, from my desktop, from my laptop, from multiple

26:18.040 --> 26:22.280
desktops, they all connect back to this one connector, they all share the same login session,

26:22.280 --> 26:26.520
all the same nick, I can see all of my messages, I can see anything that transpires since I

26:26.520 --> 26:28.160
connected last time.

26:28.160 --> 26:34.160
It has made communicating with our team so much more efficient, I would gladly pay more

26:34.160 --> 26:36.480
than $5 a month for this right now.

26:36.480 --> 26:41.520
And it's one of the many things I have running on my $5 a month DigitalOcean droplet.

26:41.520 --> 26:45.640
Not only that, but DigitalOcean is built on top of those SSDs with tier one bandwidth,

26:45.640 --> 26:49.680
backed by Linux's KVM technology, it completely rocks.

26:49.680 --> 26:54.480
So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code UnpluggedApril to go get yourself

26:54.480 --> 26:59.840
your own cloud server powered by SSD drives, UnpluggedApril.

26:59.840 --> 27:08.240
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged, DigitalOcean.com UnpluggedApril.

27:08.240 --> 27:11.480
Such a great deal, so powerful, I mean, because you can pretty much do anything you want on

27:11.480 --> 27:12.480
it, it's awesome.

27:12.480 --> 27:17.280
It is, it is, it is so much better than so many other ways you could go, like having

27:17.280 --> 27:20.280
to port forward to a virtual machine, screw that.

27:20.280 --> 27:24.020
Just go get an actual cloud server, and man, DigitalOcean is blowing up these days.

27:24.020 --> 27:28.880
They're hiring right now, they just got a great round of investments, they've refined

27:28.880 --> 27:32.960
their control panel to a whole new level, it's awesome.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.720
And you know, I heard about them from Michael Dominick from our corner radio program because

27:36.720 --> 27:38.600
they're awesome for developers too.

27:38.600 --> 27:43.160
And some of the largest sites on the web are running on DigitalOcean, so it's pretty cool.

27:43.160 --> 27:50.000
All right, so I want to get into an area that's difficult, because I have a lot of respect

27:50.000 --> 27:54.320
for Leo Laporte and the TWiT network, and I respect what he's done to legitimize the

27:54.320 --> 28:01.000
podcasting medium, and I enjoyed watching the screensavers back before it was, you know,

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
really mainstream.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.280
Like I had a satellite dish, and I was watching ZDTV before they would call it TechTV.

28:06.280 --> 28:11.360
In fact, I even saw him a little bit on MSNBC when he was playing, I think it was called

28:11.360 --> 28:16.240
Dash or something, like he was a virtual character, I've been following him for years.

28:16.240 --> 28:21.040
And one of the things that we played on Sunday's live stream was his old interview with Linus

28:21.040 --> 28:22.040
Torvalds, right?

28:22.040 --> 28:26.700
So he's given Linux a lot of mentions in the past, and in fact, even on his nationally

28:26.700 --> 28:31.720
syndicated radio show that was airing this last Saturday, he did have some sort of fate

28:31.720 --> 28:33.200
praise to give Linux.

28:33.200 --> 28:36.500
Most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.420
That's how reliable it is.

28:38.420 --> 28:40.700
Android phones are based on Linux.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.560
All Android phones run Linux.

28:42.560 --> 28:45.360
That's the operating system.

28:45.360 --> 28:48.780
You're probably using Linux all the time, maybe you don't even know it.

28:48.780 --> 28:53.000
So you can get a free version of Linux, there are many as I mentioned, Ubuntu is a good

28:53.000 --> 28:57.440
one, ubuntu.com.

28:57.440 --> 29:02.000
You can download it and install it on your XP machine, you wipe, in fact, I would wipe

29:02.000 --> 29:04.080
out all of XP and just install it.

29:04.080 --> 29:08.360
There doesn't run Windows software very well, it does in fact run it, but not very well.

29:08.360 --> 29:15.280
But that's okay because it has an entire office suite available for it for free, LibreOffice.

29:15.280 --> 29:19.280
It has all the software, you know, Photoshop clone called the GIMP.

29:19.280 --> 29:23.040
There's all the software you'd want is free and available on the Linux platform.

29:23.040 --> 29:27.160
So I wanted to play that because you can see he's giving some praise to Linux there.

29:27.160 --> 29:30.240
So the question was, and this is something that's been coming up on his radio show a

29:30.240 --> 29:36.040
lot is, look at XP, it goes kaput this week.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.040
What should I do, Leo?

29:37.040 --> 29:40.320
I'm thinking I don't have the money to buy a new machine.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.960
Should I keep XP?

29:41.960 --> 29:44.480
Should I try this Linux thing?

29:44.480 --> 29:46.880
That was the caller's question.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.600
And this is where things went off the rails.

29:49.600 --> 29:54.280
There's all the software you'd want is free and available on the Linux platform.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.280
All of that's well and good.

29:55.280 --> 30:01.000
Here's the downside, and this is why I asked Sy, do you know about computers and he does.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.800
Linux has never really been for real average people.

30:05.800 --> 30:11.200
It's really designed by and used by computer enthusiasts.

30:11.200 --> 30:15.440
And so you'll use Linux for a while and then you'll run up against something that's just

30:15.440 --> 30:17.320
weird.

30:17.320 --> 30:21.840
And unlike Windows, there's so few people that use it as a desktop operating system.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.720
It's sometimes hard to figure out how to get around these roadblocks.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.160
Things don't work right.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.160
I'll give you an example.

30:27.160 --> 30:31.880
Now, before he goes on, I mean, I'm kind of like, okay, I can kind of see where he's going.

30:31.880 --> 30:36.360
I don't necessarily 100% agree at this point, but you know, to be absolutely fair, it is

30:36.360 --> 30:38.720
challenging for most average users.

30:38.720 --> 30:39.720
Okay.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.720
So this point I'm giving the benefit of the doubt.

30:40.720 --> 30:41.720
Okay.

30:41.720 --> 30:42.720
All right.

30:42.720 --> 30:47.760
I was running a version of Ubuntu and I decided to use the open source version of Google's

30:47.760 --> 30:50.160
Chrome browsers called Chromium on it.

30:50.160 --> 30:54.440
And then I updated Ubuntu, got the newest version and Chromium stopped working.

30:54.440 --> 30:57.280
Just wouldn't, it wouldn't run.

30:57.280 --> 31:01.760
Now I was able to figure out what was wrong and it was a library.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.040
This is the kind of thing that happens with Linux.

31:04.040 --> 31:09.640
So I actually watched this happen and if folks who watch a lot of our live shows might remember

31:09.640 --> 31:11.040
I talked about this.

31:11.040 --> 31:16.000
I watched Leo got the Dell XPS Sputnik developer laptop.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
You remember this thing?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
I remember this.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Yes.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Yeah.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Very clearly.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.960
So I watched Leo on the live stream on like a Saturday or Sunday.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.960
I can't remember.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.640
He was, I think it was after a Linux action show actually.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.100
He was unboxing it.

31:27.100 --> 31:30.600
He pulls the Sputnik out and he boots it up and he's reading his chat room.

31:30.600 --> 31:35.040
And before he's even logged into the computer for the first time, and Dell has this little

31:35.040 --> 31:40.000
first time setup wizard, the chat room says, Leo, you've got to remove Unity.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.720
Uninstall Unity, app get removed, purge Ubuntu desktop, app get installed, Zubuntu desktop.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.440
And Leo just kind of blindly did it.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.600
And he created a lot of problems for himself when he did that immediately.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.200
He never even gave Unity a shot, he just immediately uninstalled it.

31:54.200 --> 32:00.000
And then, and then the chat room said, Leo, Leo, that is Ubuntu 12.04 on there.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.200
You should upgrade to Ubuntu 13.10, Leo.

32:02.200 --> 32:04.060
Do app dash get dist upgrade.

32:04.060 --> 32:07.480
And then he did an app dash get dist upgrade, and this is where he started running into

32:07.480 --> 32:08.480
problems.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.700
Now he never mentions that.

32:09.700 --> 32:14.120
And again, this is a use, that kind of use case scenario would never happen to an average

32:14.120 --> 32:15.120
user.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.120
There was a library that Chromium needed.

32:17.120 --> 32:20.200
Remember I was talking about those DLLs, Linux has them too.

32:20.200 --> 32:24.080
There was a library that Chromium needed that the people who make Ubuntu decided didn't

32:24.080 --> 32:26.040
really need to be included in the new version.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.280
So they took it off.

32:29.280 --> 32:33.880
So I had to find the library, download a copy of it, put it on my operating system, and

32:33.880 --> 32:34.880
then Chromium worked.

32:34.880 --> 32:38.580
It's not the kind of thing you want to do, and it's certainly not the kind of thing people

32:38.580 --> 32:40.780
who are used to running Windows XP want to do.

32:40.780 --> 32:45.080
So my general recommendation is that Ubuntu is a good choice if you're an enthusiast and

32:45.080 --> 32:49.520
you like messing around with them, tinkering around with computers, you enjoy that.

32:49.520 --> 32:50.520
It's great for kids.

32:50.520 --> 32:56.000
It's a great way for kids to learn how Linux and Unix based operating systems work.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.920
These are the fundamental workhorse operating systems of the whole internet.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.560
So that's a great thing to learn.

33:01.560 --> 33:05.680
But for the average person who just wants to surf a little bit, open the email once

33:05.680 --> 33:08.560
in a while, might not be the best choice.

33:08.560 --> 33:11.600
And of course that's patently false because that's exactly who should be using Ubuntu

33:11.600 --> 33:15.920
or any kind of Linux is somebody who wants to browse the web a little bit, read email

33:15.920 --> 33:18.440
a little bit, do social networking.

33:18.440 --> 33:22.760
And his recommendation is stick with XP, stick with XP.

33:22.760 --> 33:29.660
And the problem is, is what he is parroting right there is, think of it this way.

33:29.660 --> 33:37.760
Think of a Mac user or maybe a Windows switcher that goes out and buys a MacBook Pro, okay?

33:37.760 --> 33:41.320
And I'm trying to put this in parlance that Leo would understand because he's a Mac user.

33:41.320 --> 33:45.240
And he goes out there and he buys a MacBook Pro, he brings it back home, and he immediately

33:45.240 --> 33:47.960
formats the drive and puts Windows 8 on it.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.760
And then he notices, hey, you know what?

33:50.760 --> 33:51.760
This is great.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.400
I've got good performance, but my fans are running crazy.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.560
Like the thermal cooling on this thing really sucks.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.400
MacBooks don't have good thermal cooling at all.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.960
It keeps overheating and shutting down.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.120
MacBooks are awful.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.680
Apple makes bad products.

34:05.680 --> 34:10.860
When in reality, he's using the product differently than how it was intended because Apple doesn't

34:10.860 --> 34:14.000
make drivers available for Windows for the thermal management system.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.040
So it's down to emergency cooling.

34:17.040 --> 34:21.880
And if you look at that, if you look at what he's done here, he took a product, the Dell

34:21.880 --> 34:28.280
Sputnik, he immediately uninstalls with a purge command the Unity desktop, installs

34:28.280 --> 34:34.600
Zubuntu, then installs Chromium and does a desktop grading, complains about a library

34:34.600 --> 34:35.600
problem.

34:35.600 --> 34:40.040
Now he never says that on air, but then he takes that experience and he says, can't use

34:40.040 --> 34:41.040
it.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.560
Not good for regular users if you just want to browse the web, if you just want to go

34:43.560 --> 34:45.700
out there and do a little Amazon shopping.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.560
In fact, he goes on even further.

34:47.560 --> 34:50.640
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

34:50.640 --> 34:51.640
And you know who you are.

34:51.640 --> 34:52.640
If you're somebody who doesn't want to mess with computers.

34:52.640 --> 34:53.640
I just want to surf the...

34:53.640 --> 34:58.940
I just want to buy something on Amazon, send an email to my kids, look at some websites.

34:58.940 --> 35:03.600
If that's you, you don't want to mess with it, probably not a good choice.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.160
I think the Chromebooks are a good choice.

35:05.160 --> 35:08.960
I think a new version of Windows would be fine, Windows 8, if you can afford it.

35:08.960 --> 35:13.400
A Macintosh, if you've got even more money, that's a good choice.

35:13.400 --> 35:16.640
It's only for the enthusiasts that I'd recommend Ubuntu.

35:16.640 --> 35:20.520
And the thing that is, and I was going to let this go because we played the clip on

35:20.520 --> 35:25.520
the last live stream and I was like, all right, bygones be bygones, water under the bridge.

35:25.520 --> 35:30.360
Sure it was on a national radio show, sure maybe potentially a million people just heard

35:30.360 --> 35:33.780
you kind of crap on Linux for your own mistake.

35:33.780 --> 35:39.680
What really bugged me, and maybe this is just a little too inside baseball, what really

35:39.680 --> 35:47.560
bugged me is then Twit took the clip of Leo Laporte dumping on Linux and made it the highlighted

35:47.560 --> 35:48.700
clip for that show.

35:48.700 --> 35:53.420
So every super long show that Twit does, they release what's called a Twit bit, where they

35:53.420 --> 35:57.800
put a couple of minutes from that show on their YouTube channel for Twit, and it's sort

35:57.800 --> 36:00.480
of like, here's the best moment of that show.

36:00.480 --> 36:04.800
And this is what we want you to watch to get you hooked to watch the whole two hour long

36:04.800 --> 36:05.800
show.

36:05.800 --> 36:10.320
And this is the moment, this moment where Leo has taken a big stinky dump on Linux is

36:10.320 --> 36:15.160
the moment that they chose to highlight from his three hour radio show, because this was

36:15.160 --> 36:16.760
so important.

36:16.760 --> 36:21.740
And this is the part that made me angry, because the absolute arrogance and irresponsibility

36:21.740 --> 36:26.160
of somebody who has a national radio show, who didn't properly do the work, who screwed

36:26.160 --> 36:30.880
it up themselves but is still too arrogant to admit that, then dumps on the platform

36:30.880 --> 36:35.060
as a whole because they screwed it up on their own, applying a use case scenario that no

36:35.060 --> 36:40.440
average user would ever do, and then tarnishing the platform as a whole.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.440
That is irresponsible.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.440
And I, that's what upsets me about it.

36:43.440 --> 36:48.560
You know, it's kind of funny too, because those people who he mentioned are, who only

36:48.560 --> 36:52.880
browse the web occasionally and shop on Amazon, are the people who are going to be getting

36:52.880 --> 36:58.000
the viruses and needed protection when he provides, so.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Right.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.880
That's the, that's the thing is that's what has me kind of irked about it is he's actually

37:02.880 --> 37:06.440
in a sense like he's completely got it wrong.

37:06.440 --> 37:12.480
Like maybe if that caller was a PC gamer enthusiast or a video editor, like that would be the

37:12.480 --> 37:13.960
person to give that speech to.

37:13.960 --> 37:19.800
But somebody who literally wants to read email and shop on Amazon, guess what?

37:19.800 --> 37:20.860
Go get Ubuntu.

37:20.860 --> 37:22.280
It's got Amazon built in.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.280
You know what I'm saying?

37:23.280 --> 37:27.440
Like that's the perfect operating system for somebody who wants to shop on Amazon.

37:27.440 --> 37:34.000
It is, it is false on its face and this kind of old school FUD still, I think, is the predominant

37:34.000 --> 37:37.320
narrative that Linux has to combat this.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.880
This is not what he says is not true.

37:39.880 --> 37:40.880
Am I, am I wrong?

37:40.880 --> 37:45.440
I mean, I think what he's trying to say is that it's not good for the average user.

37:45.440 --> 37:49.840
If you're stupid enough to blindly just delete things that you have no idea what they do,

37:49.840 --> 37:53.360
but you can say that about any operating system to have like exactly anything.

37:53.360 --> 37:57.040
Like why is it that easy to break the library dependency?

37:57.040 --> 38:02.040
Like it's in the frequency package manager, you won't, it'll be like, you can't delete

38:02.040 --> 38:03.040
that.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.040
It's required by this.

38:04.040 --> 38:08.000
They have an integration package for the Unity desktop for Chromium.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.080
Of course, if you uninstall all of Unity, which Chromium has this nice little integration

38:13.080 --> 38:17.440
feature involved, kind of like Gnome has the extensions in the browser.

38:17.440 --> 38:19.200
It's kind of nice and integrated there.

38:19.200 --> 38:23.520
Of course, it's going to kind of blow something up or at least kind of cause us unusual problem.

38:23.520 --> 38:27.880
But it seems like there's an undeclared dependency there that should have resolved it.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.040
The issue is that he's there.

38:29.040 --> 38:34.000
He removed the integration features taking random commands from people in a chat room

38:34.000 --> 38:36.720
or whatever and running them on his machine.

38:36.720 --> 38:37.720
Right.

38:37.720 --> 38:44.040
But if like, for example, he was, he removed something that Ubuntu created and then he

38:44.040 --> 38:49.480
tried to install something that Ubuntu made like from the Ubuntu repo that dependent on

38:49.480 --> 38:51.280
the thing he removed.

38:51.280 --> 38:55.080
So why did the repo just do it?

38:55.080 --> 38:56.080
He did a purge.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.080
He did a purge.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.080
He purged it.

38:58.080 --> 38:59.080
He did a purge.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.080
I don't know what that means.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.080
That means force it.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.080
Regardless.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.080
Like just rip it out of there.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.080
Get it.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.080
I don't care if there's errors.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.080
If you want to kick back a warning to me, screw you.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.080
Pull it out anyways.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.080
Right.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.080
Wait, wait, wait.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.080
Sorry.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.080
Purge means something completely different.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.080
All right.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.080
Hold on.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.080
Okay.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.080
Hold on.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.080
Let's break down.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.720
So Ik, I wanted to get this before we go too far.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.040
I know purge means fully remove.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.040
I know.

39:21.040 --> 39:27.560
So Ik, you and I both have experimented with moving our parents over to Linux.

39:27.560 --> 39:31.560
What has your experience been with their sort of that average user scenario?

39:31.560 --> 39:32.560
Has this been a problem?

39:32.560 --> 39:39.000
Well, the biggest thing about that clip that I wanted to mention is that my parents heard

39:39.000 --> 39:44.280
the clip and immediately they said he was full of crap and my parents are not techy.

39:44.280 --> 39:45.280
That's nice.

39:45.280 --> 39:46.280
And wait.

39:46.280 --> 39:53.120
Now, as far as the use case scenario for somebody who just uses Linux to browse the web and

39:53.120 --> 39:57.760
do email and write stuff, I would say that that use case would be my wife.

39:57.760 --> 40:00.600
My wife would be the exact use case that Leah was describing.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.120
She has no problem.

40:03.120 --> 40:08.960
Of course, I'm there to help her if something goes weird but at the same time, it's not

40:08.960 --> 40:15.800
that huge of a deal to just say app.get install Chromium and everything is all better.

40:15.800 --> 40:19.400
My parents, my dad especially, was just like, that is completely false.

40:19.400 --> 40:23.960
He's making assumptions based on stuff he didn't even do any research on.

40:23.960 --> 40:26.320
And he picked up on that right away.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.800
I think this is true.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.920
Now, let's discuss Alan's point.

40:29.920 --> 40:34.040
Alan's point is, you know, maybe the system should be smarter than that.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.760
If you give it the force flag, then that's your fault.

40:35.760 --> 40:36.760
Well, he didn't give it a force.

40:36.760 --> 40:37.760
He gave it a purge flag.

40:37.760 --> 40:44.280
But what if the chat room had said rm-rf/.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.440
He could still be blaming Linux for that.

40:46.440 --> 40:54.600
I think at the end of the day, he essentially engaged in a scenario in which no user who

40:54.600 --> 40:59.600
got a machine pre-loaded with Ubuntu would ever go through.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.600
Unless they knew what they wanted ahead of time.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.800
Well, do you know what he actually hit?

41:04.800 --> 41:10.680
It was a dependency in which the Ubuntu package did not declare.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.660
If the Ubuntu package did declare, it would have been resolved.

41:13.660 --> 41:14.920
And it does now.

41:14.920 --> 41:16.600
That has also been fixed.

41:16.600 --> 41:17.600
It was a bug.

41:17.600 --> 41:18.600
You're right.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.600
It didn't declare dependency.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.600
Poppy?

41:20.600 --> 41:21.600
Damn it.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.600
Poppy ruined everything.

41:22.600 --> 41:23.600
Yeah.

41:23.600 --> 41:29.160
And like Matt pointed out, I mean, hell, even Kim Commando, though, has been better spoken

41:29.160 --> 41:31.160
in this area on this topic.

41:31.160 --> 41:36.760
And I wonder if Leo is just maybe falling subject to just a pervasive narrative that

41:36.760 --> 41:40.560
has just kind of bubbled up through the tech industry for years.

41:40.560 --> 41:43.800
Because I don't think this is even a justified issue.

41:43.800 --> 41:47.240
Yes, there was a bug in declaring that dependency.

41:47.240 --> 41:51.720
But again, this isn't something somebody would have gone through normally.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.760
So what can we do to sort of, and I have a theory, but...

41:54.760 --> 42:00.900
The big question is how often does doing the regular updates that you should be doing actually

42:00.900 --> 42:01.900
break something?

42:01.900 --> 42:02.900
Very rarely.

42:02.900 --> 42:03.900
Yeah, very rarely.

42:03.900 --> 42:04.900
Very, very rarely.

42:04.900 --> 42:05.900
Especially lately.

42:05.900 --> 42:08.560
I guess it depends on someone's definition of very rarely.

42:08.560 --> 42:12.840
It depends on if you rip out your desktop before you try to do an upgrade.

42:12.840 --> 42:13.840
Yeah.

42:13.840 --> 42:14.840
I also run SID.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.800
Running SID even is fine.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.540
And I've been running SID for a long time.

42:18.540 --> 42:23.240
It's a little dangerous, but that's even, it's almost not exactly experimental.

42:23.240 --> 42:26.040
But if it's going to be a problem, it's going to be a problem in SID.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.520
And SID is pretty good.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.520
I love it.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.520
I have a question.

42:29.520 --> 42:30.520
All right.

42:30.520 --> 42:31.520
Well, hold on.

42:31.520 --> 42:34.880
I want to give Daredevil, one second, Daredevil, go ahead before we get too far.

42:34.880 --> 42:36.280
Go ahead and make your point.

42:36.280 --> 42:41.760
I would actually just give a suggestion to distributions, if anyone is listening, install

42:41.760 --> 42:47.720
at least bugs by default and you will solve the most problems you have because the users

42:47.720 --> 42:48.720
see, oh, there's a bug.

42:48.720 --> 42:50.520
I'm not going to update right now.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.680
And that's it.

42:53.680 --> 42:57.620
In FreeBSD, we have something like that called the updating file that explains the problems

42:57.620 --> 42:59.720
you will run into while trying to do an upgrade.

42:59.720 --> 43:01.120
And go ahead, Crash.

43:01.120 --> 43:07.360
I think part, like this is, this is a problem that the community has though, is that like

43:07.360 --> 43:13.200
this guy's made this thing and what the actual issue was, whether it was an Ubuntu issue

43:13.200 --> 43:19.360
or a Chromium issue, whatever, is sort of missing the point slightly.

43:19.360 --> 43:23.740
Because the real issue here is that hundreds of thousands of millions of people watch his

43:23.740 --> 43:26.520
show and get the wrong impression.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.080
And that's, and that's the thing.

43:28.080 --> 43:32.720
It reminds me of the, Chris, you probably remember that guy many years ago who did that

43:32.720 --> 43:34.920
thing about, is Linux good for servers?

43:34.920 --> 43:41.640
And he installed CentOS and then tried to install Attitude on it and it's exactly the

43:41.640 --> 43:45.840
same as that, where the guy has, and then he makes this blog post and everybody reads

43:45.840 --> 43:50.460
the blog post and they assume because he's speaking, you know, he's a trusted person

43:50.460 --> 43:54.400
that they trust his opinion, they assume that he's correct.

43:54.400 --> 43:57.360
And this is, this is the real thing that we need to be fighting whether or not the actual

43:57.360 --> 44:01.120
issue was with Ubuntu or Attitude or whatever, that's, I mean, those are the little paper

44:01.120 --> 44:02.440
cuts that we need to fix as well.

44:02.440 --> 44:06.920
But the real issue is that there's a perception, like he says, that it's not for average users

44:06.920 --> 44:11.080
when Ubuntu is perfect for average users who probably wouldn't even try to install Chromium,

44:11.080 --> 44:14.400
they would just use Firefox because it's there.

44:14.400 --> 44:15.400
Right.

44:15.400 --> 44:16.400
And I, go ahead Riley.

44:16.400 --> 44:20.560
It's kind of funny too, because I remember watching a while back he did a show that was

44:20.560 --> 44:29.080
only like repurposing old hardware to use Linux and they did Puppy Linux on it.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.080
Oh, cool.

44:30.080 --> 44:33.440
And they just got the flash drive and they put the ISO on it and they use the unit boot

44:33.440 --> 44:35.440
and they put Puppy Linux on there.

44:35.440 --> 44:36.920
First, you're fine when you need them.

44:36.920 --> 44:40.120
Yeah, I mean, he's given good lip service to Linux in the past, but I feel like he's

44:40.120 --> 44:41.120
never given it a good, I don't know.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.120
That actually might be why.

44:42.120 --> 44:44.720
He should know better though, he should know better is the thing.

44:44.720 --> 44:49.240
That might be why, because if you look at Puppy, Puppy is awesome, it is great for what

44:49.240 --> 44:53.480
it's designed for to get as much as you can out of the hardware, but it is not designed

44:53.480 --> 44:57.040
to be completely user-friendly, it is not for average users.

44:57.040 --> 45:02.800
People using XD should not be using Ubuntu because their hardware is that old, but Unity

45:02.800 --> 45:03.800
is not.

45:03.800 --> 45:07.200
Well, no, the latest versions of Unity are much more light.

45:07.200 --> 45:10.800
Go ahead, let's give Daredevil a chance to go.

45:10.800 --> 45:13.800
To be fair, most users don't even uninstall things.

45:13.800 --> 45:18.240
If you actually do any maintenance, they don't even uninstall, they just keep installing.

45:18.240 --> 45:20.240
So as long as it works.

45:20.240 --> 45:21.240
Right.

45:21.240 --> 45:22.240
Yeah.

45:22.240 --> 45:25.720
And so, Puppy, I wanted to give, because Puppy, did you try to pop up with something that

45:25.720 --> 45:26.720
we haven't?

45:26.720 --> 45:29.480
Well, so I can see his point.

45:29.480 --> 45:35.680
He made a bunch of points that are fairly valid, that it has been for geeks in the past.

45:35.680 --> 45:40.960
And it's still for a lot, i3, and you could argue, KDE, very much for geeks, right?

45:40.960 --> 45:42.360
I think GNOME is a geek.

45:42.360 --> 45:46.160
I think, and I embrace that too at the same time, like I'm glad there's an OS for me.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.920
But the flip side is, I wouldn't say KDE is only for geeks, no, not only for geeks,

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
indeed.

45:50.920 --> 45:51.920
No, no, no, I mean.

45:51.920 --> 45:52.920
Windows to make the switch easier.

45:52.920 --> 45:55.000
Oh, I don't mean to make, I don't make KDE to sound like it's only for geeks.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.800
I mean to say, like, it's an operating, it is a desktop environment that appeals to geeks

45:58.800 --> 45:59.800
for a lot of reasons.

45:59.800 --> 46:00.800
Oh, yeah.

46:00.800 --> 46:04.720
The two things that struck me as problems here is one, we shouldn't let users break

46:04.720 --> 46:09.440
their desktop in quite that bad a way by typing a couple of commands, by removing, yeah, but

46:09.440 --> 46:12.240
then you're making the Mac, then you're, then it's a Mac.

46:12.240 --> 46:15.880
No, no, there's certain situations that we should not let happen.

46:15.880 --> 46:21.120
Like, you know, removing Ubuntu desktop, we try and that we try not to let you do that.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.840
But unfortunately, people do that.

46:22.840 --> 46:26.880
And for years, people have removed Ubuntu desktop for whatever reason, maybe they wanted

46:26.880 --> 46:30.520
to rip out Unity or rip out some bits and they remove Ubuntu desktop and the upgrade

46:30.520 --> 46:34.800
tool that they when they come to do an upgrade later on from one release to another, the

46:34.800 --> 46:36.800
upgrade tool depends on that being there.

46:36.800 --> 46:41.880
And what happens is you end up upgrading and not not installing packages that should be

46:41.880 --> 46:46.440
there and would be there if you had Ubuntu desktop there in the first place.

46:46.440 --> 46:51.200
The number of systems that I've seen broken that have been fixed by simply reinstalling

46:51.200 --> 46:55.960
that package and pulling in all its dependencies and then magically everything's fixed.

46:55.960 --> 47:04.600
So the problem that he had was following instructions from clueless numpties on IRC who felt that

47:04.600 --> 47:08.040
they were experts in this realm when in fact, they've typed that once and then probably

47:08.040 --> 47:13.400
bitched six months later when their own upgrade failed, which was their own fault and nobody

47:13.400 --> 47:14.400
else's.

47:14.400 --> 47:15.400
Right.

47:15.400 --> 47:19.240
And unfortunately, that IRC room is always full of fresh fools who are trying it for

47:19.240 --> 47:20.240
the first time.

47:20.240 --> 47:21.240
Riley, you wanted to make a disclaimer?

47:21.240 --> 47:22.240
Um, yeah.

47:22.240 --> 47:26.520
Like, Poppy, here's the thought on that, like, why don't y'all put this like whenever you

47:26.520 --> 47:30.720
want to add that upgrade, why don't y'all put a disclaimer in it like warning this can

47:30.720 --> 47:32.760
break your system or something like that?

47:32.760 --> 47:33.760
We do.

47:33.760 --> 47:37.840
But we don't, we don't recommend this upgrade as a way to go from one release to another.

47:37.840 --> 47:41.560
We've got a graphical upgrade tool that tries to do a whole bunch of sanity checks.

47:41.560 --> 47:44.640
It's called Update Manager, and it's got a button that you press to upgrade from one

47:44.640 --> 47:45.680
release to the next.

47:45.680 --> 47:46.960
And it's got a whole lot of sanity checks.

47:46.960 --> 47:53.640
It does things like disable PPAs and check for the existence of certain packages and

47:53.640 --> 47:55.560
it tries to figure out that kind of stuff.

47:55.560 --> 47:58.200
If you work around it, we've got to let you work around it.

47:58.200 --> 48:02.040
Otherwise, we're giving you a walled garden like an iPad and one big button in the middle.

48:02.040 --> 48:05.160
Yeah, I think people like even like Dave right now, he's I think you guys are missing like

48:05.160 --> 48:07.120
Ubuntu desktop isn't unity.

48:07.120 --> 48:08.760
It's like and maybe this is what people get wrong.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.680
It's like a lot of the bits that make it Ubuntu.

48:11.680 --> 48:14.160
And so that's why when you pull that and that's what he did.

48:14.160 --> 48:18.680
I mean, and I go back to there's no I just I again, it's not a real scenario use case

48:18.680 --> 48:19.680
scenario.

48:19.680 --> 48:23.320
Maybe you should have an Ubuntu should have a feature where when you try to remove it

48:23.320 --> 48:25.640
it says Leo, is that you?

48:25.640 --> 48:31.880
What do you think should match it Ubuntu or distros like it?

48:31.880 --> 48:34.600
Maybe make it a lot harder for the user to break it like that.

48:34.600 --> 48:38.080
Well, that's what the first two things that come to mind on this one, these are the two

48:38.080 --> 48:41.720
important things to keep in mind on this is first and foremost, anybody that's been in

48:41.720 --> 48:46.320
technology as long as Leo is concerned, taking advice from an IRC chat room should be slapped

48:46.320 --> 48:47.360
at that level.

48:47.360 --> 48:50.600
If it's a new operating system, you're not that experienced with don't take advice from

48:50.600 --> 48:51.600
a chat room.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.600
Just don't.

48:52.600 --> 48:54.760
If you want to take advice from the chat room, that's fine, but then verify it.

48:54.760 --> 49:00.720
Make sure it actually matches the second piece of information is as far as the warnings are

49:00.720 --> 49:01.720
concerned.

49:01.720 --> 49:07.440
Ubuntu warnings are excellent, but I think that they're a little soft.

49:07.440 --> 49:11.440
You're talking about people as a whole, especially as a community, tend to be pretty boneheaded

49:11.440 --> 49:15.800
and unless you make it in big blinking red text, they're going to ignore it.

49:15.800 --> 49:22.160
So maybe spice it up a little bit because it is really soft.

49:22.160 --> 49:23.160
I've seen the warnings.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.160
They're not really that compelling.

49:24.160 --> 49:26.400
We talked about this on TechSnap.

49:26.400 --> 49:30.920
There was a study, a university data, about the language used in the warnings and saying

49:30.920 --> 49:36.360
this file could be dangerous isn't helpful because it doesn't tell you why it could be

49:36.360 --> 49:37.480
dangerous and so on.

49:37.480 --> 49:41.800
So saying this upgrade could break your computer and they're like, well, yeah, okay, whatever,

49:41.800 --> 49:47.320
whereas it says doing this may cause Chromium not to work.

49:47.320 --> 49:53.000
Maybe something more clear like this is how it actually affects you.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
It was like two or three months ago in TechSnap.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.200
There's an actual paper from a university about updating these warnings specifically

49:59.200 --> 50:03.640
they were talking about the ones your browser gives so that people clicking through the

50:03.640 --> 50:07.760
warnings and then getting spyware and then being like, why did I get spyware?

50:07.760 --> 50:14.100
Because you said I accept responsibility and will take this file that my computer tried

50:14.100 --> 50:16.680
to warn me but it did it in such a way that I ignored it.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.640
In general, this is a little bit overblown.

50:19.640 --> 50:20.720
This is a little bit over-exaggerated.

50:20.720 --> 50:26.200
Yes, it did cause a big problem but this is a package problem that could have been like

50:26.200 --> 50:27.480
it was a tiny problem.

50:27.480 --> 50:30.200
It would never usually come up under normal circumstances.

50:30.200 --> 50:34.560
Well, Sarah Devlin, wouldn't you argue that maybe the package manager has a role and perhaps

50:34.560 --> 50:38.480
we get good information before we install, but what about information before we uninstall?

50:38.480 --> 50:43.400
Yes, because I mean, if you were uninstalling the desktop environment, you should say like,

50:43.400 --> 50:49.100
all right, you're not going to be able to then have a graphical interface and maybe

50:49.100 --> 50:53.480
a little link or description of what actually that means.

50:53.480 --> 51:00.200
So when you're removing Unity, you know what that means and what that will impact.

51:00.200 --> 51:06.000
But at the same time, this is also the problem with not having properly curated documentation,

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
right?

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
Yeah.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.760
He's taking advice from the chat room because in general with Linux, the chat room is the

51:10.760 --> 51:12.320
best place to get advice.

51:12.320 --> 51:19.000
But if the chat room is an official chat room and not some random Twitch chat room, there

51:19.000 --> 51:26.200
are other people there who... if he'd gone into Hashibantu, there is no way anyone would

51:26.200 --> 51:29.760
have told him to sudo apt-get remove Unity and force him to...

51:29.760 --> 51:32.600
I'm going to sit in that channel and tell that to everyone now.

51:32.600 --> 51:35.480
You got to understand though that like Leo, that's his IRC room.

51:35.480 --> 51:36.480
He trusts those guys.

51:36.480 --> 51:40.200
You know, he's got regulars in there that he looks at, you know, just like me.

51:40.200 --> 51:41.600
I like my chat room.

51:41.600 --> 51:44.320
I got people I take advice from and things like that.

51:44.320 --> 51:51.280
So I think what it is is he went into that situation not knowing what to do and people

51:51.280 --> 51:56.040
that he knows who's given him good advice before told him what to do and he did it.

51:56.040 --> 51:59.680
And then he based his judgment on what happened as a result of that.

51:59.680 --> 52:05.660
But maybe moving away from Leo, because like we said, it's a bigger problem overall.

52:05.660 --> 52:11.360
I wonder if this isn't exactly why what's happening with Ubuntu and Convergence has

52:11.360 --> 52:15.840
to happen because we have to almost just come at this from a whole new fresh perspective

52:15.840 --> 52:20.600
where we say, yeah, you want to use this because then you can have the operating system on

52:20.600 --> 52:21.600
one device.

52:21.600 --> 52:25.840
And yeah, it's Linux, but it's this Ubuntu version where they've kind of made this whole

52:25.840 --> 52:28.680
new interface and it works on all your systems.

52:28.680 --> 52:33.040
Like I wonder if we need a reboot of it all together and that's perhaps why Google doesn't

52:33.040 --> 52:37.480
even say it's not a Linux Chromebook, right?

52:37.480 --> 52:38.480
It's Chrome OS.

52:38.480 --> 52:40.200
It's a Chrome OS Chromebook.

52:40.200 --> 52:44.720
And I think it's that same exact philosophy there.

52:44.720 --> 52:45.720
Interesting point.

52:45.720 --> 52:46.720
Interesting point.

52:46.720 --> 52:50.200
I think at the end of the day, a full screen that pops up says you have to you actually

52:50.200 --> 52:51.200
have to type out the word.

52:51.200 --> 52:55.760
I am an idiot if you install this thing, because literally you're not only acknowledging the

52:55.760 --> 52:59.620
fact you are, in fact, an idiot, but you're also acknowledging the fact that you are going

52:59.620 --> 53:02.340
to be doing something potentially stupid.

53:02.340 --> 53:03.340
I say that solves all the problems.

53:03.340 --> 53:04.340
That's just me.

53:04.340 --> 53:06.080
Think about all these controversies around.

53:06.080 --> 53:11.680
Think about all the controversy around Mir and how different that makes Ubuntu and how

53:11.680 --> 53:13.560
I think, I don't know.

53:13.560 --> 53:14.560
Who knows?

53:14.560 --> 53:19.640
But I would be, if I was a betting man, I would bet in the next year or two, the conversation

53:19.640 --> 53:25.180
around Ubuntu and the desktop is going to switch from all this heat about SystemD and

53:25.180 --> 53:30.360
all that and Mir to, God, all these apps feel like big blown up mobile apps on my desktop

53:30.360 --> 53:33.800
and we're going to go through a period where those get refined for both types of environments

53:33.800 --> 53:36.000
and I didn't get tons of crap for that for a while.

53:36.000 --> 53:42.120
But I think all of these controversies will build toward this overall narrative that Ubuntu

53:42.120 --> 53:46.760
is different than Linux and so if you've ever had a problem with Linux, well, there's this

53:46.760 --> 53:52.000
Ubuntu one where they went off and they polished off some of these rough edges and they have

53:52.000 --> 53:56.500
this convergent system where you can get a phone and a desktop and a TV thing and it's

53:56.500 --> 54:01.000
kind of neat and if you've ever had a problem with Linux where you have this weird software

54:01.000 --> 54:04.280
problem, well, Ubuntu takes care of all that because they have a software app store just

54:04.280 --> 54:07.840
like the iOS does and only it works on your desktop too.

54:07.840 --> 54:09.880
It's really cool because you just buy the app once.

54:09.880 --> 54:13.960
Like I could see this, almost all of these controversies are almost contributing to an

54:13.960 --> 54:19.520
end result narrative that almost helps establish the differentiating brand that Ubuntu needs

54:19.520 --> 54:24.120
to sort of break away from all this noise and these old assumptions that old guys like

54:24.120 --> 54:29.660
Leo are making and I'm not saying it's necessarily a good thing, but I almost wonder if at the

54:29.660 --> 54:35.180
end of all of this, all the stuff we're talking about today eventually adds to this perception

54:35.180 --> 54:39.040
that sort of gives Linux a push and gives Ubuntu a push.

54:39.040 --> 54:40.040
Does that make sense?

54:40.040 --> 54:41.600
Yeah, I think so.

54:41.600 --> 54:42.600
I think so.

54:42.600 --> 54:46.320
I, you know, there's aspects of it that have me concerned, but I think the latter point

54:46.320 --> 54:50.300
of, you know, the old way of thinking, the old way of doing things, old, you know, legacy

54:50.300 --> 54:52.640
way of doing things isn't always better.

54:52.640 --> 54:55.760
Just because we've been doing it all along doesn't make it right.

54:55.760 --> 54:57.920
So I think I'm down with that facet of it.

54:57.920 --> 55:03.680
And this also goes back a little bit to that old horse that I love to kick about more responsible

55:03.680 --> 55:04.840
journalism in the sense.

55:04.840 --> 55:13.360
I think, you know, Leo perhaps owes it to his national audience to actually get a Linux

55:13.360 --> 55:16.480
machine for a little while and try it as the vendor intends.

55:16.480 --> 55:21.640
Like I would love, for example, for Leo to get contacted by System76 and give him a whole

55:21.640 --> 55:25.320
inclusive like here's a laptop, well actually, you know, something like that.

55:25.320 --> 55:28.880
I don't know if maybe if he could just try it over with Adele, he already has the machine,

55:28.880 --> 55:32.760
but if it was some sort of here's the whole product, use the product as it's supposed

55:32.760 --> 55:35.860
to be like, here Leo, like somebody sit down with him.

55:35.860 --> 55:38.900
Like if there was somebody who could go to Twit and sit down with Leo and be like, this

55:38.900 --> 55:42.960
is this, this is that, and not, not, you know, because the problem is I don't want to repeat

55:42.960 --> 55:45.960
the same scenario that just happened again and have it reaffirmed.

55:45.960 --> 55:54.100
There's only one rule you need to ask him to follow and it's not a vast list of commands

55:54.100 --> 55:55.100
and tutorials.

55:55.100 --> 55:59.360
Just don't copy and paste dumb commands pasted by idiots on the internet.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.360
It's really simple.

56:00.360 --> 56:07.760
I know, but I see, here's what I want is I want, I want, I don't, this is now something

56:07.760 --> 56:11.440
he'll just continue to perpetuate and I think a lot of people do it and I just, I'm trying

56:11.440 --> 56:15.680
to figure out a way we as a community could maybe evangelize like there are, maybe there's

56:15.680 --> 56:22.120
people in our audience that are Twit fans and Linux unplugged fans that could go to

56:22.120 --> 56:24.960
the Twit studios at some point because they have an open studio and maybe they could take

56:24.960 --> 56:28.120
their laptop there and they could show it to Leo how it's supposed to work.

56:28.120 --> 56:33.040
Like maybe one of the ways we could address, like seriously address some of these problems

56:33.040 --> 56:37.280
is by just getting a little boots on the ground here and using the spread of our audience

56:37.280 --> 56:42.720
to say, Hey, if you ever, ever have an opportunity to give somebody a guided tour, do it.

56:42.720 --> 56:46.960
And it like, I don't know, I think this, this is the problem that he had.

56:46.960 --> 56:47.960
Yeah.

56:47.960 --> 56:48.960
Okay.

56:48.960 --> 56:52.000
We can talk about why it happened and the bugs and the stupid commands people ran, but

56:52.000 --> 56:59.360
it's a symptom of his mentality that, you know, gung-ho going in and trying this thing

56:59.360 --> 57:00.360
out.

57:00.360 --> 57:06.840
I don't think that fixing that one guy, despite his large listenership and viewership, I don't

57:06.840 --> 57:11.240
think that fixing that is going to necessarily undo what he's already said.

57:11.240 --> 57:12.640
It'd have to be a lot of people.

57:12.640 --> 57:17.240
I know he's just, he's just an example of a problem that affects, it's a much larger

57:17.240 --> 57:18.240
problem.

57:18.240 --> 57:21.840
I think he's well aware of how the system should work, you know, he knows exactly what

57:21.840 --> 57:22.840
should happen.

57:22.840 --> 57:27.600
It's a problem is he has a, he has an immediate perceptive bias of the system when he sees

57:27.600 --> 57:28.600
it.

57:28.600 --> 57:32.440
It's this immediate assumption he has going in, whereas this, I think he just, I think

57:32.440 --> 57:38.120
he just had a very valid point that the point he was making and he was, he was using a rather

57:38.120 --> 57:42.120
contrived example, but the point he was trying to make was sometimes you get weird error

57:42.120 --> 57:46.720
messages or odd situations that are difficult to fix.

57:46.720 --> 57:47.720
And that is true.

57:47.720 --> 57:54.360
It's probably more true for Linux because people don't know it that way.

57:54.360 --> 57:55.560
I go back to bias.

57:55.560 --> 58:01.560
The entire, the entire reason Leo Laporte, and I'm not even BSing here, the entire reason

58:01.560 --> 58:06.400
Leo Laporte has a national radio show is because Windows users constantly have problems and

58:06.400 --> 58:10.020
he can stack a phone bank of Windows users having issues.

58:10.020 --> 58:13.400
So it is a problem that affects every single operating system.

58:13.400 --> 58:17.320
So it is, it is a bias to say it only applies to Linux.

58:17.320 --> 58:21.260
If you, if you, if you F around with your registry on Windows, if you go download C

58:21.260 --> 58:24.960
cleaner and wipe that registry one too many times, you're going to have all kinds of weird

58:24.960 --> 58:27.560
software problems and all kinds of DLLs that won't start.

58:27.560 --> 58:31.800
This is, it's not you in a ripping out Ubuntu desktop is equivalent to taking a hatchet

58:31.800 --> 58:33.240
to the Windows registry.

58:33.240 --> 58:38.040
And it is, it, you, you cannot say that it's something that is unique to Linux or something

58:38.040 --> 58:39.420
is unique to Windows.

58:39.420 --> 58:42.280
And so that's why I say there is a little bit of a bias at play here.

58:42.280 --> 58:43.560
That's not even a little bit.

58:43.560 --> 58:48.360
But the nice thing about Linux is those, the issues that he had, if he just stopped, they

58:48.360 --> 58:52.480
could have been fixed and very easily fixed with a couple of app get commands.

58:52.480 --> 58:56.560
Probably we could have like got him back on track, whereas taking a hatchet to the registry

58:56.560 --> 59:02.160
is actually quite a hard thing to, to, you know, back out of, but, but all of these,

59:02.160 --> 59:06.800
all of these systems, Windows, Linux, and Mac, they all require experts on hand to help

59:06.800 --> 59:08.720
you when you get into a tricky situation.

59:08.720 --> 59:14.000
I don't, I don't think Linux requires more experts or it just requires experts with different

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
knowledge.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
That's all.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Yeah, exactly.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.760
And, and I don't know, and I wonder if why maybe if we, if there is some sort of new

59:20.760 --> 59:26.940
magical product category, maybe the perceptions and the, and the biases would be put aside

59:26.940 --> 59:31.120
and they would start a new, they would, you know, maybe he wouldn't feel like he should

59:31.120 --> 59:33.360
just gung ho and go in like a cowboy.

59:33.360 --> 59:36.040
Maybe he'd feel like this is something new that I need to understand and spend a little

59:36.040 --> 59:37.040
time with.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.000
And that's a road trip to Petaluma.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Yeah, I know.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.440
We should, you know, we should do as a live Linux action show from twit, like while they're

59:43.440 --> 59:46.440
doing twit and like, that would be funny.

59:46.440 --> 59:49.880
Well, so here's the thing with Leo that most people don't understand.

59:49.880 --> 59:52.360
And I only know of, because I know people that used to work with him.

59:52.360 --> 59:56.960
So let me, let me put this to your point blank at the end of the day, Leo doesn't like to

59:56.960 --> 59:57.960
be wrong.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:02.640
And so when something goes wrong, you know, I, you know, that's my, that's my impression.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.640
I know.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.640
I know.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.640
Nobody does.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.640
Nobody does.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.240
So I am going to get so much hate mail from our audience for saying anything bad about

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.240
Leo.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.240
And I was a nice guy.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.800
I don't want to make this approach.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.720
And the reason, the reason, the reason why we are doing this is a quite literally it's

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:25.280
available in audio B it was on a national radio show in the United States that also

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.640
streamed on the internet and listened by thousands of people and then downloaded by about another,

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.540
you know, a hundred thousand people.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:37.960
And see, it was made to it spotlight special and I, that, that just pulled my irk chain.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.680
This isn't necessarily about Leo.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.480
Leo is representing a common bias that is out there that many people that may be a lot

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.480
of people even in our audience have.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:49.600
So I am not trying, I'm not trying to flame Leo, but he, exactly.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.600
He knows better.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:54.800
And what he really owes, if you're going to, if you're in the position, if you're in the

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.080
position of acting as a radio personality on a nationally syndicated radio show, giving

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:06.200
technology advice, I would argue it is perhaps your responsibility to actually have experience

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.720
with some of these things before you give such a definitive answer on the topic.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:17.720
The issue is probably like is, is kind of, uh, goes back to a, every tech person has

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.560
the same kind of opinion where they don't want to, if someone asks me a question, they

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.920
just don't want to say, I don't know.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.240
They could just, they could say, I don't know, and someone move on and get help.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:31.760
But we want to say, we want to be helpful even if what we say is not helpful.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.760
Right.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.480
You got to have an answer, especially when you're on the radio.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.480
Yeah.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.640
Just, it's the difference is when I'm wrong, it's a friend of mine having, having a problem

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.360
that I have to figure out how to fix it versus millions of people he is never going to talk

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.360
to.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.440
However, I would just like to say, I mean, the only, I know Popey made a good point,

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:55.200
you know, like changing Leo's mind in the big picture really is just a drop in the ocean,

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.520
but I actually think it's a drop we could make happen.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.800
So if somebody is in the California area and wants to go up there with a, like a, like

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:07.560
a ultra pro or something like that, or if somebody has a, a nice, uh, you know, a ThinkPad

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.360
running a Ubuntu or Linux like that, go show it to him.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.800
Like, uh, go up there Sunday, uh, go after the tech guy show.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.160
So show up about 2 PM and you'll have an hour between 2 PM and 3 PM where he's just screwing

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.840
off sitting at the twit table and you can sit down and you can talk to him and you can

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.360
show him how to actually use it and maybe you can change his mind.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:31.800
And maybe next time he's at, well, there you go.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.400
And the next time, and the next time he's, the next time he's on a nationally syndicated

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.000
radio show asked, what should I do when I replace XP?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.640
Maybe he'll have a slightly different answer.

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:44.020
And maybe if you're even comfortable explaining to him what the problem was and, and kind

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:48.720
of where he went wrong, that might help and make it equivalent to, you know, taking a

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.380
hack to the registry, make you, he'll understand that.

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:55.240
And I think if we can at least change one voice on the radio, especially at a time like

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:59.840
this, when literally I guarantee it next weekend, it's the weekend after XP support ends, he's

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.660
going to get calls asked what I should, what should I do with my old XP machine?

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:06.320
This is a change we could actually make, but I would say a more productive approach is

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.680
to just reach out to Kim commando quite honestly, because I think they're about as equal.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.240
They're equally relevant in my mind personally.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.240
They're both nice people.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.320
I have no problem with them personally, but I, I, I there's things that there's, there's

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.160
so much stuff behind the scenes that makes me livid.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.920
It's like, Oh, Leo, this Leo, that Leo's a nice guy, but he's not, he's not the second

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.920
coming.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.320
He makes mistakes just like any one of us might and you know, yeah, he's human, but

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.240
at the end of the day, let's, you know, I don't, I think it's cool to show him and stuff,

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:37.000
but I think honestly going out and to someone that's actually going to be more receptive,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.920
I don't think he's going to be as receptive as people think he's going to be.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.920
I really don't.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.920
Yeah.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.920
Maybe not.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.840
Maybe instead of sending someone there, like if someone goes there to teach him how to

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:52.080
use it or show him how we could take it to somebody would do that, but bring their parents

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.040
with them and say, here's an actual average user.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.040
See what happens.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.040
There you go.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.040
Yeah.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.040
That would be interesting.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.040
Yeah.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040
All right.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.040
Okay.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.280
Well, so the final thing, or there is one thing that we have to worry about is that

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:10.280
Leo's been lulled into a false sense of security by Steve Gibson because he said he was okay

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.920
to run for certain power users who apparently quote unquote know what they're doing.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:18.720
This is also something I do take a bit of an issue with essentially they're saying XP

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.720
is fine.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.840
In fact, you don't even have to have the latest service pack of XP or even the last update

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.840
since that latest service pack, all you have to do is don't run as a user.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.980
Well, I can tell you as somebody who has had hundreds and hundreds, literally hundreds

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:37.160
and hundreds of users that I was support for and almost the vast majority, at least the

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.440
vast majority of them, I would say almost 90% of them were all running as regular users

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.720
on XP had incredible amounts of problems.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.840
Yes, it's running as a regular user is still a good idea.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.840
You know, it helps you.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.500
It keeps like that drive by malware problem.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:57.240
Like it helps like IE stuff tamps that down, but everyone clean nailed it.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.240
Leo needs a co-host.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.240
That would be awesome.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.240
I say Stallman problem solved.

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.680
The problem is recommending XP, like literally recommending XP over Linux is a little, I

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.800
think, I think it's a little almost dangerous.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.800
Oh, it's beyond dangerous.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.880
Yeah.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.680
So anyway, that's why I'm so angry about it just because it's like, it's so irresponsible.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.520
It's one thing if you don't know better, but come on.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:20.600
But what Gibson said doesn't make sense either because if the power users, even if they're

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:25.640
a windows power user, they're, they are fully aware that they should not be running XP.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.600
Yeah, exactly.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.420
I mean, yeah, this is, see, this is, but okay, but okay, let's put this in perspective here.

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:37.120
This is the level of bias that we're up against that the option is actually for them in their

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:42.440
minds it is a better option to continue using XP for somebody who wants to use Amazon and

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.440
check email.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.200
It is a better option for them to use XP than use Linux.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:50.860
That is the amount of bias that is out there and that to me seems like a Berlin wall level

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:51.860
of bias.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.860
True.

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:56.820
You know, XP could be secure if you remove all drives, all USB ports and totally disconnected

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:57.820
from the internet.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.560
I mean, it's the most secure operating system in the world.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.560
There you go.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.560
Just run it from Ram.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.560
Never restart.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:03.560
Exactly.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.560
See.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.560
Yeah.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.560
All right.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:10.640
All right, guys, I got to go see the electricians at the studio and I, gosh, I hope this didn't

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.640
come across necessarily as bashing one person.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.920
Well, and direct your bashing to me because I'm the one bashing and he's the one sticking

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920
up for me.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.280
So throw it my way because I'll defend it.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.680
So I think we'll have to bump it to the big show.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:26.880
I think we'll, we can take more, we'll take more on the topic in the post show, but the

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:31.320
topic we'll have to bump to the big show is Ubuntu makes the Amazon product results opt

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.320
in.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.560
Love to know your thoughts on this one, guys.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:38.320
So leave us some feedback either in our main subreddit thread where we always post these

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:43.600
shows or you can go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com clicking that contact link and choose Linux

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.720
unplugged from the dropdown.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.800
What do you think about the changes coming to the Ubuntu scopes?

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.800
Do you care?

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.800
Are you glad?

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.800
Is it about time?

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.800
Is it a huge reversal?

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.800
It is outrageous.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.080
I'd love to know your thoughts.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.080
Just send them in to us.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.680
Don't forget you can join us live on Tuesdays, 2 p.m. Pacific over to jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:03.800
slash calendar and line us on Thursday, 7 p.m. on jblive.tv.

Matt, I'll see you on Sunday.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.480
Download Sabi and load it on your machine and get an opinion, okay?

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.480
Okay.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.280
All right, everyone.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.440
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.840
Join us on Sunday for the big show.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:22.920
We'll be reviewing Sabi and Linux and then if everything works out as planned next Tuesday

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:23.920
on Linux Unplugged.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.920
All right, everyone.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.920
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.800
