WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.520
How

00:01.520 --> 00:06.720
How much of your Bitcoin stash have you still got left Chris or have you exhausted it yet?

00:06.720 --> 00:11.960
I haven't exhausted it yet, but I am starting to get more picky about how I spend it. Yeah, I've

00:12.720 --> 00:14.240
I've

00:14.240 --> 00:21.800
Depleted mine by about eight and change Bitcoin this last week. Oh, what did you oh really and and and I worry

00:22.040 --> 00:26.760
See, I've been watching the price. In fact at this very moment. It's at six hundred and twelve dollars and eighty-one cents

00:26.760 --> 00:31.200
U.s. Not that I'm following not that you're not that I'm multiple tickers on your desk

00:31.840 --> 00:37.920
But why why would you do you want to share the class with the transaction was because that sounds like a big chunk of Bitcoin

00:37.920 --> 00:40.160
I mean, I gotta look that up. But let's see eight

00:40.760 --> 00:45.160
Bitcoin can you can Google do this eight Bitcoin in USD? Is that five grand?

00:46.120 --> 00:52.120
Yeah, it doesn't doesn't do it when you type it in but I wonder if I could ask Google 8 BTC is you basically five

00:52.120 --> 00:54.420
Grand. Yeah. Yeah. Yep, just about yeah

00:54.420 --> 00:56.420
Wow

00:57.780 --> 01:00.620
That's some buying power and that is I

01:01.300 --> 01:06.820
Have been tempted to cash mine in for a very large laptop recently. I've been thinking more about doing production on the road

01:06.820 --> 01:11.180
Oh, that'd be cool. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this is this is how much is that Acer 21? Just curious

01:11.180 --> 01:15.220
I don't know what the price is. I don't know if they even have a price yet. It's probably not out

01:15.220 --> 01:19.260
Yeah, they probably don't have an announced MSRP. So is it is it a was it a laptop wimpy?

01:20.460 --> 01:22.460
two laptops Oh

01:22.460 --> 01:25.480
Wow, you were all of a sudden the in them in the hardware

01:26.020 --> 01:27.300
Yeah, yeah

01:27.300 --> 01:34.540
So I I haven't had much hardware for a long time and then this year um has been a blowout year for new hard

01:34.660 --> 01:39.380
Yeah, sort of a restocking. Yeah, I've been selling stuff as I've been going along. Oh good. Yeah

01:40.620 --> 01:42.620
Yeah, I've got the I

01:42.940 --> 01:46.420
Haven't got it yet. It should arrive tomorrow. Hopefully the

01:46.420 --> 01:52.820
The top of the line Dell XPS 15. Oh, that's nice

01:53.300 --> 02:00.740
Yeah, and also the Dell XPS 13 developer edition. Are those both sky-like or both sky-like? Yeah

02:00.860 --> 02:04.700
Mm-hmm. That'll be interesting. He's gonna be development machines

02:05.940 --> 02:07.940
Yes. Yes one one

02:08.660 --> 02:10.660
for mobile stuff and

02:10.660 --> 02:16.020
And one for around the house sort of

02:16.740 --> 02:18.160
dev work and

02:18.160 --> 02:20.160
To and from family and stuff like that

02:20.160 --> 02:25.800
But I really wanted something with them 4k screens and touch to to experiment with so

02:26.580 --> 02:28.500
So yeah

02:28.500 --> 02:34.500
Congrats about accessories as well. So that'll be interesting. Were you able to take advantage of Dell direct using Bitcoin?

02:35.920 --> 02:37.920
No, I went through

02:37.920 --> 02:42.780
some local companies that are part of the Dell outlet program

02:43.940 --> 02:45.340
Interesting. Yeah

02:45.340 --> 02:49.220
Whoo, that'll be really cool. But great. It'd be great to hear your thoughts on them

02:49.220 --> 02:50.520
The I know for me

02:50.520 --> 02:55.740
I one of the reasons I pulled the trigger on the XPS 13 was that high DPI display because that that was a game-changer

02:55.740 --> 02:57.740
For how I do my reviews, right?

02:58.500 --> 03:05.060
Wow, I think I waited too long even mm-hmm, but maybe I don't know it kind of depends Linux is also kind of dragging its feet

03:05.060 --> 03:09.140
So you you got yours last year. Is that right? Mm-hmm

03:09.580 --> 03:13.900
Yeah, yeah. Okay. I couldn't remember if it was last year's all the years but it blended to one now

03:14.980 --> 03:20.500
And you got a windowsy version that you adapted with the adapted as a polite word

03:20.500 --> 03:28.300
Yeah, I pulled out the wireless and I put an Intel card in and then I installed Linux. Yeah, it's interesting actually reading reading because um

03:30.620 --> 03:33.660
There's been lots of firmware updates for these devices

03:33.660 --> 03:38.660
Which you sort of have to apply and some of them you can only apply through Windows. So

03:39.340 --> 03:46.100
Bust out the trial versions of Windows 10 in order to update all the drivers. That's a matches and firmware. Yeah, I know

03:46.900 --> 03:52.740
The BIOS you can do but it's like the Thunderbolt firmware and touchscreen firmware. You can't do outside of Windows

03:54.300 --> 03:59.580
But it's interesting how many people that are running Windows actually say swap out the Broadcom

03:59.580 --> 04:04.100
For an Intel adapter because it yeah. Yeah, that was much simpler when I did that

04:04.100 --> 04:07.680
Yeah, yeah, but but it's not for compatibility with drivers

04:07.680 --> 04:13.860
It's just the Intel stuff works better than the rural cum stuff or at least it did then when it was sort of new

04:13.860 --> 04:19.740
I think it's all been resolved now, but yeah, it's interesting to see some of the parallels between the two communities

04:20.980 --> 04:24.900
Yeah, it's funny because I I really really like my expert

04:24.900 --> 04:30.500
Yeah, XPS 13 is as turt as far as far as size and right portability goes but

04:31.420 --> 04:36.020
Man having now now having worked on some desktops some newer refreshed desktops again

04:36.020 --> 04:39.260
I really feel like the there is some serious advantage to a large machine

04:39.260 --> 04:43.300
I can maybe I could maybe have a much more portable workload where I could do more work

04:43.300 --> 04:46.260
We're usually less limited by things. You don't have to think about it. Mm-hmm

04:46.660 --> 04:49.980
Mm-hmm your manual example, you know, you have a lot going on at once. Yeah, and so

04:49.980 --> 04:56.420
I would there is so to buy that laptop in Bitcoin. Did you have to convert it first or were you able?

04:56.420 --> 05:01.060
How did that so I'm wondering if like you were able to avoid like brexit induced

05:01.940 --> 05:04.540
economic depression like type conditions

05:05.260 --> 05:08.860
I can't tell you how how valueless our currencies

05:09.780 --> 05:15.900
And that's why Bitcoin could look even more attractive at this moment. Yeah. Yeah, so for both transactions

05:15.900 --> 05:22.460
I was able to keep it purely through Bitcoin which was a key part in actually being able to do it. Yeah. Mm-hmm

05:22.460 --> 05:23.980
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah

05:23.980 --> 05:25.060
I wonder

05:25.060 --> 05:31.940
but for anyone for anyone listening in this part of the world specifically in the UK and you're interested in Bitcoin and you need an

05:31.940 --> 05:33.940
exchange that is reliable and works

05:34.660 --> 05:37.060
there is an exchange called coin corner and

05:38.260 --> 05:42.700
You can move your money in and out of a Bitcoin wallet

05:42.700 --> 05:49.620
No problem whatsoever and cash out no issues pay in it's really really simple works very well

05:50.540 --> 05:55.680
So they're a semi offshore. They're in the Isle of Man, which is sort of a tax haven

05:56.380 --> 05:57.820
and

05:57.820 --> 06:00.940
Independently governed so a good place to put your Bitcoin

06:00.940 --> 06:11.940
This is Linux Unplugged episode 161 for September 6th, 2016

06:19.060 --> 06:25.420
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's not all that interested in tomorrow's Apple event

06:25.420 --> 06:28.100
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes

06:28.100 --> 06:34.820
I'm glad you're here today because apparently Linux doesn't take Labor Day off. Nope. We have a lot to cover

06:34.820 --> 06:40.940
In fact, the show this week is packed full of updates from some of our favorite open source projects all over the net

06:43.060 --> 06:45.060
Including a little suspense

06:45.120 --> 06:52.380
Including a little distro review. Oh and even some Waylon love it is a classic episode of the unplugged program

06:52.380 --> 06:57.420
So super excited to be here. We're back from Labor Day. You didn't miss a beat Wes

06:57.420 --> 06:59.580
You are on top of with tons of links this week

06:59.700 --> 07:06.900
So we're gonna go through all of those so brace yourselves mentally and let's bring in that mumble room time appropriate greetings virtual lug

07:10.340 --> 07:11.580
Hey, oh

07:11.580 --> 07:17.860
Hello guys, so Wes is over here rapidly tap tap typing away on his computer where he has once a gun

07:18.500 --> 07:23.420
Trying out another distro for us to discuss here on the unplugged show. So that'll be coming up in a little bit

07:23.420 --> 07:29.220
I'll give you a hint. It might be the best KD desktop ever. It just might but you have to stay tuned

07:29.220 --> 07:31.220
Yeah, we then might not it might not

07:31.820 --> 07:36.940
You never you never really know, but why don't we start out since I just hinted with a little KD news

07:36.940 --> 07:40.180
Or a little KD review. How about we start with a little KD news?

07:41.540 --> 07:46.260
Speaking of Waylon speaking of KD. I just threw them all together in a sandwich and that is our

07:46.820 --> 07:51.020
first update this week the KD neon developers are switching to

07:51.900 --> 07:53.260
Wayland

07:53.260 --> 07:55.100
by default

07:55.100 --> 07:56.340
Yeah

07:56.340 --> 08:02.580
Yeah, you're ready for this now you guys remember neon that's the more a cutting-edge version of the KD desktop that sets a top

08:02.580 --> 08:04.100
of Ubuntu

08:04.100 --> 08:09.460
Now they're gonna start moving forward for their developer unstable packages to use Wayland by default now

08:09.460 --> 08:13.740
There's gonna be some conditions here. There still has to be some work done on X X Wayland

08:14.580 --> 08:16.260
Plasma 5 8 is required

08:16.260 --> 08:21.760
There's some other upstream updates that have to be made and also if you're on Nvidia, you're still gonna be using X

08:21.760 --> 08:23.760
It's gonna default you back to X, right?

08:24.520 --> 08:26.280
But the Wayland is getting nice

08:26.280 --> 08:33.220
So we have this we have this story here from the KD neon project and then here's another story for door 25

08:33.800 --> 08:40.880
Technical technical advisory board for Fedora has given the thumbs up for Fedora 25 to ship Wayland by default if they want wow

08:40.880 --> 08:46.580
Now the developers could still choose not to just like they did for 24 because they got the same approval for Fedora 24 and they

08:46.580 --> 08:47.520
Decided to punt it

08:47.520 --> 08:52.720
But it's been given the go by the FS CEO as we all like to call it around here

08:52.720 --> 08:57.640
Which stands for fedora engineering and steering committee? I guess of course yeah, obviously

08:58.000 --> 09:02.960
so they gave it the green light they say they agree to go with Wayland by default and

09:03.600 --> 09:08.720
They'll make it clear how to switch back to x11 in the release notes if needed that was part of their requirements by the technical

09:08.720 --> 09:09.720
board

09:09.720 --> 09:12.600
Fedora 25 will be using gnome 3.22 by

09:12.600 --> 09:16.960
Default and it's currently scheduled home to ship on

09:17.440 --> 09:23.560
November 8th assuming there were no delays there will be never delays never delays, so let's take a moment Wes and

09:24.240 --> 09:27.620
Envision a future where fedora 25 actually ships

09:28.360 --> 09:30.780
With Waylon, let's just pretend like this actually happens

09:32.680 --> 09:36.680
All of like the major major major issues are fixed

09:36.680 --> 09:43.440
What's the first benefit you're looking forward to when you can boot up one day and Wayland is by default

09:43.440 --> 09:46.240
It's turned on ready to go. You're no longer using X

09:46.800 --> 09:48.840
What what what that day changes?

09:48.840 --> 09:55.920
I'm gonna be able to watch a show a YouTube video to one of my co-workers without being embarrassed by the screen tearing yes

09:56.280 --> 09:59.920
That's it for me. Yeah, in fact one of Wayland's taglines has always been every

10:00.560 --> 10:03.640
Frame is perfect right that would be huge

10:03.640 --> 10:09.960
Yeah, the famed like control it you know if I'm using MPV or something else where I can really and where it knows

10:09.960 --> 10:10.860
What's what it's doing?

10:10.860 --> 10:13.080
I don't really have that big like day-to-day watching problems

10:13.080 --> 10:16.680
But there's just always those videos or it's coming from an old flash client or something. It's just

10:17.280 --> 10:20.520
My computer is powerful enough. I have the GPU for it. It just looks like crap

10:20.520 --> 10:25.400
Yeah, that was gonna be my pick too does anybody else in the mumble room have a big like this is why I'm waiting for

10:25.400 --> 10:31.440
Wayland because you gotta ask yourself. What's all the excitement about it's gonna be a huge change things are gonna undoubtedly break

10:31.440 --> 10:36.280
Is there is there something on the other end of this transition that you're looking forward to for me?

10:36.280 --> 10:37.480
It's definitely the screen tearing thing

10:37.480 --> 10:42.080
I wonder if you know if anybody else in the mumble has any go ahead and jump in I was just reading there's a thread

10:42.080 --> 10:45.160
On on the fedora subreddit that talks about it

10:45.160 --> 10:49.680
They also you know this is a good one to multiple monitors with different DPI

10:49.680 --> 10:54.440
So you can have a high DPI monitor and a low DPI monitor and have a multi monitor set up that's like

10:54.440 --> 11:00.880
That's it's kind of embarrassing actually on Linux if you have a high DPI laptop with a with an internal screen

11:00.880 --> 11:04.160
It's high DPI, and you hook up an external monitor the external monitor

11:04.840 --> 11:10.760
Is is that as it is at a much lower resolution than you would like it's it's really kind of you know

11:10.760 --> 11:12.760
It's even more embarrassing what what?

11:13.120 --> 11:16.080
Microsoft Office failed you high DPI on a single monitor on Windows

11:16.840 --> 11:22.240
That's embarrassing. Well. Yeah, I mean the wind yeah, the Windows platform is not there's no excuse for that

11:22.240 --> 11:28.680
I know Microsoft's part office should work perfectly on Windows with high DPI. Yeah. Yeah, that is but yeah, I

11:28.680 --> 11:33.360
All right besides the besides OS 10 everyone has their problems there. I think

11:33.920 --> 11:37.720
Guys, I got a crack one open before we get into this next story because this is not the headline

11:37.720 --> 11:39.720
I expected to ever read on this show

11:44.280 --> 11:48.720
Adobe is updating the flash player using the Netscape plug-in API

11:50.400 --> 11:52.400
New version of flash is coming everybody

11:53.080 --> 11:54.320
well

11:54.320 --> 11:59.060
And I was trying to think about this why why would they why would they do this William?

11:59.060 --> 12:01.060
Do you have any guesses why Adobe would do this I?

12:01.640 --> 12:07.720
Mean besides Firefox support. I don't know does Firefox have any like workaround for dealing with that if they didn't do NPAPI

12:08.800 --> 12:13.760
Well, I guess Firefox could probably adopt them the PPAPI if they wanted to which

12:17.560 --> 12:21.160
Well Chrome and chromium are using the PPAPI already yeah, so it was opera yeah

12:21.160 --> 12:26.280
So here's a couple other things. They're just noteworthy. This is a really odd like

12:27.040 --> 12:28.080
understated

12:28.080 --> 12:33.120
They don't make a big deal about the fact that they're totally reversing the position that they made in 2012

12:33.640 --> 12:36.120
This is really odd, but one of the things they do mention is

12:37.480 --> 12:45.120
Because this change is primarily a security initiative some features like GPU 3d acceleration and premium video DRM

12:46.160 --> 12:48.160
Will not be fully implemented

12:48.160 --> 12:51.960
Hmm. Mm-hmm. I wonder what their angle

12:51.960 --> 12:58.240
What this has to pressure for there has to be so there has to be some sort of contract or or some sort of agreement

12:58.240 --> 13:02.300
I mean so one of the things that Adobe had done is they said they were gonna stop updating in

13:02.860 --> 13:07.120
2017 for security purposes, maybe this is just an easier way to do security updates

13:07.800 --> 13:12.740
Possibly because that's what they're focusing on, but I almost wonder if there was some sort of vendor

13:12.740 --> 13:18.140
Product that shipped using Linux and there was there was a contract in place

13:18.140 --> 13:21.180
Oh, maybe and Adobe's like well if we have to do this work anyways

13:21.180 --> 13:24.660
Yeah, I'll ship because I don't think Mozilla has any interest in keeping it around

13:25.100 --> 13:28.780
Here's what it's got to be someone else using it. This is what grinds my gears though

13:30.300 --> 13:32.020
If these bastards at Adobe

13:32.020 --> 13:38.220
we're gonna spend all of this time and all of this back and forth and all of this rigmarole on getting flash on Linux and

13:38.220 --> 13:45.860
supporting an old Netscape plug-in API and back porting features from their Windows and Mac version in the Linux version to make it stable and

13:45.860 --> 13:47.860
Secure again, which can't be a small task

13:49.020 --> 13:53.500
They were like, why is this what they choose to spend their time and resources on right?

13:53.500 --> 13:58.660
Why aren't they doing Photoshop or Premiere ports or after effects like spend your time and energy there you jerks

13:58.860 --> 14:03.180
Not on the flash thing let flash die. Maybe it was easy enough. It was just oh, all right

14:03.180 --> 14:06.420
We'll kick the cron back on and they'll build that for him and upload it to their web server

14:06.420 --> 14:12.140
Ah, so yeah, that is that was a story that caught my attention this week and I just you know facepalm

14:12.260 --> 14:15.860
Well, I'm glad in some respects. I'm glad we're getting security updates for flash

14:15.860 --> 14:18.540
I mean it is better to have them to have not I just hope it doesn't like

14:19.340 --> 14:23.940
Grant some legitimacy to people still using flash or not without a migration. Oh, I think it does

14:23.940 --> 14:24.300
Yeah

14:24.300 --> 14:30.900
I think it does and I think part of that is because the industry hasn't fully replaced the functionality that flash offers still feels

14:30.900 --> 14:36.500
Like one or two years away. Mm-hmm. That's just crazy. You know, it also is an

14:36.540 --> 14:40.300
Interesting little read that I think you caught this is from somebody named Carl

14:40.300 --> 14:44.340
And he's a software engineer and he likes to be considered an aspiring artist

14:44.340 --> 14:49.060
Oh, and he ran into a little extended for bug that I thought I'd just share with the class because it's particularly interesting

14:49.060 --> 14:51.900
He said after buying and setting up a shiny new four terabyte hard drive

14:51.900 --> 14:57.480
I began filling it slowly with files from various old hard drives. I have we've all done this. Yep been there

14:57.480 --> 15:01.820
I have he says and I so I went through I found like an old website I had when I worked in high school and decided

15:01.860 --> 15:06.060
Why the heck not why was so much space should I not just keep track of all of this?

15:06.060 --> 15:11.460
It's gonna be easy. So I started copying the files over and I started getting a strange no space left on device air

15:11.460 --> 15:12.820
He says hmm. This is odd

15:12.820 --> 15:17.460
I have this huge hard drive and I'm just trying to move over an 18 gigabyte website directory

15:17.460 --> 15:22.860
He says as it turns out I ran into a bug with extended for that causes it to fail if there are more than

15:23.340 --> 15:25.340
32,000 files in a directory

15:25.340 --> 15:31.580
so he goes on to say by the way really what you should probably do is do a little bit better file management and not

15:31.580 --> 15:34.060
Have so many files in the root of a directory

15:34.260 --> 15:38.940
But I guess that you know, I I toss that in there mostly as a PSA

15:38.940 --> 15:42.640
This is probably not something most of us think about but I think the real lesson here was

15:44.060 --> 15:48.980
Do better file organization plan to have your files stored in a hierarchy from the get-go

15:48.980 --> 15:53.500
Don't have flat folders with file explorers that just when they when you open it up

15:53.500 --> 15:55.540
They just totally die because they can't read all the files

15:56.860 --> 15:59.300
William do you have a sense of what this particular bug is? Oh

16:02.620 --> 16:05.220
It's kind of a built-in limit, I don't think it's really a bug

16:05.220 --> 16:07.220
He just hit a limit at a limit of ext4

16:07.380 --> 16:13.060
No, just has a limit of storing 32,000 entries in the inode will be you had experience with this

16:13.420 --> 16:15.960
It's it's not a limit. It's a bug

16:15.960 --> 16:22.960
So really? Yeah, so I got hit by precisely this issue about

16:23.320 --> 16:28.520
Four or six weeks ago at work and we figured out the problem and fixed it. So very quickly

16:29.120 --> 16:34.320
In the transition from ext3 to ext4. Yeah, I knew

16:35.800 --> 16:43.720
hashing algorithm was added to hash all of the files in a directory in order to accelerate the lookups and

16:43.720 --> 16:51.600
Theoretically that hash should be good for a massive number of files in a directory

16:52.280 --> 16:57.600
But in reality, there's a limitation in the implementation

16:57.600 --> 17:02.160
It is a bug that means you start to get hash collisions after about

17:02.720 --> 17:07.880
50,000 files or or you can start to get hash collisions after about 50,000 files

17:07.880 --> 17:15.560
And we were backing up a large directory a single directory that was full of files millions of files

17:15.560 --> 17:19.840
And the issue was is that the actual server was running ext3

17:20.040 --> 17:24.660
The backup server was running ext4 and our backups were failing

17:25.040 --> 17:31.540
Because we were running into this hash collision and and if you look into the kernel messages, it says dir index

17:32.360 --> 17:34.600
Out of range or full or something like that

17:34.600 --> 17:41.000
So our solution was to change the backup server from ext4 to X

17:41.640 --> 17:43.640
And all of our problems went away

17:46.920 --> 17:52.040
One of the favorite and file systems here on the show everybody thinks that we're on the ZFS payroll

17:52.040 --> 17:57.120
I've been accused of yeah being but if anything it'd be the XFS camp

17:57.120 --> 18:00.840
Which who even who even is the main was SGI back in the day?

18:00.840 --> 18:06.960
Wasn't it? That's it? Yeah, I don't know. I think it still is SGI engineers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow

18:08.120 --> 18:10.120
Thank you ships us by default, right?

18:11.400 --> 18:13.600
Yeah, I think so what extended for I

18:15.660 --> 18:20.740
Have the full you know, I will put the full link to the post in the in the show notes

18:21.600 --> 18:25.560
Between a rock and a crazy place. It says Wimby while we have your ear

18:25.560 --> 18:32.120
I wanted to do a follow-up from our discussion last week about installing Ubuntu touch on the Meizu Pro 5

18:32.400 --> 18:35.760
because you came across like a pretty solid piece of

18:36.760 --> 18:39.000
Instruction like it's a PDF that kind of has everything you need

18:40.320 --> 18:46.600
Yeah, a couple of guys in the Ubuntu community have basically pulled together all of the information that I you know

18:46.600 --> 18:51.980
I sort of read they've pulled it together into one PDF document with links to all of the

18:51.980 --> 18:58.660
Files and utilities that you need so you can start at step one and work your way through and at the end of it

18:58.660 --> 19:05.060
You have Ubuntu running on a Meizu Pro 5. So it's a PDF and I've got it linked in the show notes

19:05.060 --> 19:07.300
How has your experience been going now another week into it?

19:08.100 --> 19:14.060
Yep, very good still works. No issues discovered still finding my way with you know, the

19:14.700 --> 19:16.700
touch experience and

19:16.700 --> 19:21.980
Updating some of my own apps and still finding new apps along the way

19:21.980 --> 19:28.580
So I'm good and working working out what I'm gonna do to sort of help improve things. Oh cool

19:29.380 --> 19:36.700
So how does the podcast playback situation? Is that is podcast player Bluetooth audio? Is that still rough? Hmm? Yeah, so

19:37.420 --> 19:42.920
I could use it. I can use a headphone jack. I'm not an animal. I'm sure I'm sure that every Ubuntu touch device

19:42.920 --> 19:44.920
We'll have headphone jacks for a long time

19:44.920 --> 19:52.320
Yeah, so if you use a headphone jack, that's just fine and I've updated my so I say I've updated my

19:52.800 --> 19:59.720
There's a guy who was maintaining a pocket casts web app. I've published my own pocket casts web app

19:59.720 --> 20:03.280
Which is a little bit more updated and we'll keep

20:04.040 --> 20:07.680
Will not interrupt the playback of the podcasts for example and things like that

20:08.320 --> 20:14.120
So I'm using that for local playback because I can just you know resume

20:14.120 --> 20:18.320
It's got you know staked between all of my other pocket cast setups

20:19.960 --> 20:25.080
But I desperately need to actually write up a number of sort of feature requests and

20:25.800 --> 20:32.840
Enhancement ideas for pod bird because what I'd like to do is actually move to the native pod bird player which can play

20:33.680 --> 20:39.040
Podcasts just fine. It's if you if you listen to a lot of podcasts

20:39.040 --> 20:47.240
You know what the rough edges are in terms of the user interface and and and using it navigating around and that's sort of

20:47.760 --> 20:52.440
Stopping me from adopting it that and the fact that Bluetooth in the car doesn't work at all

20:54.040 --> 20:56.640
Yeah, disappointing but that'll come I think and

20:57.160 --> 21:02.680
Yeah, there's there's bugs for it and I've I've added my information to the to the bug tracker on that one

21:02.680 --> 21:05.520
So there are people that are aware of it. It seems to have a high priority

21:05.520 --> 21:09.320
It sounds like there's a couple of different options for playback of podcasts. So that's nice. I

21:10.120 --> 21:12.760
Was pretty close to trying it out on my Nexus 5

21:12.760 --> 21:16.940
I got the process started, but I didn't have time to let the Bantu flash tool finish going

21:16.940 --> 21:22.040
Oh, that's gonna happen again when I have a little more time dedicated to it. It would have been really cool

21:22.120 --> 21:25.840
That's I was trying to get the multi boot image to work, but no luck

21:26.480 --> 21:30.520
That's the way to do it too. So that way if you really had to you could still go back to Android, right?

21:30.520 --> 21:35.560
I see that's like to all booting with Windows though. You know, it is risky. Yeah, it is. Yeah

21:36.120 --> 21:41.400
It's I think you've used this analogy before it's like a recovering alcoholic, you know, if you leave

21:42.120 --> 21:46.920
You leave a a bottle of beer out on the on the desk somewhere and you can see it

21:46.920 --> 21:49.560
You'll be tempted to drink it right the first time things get really hard

21:52.040 --> 21:57.140
I'm just rebooting for Netflix. That's fine. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it starts with the Netflix

21:57.140 --> 21:59.020
No, it does

21:59.020 --> 22:01.700
So yeah remove all of those temptations

22:01.700 --> 22:09.340
I've I've actually reset my my Android phone, which is still doing pocket casts, but it's just all it's got is pocket casts

22:09.340 --> 22:14.180
I haven't set up any of the eyes on it. So that's a good way. I kind of mean and I've also you know

22:14.420 --> 22:16.420
moved all of the

22:17.140 --> 22:24.580
Two factor authentication stuff onto the Ubuntu phone, you know, because that's kind of when you do that you there's no going back

22:24.580 --> 22:27.300
It's like right. This is my device. Now. This is the one I'm using

22:29.060 --> 22:35.620
Interesting I'm following wimpy I'm following this because you know, I'm looking at I'm looking at the Nexus 6 something and one of these days

22:36.020 --> 22:38.020
Android one of these right?

22:38.020 --> 22:42.260
Speaking of mobile. Let's stop for a second and mention our first sponsor this week

22:42.260 --> 22:44.500
And that would be the folks over at ting

22:44.500 --> 22:48.660
What a fitting moment to talk about ting because that's exactly where I'll be taking my Ubuntu touch device

22:48.900 --> 22:52.340
I do know folks that have run Ubuntu touch devices on ting for like

22:52.340 --> 22:53.540
I

22:53.540 --> 22:55.540
Think it was a two-week period

22:56.100 --> 23:01.060
To run a boot to touch but then I actually ended up on the Nexus 5 finding sailfish OS to work a little better for me

23:02.180 --> 23:05.780
Ting does not mind any of the ting is really great. It's super simple wireless

23:05.780 --> 23:11.220
they they have CDMA and GSM service, which is wonderful because you can pick whichever works better in your area and

23:11.500 --> 23:14.300
You can get a great discount if you go to the linux.ting.com

23:15.060 --> 23:20.980
You support the show you get a discount off your first device or if you have a compatible device that works on their GSM or CDMA

23:20.980 --> 23:26.100
Networks then you'll get $25 in service credit ting just charges for what you use

23:26.260 --> 23:30.900
$6 for the line and then your usage on top of that. They got real human beings that actually help

23:31.540 --> 23:36.020
They're geeks themselves and they actually help which is sort of an amazing thing to be able to say about a company

23:37.380 --> 23:43.700
They have a whole range of devices from exceptionally well-priced phones up to the really crazy high-end expensive ones

23:43.700 --> 23:48.340
The ones the ones that we all drool over they've got great tools to manage your account

23:48.340 --> 23:50.420
one of the things I really like about ting is

23:51.300 --> 23:55.800
They don't really have any agenda other than just offering you a simple wireless service

23:55.860 --> 24:00.460
So they the way they've set it up here is you can use ting as only a phone provider

24:00.460 --> 24:01.700
You could use ting as only data

24:01.700 --> 24:06.300
You could never text if you use something like telegram and never pay for text message or just only text

24:06.300 --> 24:07.620
Maybe you love texting well

24:07.620 --> 24:11.940
And I do know a couple of people who I've mentioned before that have the SIM cards in

24:12.340 --> 24:15.020
Little devices that are connected to their alarm systems

24:15.020 --> 24:20.740
Oh, yeah, and they text them when there's movement or things like that and it can just be the simplest thing and that's all they

24:20.740 --> 24:24.940
Use it for and they get what five text messages a month. That is cheap. Yeah, it's so cool

24:25.060 --> 24:27.380
Go to linux.ting.com to check them out

24:27.380 --> 24:34.180
Also, you don't even have to be a ting customer taking advantage of some of the cool stuff on their blog. They've been doing unboxing giveaways

24:35.260 --> 24:37.820
Usually it's like a matter of leave a comment on Facebook

24:38.100 --> 24:44.020
Subscribe to the YouTube channel leave a comment and you're entered to join to get a potentially free phone, which is really cool

24:44.020 --> 24:49.060
But they've also been covering all the different types of cord cutter problems that you might run into

24:49.060 --> 24:54.460
So if you're a cord cutter and you want to get sports or you want to get news or you want to get the CW shows

24:54.500 --> 24:58.980
They've been doing a series of blog posts on that and that's not really specific to being a ting customer

24:58.980 --> 25:02.100
they're just geeks and this is the kind of stuff they're into and you might

25:02.780 --> 25:06.020
You might just want to go there to check them out and just learn more about like in

25:06.500 --> 25:08.540
In a piece down here where they talk about football

25:08.540 --> 25:15.340
And they do a they do a little mini review of the sling TV service which I use to watch a food network and history

25:15.340 --> 25:19.940
Channel and live news at home where we don't have any TV service

25:19.980 --> 25:21.820
It's pretty cool, and they do a review in there

25:21.820 --> 25:24.820
And it's really applicable to anybody that might want something like that

25:24.820 --> 25:26.580
So it's kind of a nice to go over there

25:26.580 --> 25:31.420
You can you can learn more and you can before you hit their blog you can support the show by going to linux.ting.com

25:32.460 --> 25:36.820
And then jump around and learn more about ting try out their savings calculator read their blog

25:36.820 --> 25:43.940
See how cool those people are linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

25:43.940 --> 25:46.420
That's linux.ting.com to support the show

25:47.020 --> 25:51.380
Well, mr. West I can't believe that Adobe story like that's still right

25:51.380 --> 25:54.880
That's still like rattling around the back. We were beyond this as a community

25:54.900 --> 26:01.140
And you know what else I thought we were beyond is this trying to trying to get a government approved backdoor into encryption

26:01.460 --> 26:05.620
And I think this is gonna be a major problem if this goes forward for open source software

26:05.620 --> 26:10.700
This is something that we briefly touched on in the roundup in tech snap last week the

26:11.820 --> 26:13.820
FBI director James commie is

26:15.500 --> 26:17.500
Positioning for a

26:18.140 --> 26:20.140
reopening quote-unquote of the

26:20.420 --> 26:27.500
Quote encryption debate because right now it's dipped below public consciousness. He says and he thinks in next year

26:27.500 --> 26:34.500
He's gonna wait to 2017 because next year. We can have a quote adult conversation in this country about it

26:34.500 --> 26:41.500
You want to install backdoor encryption and that would it would be a it would be a regulatory thing

26:41.500 --> 26:48.500
So that would mean if you're shipping software that uses a type of encryption in the US in order for it to be legal here

26:48.500 --> 26:53.500
You would have to follow these rules potentially and that seems like you could have huge consequences

26:53.500 --> 26:56.500
Question what?

26:56.500 --> 27:02.500
And this has got a bit of conspiracy bacon here, but why is commie?

27:03.500 --> 27:07.500
Wanting to wait. Why not do this debate right now? Is there?

27:08.500 --> 27:11.500
Something else that's more important than that

27:11.500 --> 27:15.500
Well, I think he I think he gives away his motivation when he says next year

27:15.500 --> 27:21.500
We can have an adult conversation in other words once we're past the election year because everything in an election year gets crazy

27:21.500 --> 27:27.500
Let's have a let's have a conversation right now about it

27:28.500 --> 27:31.500
You know, well, I think that's what I'd be saying

27:31.500 --> 27:38.500
I think I think the technology community is simply of the opinion. This is just a bad idea for all kinds of reasons

27:38.500 --> 27:41.500
We've been at there's no such thing as just a government backdoor

27:41.500 --> 27:44.500
There's back doors that can be taken advantage of but just for so frustrating because it feels like

27:45.500 --> 27:48.500
It's like they're not listening on the other side, you know, you're like, well, okay

27:48.500 --> 27:54.500
We can have this conversation to have you have you answered our other big point that we kind of have been asking you about

27:54.500 --> 27:56.500
Well, I guess what I'm worried about is

27:56.500 --> 28:03.500
What we're not talking about what we're not talking about is the impact this will have on the legality of open-source software

28:03.500 --> 28:10.500
The impact this will have on the adoption of open-source software in companies that have government contracts or government agencies themselves and divisions

28:10.500 --> 28:23.500
if all of a sudden things like Tor and I don't know what a name a Lib Lib vault or Libre vault or you'll sink thing or all of these things all of a sudden have to have back doors built into them

28:23.500 --> 28:30.500
Well, there's gonna be a huge portion of these software developers gonna say no, I won't do that right plus now now

28:32.500 --> 28:38.500
The technical the technical aspect of how that gets implemented. Is that gonna be GPL code? Like how does that exactly work?

28:38.500 --> 28:43.500
Yeah, it can't be like some sort of proprietary thing that gets bolted onto these GPL projects. So

28:44.500 --> 28:52.500
How the hell does open-source exist if this ever becomes a reality and here's why I worry about it is because they do not let up

28:52.500 --> 28:58.500
Every single terrorist attack. Oh, yeah, it's encryption going dark. They're using that evil telegram

28:58.500 --> 29:02.500
They're creating their own encrypted applications for communications cybercalifate blah blah blah

29:02.500 --> 29:10.500
and then there's a and then anytime there's an attack the encryption is once again the conversations brought up and it does kind of worry me and

29:10.500 --> 29:12.500
the other thing is is that

29:12.500 --> 29:18.500
It's not just commie. In fact, I think one of the reasons why James commie is having so much luck with pushing this conversation

29:18.500 --> 29:25.500
Amongst legislators and whatnot in the US is our counterparts over the European Union have expressed similar initiatives last month

29:25.500 --> 29:32.500
The French and German interior ministers called on the EU to implement measures forcing encrypted app manufacturers to develop back doors

29:32.500 --> 29:34.500
for use by law enforcement officials

29:35.500 --> 29:41.500
Would effectively make end-to-end encryption where only the center and the recipient have access to transmitted data illegal in Europe

29:41.500 --> 29:43.500
Yeah, isn't that that seems wild?

29:44.500 --> 29:51.500
It's happening on both ends of the pond right now. They come in for my full disk encryption too. Yeah. Yes. Absolutely. That's terrifying

29:51.500 --> 29:57.500
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I don't it does feel like open source isn't hardly considered because it's like yeah

29:57.500 --> 30:02.500
Well the government can strong arm that you know come you can get your Microsoft's and your Apple's and your Google's to do this

30:02.500 --> 30:05.500
But how you gonna get the Libra vault developer who lives in Russia to do it? Yeah, exactly

30:06.500 --> 30:09.500
And you can't I mean are you just gonna have more laws that we just?

30:09.500 --> 30:13.500
Pretend and look the other way when you acknowledge that you're not really gonna be able to stop your citizens from using it and then you

30:13.500 --> 30:16.500
Just turn them into criminals is open source software that doesn't have these

30:16.500 --> 30:22.500
Mandated backdoors become illegal. Do you is it does it become a crime to use types of software like that for communication?

30:23.500 --> 30:27.500
I don't know. Where does this end? And that's why it's kind of got me worried because in particular

30:27.500 --> 30:33.500
We are having we are having the conversation and people like Bruce and I and other loud voices in this debate are are

30:33.500 --> 30:35.500
Coming out strongly against this concept

30:35.500 --> 30:41.500
But the but there's nobody advocating it from the open source perspective of how this could and if you at this point

30:41.500 --> 30:46.500
Damaged open source in a certain like to this degree would probably have a negative impact on the economy. Mm-hmm

30:47.500 --> 30:51.500
Seems pretty maybe we maybe we can be you know those

30:52.500 --> 30:58.500
Advocates in that or at least the starting forces, you know, I think you give us too much credit

31:00.500 --> 31:04.500
Damn it we can try let's let's go back to something that's more in our realm because yeah

31:04.500 --> 31:09.500
There's only so much shouting of the wind we can do on that particular issue, but the issue has been raised

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
I thought this is pretty cool

31:11.500 --> 31:14.500
KTE software is coming. Oh, that's right

31:14.500 --> 31:19.500
It's gonna be a store soon to offer downloads in snaps flat packs and app image formats. Wow

31:19.500 --> 31:20.500
Yeah

31:20.500 --> 31:27.500
Dub the Katie each store the new software store is exactly that a store where application developers can publish their own open source projects and

31:27.500 --> 31:30.500
Share them with the world also known as the Katie software store

31:30.500 --> 31:35.500
The migration from the open desktop to our services to the new Katie software store has happened in the background

31:35.500 --> 31:41.500
It's been going on for a while now and a Katie developer blogged about the new software store on his personal blog revealing the fact that

31:41.500 --> 31:48.500
Users might be able to soon download their favorite open source applications in the new snap and flat pack and app image binary formats

31:48.500 --> 31:53.500
Which was which is pretty damn cool and it's it's nice because we've seen the gnome software center

31:53.500 --> 31:56.500
Sort of get pretty wide adoption on the GTK side of things

31:58.500 --> 31:59.500
There's

31:59.500 --> 32:07.500
Not a great answer for the KTE plasma desktop side of things. There's some different solutions like the muon software center and things like that

32:07.500 --> 32:13.500
But one like KTE quote-unquote. Yes official store is great and I I remember

32:14.500 --> 32:18.500
Talking to Aaron years ago about some of the back-end ideas I had for this which were pretty bright

32:18.500 --> 32:22.500
So I think it could be it's been stuff's been in the works and hopefully this is a good

32:22.500 --> 32:28.500
Good push through and people can use it anybody the mumble room have any thoughts about the new KTE software store

32:28.500 --> 32:34.500
And again when they say store, I bet you almost everything there's yeah gonna be free. It's a weird model for open-source

32:34.500 --> 32:39.500
Why say store? Is that just because of what they think people will understand that analogy better?

32:40.500 --> 32:45.500
Well repos a scary word. Maybe they couldn't think of a better word like boutique. Oh, yeah

32:45.500 --> 32:48.500
There's only so many good words that's boutique was taken

32:50.500 --> 32:56.500
The software center has taken to I still think boutique would or something would be weird compared to store because you're used to like

32:56.500 --> 33:01.500
The Google Play Store the App Store those kinds of things, right? That's where I think it comes from

33:01.500 --> 33:04.500
Yeah, something something big marketing be different

33:06.500 --> 33:08.500
Katie big list

33:09.500 --> 33:11.500
Yeah, go ahead

33:12.500 --> 33:16.500
If I might offer I think the software store given that people are looking for app stores, etc

33:16.500 --> 33:21.140
And there is such a thing on the gnome side. I'm not a KTE user myself, but I

33:22.020 --> 33:25.500
Widely would accept a software store even if it's not monetizable

33:25.500 --> 33:31.500
And if it is that's great more app developers well, I mean and it leaves room for that later and making some money

33:31.500 --> 33:35.040
Yeah, I mean it leaves a room for later on for them to come along and say let's sell this

33:36.100 --> 33:38.300
And as long as they like do a good job on the back end

33:40.020 --> 33:42.020
Yeah

33:43.780 --> 33:50.620
Chris here's another thought how long won't be until the other desktop environments

33:50.620 --> 33:56.500
Get their own stores or boutiques or whatever you want to call it like

33:57.060 --> 34:01.140
For example the X F C E shop. No, no

34:03.260 --> 34:05.260
Store no

34:05.860 --> 34:07.860
There will be and there will there will be

34:08.340 --> 34:13.380
It's not gonna be called the Pantheon store, but you're you're barking up the right tree there. Yeah. Yeah elementary already doing that

34:13.380 --> 34:17.580
They've already got their App Center. I think they call it. Mm-hmm. All right. Yeah

34:17.580 --> 34:19.580
and

34:19.900 --> 34:24.780
So that's that is I think good for Katie because kind of by my estimation there

34:24.780 --> 34:28.060
They were sort of I was kind of looking like where's their official solution here

34:28.060 --> 34:31.320
So there we go the KTE software store and downloads and snap to

34:32.180 --> 34:35.140
You know, it's been weeks. I can really haven't heard really any big

34:35.780 --> 34:36.900
snaps

34:36.900 --> 34:38.540
No big flat packs

34:38.540 --> 34:43.780
Like there's no been there's not there hasn't been an ounce would have some big project or or anything like it was build up to

34:43.780 --> 34:50.020
But then we haven't really heard anything for a bit. Maybe we're an incubation period people kind of trying them out making more of them

34:50.020 --> 34:55.780
Maybe even using them. Mm-hmm. Maybe it'll be interesting to see what kind of distribution like for those three, you know

34:55.900 --> 34:59.060
Well, they have mostly at one kind mostly snaps. I

34:59.900 --> 35:05.820
Don't know. Hmm. Yeah, which ones will be the most popular all those. Yeah, maybe we get stats on that. All right

35:05.820 --> 35:09.800
Well, let's let's move along moving on because I caught something caught my eye

35:09.800 --> 35:14.420
Over at elementary.io speaking of this of the elementary OS desktop

35:15.040 --> 35:22.360
There's a countdown going two days 19 hours 22 minutes and seven seconds as we record this year show I count down

35:24.160 --> 35:30.320
Yes, right now just like last time it's gonna be for a new release. Hmm. Why would you give them?

35:30.320 --> 35:32.320
I don't know miss Wheeler. I don't know

35:33.000 --> 35:37.400
Hmm. I don't know. She's yeah, probably likely. I don't know today. We'll find out two days

35:37.400 --> 35:44.720
I remember I I broke the news in the chat room the last time they did it so sweet Lou breaking the news for us

35:44.720 --> 35:47.440
Maybe they're just merging with Apple and Apple have some big news for us

35:48.920 --> 35:54.180
That's a good one that's a good conspiracy that they're merging with Apple. Yeah, I like that

35:55.240 --> 35:58.280
I'm gonna I'm gonna guess it's probably not that yeah

35:58.280 --> 36:03.320
Well, I'm gonna say that if that were the case, they probably wouldn't be the ones making the announcement

36:03.320 --> 36:07.560
Yeah, of course. They're smart. They're smart because if you work, yeah

36:07.560 --> 36:12.680
It wouldn't suspect a thing if it was gonna be merging with Apple would be announced tomorrow. Yeah, right

36:12.680 --> 36:15.040
That's just wrong Apple's keeping them in the dark

36:16.800 --> 36:23.080
Yeah, maybe so we'll find out stay tuned and find out I'm sure we'll do a little update next week

36:23.080 --> 36:28.040
But I do kind of like the hype. I gotta admit it's fun. It makes it feel a little more like

36:28.520 --> 36:31.760
You know, it's not just posted on the mailing list and maybe that's more your style

36:31.760 --> 36:35.860
But it's like there's a whole involvement to it. It feels like a production. So, let's see as any

36:36.240 --> 36:38.240
452 says that they're merging with twit

36:38.720 --> 36:40.720
elementary OS and twit

36:41.160 --> 36:44.680
That's I got a theory for you. How about this one?

36:46.920 --> 36:50.240
System 76 is buying them. Oh, yeah, right

36:52.240 --> 36:56.840
Distribution for system 76 hardware wouldn't that be good wouldn't that be something because you know

36:56.840 --> 37:03.020
They've got system 76 got a really great range of machines right now and they have one of the developers

37:03.320 --> 37:07.840
Works there at system 76 both share attention to detail and wanting to craft

37:07.840 --> 37:12.800
Yes, exactly and you know because somebody who works with the project works there at system 76

37:12.800 --> 37:17.320
They have a kind of a direct line for this kind of stuff and some of their rigs would look particularly good

37:18.200 --> 37:22.440
Running elementary OS like like they have the disable complete all-in-one

37:23.020 --> 37:25.420
Right, that's like obvious. That would be I mean that would

37:25.420 --> 37:31.860
Legitimately would make and it also elementary OS has really kind of gone out of their way to make sure everybody

37:31.860 --> 37:33.460
They're they're clear like they're there

37:33.460 --> 37:38.500
They don't feel that their competition is Ubuntu or Ubuntu Mate because they want to go there

37:38.500 --> 37:43.200
They say they mainly going after users that are already running proprietary OSes

37:43.200 --> 37:45.200
They don't right that's who they're going after

37:45.420 --> 37:47.500
You could argue that still competing with other distros

37:47.500 --> 37:53.140
But I think it's it's an interesting approach and if you look at their distribution in that context that their their primary market is people

37:53.140 --> 37:55.140
Who aren't running Linux yet?

37:55.140 --> 37:59.900
I think they think their attention to details. It's pretty interesting. So the system 76 picking them up

38:00.900 --> 38:04.700
Well now I just want that to happen Chris. I know I know it would be pretty big

38:04.700 --> 38:09.140
I wouldn't want like the general distribution to go away because I've been running on Dylan's laptop and that's a Dell

38:09.780 --> 38:12.380
Like I think it's almost like that same exact model you've got right there

38:12.380 --> 38:16.020
Oh nice, and it's been flawless for over for well over a year now

38:16.300 --> 38:20.660
So I wouldn't want them to go away as a general distribution. No, I wouldn't either but you do have to wonder

38:20.660 --> 38:24.580
I'm sure if I'm sure if something like that were to happen

38:25.260 --> 38:31.060
There would be some little birdies going around tweeting about it. Yeah, probably all right before we go any further into the show

38:31.060 --> 38:34.820
I'm excited to get to the review that Wes is reviewing wait

38:34.820 --> 38:40.900
What the review that Wes is reviewing no the distro the Wes is reviewing speaking of really well put together

38:41.220 --> 38:44.060
distributions that pay a lot of attention to the fine details

38:44.060 --> 38:51.020
I'm really curious, but before we get there. I'm gonna mention digital ocean digital ocean comm and use our promo code

38:51.020 --> 38:57.180
Do unplugged all one-word lowercase, and you'll get a $10 credit at digital ocean. This is a great cloud hosting provider

38:57.980 --> 39:01.180
Why is it great? Well when you're using the cloud you're using other people's computers

39:01.180 --> 39:04.300
And so you want to make sure they're good you want to make sure they got great infrastructure

39:04.620 --> 39:11.020
Running on Linux using the KVM virtualizer SSDs for all the disk I owe 40 gigabit e-connections right into the hypervisors

39:11.020 --> 39:17.660
Some of the best data centers in the world in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, Germany, even India

39:17.660 --> 39:22.220
It's I know I know they have the best interface in the business

39:22.220 --> 39:28.460
Never seen anybody come close to this desktop or a web app HTML5 console you get access to your rig from

39:28.700 --> 39:31.660
Post all the way to login they have incredible

39:32.380 --> 39:37.100
Nicely formatted tutorials and guides to help you set things up. They have entire application stacks

39:37.100 --> 39:42.860
You can deploy boom ready to go. Everything's good to go or you can deploy a base rig. I love both of those options

39:42.860 --> 39:44.540
They've got a bunch of good distributions

39:44.540 --> 39:50.860
You can choose from and you combine that with the great UI the simple ability to spin up multiple machines at once

39:51.020 --> 39:53.020
The crazy straightforward pricing get this

39:53.420 --> 39:57.580
$5 a month is the base rig so if you use our promo code deal unplugged you get the $10 credit

39:57.580 --> 40:00.060
But you can also do digital ocean at an hourly rate

40:01.420 --> 40:05.420
Now girl, I am telling you do unplugged is going to get you the extra money

40:05.420 --> 40:11.500
Plugged is going to get you the extra mile if you're using the hourly rate because you can get a fantastic rig at like

40:11.500 --> 40:14.380
Three cents an hour. I think that's the most popular one. I mean, it's just nuts

40:14.540 --> 40:20.380
And now they have block storage up to 16 terabytes of storage. You can allocate to your rig. That stuff is awesome all SSD based

40:21.740 --> 40:23.900
That's pretty nice. That is pretty nice

40:24.220 --> 40:29.420
Also, check out the digital ocean community page where they've got all of their tutorials posted right there

40:29.500 --> 40:33.340
Including some good ones working with zfs working with own cloud

40:33.340 --> 40:38.140
A lot of stuff is now getting updated for ubuntu 1604 and centos 7 and all that stuff

40:38.460 --> 40:45.980
And then also they they're highlighting their projects that use their super nice straightforward api just use our promo code do unplugged and a big

40:45.980 --> 40:51.500
Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the linux unplugged program. And yeah, they got free bsd too

40:51.980 --> 40:56.940
Yeah, they got free bsd. In fact mentioning free bsd just really quick before we move on free bsd

40:56.940 --> 41:01.980
Just announced a centos 7 binary compatibility. They've been working on it for a while

41:01.980 --> 41:03.980
You know, but get that linux layer in there. Yep

41:04.540 --> 41:06.540
Yeah, well, I mean like windows does

41:07.900 --> 41:08.700
Yeah

41:08.700 --> 41:16.620
As of yesterday a linux based c7 landed in ports for installing the centos base packages as it will allow running newer linux binaries built for

41:16.700 --> 41:17.500
modern

41:17.500 --> 41:21.500
Centos right at enterprise 7 era systems on free bsd

41:23.020 --> 41:29.020
Which is very handy it turns out, uh, previously centos 6 was the default and by a little bit dated now

41:29.020 --> 41:34.300
It is isn't it? So there you go. So now you get the centos 7 which doesn't feel like a spring chicken chicken either

41:34.380 --> 41:36.620
But uh a nice step up. Yeah, absolutely

41:36.700 --> 41:41.420
I was kind of wondering to see this after windows made their announcement when if free bsd was going to have any more incentive to

41:41.660 --> 41:43.580
Keep this current wonder

41:43.580 --> 41:47.180
I wonder what kind of game not games, but I do wonder if games are going to be more

41:47.660 --> 41:51.820
I was wondering just what kind of class of applications this opens up for bsd that wasn't available before

41:52.140 --> 41:56.460
And i've seen some people hacking to get steam working on free bsd and there's been scripts that do it

41:56.460 --> 42:02.620
I guess it wasn't this yeah, this could make it easier. Yeah, maybe I wonder if they'll ever target not sent to us as well

42:03.100 --> 42:07.900
I've asked about that and I basically got a what's the point? Yeah, and why would we do that?

42:08.940 --> 42:13.740
Like because I think and I don't mean to disparage but I think to the bsd people

42:14.700 --> 42:19.180
Linux is already really silly. And so if you're gonna support any kind of compatibility

42:19.180 --> 42:22.060
Why wouldn't you do it with the most adult linux? I think it's how they look at it

42:22.060 --> 42:26.700
Well, and if and if they're targeting a lot of server workloads centos may be the thing that you know

42:26.780 --> 42:29.500
Is most like what their boxes will end up being used for yeah

42:30.220 --> 42:36.220
I don't I I would be way more enthusiastic about being able to install like a debian user land set of tools and stuff

42:36.540 --> 42:42.060
And then i'd be like, oh right. Okay. Let's go look at this true os with the rolling free bsd and a debian user land

42:42.060 --> 42:43.980
I can install

42:43.980 --> 42:50.140
I mean, I I would do that. What's that that mac os 10 don't uh, there's a there is a there is a like a

42:50.140 --> 42:54.780
There's like a user land set of tools. You can install that has like apt-like functionality. I'm blanking. I don't even know

42:56.300 --> 43:01.500
Yeah, yeah homebrew that's what it is. Yeah homebrew. Yeah homebrew that they can kind of like that. Yeah, that'd be nice

43:01.980 --> 43:06.540
Give me all that kind of stuff. But yeah, I I you know, I I think that's probably going to hook some people up

43:06.620 --> 43:08.620
So mr. Wes

43:08.860 --> 43:12.720
You are trying out the distribution that jack wallen at linux.com

43:13.340 --> 43:17.740
Says bring serious relevance back to kde. Oh strong words. Yeah

43:17.740 --> 43:24.540
Yeah, um, so it's called chaos kaos. We have talked about it before they've just recently gotten a new update

43:25.180 --> 43:30.060
And it is a very refined approach to the plasma 5 desktop

43:31.100 --> 43:35.420
Sort of a gray color scheme very uniformed. What are your thoughts on it so far?

43:36.060 --> 43:39.660
You know i've um, I haven't run a kde distro for a while

43:39.740 --> 43:42.460
So that was a little bit of one of the reasons I was thinking it'd be a fun one to throw at you

43:42.460 --> 43:48.300
Yeah, um, I like it katie takes a little bit to get used to I honestly there's a lot of little things that i'm

43:48.300 --> 43:52.300
Kind of surprised by and i'm like, oh right. I really like this and so there's a lot of little things

43:52.460 --> 43:56.940
I'm enjoying having the like the taskbar kind of thing right on the bottom. I'm enjoying

43:57.740 --> 43:59.740
just the responsiveness and

43:59.900 --> 44:04.140
There's a lot of effects, but there's not there's not too many effects and it's kind of just it's just refreshing

44:04.220 --> 44:04.780
It feels light

44:04.780 --> 44:08.460
It feels pretty responsive and i've been really impressed when I was just going into tinker with it

44:08.460 --> 44:12.700
and they have their own limited repository and they're using pacman as the

44:13.260 --> 44:16.460
As the tool so it felt right at home and they've got like nice colors

44:16.540 --> 44:19.820
It feels it feels just like it's been well cared for well touched

44:20.140 --> 44:21.900
I you know, I haven't I haven't used it long term

44:21.900 --> 44:23.020
So I don't know

44:23.020 --> 44:28.060
How well their software availability will meet my needs especially since i'm used to the larger arch repos

44:28.140 --> 44:33.260
And one of the things they advertise is a limited repo. They're very focused on kd isn't arch base though

44:33.260 --> 44:35.500
So yes, and I believe it'd be pretty easy to get

44:35.500 --> 44:39.740
Um other other arch packages installed if I wanted to i've not tried that yet

44:40.060 --> 44:44.460
Yeah, I think I think when I messed around with it you could but I think that's one of their things

44:44.540 --> 44:47.260
Is they really want you to just use their limited selection?

44:47.820 --> 44:48.780
um

44:48.780 --> 44:50.780
It does feel like a very modern

44:50.860 --> 44:53.180
Like if you're someone who who really likes kde

44:53.660 --> 44:58.380
And want something that like you can just kind of set up go with it'll be a nice configured default

44:58.380 --> 45:00.380
You can customize it if you want from there

45:00.540 --> 45:03.020
But you have like new packages you have like the core stuff

45:03.020 --> 45:07.580
You're kind of already using the you know k-office or whatever then I think you'll be really happy with it

45:08.140 --> 45:15.420
So they have uh, they have a qt designer included karita cupzilla c file dolphin k3b kate sue studio image writer

45:16.060 --> 45:20.940
Jack says the only real glaring hole in chaos's list of software would be an email client for that

45:21.020 --> 45:25.500
You have to go to the package manager. Now. Did you did you get a chance to try out their gooey package manager?

45:25.660 --> 45:29.260
Did you get a chance to look at this? Yeah, aren't they they're using uh octopi? Yes. Yeah

45:29.260 --> 45:32.940
Uh, yes, I installed the installed firefox from there and a couple other things

45:33.340 --> 45:34.540
And it wasn't uh wasn't too bad

45:34.540 --> 45:39.100
I went back to the shell which I was also very pleased with and they've looks like they've applied some formatted options

45:39.100 --> 45:44.220
Like they've got the fun little pacman style on pacman set and they've got some really nice spacing setup

45:44.220 --> 45:47.740
So it like very clearly shows you some like these are your packages. Here's the new ones

45:47.740 --> 45:51.100
Here's how much you're downloading in kind of a non-standard way, which I appreciate it

45:51.340 --> 45:53.660
So they have they break it out into three repositories

45:53.660 --> 45:58.220
So they've got core that contains the basic software necessary for the system to boot communicate with the bios

45:58.220 --> 46:05.260
And set the basic shell options then main which contains the necessary libraries drivers and firmware to make the desktop function

46:05.500 --> 46:08.780
And then they got apps and that contains all the user facing apps

46:09.100 --> 46:14.480
Spread out into those three different categories the three repositories work seamlessly together to keep chaos or kaos

46:15.020 --> 46:21.260
Up to date and running smoothly jack concludes by saying if you've been looking for a distribution to sway you back to the kde desktop

46:21.420 --> 46:26.220
And by kde desktop, he means plasma desktop look no further than chaos. It's a beautiful

46:26.220 --> 46:30.940
It is beautiful runs with us which runs with a snap of a much lighter desktop

46:31.180 --> 46:33.980
And feels as reliable as any other option available for linux

46:34.140 --> 46:36.300
I haven't been impressed with kde for very very long

46:36.300 --> 46:38.860
I have not been impressed with kd in a very long time

46:38.860 --> 46:43.340
But I am very impressed with this one and I'm certain users would find themselves equally happy to return to a desktop

46:43.660 --> 46:46.140
That has long needed a champion like chaos

46:46.940 --> 46:49.660
What are your thoughts on the speed? He talks about the speed a lot in this review

46:50.300 --> 46:52.060
Yeah, I mean I was pretty

46:52.060 --> 46:55.740
It didn't feel sluggish. I mean I haven't used a bunch of other kde distros recently

46:55.740 --> 46:59.020
So I don't really know I can't compare them that well from that perspective

46:59.100 --> 47:01.580
But as someone who uses who's you know

47:01.900 --> 47:05.180
Uses i3 are awesome from time to time who otherwise uses, you know

47:05.260 --> 47:10.540
Gnome but not that many plugins kind of a lighter gnome. It it really felt responsive. It felt light

47:11.180 --> 47:15.980
The graphics looked nice, which they usually do thanks to kaywin. Um, so I was very pleased

47:15.980 --> 47:18.060
It was like a very usable experience. Hmm

47:18.540 --> 47:18.860
well

47:18.860 --> 47:24.860
That is that is probably if you've been looking for a plasma desktop to jump into this is probably one to play around with if nothing

47:24.860 --> 47:29.420
Else because you can get a sense of their design look and their theme they're going for and you could replicate some of that

47:29.420 --> 47:32.300
If you want it in your own, yeah, and I I don't hate the way it looks

47:32.380 --> 47:36.380
I don't think it's necessarily the style that I would go go for it's a little it's a little

47:37.100 --> 47:39.260
Blue and boxy and I mean the gray is nice

47:39.660 --> 47:43.340
Um, I don't think it feels quite as streamlined as what i'm used to in gnome

47:43.420 --> 47:45.660
But I mean katie is so flexible that i'm sure you can

47:45.980 --> 47:49.260
You know if you want to change it to make it something that you like that wouldn't be a huge problem

47:49.260 --> 47:54.540
Um, i'm waiting for the plasma matte desktop version

47:55.500 --> 47:59.100
Wimpy will be shipping in ubuntu 17, uh, oh

48:01.420 --> 48:05.260
I will say it does come with some nice stuff like mpvs here. Yeah included by default

48:05.980 --> 48:11.820
There's the it's a pretty good showcase of a lot of different qt software as well. That's good. Yeah, i'm i'm

48:12.760 --> 48:17.980
Seriously tempted to replace vlc with mpv at some point. Yeah

48:17.980 --> 48:23.900
Um, the new versions are very nice and um, yeah, i'm waiting to see a vlc

48:24.620 --> 48:31.100
Three drops with high dpi support. I like gnome mpv a lot too, which is a nice front end mpv. Yeah, exactly

48:31.260 --> 48:36.300
That's exactly in fact that and that new version. Um for gtk 320 is really good

48:37.100 --> 48:37.820
Yeah, yeah

48:37.820 --> 48:42.380
It's it's it's my go-to player now for video clips on the stream whenever i'm whenever i'm playing videos

48:42.380 --> 48:47.980
On the show that aren't that aren't like on a web page i'm using gnome mpv because it i've been also having a decoding

48:48.060 --> 48:51.260
Issues with vlc and where it starts dropping frames and things like that

48:51.260 --> 48:54.620
It just gets to be all all kinds of a mess not something you can afford as a broadcaster

48:54.860 --> 48:59.740
I like sweetloo's idea of looking at chaos desktop and then taking some of those

49:00.060 --> 49:03.500
Ideas and transitioning them into an lxqt sort of lightweight desktop

49:03.660 --> 49:09.340
I don't think lxqt has all of the theming and and and well, I guess unless you can use kwin with lxqt. I'm not sure

49:09.340 --> 49:14.140
Uh, but I I look at this and I think they're doing some things that are right here

49:14.220 --> 49:19.420
And it's that same sort of a little extra attention to detail and the plasma desktop doesn't often get it

49:19.420 --> 49:24.860
So that's what also kind of makes it special. Yeah, exactly and it feels like they're you know, it's it's nice to have the focus

49:24.940 --> 49:26.220
It's not just

49:26.220 --> 49:30.540
A distribution that has oh, you can also get our kde spin. It's like this is what we're doing

49:31.020 --> 49:34.940
It feels a little more polished. It feels a little bit more like yeah, we thought about it from beginning to end

49:34.940 --> 49:39.660
We've picked our entire software stack. We've built our own repos just to do this project

49:41.260 --> 49:47.260
Wimpy are you feeling the uh, the impending release date of the 1610 version of the ubuntu bata desktop?

49:47.260 --> 49:50.060
Does it start to build up like is it? Yeah

49:50.780 --> 49:52.780
Yeah, so, um

49:53.100 --> 49:56.860
In feature freeze now. Yeah, and uh, yeah, we got lots of stuff to fix

49:58.060 --> 50:01.660
Now I know there was uh, there was one feature that ended up getting scrapped for 1610, right?

50:01.660 --> 50:06.780
Yeah, we uh, I yanked the uh, the marte hub hud

50:07.100 --> 50:09.100
Um, we introduced that in alpha 2

50:09.660 --> 50:15.260
And uh, we had some great testing feedback, but the feedback was clear. It was not ready

50:15.820 --> 50:23.520
And uh, uh, we don't have time to fix it up. So, uh, we've we've yanked that and we'll revisit it in 1704

50:24.540 --> 50:27.900
Well, that's kind of a downer you should share with us something that's going well

50:27.900 --> 50:33.740
I mean I I respect the decision. You gotta you gotta do what you gotta do. Uh, but now you should pick now pick me back up

50:33.740 --> 50:35.740
So get me excited about something. Yeah

50:35.820 --> 50:37.820
What do we have to look forward to?

50:38.460 --> 50:40.060
well, it's

50:40.060 --> 50:44.460
It's a bit uninteresting really this release for ubuntu marte because we haven't

50:45.180 --> 50:47.180
landed any groundbreaking

50:47.340 --> 50:50.060
new features, but in terms of what the

50:50.700 --> 50:52.620
end user sees

50:52.620 --> 50:53.900
but

50:53.900 --> 50:55.900
It's a ground up

50:55.900 --> 51:01.360
Recreation basically so although it doesn't look like and it might not feel like it

51:01.440 --> 51:06.720
But we literally started from scratch and built it all from the ground up all over again

51:07.360 --> 51:10.320
And it's really all about the transition to gtk 3

51:11.360 --> 51:17.520
And one of the reasons that we don't have time to go back and fix the marte hud for example is we did the initial

51:18.080 --> 51:21.120
Let's go to gtk 3 and at that time it was

51:22.080 --> 51:23.600
gtk

51:23.600 --> 51:29.520
318. Oh, right and then part way through the ubuntu cycle

51:30.560 --> 51:32.560
They've pulled in gtk 320

51:33.200 --> 51:35.200
Which is a massive upheaval

51:35.440 --> 51:40.800
For anyone that's a theme designer, you know that basically all your themes stop working. You have to redo all your theming

51:40.880 --> 51:42.880
Oh man, so we've redone

51:43.280 --> 51:49.780
All the themings for gtk 320. So we've actually done like two significant tool get toolkit transitions

51:49.780 --> 51:54.020
In in this cycle, does that feel like you're bringing a lot of a lot of your time up?

51:54.660 --> 51:55.460
um

51:55.460 --> 52:02.740
It does and it doesn't because I made this decision that this release was going to be the we break everything we start over

52:03.060 --> 52:07.000
You know, this is this is the new starting point heading towards 1804

52:08.100 --> 52:13.300
We have to do this and the other thing that's happened, which is perfect timing. It was um

52:13.300 --> 52:18.920
Um, maybe late last week. Um, it's been announced that gtk 322

52:19.860 --> 52:21.860
Will be the last gtk 3 release

52:22.500 --> 52:25.140
From that point onwards it will only get fixes

52:26.100 --> 52:32.900
So after 322 then we go into this new gtk 4 development cycle, which is great. So from the mate

52:33.540 --> 52:36.420
Desktop team. This is ideal because now we can

52:37.380 --> 52:39.700
Stop having to do catch up on

52:39.700 --> 52:46.440
On gtk 3 toolkit api changes and actually just solidify hunk down fix up stuff

52:46.920 --> 52:52.040
Against that version and then the idea would be that 322 would be around for a year or more

52:52.680 --> 52:56.120
It will be well the idea is is uh that um

52:57.080 --> 53:02.200
Uh in about 18 months the stable version of gtk 4

53:02.760 --> 53:06.120
Will come along in that there won't be any api changes at that point

53:06.120 --> 53:10.940
So we've got like 18 months of sitting on that version of gtk

53:11.640 --> 53:14.040
with no api changes

53:14.600 --> 53:21.160
And then we have a transition in about a year and a half to a new toolkit, but we can now choose when

53:21.960 --> 53:23.160
we jump

53:23.160 --> 53:25.160
um toolkit versions

53:25.480 --> 53:31.080
Rather than us all having to you know, keep pace with with the cadence of gtk. Yeah

53:31.080 --> 53:36.360
Yeah, that's nice have something really you can target and then do bug fix and that kind of stuff

53:36.360 --> 53:39.880
Yeah, so so we might be a little bit rough around the edges for 1610

53:39.880 --> 53:44.600
but i'm really looking forward to 1704 because I know that we'll

53:45.240 --> 53:48.520
only have one gtk version to focus on and

53:49.080 --> 53:56.860
From now and probably all of the 1704 release will just be a refinement and fixes version probably no significant

53:56.860 --> 54:02.620
New developments will continue to improve the ubuntu mate welcome and the software boutique

54:03.100 --> 54:04.380
But in terms of all the other stuff

54:04.380 --> 54:09.980
We'll just focus on fixing up and making good for a good long period because we need to sort of develop that

54:10.540 --> 54:14.780
That stability and confidence that everything's working as we intend it to it's amazing

54:14.780 --> 54:19.900
How much you know how much back end work that takes for sometimes very little actual show

54:20.300 --> 54:24.460
But when you really do get that like no you can trust it. It just works. It's really worth a lot

54:24.460 --> 54:27.100
Yeah, and it does sort of just work at the moment

54:27.100 --> 54:32.620
But I know where the bugs and the wrinkles are and some of the testers have sort of identified lots of little paper cuts

54:32.620 --> 54:34.620
And we need to start addressing that stuff

54:35.180 --> 54:37.980
It sounds like it is it going to be an interesting it's an interesting phase

54:38.220 --> 54:42.300
And I bet I bet you're still I bet there's still something as an end user

54:42.300 --> 54:45.020
I'd be excited about for the for the 1610 release and I think

54:45.580 --> 54:48.460
for somebody like me, uh, I am I

54:49.340 --> 54:53.420
I think every six months is pretty aggressive and I don't think there's any problem at all

54:53.420 --> 54:58.300
With using a couple of releases every now and then to just work on some of this stuff. Yeah, right

54:58.380 --> 55:06.220
Yeah, that's what these intermediate releases are for, you know, these are the releases where you do this stuff, you know to build up to the lts

55:06.620 --> 55:06.940
I mean

55:06.940 --> 55:13.100
I suppose the thing that i'm most looking forward to and this isn't a 1610 thing specifically because it's um, I think it's landed in

55:13.720 --> 55:20.140
1604 if it hasn't it's about to and that's um firefox 49 being able to play netflix. I think

55:20.140 --> 55:24.460
That's huge. That's such a big deal. Um

55:25.340 --> 55:30.540
So, you know amazon prime and netflix now working in uh firefox is terrific

55:30.620 --> 55:36.700
So, you know, that's not nothing to do with tomato in particular, but that's a real good feature

55:37.100 --> 55:42.460
Yeah, absolutely. It is man. In fact, we should do just a quick firefox update

55:42.540 --> 55:45.660
So we're blowing through a lot of our updates right now. I think this is good. So but wimpy brought it up

55:45.820 --> 55:47.820
Why don't we do that? Um

55:47.820 --> 55:50.620
It's looking serious. I'll tell you about it here in just a moment

55:50.620 --> 55:56.320
In fact, let's let's uh, reorient ourselves and talk about linux academy really quick and then we'll transition into firefox linuxacademy.com

55:57.100 --> 56:01.660
Slash unplugged that's where you go. You want to be happy like this lady up on the screen and do a little linux academy dance

56:01.980 --> 56:03.900
Go there and learn more they got labs

56:03.900 --> 56:08.940
It'll spin up on demand with the distributions you've chosen and the courseware and the lab servers match that choice

56:09.260 --> 56:11.580
They have instructor mentoring when you need it

56:11.740 --> 56:16.380
It is really a platform to teach you everything about the core essentials around linux and everything built

56:16.380 --> 56:20.300
On top of it if you're a client if you have a client that has a new project for you

56:20.460 --> 56:23.340
If you want to impress an employer or you want to learn a new skill

56:23.660 --> 56:26.160
You want to challenge yourself or you want to get a certification?

56:26.700 --> 56:29.840
These are all great opportunities to visit linux academy go to linuxacademy.com

56:30.540 --> 56:34.460
Slash unplugged check out how their dashboard totally maps out the courseware for you

56:34.620 --> 56:38.540
Gives you download links for the comprehensive study guides and audio that you can take with you

56:38.840 --> 56:42.700
Instructor mentoring is integrated into the platform too. So it's always available when you need it

56:42.700 --> 56:47.260
They have a community stacked full of jupyter broadcasting members and they have so much great courseware

56:47.820 --> 56:53.820
Plus linux academy has been staffing out to make sure all of their existing courseware stays relevant and gets updates and they can continue

56:53.900 --> 56:58.320
And expand to make sure that your membership stays extra extra valuable linuxacademy.com

56:59.260 --> 57:03.180
Slash unplugged they got ios and android apps as well. So you can do it on the go

57:04.140 --> 57:10.780
Check them out linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

57:10.780 --> 57:13.900
Linux academy.com slash unplugged. So this is a big deal

57:13.980 --> 57:20.140
I think firefox could be getting up to a 700 improvement in responsiveness. Yeah, I said 700

57:21.180 --> 57:25.580
Holy crap chrome take that. This is really something now

57:25.580 --> 57:30.940
This is these are stats that are being reported by mozilla themselves. I'm guessing hopefully based on metrics

57:30.940 --> 57:32.940
They're getting back from early rollout of

57:33.560 --> 57:39.500
Electrolysis the company is reporting a 400 improvement in responsiveness and a 700 improvement in

57:39.500 --> 57:41.500
web page load times

57:42.240 --> 57:44.960
There's also the responsiveness for loading large web pages

57:45.600 --> 57:51.360
Over the next week multi-process will begin coming to 10 percent of total firefox users in the coming weeks

57:51.760 --> 57:54.320
mozilla will push multi-processing to 100 percent

57:55.360 --> 58:00.400
Of their initial user group the group represents 40 to 50 percent of the total users

58:00.640 --> 58:02.640
It's a lot of interesting numbers here

58:02.720 --> 58:06.720
The gradual rollout with the next six months a major within the next six months

58:06.720 --> 58:12.240
The majority of users can expect to have these capabilities. So here's what you're going to get in firefox 49

58:12.240 --> 58:16.480
It's going to enable us a set of add-ons that work well with multi-processing

58:16.480 --> 58:22.840
So you'll have for you'll have like a set in firefox 50 and 51 is somewhere depending on how development goes

58:23.760 --> 58:29.000
Sandboxing and enabling of more add-ons turns on then firefox 52 or 53

58:29.520 --> 58:33.680
Multiple content processes will be introduced and they talk about some of the cool things

58:33.680 --> 58:40.640
They've done in there with their mem shrink project to really nail this memory use thing with multi processes and they say well learn from

58:40.640 --> 58:41.960
the competition

58:41.960 --> 58:49.220
The way they implemented multi-course referring to chrome right the way they implemented all day. Oh, yeah, of course or opera. Yep

58:49.720 --> 58:54.320
The way they implemented multi-process is RAM intensive it can get out of hand

58:54.520 --> 59:00.560
We're learning from them and building an architecture that doesn't eat all of your RAM. Oh, I like that

59:00.560 --> 59:06.200
Yeah, so up to 400% improvement on load times less RAM usage. Um

59:06.960 --> 59:08.840
rust

59:08.840 --> 59:10.840
electrolysis

59:11.000 --> 59:12.880
Netflix support

59:12.880 --> 59:14.120
What is going on?

59:14.120 --> 59:18.480
Wes is firefox all of a sudden coming around only ready for Chris is it bad?

59:18.480 --> 59:23.080
Is it coming out off the ropes and swinging them punching chrome right in the face?

59:23.080 --> 59:28.660
I think it is clear at least the Mozilla's kind of you know, they've really felt what users pain has been

59:28.660 --> 59:32.240
I mean, especially like electrolysis has been a huge long rollout

59:32.240 --> 59:35.400
But it does feel like they've been making a lot of changes now to kind of like, okay

59:35.400 --> 59:36.200
We really need to catch up

59:36.200 --> 59:37.320
We really need to be

59:37.320 --> 59:40.440
Be in the spots where Chrome has us beat because there's like, you know

59:40.440 --> 59:44.840
There's like the 80% that they both do they're both totally fine. You can do like that much of your web browsing

59:44.840 --> 59:46.840
It's just those like extra Netflix support

59:47.520 --> 59:54.120
Responsiveness not hanging on your one crappy site. Like these are things that people who like use the web a lot really expect out of a

59:54.120 --> 59:55.600
browser

59:55.600 --> 01:00:00.560
Ww you've run into 4 gig memory limit issues. What are you let's go. What are you talking about?

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.080
You're talking per tab per process. What is this for the entire process of firefox?

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:11.160
I've run into like two to three to four to five to six

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:17.120
Gigabits or six no six gigabytes of my eight gigs of RAM use

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:25.000
Just because I'm running multiple tabs or maybe I'm researching something or I'm reading cross things and you know

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.480
So yeah, firefox definitely needs a memory shrink because it's getting ridiculous

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.520
Well, I think this new electrolysis overall is gonna end up using more memory

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.960
I mean, they're just being really smart about how they're doing it

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.400
But I think it still uses more memory because you're running more processes

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.320
So I don't I don't know if that's actually gonna I don't know if that's gonna help

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.240
Yeah

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:55.920
firefox doesn't have that sandboxing or like that chrome thing where it separates up in orange tabs into

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.660
Separate processes right now. So on the latest, you know version for me

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:09.140
It's still chewing up memory. So the only thing it's saying boxes would be the flash process

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:16.860
I believe so that's still separate. So you'll eventually get a flash crash, but you won't as often as it was before

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.860
So it still needs

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:25.740
Don't do improvements and this is a good stuff and I've been waiting and waiting for like electrolysis and I I think

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.180
Michael to know which isn't here

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:35.300
Has been using electrolysis a little bit more so he could probably talk more on it. Mm-hmm. Yes, so

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.860
So for me right now

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:43.220
I'm still dealing with that and I sold and up crashing firefox daily

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:48.100
Just because I need to reset my memory and I need to keep tabs and I have stuff

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:56.020
Enabled for that to keep those sections. It's it's a process and I'm willing to wait for it. So, you know, we'll see what happens

01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:03.100
Yeah, I'm getting hopeful though. Mm-hmm. And you should note that you can in about config under browser tabs. Yes remote

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:07.820
Yes, you can enable it for yourself. If you have firefox. Oh now you're talking my

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:13.420
So go try it out about config, right? You go in there and then it's where let's see how you got that. You got the file

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:17.820
I got it right here browser tabs.remote.auto start set that to true

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.420
If you then look under about support

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:27.700
It should have a multi process windows column. And if it shows that you have those then you're on it. Cool

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:32.540
I just enabled it right now is really easy. So cool. Well, all right now I kind of want to go try that

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:36.820
Yeah, I see if it's possible. That's pretty neat. They say and you know, I I caught the first

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:41.020
No, I caught the thing is for me is I'm such an extension idiot

01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:45.060
Like I've just got I got like markdown dome be a chrome. Yeah, really

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:48.940
I know it's it's it's because the I find these tools useful to extend my workflow

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:53.460
Like I I can bang out some just some great show notes by using a bunch of different tools and stuff and you're in like

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.460
It's like a candy store right? You're like, oh, yes

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.980
Oh, come on. Oh, come on

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:06.580
I'm not that bad. I I do good. I do them. Yeah, I do that. I got laugh. Okay, here's what I have right now

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:10.200
I have two markdown extensions to yeah, because one

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:16.020
One can create markdown by selected HTML and one just creates a markdown link to the page

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:21.820
I see and then I've got last pass because I went back on the last pass juice. I got my highlighter bookmark

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.980
And I got hangouts and I got an imager. Oh

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.940
And I got Google quick scroll, which is kind of cool. Have you ever seen?

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:30.700
Yeah, tell me more

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:35.380
So like when you search for something on Google and you click the link quick scroll comes up and it takes you right to the spot

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:38.340
The page that is relevant here. Okay, that's really nice. Yeah, it makes it fast

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:41.460
And then I've got a subreddit style on it, which I don't even know what that's for

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.180
So I'm not like crazy with the extent. No, that's actually pretty good

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.220
And that you know flash is probably in there somewhere, but Google does all that. Yeah

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:52.900
Thanks, you make me to sound like I'm some sort of maniac. No, that's actually very reasonable

01:03:52.900 --> 01:04:00.700
I I I'm excited to say that Wes and I will probably if all goes as planned be going to the open daylight summit

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.780
I think it was called on September 27th in Seattle

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:08.780
It is a conference about software defined networking and Linux etc

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:14.760
Etc put on by the Linux foundation, which means we might be doing like a different recording time in a week or so

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.760
So we'll update the calendar and let you guys know

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:21.060
Probably the 20th would be the the day we would do something if we do like a double or a late recording

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.900
I don't know what our plans are there

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:26.220
But because the 27th the day that the conference starts is a Tuesday, right?

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:31.180
And I don't really have any rigs here by myself that I think we could do a show live there from at the moment

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:33.780
I'm not sure tricky endeavor. Yeah, and I just don't think I don't know

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.100
Maybe I'd have time to put something to be such a bummer if like, oh

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:40.900
We tried that and then it didn't work. We just didn't have a show that we could always just have the mumble room to the show

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:46.140
Oh, yeah, I think they've got it down now. They might I bet I bet if I bet if they really put their minds to it

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:51.340
They could I bet I think they could I could probably do a better show with maybe Rekai Marshall on them into into place

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:55.340
I don't know. I could I could see I don't know. I think they could self-organize actually

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.580
I tell you what, I tell you I think wimpy would probably get drafted

01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:04.540
Yeah, but I think I could I think they could self-organize and then and then they do their own show. Don't tell them

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.540
They'll go off and just come back to the network

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.380
It's just you and me from then on

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.340
Also, I guess before I run if you want a little more show

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:20.300
I got to give a plug to our brand new show you can go to error dot show and

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:26.840
That'll take you to the user air program. We've got two episodes out right now. Episode 3 is officially in the can

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.420
I hear it's coming soon. Mm-hmm. It'll be coming out soon

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:35.380
and so you can subscribe to the feed and just get it auto magically we do have an mp4 and mp3 feed at this time and

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:40.780
It's also getting posted to the youtubes and in the all shows feeds if you're there you've got it

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:43.660
But both episodes so far really well reviewed

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.340
So I invite you to check it out if you want a little more Linux discussion

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:51.700
You know pleasant fun manner. It's great. We we we very

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.500
We try to have a very different feel for that show. And so I think we're pulling it off

01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:01.320
Yeah, I gotta say you episode 2 was great. Thank you. I hope you enjoy candid and yeah, that's true

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:08.460
It is and I hope you enjoy episode 3 as well, which will probably be out Wednesday morning Tuesday night JB time

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:12.500
So if you're watching the feeds what what I just like JB time that is do well

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.760
That's that's where we live. I just because it doesn't really matter to anybody listening

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.780
It's just because if I say it's specific, well who cares I could it could be East time

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.820
But if it's not your times, it doesn't matter. It's just the time that would jet evening for where we're at

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:30.380
Yeah, we got to do the beard time. Haha. I kind of like that too. That's that's not a bad suggestion

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:35.220
Beard time. I like it West. Alright, so I think that'll probably bring us to the end of this week's program

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:39.540
We do have a couple of more things that we'll pick up in the post show. So if you're sticking around

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:45.540
Well, I might put some of it in there West don't disparage. Okay, people could stick around and listen, but really you're right

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:51.660
The live experience like because we might get some gonna probably say hey recap put some of that in there

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:56.700
You know, but there's some like there's some real stinkers that are worth being there live for

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:03.860
JBLive.tv on a Tuesday you go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get it converted to your time

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.020
You got the robots there to do that

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.020
You can also go over to the contact page

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.100
Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:14.040
Send us in a comment and if you are you if you're a longtime YouTube watcher for the unplugged program

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:43.540
Give us a thumbs up. Please do. See you next week

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.540
Get it out of here

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.900
I've never installed GNU slash Linux

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.980
And the value of this is negative

01:07:55.060 --> 01:08:02.660
I'm gonna say a cucumber sour is very refreshing. It was actually very pleasant. Yeah, not too sour not super intense

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:07.140
It would be a good summer beer too. Like when it's really hot out. Yeah, even moan the law yo, man

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:11.580
Screw water you go. I want a beer and you go grab one of these this this cucumber

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:18.180
Sour would really do it for me. Not hoppy at all. Is this is this another local beer you brought to let's find out

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:24.780
You are some kind of maniac from Bend, Oregon, Oregon. That's not too far. That's that's legit. That's local

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:29.700
That is local. All right, JB titles calm. Let's go pick our title everybody. Thank you mumble room

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:41.420
Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Now. We have to go vote somebody off the island and only one person will survive at JB titles.com

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:50.220
Flashy extension idiot. That's kind of funny. Welcome to nope a real pain in the flash. That's also good

01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:56.180
So from everything I'm reading that we could link me earlier

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:04.660
Apparently by the end of this year slash and silver light will be mostly in the NT API

01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:11.500
For Firefox and it will be the only thing there and they're moving everything else to web extensions

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:17.500
You know, I do remember some talk about that web extension stuff in that vein interesting. Yeah

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:22.300
The beard knows the beard knows. So what do you know about software to find networking West?

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:31.100
Not as much as I would like to. Mmm, but it's an interesting topic and I feel like it's something that it's Linux is poised to do well with

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:35.980
It's too bad. A lot of the hardware implementations are so proprietary exactly

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:42.700
Just don't really have much option in the way of hardware things like switches. They're all very expensive for software-defined switches. I

01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:47.780
Don't be nice if there were cheaper devices it'd be nice if like ubiquity

01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:51.860
You got in the software-defined networking more I'm waiting for like a white box

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:57.940
Switcher that you can download by and like actually run cumulus on but they're all like open compute theory will provide these things

01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:03.620
But they're still targeting way higher end than what your average home user is gonna want like they're going like hundred gig now, right?

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:07.180
I feel like there's like this huge software defined

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.900
culture and and community that's growing that is sort of like

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.940
unknown

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:18.680
Because it this there is so much happening here, but yet I don't really have any eyes on it for some reason

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.880
I and I don't know if it's just a lot of it kind of behind closed doors in the enterprise though

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:29.900
I think that's why hmm. Okay. I don't usually work on your switches or 40 gig plus or yeah. Yeah. Yeah

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.180
Okay, that kind of makes sense

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:36.940
So there is a Linux Foundation have looking at it right now

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:40.220
software defined networking

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:43.020
Event in Seattle. Oh

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:50.660
The open Daylight Summit. That's what they're calling it the open Daylight Summit September 27th through the 29th and

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:57.820
I have gotten you and I pre-approved press wise to go in the foundation actually contacted us and said hey

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.820
Do you guys want to attend and I said?

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:01.940
Can West go to well, thank you

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:08.460
Well, I don't think this isn't his this is actually not really his thing

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:15.660
So this is this is developers and the software to find networking community coming together to demonstrate some of the latest technology

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:17.540
in open

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.860
software to find networking

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:25.260
So I feel like this is an opportunity for maybe to go and learn what's learn what some of them are talking about and then see

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.900
We can translate that to back to the audience to something that's interesting. I don't know what you're gonna say

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:35.580
Well, I was gonna say it's open like open power is open to some extent like there's the protocol and stuff is open

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:40.780
But most implementations are not necessarily open like a lot of the ones you care about say the hardware stuff

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:47.240
While they're using open flow as some great API that you can talk to you still don't have any of the software or for the switch

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:52.960
Yeah, and see that's the kind of you're linking against some Broadcom IP or something. That's exactly the kind of thing

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.660
I want yeah, I out for that's exactly what I want to keep my eye out for and I mean

01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:02.500
It's still cool you buy the switch and it runs whatever software as long as you can control it with your open controller and stuff

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:07.740
It's mostly okay. Yeah, it's still it's still an ideal, right? It's still an improvement, but it's not ideal

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:13.320
So that's so that's on the 27th West okay, and that's that's a Tuesday

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.700
And I don't know exactly what we should do like we there's a couple of options

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:21.980
We could go in the morning and try to hustle back up here in time for unplugged and do a later unplugged

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:23.980
That's definitely a possibility

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:30.980
We could pre-record on the 20th and dude we could do two unplugs and then not worry about that Tuesday at all or

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.180
And I don't think this is I don't think I have the hardware for this

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:40.500
But the real Hail Mary of course would be to do a show from down there. Oh, right, but I don't think I have

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:46.900
I mean, maybe I could do it from the MacBook Pro, but I haven't really put it in that kind of workload yet

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:51.260
But otherwise I I mean I need like a pretty powerful machine to do all that not to mention

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:56.580
I'd have to make sure I have all the analog equipment to make that possible so I didn't get permission from them

01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:03.020
There's a good open flow switch. Oh, yeah, okay in terms of like something a consumer could afford. It's like a hundred bucks

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:09.420
Posted it. It'd be a good learner device wouldn't it yeah the zodiac here. Oh, yeah

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:13.260
Yeah, the zodiac those would be fun to play with wow look at that thing. That's pretty interesting

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:16.740
Yeah, I don't know how performant this would be in terms of switching capabilities. I don't even know

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.060
Learn on yeah, yeah

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:22.740
So I guess I'm gonna go in there with a pretty open mind

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:27.260
If we can make it down there, and you and I'll probably just have to figure out what we want to do recording wise

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:33.260
Okay, I'm open for whatever. I would love to do the show from there, but I'm thinking that's probably not doable

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:38.820
But if we got if we hustled we got a few interviews in the morning and then got up here say by like

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:44.340
233 and did it like a late-unplugged. Yeah, maybe that might be I don't know so that's something to think about

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:50.020
It's coming up on our radar on the 27th. They're having it here in Seattle and the Linux foundations behind it

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:54.260
So that's kind of awesome. Yeah, that's interesting too. I like the idea of this at least

01:13:54.260 --> 01:14:00.820
It's the tough pie case with 15 backers. They have 22 days to go. They're looking for

01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.740
5840 Australian funky money

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:10.580
But it and they're at 2400 right now the tough pie is an all-in-one breakout tough case for the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:17.140
With an inbuilt 7 inch display look at that thing Wow it looks like you're toting a bomb around

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.140
You could be toting a bomb it could be high-end production equipment

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:27.300
There's the inside view with 3d printed mounting brackets and spaces and look at all that stuff like they're running Cody down there

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.940
Look at that. Yeah, they gotta go home with Cody on it

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.860
And of course I like that setup just for like all right

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:35.100
I can watch my movies and retro pie it's got a keyboard in there

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.380
I mean, it's a huge laptop

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:42.060
But this thing looks like you could toss it around on an airplane or or drive over it with a tank and it would survive

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:45.580
It's pretty cool, and it's called the tough pie by Brett Swan

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:49.220
Mmm. Yeah, you never know you never know 22 days left to go

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:54.180
He might Brett my reasonable goal to try to raise to I'm gonna send it over to know though because he and I like the idea

01:14:54.180 --> 01:15:15.860
Of modding up those types of pelican type cases to do production stuff too. It's part of cool ways. I like it. I'm interested
