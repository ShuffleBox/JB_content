1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
you're my hero thanks poppy yeah you're welcome you're welcome so how the hell

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,220
are you great I see you tweeting about audio editors I've been recently

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,960
screwing around with I've been I've been taking another crack at the sort of the

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,480
best quote-unquote audio editors for Linux which what would you say what

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,680
would you say is the best audio editor for Linux what would you say yeah what

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,740
would you say wimpy oh it's an audio yeah well boy boy do I agree with you

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,960
wimpy boy fist bump yeah oh it's an audio is amazing but it you know the

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,860
problem with those now it's a single track editor right it's great though

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,840
it's it's a really it's the best audio editor out there if you just need to

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,200
like need it yeah I don't do anything complicated with audio right if you just

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,880
need to like clip and trim and you know cut or if you want to like open up like

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,000
a video file like a movie and pull like a clip out of a movie it's great for

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,600
that so it's really it's it's not it's not free software but it's free as in

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,720
cost and it's really good pointing it's not open source yeah it's very good I

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,920
mean I'm not and I'm not saying it's good for Linux I mean it's not good for

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,320
Linux right it's good for any operate like it's better than like pretty much

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,080
anything out there for any operating system it's I think it's actually

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,120
available for all the operating systems but it's really good I use I use it a

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,400
lot for unfilter and I like it a lot or sometimes if I just need to grab

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,520
something small but yeah if you go in multi-track it's probably it's probably

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,640
our door which I just I have not been happy with our door what happened to is

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,040
I made a big mistake is when I I had this machine that I was testing mountain

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,560
lion alright now what's it called Yosemite I was testing Yosemite on and

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:56,120
for production and I installed audition Adobe audition it's so good it is an

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,400
amazing audio editor and I had used it years ago so I was kind of like I was

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,440
kind of impressed with it then but man they it's so good it's so so good it's

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,800
so good and like compare and then I opened up our door again going back to

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,040
because I edit I I'm currently editing women's tech radio in our door and so

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,640
the the pains that I've been having in our door of kind of kind of would made

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,120
me check out audition and so now I'm like trying to figure out if you can get

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,160
audition to run under wine which it seems to be currently not possible so I

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,680
think I don't know I I guess see I've been I've always said that Linux has

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,720
really great audio editing but then and then I went and checked out our audition

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,560
I was like whoo this is it's really great and like the like some of the

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,960
plugins and effects that it ships with alone like it it does some really

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,840
impressive like noise removal if you have like something in the line that you

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,680
don't like it has a it has a I mean all all editors have this but it's actually

38
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,400
really good like it can sample a section and then it's really good about

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,880
visualizing for you how it's going to remove that and then you can adjust the

40
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,680
sliders and you can it visually represents how it's gonna clean that

41
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,080
noise up and you can preview it in real time in any section of the audio you

42
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,480
want and then you can say it's just it's the tools that it has are really nice so

43
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,520
now now now I'm feeling like our doors it's good but what right now I think our

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,160
door is really good for recording but when it comes down to doing high high

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,560
level of production editing like more than just cutting the top and adding

46
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,560
music when it comes down to really getting in there I don't know all right

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,520
so somebody say something here can I hear oh I have this thing yeah here we

48
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:48,200

Hangouts yeah it's exactly like Hangouts only it's encrypted and secure and can

63
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:27,280
it do recording it can do recording as well on the server welcome to Linux

64
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,600
unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's putting out the welcoming Matt

65
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,480
for all of those Mac switchers my name is Chris and my name is Matt so just

66
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,860
before the pre-show I was asking you are you flooded at all because here up in

67
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,960
the beautiful rainy Pacific Northwest it is bad Matt I'm taking the I have to put

68
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,240
the four-wheel drive on to make it into the studio because I'm basically driving

69
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,960
through a river oh wow yeah it's yeah that was one of the roads that one of

70
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,120
the roads I take a good portion of it is totally underwater right now well I know

71
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,040
Sylvania's just basically get your scuba gear I mean yeah I can't get to my

72
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,040
butcher I can't they close the road yeah they're they're done I mean I've got

73
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,720
problems Matt how am I gonna get my meat you're gonna have to boy scuba gear I

74
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,760
mean it's gonna come down to scuba gear yeah we've been spared up here so far

75
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,160
nothing I mean as far as but you've seen where I live I live on a gigantic like

76
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,400
mr. burn style hill so yeah actually well one of the things I did early when

77
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,520
we moved into the JB one studio is I actually built a boat underneath the

78
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,120
studio I just got a wild idea to do it and so I figured we did that and so if

79
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,400
we have any flooding here JB will be fine we'll just float hey coming up on

80
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,160
this week's episode of the Linux unplugged show we're gonna get to some

81
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,440
great follow-up in fact we're gonna get make good on a bet here in just a

82
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,980
moment we're gonna cover something for the community and then mr. Richard

83
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,200
Stallman I had a talk recently and it was pretty standard affair he has a

84
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,800
pretty good talk that he gives but he had a couple of moments that he

85
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,880
definitely emphasized and I wanted and I think I want to have a real talk with

86
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,160
the virtual lug about some of the things he said and because I think there's a

87
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,080
lot gonna be a lot of conflict in it and it's something we need to just have an

88
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,920
honest discussion about it's not gonna be to make fun of our mess it will be to

89
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,200
have a legitimate discussion of some of the points he makes and then later on in

90
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,200
the show I I had a 2014 prediction that are I'm sorry 2015 prediction that more

91
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,920
of not all not a lot not not like millions but a noticeable percentage of

92
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,180
high-end Mac users would get frustrated and begin abandoning the Mac OS

93
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,400
platform and switch back to Linux users that perhaps we had lost along the way

94
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,440
a bunch of users we lost along the way that might come back well over the

95
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,520
weekend a total s storm developed in the Mac community they ended up making it up

96
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,120
on on CNBC national television lots of articles written about it about the

97
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,840
decline of Mac software and about developers who've been around for 10

98
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,360
plus years switching the Linux platform I'm gonna tell you about that and maybe

99
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,760
if there is an advantage in there for Linux hmm yeah we'll see so why don't we

100
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,000
bring in our our virtual lug a time appropriate greetings mumble room hello

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,440
hello great to have you guys no all right so poppy since you're here let's

102
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,560
cash in on a bet poppy you in a prediction said that if Ubuntu does not

103
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,680
does not ship on a phone by the end of 2014 you'd wear pants on your head and

104
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,400
here you are boom right there for the internet to see poppy making good Ninja

105
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:37,480
Turtles pants on his head I hope so I hope so that's kind of like a trophy of

106
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,160
shame now I think you should save that and then if somebody else fails a pants

107
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,560
bet you should ship the box but they have to pay for the shipping so it's not

108
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,560
out of your pocket like you should just pass that around now oh yeah pair of

109
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,320
pants every time well it could be I'm just proposing that as an option it that

110
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,520
might not be practical but as soon as it leaves my house I'm no longer obligated

111
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,840
to wear them anymore right yeah unless you fail another bet unless you fail

112
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:10,160
another bet so good on you I like this you know what honestly Matt you might

113
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,240
have considered going this route instead of an entire monkey suit oh I know right

114
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,920
tell me about I still got that thing oh yeah I still got my money that might

115
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,960
yeah I might even make it make a reappearance here someday I got my man

116
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,720
in the yellow hat outfit so he could always busted out you know we were

117
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,960
talking about production on Linux more and more recently but on the pre-show

118
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,760
even and Katie and life and wrote and he said hey I don't if you caught this but

119
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,720
there's some news about Katie and live John Baptiste has gone got the Academy

120
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,680
Award for the best application in 2014 here we go the score this is pulled he

121
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,400
pulled from the form for Katie and live he says JBM is back with a vengeance

122
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,360
developing Katie and live after being pretty much out of action for about a

123
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,240
year and a half he's been slaving away porting the

124
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,000
application to the latest version of Katie's frameworks which means there's

125
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,800
not much of for us lowly users yet but what it means in the long run is that

126
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,760
the application can keep moving forward with the latest developments of the

127
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,440
underlying application framework for which it is built so in other words it

128
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,800
sounds like Katie and live might be moving to qt5 and development has begun

129
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:22,280
again I live in it oh it's it's unbelievable because it used to be you

130
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,480
know my favorite let's crash an editor editor but here in recent years it's

131
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,040
surprisingly will take a beating it's fast it's stable surprisingly I can add

132
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,400
to it all day long I could have 50 lines of whatever it doesn't care it just

133
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,720
works it's like yeah and it you know it makes a lot of like compositing and

134
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
green-screening all that type stuff it makes it real easy to do I want to get

135
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,280
used to the flow you know for casual usage I would recommend it yeah well

136
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,040
then I'm glad to hear the development continues so thank you to Katie and I

137
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:57,400
fan for sending that in I I I think I've had probably more luck with the earlier

138
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,640
versions of open shot but um I want to like it it just it's just you know I can

139
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,260
only hit save so many times after a while you do you have to develop a save

140
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,280
tick you know and if I want to do anything with any you know you know more

141
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,840
than three lines or you know oh forget it it's just it needs a little work I'm

142
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,880
excited to see what they do in the future though so I you know since since

143
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:27,320
we moved into JB one last year Rekai has been our editor so I don't actually do

144
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,720
any video editing really anymore unless I unless I want to so it's not really

145
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,120
been something that I've had to really push very much but I have it's called

146
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,000
avid mucks see am I saying that right guys are you familiar with sounds close

147
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,880
every demon yes okay so you guys all know what I'm talking about right this

148
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:52,480
like for example today I got like three clips from RMS's speech and what it

149
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,000
allows me to do is I opened up the WebM file that RMS the speeches in and I was

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,400
able to go in and just say here's a marker and now here's a marker out take

151
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,320
these take the between these two markers and save that as its own standalone

152
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,600
WebM file and it doesn't do any recoding it doesn't it just takes that section of

153
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,760
the file out re-encapsulates it back in a WebM wrapper and and just drops it on

154
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,040
the file system it so there's no degradation and quality because there's

155
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,680
no re-encoding yeah and it does it with all basically I think you got a codec

156
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,440
for and so what you really got it which so so you might consider like if you

157
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,280
don't need a full-fledged freaking editor sometimes you can do quite a bit

158
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,200
which is chopping the ends and maybe even dropping in and pasting in like

159
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,000
maybe intro and outro clips and you don't even need a full thing because

160
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,320
then you just save that out to one a MKV master file and then you run that

161
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,800
through handbrake to make your versions and you're done it's really easy so you

162
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,720
don't what I'm discovering is is I started rethinking about this and what

163
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,400
I realized is well if my if my production needs are reduced now that

164
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,920
Rekai is really handling handling the editing of the shows then maybe I don't

165
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,520
need a full-fledged editing suite of tools and once I kind of made that shift

166
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:04,600
in mindset it really was a lot easier but it depends on your workload all

167
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,400
right yes very good so we've got a few things I want to talk about and Colonel

168
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:15,600
Linux are you still here yes you are but you're muted all right well standby I'm

169
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,680
gonna I'm gonna go to you I'm gonna go to you but first I'll let you get your

170
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,440
audio sorted while I take a quick moment and talk about Linux Academy so Linux

171
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,400
Academy is a sponsor of the Linux Unplugged show and I think they're a

172
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,520
perfect fit for our audience we were just talking about kind of moving

173
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,320
yourself forward a little bit and trying new things and reach it changing the way

174
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,240
you think about things that's one of the things that Linux Academy has allowed me

175
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,040
to do here's why if you can get started by going to Linux Academy comm slash

176
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,120
unplugged you'll get our special 33% discount Linux Academy comm slash

177
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,960
unplugged and then you get access to all of their content I've logged in there

178
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,440
and I've been surprised I kind of had a wreath I had a rethinking process when I

179
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:00,440
went to Linux Academy comm specifically slash DevOps and I realized that DevOps

180
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,440
is actually something that I guess I was I was sort of doing for a long time I

181
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,120
didn't realize that's what we would call it and this is an area that's growing

182
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,080
like like nuts and so Linux Academy has been developing courseware specifically

183
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,800
for that area but they've also got courseware you you get anything you'd

184
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,240
want to scratch an itch on for Linux really from mastering Linux to absolute

185
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,360
beginner stuff and you can walk away from this and go get certifications it

186
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,960
happens all the time in fact I've been getting some success stories which is

187
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,560
awesome thank you to the audience for sending that in and keep sending if you

188
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,200
get if you get a cert after taking a Linux Academy of course I love hearing

189
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,200
about it so keep sending them in it's really encouraging too because if you

190
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,200
ever kind of bottom out a little bit they've got a community of support that

191
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,880
will help you kind of get going again but they also have a system that will

192
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,600
give you really easy to adjust and assess time for how long something's

193
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,960
gonna take you'll log in you're gonna say this section is gonna take this long

194
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,960
this section is gonna take this long you need this much time and you can say you

195
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,560
know what Linux Academy bro I only got so much time I'm a busy man and it will

196
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,800
automatically create a learning plan that met that matches that amount of

197
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,700
time you could downloadable comprehensive study guides virtual labs

198
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,500
you can work and they'll spin them up on the back end 7 plus Linux distributions

199
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,080
you get to choose from they automatically adjust the courseware to

200
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,480
those Linux distributions I mean this is a seriously slick system because it's

201
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,480
created by people they're enthusiastic and passionate about Linux now if you're

202
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,680
a listener of this show you know what that difference means when somebody

203
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,320
actually cares about open source and Linux versus just a general education

204
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,880
site it is the final gap it's that gap that closes the uncanny valley linux

205
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,960
academy.com slash unplugged get our 33 percent discount get access to

206
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,680
everything they're doing some great new Docker courseware just went up also the

207
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,720
puppet professional stuff the puppet stuff they've got now you start at total

208
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,380
noob you know I know puppets this thing it lets me like manage servers and you

209
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,440
go to like okay I'm ready to go get the cert seriously it's all the way through

210
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,680
and you can do stuff in practicality they have scenario based courseware it's

211
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,960
so great linuxacademy.com slash unplugged go check them out and a big

212
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,480
thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show

213
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,360
all right mr. Colonel Linux are you back now I got my voice back hi there I missed

214
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,840
you so I wanted to talk about some upcoming conferences the first one on

215
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,200
the list is scale 13 February 19th to the 22nd it's a big one at the Hilton

216
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,320
Los Angeles Airport are you still on your radar planning to go to this I am

217
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,480
in fact I I've been to most of the the Linux conferences multiple times but

218
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,240
I've never been to scale so this will be my first time at scale and I have to say

219
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,880
the thing I'm most excited for is apparently you can paint with you can

220
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,240
paint with like they have like a bio lab and you can then you you can take the

221
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,760
the bio biological material and paint make like drawings and stuff with whoa

222
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,240
yeah oh I also see they're doing the traditional PGP key signing party which

223
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,040
is great now do you know anybody else on the crew is anybody else yet confirmed

224
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,600
going not that I know of so we're gonna start organizing something around scale

225
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,280
so that's coming up and and if you're thinking of going make sure you say hi

226
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,840
to Noah and anybody else ends up making it on the crew the next big one for us

227
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,080
where we really go all out is Linux fest Northwest 2015 it's gonna be the

228
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,600
biggest Linux fest ever Bellingham Washington April 25th to the 26th this I

229
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,320
think is gonna be a huge year for Linux fest because it's just been getting

230
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,840
bigger and huger every single year and every year the feedback is always so

231
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,240
positive that it just seems to continually grow I know this one's

232
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,920
pretty far away because it's right up in our corner of the Pacific Northwest but

233
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,320
I'd love to encourage the audience to make it out we're gonna go all out worst

234
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,720
we're talking to them about having two booths so that way we have enough room

235
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,760
to spread out and if you know if you know what that's like having two booths at a

236
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,400
conference like this that's really quite an event and I think it's gonna be

237
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,360
amazing and hopefully and not everything's lined up yet we're all the

238
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,700
very beginning stages but hopefully we'll be able to live stream the entire

239
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,080
thing and we might even be able to do that using Linux so stay tuned for

240
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,560
information on that so I've links to both those in the show notes if you want

241
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,920
to check out more details love to see you guys at Linux fest Northwest I think

242
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,360
we're gonna go all out and I hope we're gonna get as much of the crew out here

243
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,200
as possible so we'll find out and that's again April 25th in the 26 2015 in

244
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,320
Bellingham Washington Linux fest Northwest org for more information mr.

245
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,240
rotten corpse are you still here did you have to jet off all right and are you

246
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,840
ready to talk about the new pick site that you set up yep sure all right so

247
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,960
it's a Jupiter broadcasting comm slash last picks and now with the complete

248
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,760
entire essentially nine-year history runs Linux and this is unbelievable made

249
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,880
me realize how how old the show episode one Linux action show my Tivo runs

250
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:43,480
Linux June 10th June 10th 2006 which is quite a long time ago so rotten corpse

251
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,880
tell us about this pick site and how maybe people could contribute fork their

252
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,280
own etc the pick site is it's it's written in PHP so if you know PHP you

253
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,200
can help out with that in that case but if you don't you can actually contribute

254
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,720
through adding data to from the github site so if you if you go to the github

255
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,400
page you'll see that there is a folder says site and then inside that folder is

256
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,920
the data file and everything's stored in the data file okay so there's a template

257
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,080
in the data files you just copy and paste and add it to the bottom of the

258
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,960
file and this it's that simple to just change the numbers and then add the like

259
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,680
the name of the pick and the URL and that's and that's pretty much all you

260
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,400
have to do and just send the send a pull request and I have a tutorial that I'm

261
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,080
working on that explains how to do everything but also another tutorial to

262
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,480
how to keep your stuff up to date with the main branch but the one of the

263
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,800
things I like about the site is that it's mobile friendly so if you pull it

264
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:52,240
up on a tablet or a phone it will you know responsively adjust itself to fit

265
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:59,760
everything and one of the coolest features I like is the the calendar jump

266
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,360
so you can just click that the top right button and you can choose just between

267
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,600
no look at that that's really go back to 2012 or whatever whoo oh that's slick

268
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,160
yeah it's especially useful on the runs Linux one boy you're making me feel

269
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,320
really old though when I realize how old the show is that's that's kind of

270
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,280
honestly tripping me out a little bit to see all of it linked and noted here this

271
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,600
is really the first time I've seen a list of the show like this because the

272
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,800
back catalogue isn't is in such disarray I've never actually seen it visualized

273
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:40,080
like this as funny as that might seem there's a lot of people that helped I

274
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,200
and you can go to the good hip thing and see that in the contribute section who

275
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,840
helped out so it was really I couldn't done it by myself but one of the cool

276
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,080
things that I set up is an API that so developers can take all the data out and

277
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,120
you just go to the contribute section and there's an API link right now it's

278
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,080
just JSON but there will be other output formats as well and you made this video

279
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,000
here about it yeah the video is actually just the keeping your seeing I need to

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,120
make I'm still might working on another people want their own their own list

281
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,360
their own copy yeah if they want to help they need to fork the original repo and

282
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,680
then once you make changes or someone else makes changes it might confuse

283
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,640
people have never used it before so this video is just to help them keep their

284
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,600
repo in sync with the master well it's pretty neat to see all this and this is

285
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,840
a common request and something we've tried in different forms but thanks to

286
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,520
various volunteers in the past you know they've done unofficial lists on their

287
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,080
own they've tried doing in different capacities but this one it's it's much

288
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,200
easier to find for one because it's just it's a Jupiter broadcasting comm slash

289
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,880
las pics so that's nice but also I like that the community can also keep it up

290
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,440
to date if anybody can contribute and you don't need to know how to code at

291
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,760
all just go to the contribute section and you know just walk through it and

292
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,960
then fork your own fork your own repo and that's it not to repeat myself but

293
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,800
if you get up if you get a new Android device or a new Linux desktop I totally

294
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,280
recommend going to the desktop apps or the Android apps and checking out some

295
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,720
of the pics there are some super really really good apps I really like this list

296
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,360
I work really hard to pick these apps to make sure they're as good as possible

297
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,640
whenever I can it's not always possible but I really stand by all of these app

298
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,680
picks and so if you've got a new rig to set up that's a great list to start with

299
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,580
right there and you can again Jupiter broadcasting comm slash las pics it's just a

300
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,040
great resource for the community and thank you for everybody who's helped

301
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,520
rotten corpse and a big thank you to producer rotten corpse creating that for

302
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,040
us well it was such a gold mine because I mean I remember air droid when you

303
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,160
guys featured that you know it's just like that's what really sold me on an

304
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,320
Android right there I was like I can't do this on my own my other device this

305
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,480
was awesome well it's also nice for me because I have a pretty good idea of

306
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,160
what I've covered before and I can always do a site search but to have the

307
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,720
list and just be able to go to listen search to see have I picked this app

308
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,560
before exactly sometimes there's ones I'd like oh how could I how could I have

309
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,560
skipped this oh my gosh I need to go pick this right now and then it's I go

310
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,280
search see if I've done I haven't I'm like oh I'm good this is my epic so also

311
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,320
helps for no duplicates too yes exactly totally that's what I'm saying man tells

312
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,280
what I'm saying thank you sir very much and to be interesting to see if any

313
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,720
developers managed to pull that into their app that could be a that could be

314
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,320
a neat light like when you're listening to an episode if they could pull in like

315
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,280
here's just the pics boom from this episode right there you never know all

316
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,160
right well I'll tell you about something I pick as digital ocean digital ocean

317
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,320
comm sponsored Linux unplug program and use our promo code we've got it just for

318
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,480
a little bit we're hanging on to it because we're retro because we're hip

319
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,000
but not stirs it's unplugged December that's a $10 credit for digital ocean

320
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,600
unplugged December and what's great about digital ocean you just go in there

321
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,800
and apply it to your account you don't even have to put a credit card in there

322
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,960
to try out digital ocean so what is digital ocean it's a simple cloud

323
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,840
hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you

324
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,600
to spin up your own server that you get root access to and you can start in less

325
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,360
than in about 55 seconds maybe even less than that I often see a lot less than

326
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,680
that and only it starts get this five dollars a month that'll get you 512

327
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:08,000
megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer and they

328
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,400
have data centers in New York and San Francisco and Singapore and Amsterdam

329
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,400
and London but they're beautiful too and they have multiple data centers in those

330
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,640
locations you can do private networking within the data centers which doesn't

331
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,320
count against your bandwidth totals so if you want to have a front-end web

332
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,880
server in a back-end database server or some caching that's a really really nice

333
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,120
option you could also do something like have a couple of front-end servers in a

334
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,520
back-end now server put open media vault on there there's all kinds of things you

335
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,120
can do once you get once you get access to the box because you've got root

336
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,240
control of it and what's really great is it's all powered by this dashboard the

337
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,360
digital ocean is created and it's so great I mean they've got the super

338
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,160
powerful hardware with the SSD drives and the tier 1 bandwidth all running on

339
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,320
top of Linux using KVM like a boss and then they came up with this interface

340
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,400
and I'm like are you kidding me are you serious you've made it this easy it's so

341
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,480
intuitive and power users can replicate the interface on a larger scale digital

342
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,040
ocean straightforward API and so there's tons of great community apps because

343
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,800
once you get a good API for a popular service well if you make the API they

344
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,080
will come as Kevin Costner has taught us and digital ocean knows it so they've

345
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,480
made that we were just on the pre-show checking out meet meet Jitsi

346
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,200
implementation that's running on a digital ocean droplet fully encrypted

347
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,680
exactly like hangouts where it does the auto switching and you get the little

348
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,840
tiles below of who's talking it's all built into the browser running on a

349
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,120
digital ocean droplet right now it's so many opportunities and there's great

350
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,520
tutorials because they're willing to pay money for those tutorials in fact we've

351
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,320
got a link in the show notes of digital ocean pay up to $200 if you got

352
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,520
something you can write here's an example of one I think I'm gonna go for

353
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,640
especially as my son gets more and more into reading and then pretty soon my

354
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,920
daughter this is how to create a clever a cleaver a e-book server on a buntu

355
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,440
yes I said a buntu yes I said a buntu 1404 right there you go get the digital

356
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,140
ocean droplet use our promo code unplug December you get the $10 credit you go

357
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,720
create yourself an ebook server cleaver is amazing it's something I want to do

358
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,960
an entire episode on at one point but now I'm thinking this is step one for me

359
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,080
try this out it's just another use of the really millions of possibilities you

360
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,700
could use a digital ocean droplet for unplug December digital ocean and a big

361
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,920
thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplug program alright

362
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,040
so Richard Stallman had a talk recently and it's pretty standard affair freedom

363
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,480
in your computer and in the net he says for freedom in your own computer the

364
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,760
software must be free for freedom on the internet we must organize against

365
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,040
surveillance censorship software as a service and the war against sharing

366
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,920
pretty common approach for mr. Stallman and a message that's definitely worth

367
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,400
listening to in fact that's why I encouraged people at the end of last

368
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,120
week's last to go listen to it however where I run into is a little bit of the

369
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,080
practicalities and I want this is what I want to discuss with you guys so I've

370
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,360
pulled three clips from his talk that he normally goes down this path but he

371
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,120
emphasizes these points pretty hard in his talk and I think I'd like to hear

372
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,840
from all of us who have worked in any kind of software industry where that's

373
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,760
where that where that company's goal has been perhaps to have some level of

374
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,080
profit and make money and I think that and that could be it could be a lot of

375
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,680
us that work in the contract contracting capacity people who develop software

376
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,800
and sell it and so in Richard Stallman's talk today he talks about how these

377
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,840
companies that use software as a means to make money are simply doing it for a

378
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,120
greedy purpose and I want to play the clip and I want to talk about it because

379
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,480
in his opinion there's no way around it it's evil by nature proprietary software

380
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,100
are being victimized by proprietary malware of course the reason they do

381
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,920
this is typically for profit it's not that they're sadists that enjoy

382
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:50,400
mistreating people no they're totally egoistical and they do this for profit

383
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,880
like they the more users they make captive the more they can sell to

384
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:04,640
somebody else and in effect proprietary software is all a swindle and they're

385
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,640
not even ashamed of it they have conferences where they talk about their

386
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:18,280
latest advances in how to make users captive and mistreat them in effect the

387
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,720
proprietary software world is one where the ethical standards of treating the

388
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:31,800
customers or the users have disappeared any mistreatment of those users is okay

389
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:37,400
there may be some pesky laws or regulations they have to find an excuse

390
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,840
to bypass like so his point is is that they're they're fundamentally it's

391
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,680
gonna be an evil motive and I guess are we victims of commercial software in the

392
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,880
sense that we are not allowed to have control over it in the end which is what

393
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,080
his point was and here's here's why I asked this because right now we are in

394
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,280
the thick of CES the Consumer Electronics Show is happening right now

395
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,900
and just like Richard said these companies are up on stage and they're

396
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,960
bragging about the ecosystem they're bragging about the lock-in I watched the

397
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,240
ACES keynote and I I literally felt belittled I felt like he's and he's

398
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,880
holding a phone up there he's like and for those of you who like to think out

399
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,600
the box here's three models you can pick from because you're a renegade and it

400
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,360
felt like they were formulaically looking at the audience and saying well

401
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,160
these people identify as this so here's their product and these people identify

402
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,640
as this so here's their product and it felt like they were actually their

403
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,920
intention was the exact opposite of their message it felt it felt gross and

404
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,400
it's all I wouldn't and and again it's about locking me into their system so

405
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,120
what RMS says is very extreme but yet when I look at the background of CES

406
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,280
happening right now I think long term I think you might be a little right well

407
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,020
you know I I look at it as this from just a nuts and bolts point of view he's

408
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,520
accurate what he's saying is true unfortunately and I and I know that he

409
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,660
doesn't care about this but this is a reality convenience always and will

410
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,280
until the end of time unless we end up in some apocalyptic world will always

411
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,440
trump privacy and it just that's just a reality we give way to it every single

412
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,600
day oh you want to use a club savings card at your grocery store it'll save

413
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,040
you 30 cents sure you're giving up your privacy but you know it's saving you a

414
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,920
little money and it's convenient we'll always give way to that now that's not

415
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,160
to say everybody will but I think that that's the underlying issue you know

416
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,180
does that make what Richard says wrong or bad in some capacity not at all no I

417
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,760
think that what he's saying is fine I have no problem with it but I would

418
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,720
point out that no one's going to wrap suddenly change their mind unless they

419
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,760
experience that victimization that he's speaking of okay Colonel like show me the

420
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,720
money what do you think you think about the money right so what so he's right

421
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,800
when he says that those companies make a lot of decisions based purely on capital

422
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,640
and why wouldn't they those businesses exist to make money and they don't care

423
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,320
about users freedoms and why would they that's not a profitable aspect to them

424
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,960
but if you make it a profitable aspect you know to them either by one as users

425
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,400
if we say I'm just not gonna buy if I can't buy a device that I have

426
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,080
administrative access to or can get administrative access to then I just

427
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,760
won't buy it I'll buy all I'll buy this device or this competing device and you

428
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,560
don't give them your money that's one way you can for that you can you can

429
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,760
show those companies that if if they want give them a way to make money by

430
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,400
supporting users freedoms the second way you can do that is I've gone into I

431
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,760
can't count how many businesses I've got into and said you shouldn't use

432
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,280
Microsoft Office you should use Libra office now there the the the concept of

433
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,240
freedom and the concept of users rights they couldn't care less about but when I

434
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,880
tell them well instead of paying $300 a year $400 a year to upgrade to the

435
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,840
newest version every year you just go to this site you click on this download

436
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,080
link and it's free for all 60 year computers and you start putting that on

437
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,120
paper and shove it in front of a in front of a president's face now they

438
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,360
care now yeah yeah well okay wimpy are you a victim when you buy your Amazon

439
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,880
fire TV are you now a victim well Richard Stallman would say that

440
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,240
I'm a victim I'm just a slave to convenience I suppose really on time

441
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,800
yeah I'm a pragmatist much more of a pragmatist and Stallman is that's for

442
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,640
sure rotten corpse you think in the long run though RMS is right yeah I mean I

443
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,320
think our message kind of already proven that the the messages is right because

444
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,560
and when he started doing this there was basically no options for like as soon as

445
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:42,720
the the proprietary stuff took hold there was only proprietary stuff and now

446
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,120
there's actually people who have joined the argument in projects like Firefox

447
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,840
and stuff that are trying to keep things and a way for freedom is important to

448
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,280
them and I think in the long term it will be eventually it will people will

449
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,240
realize but it's in the short term it's really hard to convince them other than

450
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,760
the you know the stuff that's free money wise but I think that what mad dog said

451
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,800
is also a really good point that instead of trying to explain the freedom

452
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:17,080
explain the fact that you're technically a slave to the product the products okay

453
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,320
wimpy go ahead take your shot so you think fire TV and freedom there's

454
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,760
intersection here you're ready to defend it go no I'm not going to defend it what

455
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,200
I was going to say is that for me the fire TV is a convenient device because

456
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,200
it was inexpensive and I can plug it in and it works and it does what I need it

457
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:46,760
to do but if I needed to exercise my freedoms then I'm perfectly capable of

458
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:56,440
building a XBMC or Cody set-top box using a Raspberry Pi and streaming the

459
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,920
content over NFS from a server in the house so I have I have my choices I've

460
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,320
just chosen convenience over protecting my freedoms in this case and let's not

461
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,880
forget the the content that I'm consuming on my fire TV or my XBMC Cody

462
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:23,040
box is proprietary and copyright and license encumbered anyway so all right

463
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:29,200
fair enough but a daredevil let me ask you this if those of us who have the

464
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,960
option to implement a free system don't elect to do it then who will and will

465
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,880
those options fade away long term here I mean I'm talking really big picture like

466
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:43,760
this is in a way the expression of human thought it is it is something that maybe

467
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,800
should be protected and if those of us who have the means to implement the

468
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,480
version that protects that thought for the future generations don't implement

469
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,080
those options daredevil I'm asking you don't we sort of condemn those options

470
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:03,320
yes but I feel that we have an option to still make a transition easier but

471
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,800
currently the tools that we have at our disposal have been really hard to push

472
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,560
to the public but there is a place that we're starting to get our feet in which

473
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,440
is into in government institutions because of cost and through this we can

474
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,960
influence a future road pad that actually makes sensible copyright law

475
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,880
that actually fixes the problem at its core not just you know we're still on

476
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,640
the fight corporations free software and sometimes the corporation is aligned

477
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:37,280
with us and then it gets fuzzy right well I feel that RMS RMS would disagree

478
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,080
with you so you are you sound like an optimist that's nice RMS would say no

479
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,080
it's not going to go that way in fact RMS says well our duty is is we have to

480
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:53,720
protest these come now and we have to fight back for instance we have to

481
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,520
protest whenever the representatives of the companies that mistreat people show

482
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:06,800
up to speak recruit or whatever if there's an Apple or Microsoft or Adobe

483
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:14,600
or etc recruiting team coming to your university well organize a protest and

484
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:25,920
teach explain to people why it why that company is doing harm so popiah I know

485
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,840
this is maybe a point that you might have contention with do you think the

486
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,080
appropriate way to express this is through protesting like the Apple genius

487
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:38,960
by yeah well yeah I have I mean you've obviously poked something there where I

488
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:47,160
I have I I don't like some of the the means by which this is done I think the

489
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,320
positive way to do things is to write good software write good free software

490
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:58,120
to continually berate companies that make proprietary software I don't isn't

491
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,560
working I don't think it ever has really worked I think what has worked is

492
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,320
producing great alternatives to proprietary software in the form of free

493
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:15,720
software hmm and how do you also market that software well and yeah honestly it

494
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,240
even fails the core our economic economies are based on intellectual

495
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,120
property the real exports of nowadays modern societies is intellectual

496
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,400
property if you don't fix it in a way that incentivizes business to move away

497
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,480
from that direction then you're killing yourself it's not just asking to the

498
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,480
corporations to stop it's asking the country to stop and that doesn't make

499
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,600
sense to anybody so that I feel that there needs to be a tangible way to make

500
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,760
a transition if you don't offer a transition to people they won't care

501
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,640
because they will look at the benefits of these proprietary software and

502
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,200
actually discard some of the inconveniences right we need to teach

503
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,000
people in one hand but at the same time we need to provide a transitional and

504
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
not just with quality software because quality software can be transformed into

505
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,280
proprietary look at PSD license for example explicitly allows this and I

506
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,680
feel that if you don't fix the core issues you're going to run into them

507
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,440
later or sooner it doesn't matter you will run into them RMS would argue that

508
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,600
I think it needs to begin with the individual developer at the end of the

509
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,840
talkie to the Q&A and the question came up well what if I want to make money

510
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,800
might like to make living out of selling their software so which business model

511
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,420
would you okay the first question is they might point is they might like to

512
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,520
do that but if they but that doesn't justify or excuse doing it in an

513
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,800
unethical way proprietary software is an injustice they shouldn't do that but

514
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,880
there are there are many free software business models like there is selling

515
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,360
support there is constructing custom solutions paid by the clients you can

516
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,960
deliver the solution is free software the clients still gonna have to pay there

517
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,520
is crowdfunding there's just plain asking for donations there's a new

518
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,440
package called Lily pond for editing musical scores and the maintainer gets

519
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,000
enough money just from users that are happy and send it there are others as

520
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,920
well there are big companies that fund development of useful free software

521
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,800
governments fund a lot especially in Europe so yes there are ways to do this

522
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:32,040
but if you don't find one that doesn't excuse non free software next so that's

523
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,120
a pretty radical stance and I think that's where it starts to lose the

524
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,920
message with a lot of people dare W have any follow-up thoughts on that yes and

525
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,560
this is as a software developer I have to agree you can actually because your

526
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,880
client especially when it's a client that doesn't have the technical

527
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,000
understanding you can claim that this is the appropriate way of doing and I work

528
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,560
on my own bucket so I can decide these things but I understand that the models

529
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,600
and the great companies currently didn't weren't like in you United States you

530
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:09,120
have a red hat and we here kind of have open Sousa right so Sousa but it's still

531
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:14,480
around of a hybrid model you still have canonical it's still a hybrid model so

532
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,280
there has some some benefits on the hybrid model otherwise it wouldn't be

533
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,720
the selected model right so unless there is a fix on the policy I don't think

534
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:33,240
there will be not even a fight that will actually make a dent in solving the

535
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,400
issue we as developers we can bring up but most of us can actually argue that

536
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,360
we're already doing free software for the companies we give our copyright to

537
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,240
the company that paid us so as developers are really doing committing a

538
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,160
crime perhaps the company model is but at that point is like me saying I'm

539
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,600
going to enforce anyone that's got my software do not use it somewhere else

540
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,840
like yeah can I just interject yes and point out that this isn't actually an

541
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,840
abstract argument because what RMS is talking about is a framework of social

542
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,640
justice that is around software but is in terms of technology that we're using

543
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,840
now for technology that we can be more important to us in the future things

544
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:22,640
like you know heart pacemakers care I know smarter TV smart cars exactly now

545
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,880
the point is okay how ethical is it for someone like a right to not be have

546
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,640
access to the safety aspects of those devices to make sure that they are safe

547
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,560
for them okay when some company decides care out to look up a care right and

548
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,240
throw their key I look at it from a completely different perspective from

549
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,320
that too I look at it from a 200 year perspective I try to think ahead and I

550
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,800
try to think looking back at our history and our creations if these things are

551
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,200
locked away behind these proprietary licenses and walls in the long term

552
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,880
they're a loss they don't they don't better the whole which is kind of sad

553
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,280
well it is human nature to share things I mean the whole point about proprietary

554
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,280
stuff okay is that you know when man discovered a fire okay wasn't something

555
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,320
he hoarded himself care right and kept for himself right there's a question

556
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,360
okay you know everyone who benefited from the idea of care from you know

557
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,320
making fire that's because inherently okay it's a human nature okay to swap

558
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,800
ideas going to discuss and two things it's this in sort of you know

559
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,200
commercialistic aspect okay that's made us sort of very it is against human

560
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,000
nature like that's why I think a lot of people get into software like on the

561
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,400
commercial desktops I think that's why a lot of people get into piracy I think

562
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,560
that's why a lot of people share stuff before I knew about music piracy I was

563
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,120
making mixed tapes with friends and we were sharing them I didn't know that was

564
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,040
stealing music that was just sharing something I liked with my friends oh

565
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,320
hell back in 1982 okay I was sharing all these spectrum games on tapes and

566
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,840
everything yeah very much so very much so so the whole talk is linked in the

567
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,600
show notes if you want to check it out one thing is is you know the message is

568
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,480
always very strong and then if you think about a little bit sometimes you get to

569
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,920
the truth underneath it I'll tell you about the truth of my savings that's

570
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,400
ting go to linux.ting.com sponsor of the Linux unplugged show and now I have

571
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,080
turned the corner on my two years with tang and what's well yeah I know I know

572
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,160
it's awesome and it's great because I've only paid for what I use I've got no

573
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,760
contract nor the termination fee and remember ting's got that savings

574
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,160
calculator so if you're noodling around how much you would save go put in your

575
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,600
actual monthly usage so how many you make a lot of calls let's say you make

576
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,160
and let's say you make a hundred minutes I doubt it I doubt it do you even talk

577
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,640
on the phone for an hour let's let's say 60 minutes go you know let's say you do

578
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,860
let's say 80 minutes because you know grandma called text messages you know

579
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,800
you get that damn SMS system that goes off accidentally because something went

580
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,600
off on your alert system so you get 300 text messages let's say but normally you

581
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,840
don't but let's just say this this month you got a lot of text messages and

582
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,080
megabytes used because then you had to go log into the remote GUI to disable

583
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,120
the alerts and of course it downloads all those damn graphs every time you

584
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,520
have to do it let's say you used 800 megabytes so I don't so you know what

585
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,720
you used a gig it was a really bad month because your job sucks so now what was

586
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,100
your bill because you're in a contract right if it's bill if your bills like

587
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,000
mine let's say it's 130 bucks all right you go calculate your savings just go

588
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,960
see what you do now depending on your usage these numbers will change so go

589
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,680
over to the ting calculator and try it out but boom over a two-year period if

590
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,760
you're like Chris and you're at your team you're making you're just passing

591
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,600
the two-year mark two thousand three hundred and twenty eight dollars saved

592
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,300
over two years by switching to ting and ting is just starting to get better not

593
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,720
only do they have an early termination relief program no hold customer service

594
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:41,120
an incredible dashboard but ting is also going to GSM in February will you be

595
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,320
able to see them at CDMA and GSM under one account and one of the things I love

596
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:51,320
about ting is they've always got your back this model allows for them to be

597
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:56,560
unlike any other carrier and so one of their series they have on their blog now

598
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,840
the ting tip and the first one in the ting tip is reducing your data usage in

599
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,680
Google Chrome so if you use Chrome on Android like I've been using I like

600
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,480
Firefox 2 on Android but I've been using Chrome more they have a step-by-step

601
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,600
process with nice animated gifs so our gifts whatever you want so you can just

602
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,240
go they don't have flash come on right you're not an animal plus it works on

603
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,880
your mobile this way and you go in you go through these settings and they'll

604
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,280
talk to you about how do you do reduce data usage on Chrome the ting blog is

605
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,880
always featuring really great stuff app pics stuff about their GSM coverage and

606
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,200
now these the ting tips to help reduce data usage yeah the mobile carrier is

607
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,200
writing up great how-to's to save data and by the way you don't have to be a

608
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,160
ting customer obviously to take advantage of these tips but it's pretty

609
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,280
cool that things put them out there so go to the linux.ting.com linux.ting.com

610
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:50,160
it's linux l-i-n-u-x I'm sorry gnu linux was already taken we couldn't we

611
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,800
couldn't use that one so it's just linux.ting.com they'll take $25 off your

612
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,360
first ting device if you got a ting compatible device guess what you got one

613
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,960
you can just bring with you they're gonna give you $25 of credits would

614
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,040
probably pay for your first month oh ting it's pretty great linux.ting.com

615
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:09,360
and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the linux unplugged show so one of the

616
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,200
things we noticed colonel linux and I when we're at these events is there in a

617
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:19,600
wash of Mac books it is gross it is full of Mac books so we're gonna talk a

618
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,520
little bit about this and I want to say at the beginning of the segment if

619
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,640
you're listening to this show and Mac OS X works for you and the Mac hardware

620
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,920
works for you no judging good for you I have no problems with that this is not

621
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,560
going to be an attack on your choices if I acknowledge that for many it works

622
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:42,680
probably many so I want to just disclaim that right now this is not an attack on

623
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:48,040
those of you who choose to use the Mac but I made the prediction in our

624
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,280
predictions episode that I felt like people are gonna start getting really

625
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,800
burned out with Mac OS 10 the quality isn't so good you start to feel the

626
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:01,800
walls of the sandbox pretty quick and you kind of get tired and burned out on

627
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,360
what I call like it's it's I don't have a great term for it but I think of it as

628
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,600
like the marketing debt of OS 10 like there's a there is a direction that

629
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,280
Apple as a company is going in and in order to make the whole product line

630
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,760
look like it's going in that direction Apple will unnecessarily do things to OS

631
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,280
10 to fit that like you know all of a sudden rebranding the way it looks with

632
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,880
unneeded transparencies that slow it down or yearly release cycles that way it

633
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,200
feels like your phone's firmware and you think of it as a firmware not an OS

634
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,000
release and in the meantime they don't have enough time to do Q&A these kinds

635
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,360
of things I feel like will begin to grate on people so that's where we begin

636
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:46,640
today Marco Armit who is he was a guy that originally wrote tumblr he created

637
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,920
Instagram he's the current developer of overcast he hosts the podcast accidental

638
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,200
tech podcast and he used to be the publisher of the magazine and he's one

639
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:02,120
of the top sellers in the iOS App Store and he wrote on his blog over the

640
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,120
weekend that Apple has lost the functional high ground that Apple's

641
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:11,000
hardware while great met does not is not matched in OS quality in fact he goes on

642
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,640
to say that it's gotten pretty bad and he goes on to cite that a recent

643
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,480
developer a well-known developer who's switching to the Linux desktop so Marco's

644
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,200
argument here is that essentially what my prediction was is that Apple's

645
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,020
marketing is pushing the OS in directions and at a pace that they

646
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:30,200
cannot sustain internally development wise that the quality has been on a

647
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:35,480
rapid decline in fact word-for-word he says I suspect the rapid decline of

648
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,240
Apple software is a sign that the marketing is too high a priority at

649
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:43,640
Apple today this is a long-term Apple developer who makes his money on the

650
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,120
Apple platform saying this not Chris this is not Chris saying this this is

651
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:52,000
Marco saying this and I think that's remarkable and this also comes just

652
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,680
after Jeff Wozniak or geoff Wozniak I'm not sure how you say his name 10 year

653
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,760
developer of OS 10 switch to Linux in late 2014 and he says it was the best

654
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,560
tech decision he made all year he says he started using OS 10 in 2005 when OS 10

655
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:12,560
was at version 10.4 Tiger he was having troubles with Linux and he moved over to

656
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:17,840
OS 10 he was happy as up to OS 10.6 snow leopard thought it was pretty good then

657
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,960
things started to show up that he didn't like an OS 10.7 features like launchpad

658
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,960
that didn't really resonate with him and as things progressed he became

659
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,720
increasingly annoyed and disconnected with the environment he said he found

660
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,400
he'd stopped using the majority of the primary apps that shipped with OS 10

661
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,320
like mail Safari iTunes and the Apple creativity apps like the iLife suite for

662
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,880
the more for the most part he says he ran essentially Firefox mailmate and a

663
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,840
terminal most of his work was done in terminals the culture of the operating

664
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,560
system at this point was more about sharing than it was personal

665
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,480
productivity in short he says I was working against the grain of the

666
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,640
environment I was working against the grain of the environment I was in a

667
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:00,120
gradual transition but OS 10 it went from a useful tool that got my work done

668
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,520
to obnoxious ecosystem that I no longer wanted to be part of he goes on to talk

669
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,280
about how it was daunting that there was a complete lack of transparency in

670
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,880
future software development and a decline in quality as he perceived it

671
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,040
which makes it a tenuous relationship when you're using as your development

672
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,960
platform and then he says 10.10 Yosemite hit the upgrade was egregious he says

673
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,360
messages in 10.10 is a complete shit show it's a stunning regression he says

674
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,640
at this point my default position on Apple software and OS 10 has moved from

675
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,520
probably good to probably not okay they seem more interested in pumping out

676
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,720
quantity by the way of upgrades it's death by it's death by a thousand cuts

677
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,400
but it's death nonetheless he says I came to realization I was

678
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,540
frustrated disappointed by OS 10 and I didn't see it getting better so I quit

679
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:52,800
now he goes on to admit I've gone back to running Linux and I consider it

680
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,120
somewhat inferior if not markedly inferior to OS 10 OS 10 in terms of

681
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,920
usability but it feels like a personal computer again I'm enjoying the

682
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,440
experience and look forward to working with it even if it's a monumental pain

683
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:13,280
in the ass and then he links to Paul's audio yeah you know that was probably

684
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,120
the most truthful article I've heard in a long time because he nailed it at the

685
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:21,440
end he nailed it in the middle yeah ten-year developer on OS 10 plus you've

686
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,480
got Marco arm at one of the top iOS developers now to top it all off panic

687
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,280
one of the longest time developers for the mac OS platform panic one of the

688
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,000
biggest independent development shops for OS 10 one of the most respected and

689
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,640
well-known creators of iOS apps and OS 10 applications did a year-end post and

690
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,040
they talked about the challenges in this 2014 review iOS upgrades they talked

691
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:52,040
about how iOS upgrades have not been very well done they talked about how

692
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,720
they had to leave the Mac App Store they say that it hasn't been going very well

693
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,580
in the Mac App Store and that sales the sales after leaving didn't suffer they

694
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:05,400
talked about the app review process being atrocious but here's the most

695
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:13,080
devastating number of all they break down their sales 51% of panic sales are

696
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:22,240
on iOS 49% of panic sales are on the Mac okay 51 on iOS 49 on the Mac but

697
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:32,520
revenue only 17% on iOS 83% on the Mac even though they sell more on iOS they

698
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:38,520
make dramatically less money which I believe a lot of developers are learning

699
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,280
about the whole entire Mac ecosystem and the whole premise of getting developers

700
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,320
to buy these Mac books to get Xcode to get a Mac is so they can get in this app

701
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:54,680
store this gold mine but these are top-tier Apple developers top-tier Apple

702
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,880
developers saying it doesn't make economic sense they say iOS represents

703
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,560
just 17% of our total revenue despite selling more than half of our total unit

704
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:10,600
sales that's huge it's part of this crazy huge mobile users won't pay enough

705
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,640
money but there's a lot of problems there so I think you know this this

706
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,440
promise of the App Store has pushed a lot of people to buy Macs but this

707
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,680
promise seems to be flopping on its face you've got these prominent developers

708
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,880
that are saying look at these things aren't right quality's down I lay they

709
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,360
Marco Armand his post says the stuff that we used to give Windows users a

710
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,760
hard time about like we've got no room to talk Windows is getting nice and

711
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,040
stable meanwhile our crap can't run very well and I totally concur with that like

712
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:44,640
you know we just upgraded the Wirecast system to Mavericks which is 10.9 even

713
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,280
though 10.10 is out because the quality of the releases takes about a year

714
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,840
before they're usable in a high production workload it's getting pretty

715
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:57,960
bad so I wonder is Linux in a good position to pick up this mess because

716
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,040
it's gonna get pretty bad before people are gonna switch and that could take a

717
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,200
little while and legitimately so Windows 10 isn't that far away right I mean

718
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,920
Windows 10 is a couple years away they're gonna have a really strong

719
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,640
message especially to power users as yours looking pretty good people could

720
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,600
want to get in on that Matt do you think Linux is in a position to pick up some

721
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,040
of these what about these folks who switch to the Mac that might be

722
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,680
switching back do you think we're in a position are we ready for that I think

723
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,800
so I well let me let me preface that yes and no yes in that we have the

724
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,320
bare-bones stuff necessary to make this happen yes it's absolutely in existence

725
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,880
if we could actually get I don't know the word out beyond the echo chamber

726
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,560
that would be an amazing thing that's yet to happen I hope it does that's what

727
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,680
needs to happen and where Microsoft will be picking up the pieces if we don't get

728
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,200
you know our heads out of our butts and get that happening if we get the word

729
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,280
out hey there is an alternative you guys should check this out then get some of

730
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,560
these developers to actually you know utilize it and then share the software I

731
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:57,000
don't know developed for Linux you know as an option I think we might actually

732
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,240
see a shift but until that happens you know I think that we're gonna

733
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,880
perpetuate this the usual circle jerk I really do well and I said here's a case

734
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,320
set up here's a case study Michael Dominic co-host of the quarter radio

735
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,760
program yeah longtime Mac developer hadn't needed a second workstation and

736
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:20,080
he grabbed a Dell laptop and our desktop I'm not sure and he installed Ubuntu

737
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:25,040
Mate 1404 edition that Wimby and team have put out and for him he says you

738
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,200
know at the end of day Chrome is Chrome sublime text is sublime text and I need

739
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,480
a terminal and I was able to get all of the work done I needed to do on this

740
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,360
machine and I think that's significant I think it is so I think that to further

741
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,000
preface this even more for developers absolutely we'll see a shift I don't

742
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,560
think there's any question of that I think where we're gonna continue to

743
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:48,040
fall down those that they're gonna be using Linux boxes to make software for

744
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,400
Windows and they're gonna be using Linux boxes to make software for you know for

745
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,740
other platforms and probably a lot of mold and web services big time on web

746
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,200
services I don't see anything really happening on the Linux desktop and and

747
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,400
that's sad no I mean as far as the developers that are actually developing

748
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,680
for it yeah they're doing their thing but as far as the big migration that

749
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,880
we're hoping for no one if I go outside and scream hey I'm using Linux no one

750
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,000
has any idea what I'm talking about I mean that's not changing we don't

751
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,320
actually get out there and change that we talk about it but no one actually

752
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,400
doesn't well and if we're just looking if we're just looking at the high-end

753
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,600
technical users the users that are looking for an exodus from the Mac

754
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,240
platform wimpy make me feel better are you saying you're seeing a pretty good

755
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:31,920
percentage of Mac hardware yeah within the Ubuntu Marte community I was really

756
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,720
surprised at how many people there are that are using Mac hardware and that's

757
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:44,120
a mixture of Intel Mac books is that what they're called I don't know I've

758
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:52,840
never seen one somebody somebody in the community has put together a power PC

759
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:58,620
build of Ubuntu Marte which runs on the the you know iBooks the g4s and what

760
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:04,840
have you so I'm actually working with them to try and improve that so I when

761
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,160
when I had some hardware difficulties that some of the Jupiter broadcasting

762
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:14,000
community helped solve for Ubuntu Marte and this is things like UAFI because

763
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,800
again I've never seen one of those whatever a UFA is it most of the people

764
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,520
that volunteered to help were running Mac books of some description yeah I've

765
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,000
gotten emails from folks on Mac books on power PC MacBook specifically saying

766
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,040
they're doing Mate edition I had I had 30 people participate in the testing and

767
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:39,360
the feedback and 24 of them were on Mac hardware and this was in the real early

768
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,560
days of Ubuntu Marte when it was in the alphas and I was genuinely surprised by

769
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,720
that and of course what they do is they stick plank or doki on it and they

770
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:56,040
recreate a Mac OS 10 type workflow because you know Mac OS 10 is a

771
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:02,160
traditional desktop by and large right Colonel Linux this is why we've got to

772
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,880
make Linux work better on the MacBook hardware don't you think I think that's

773
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,520
a I think that's a great first step but it it that won't entirely solve the

774
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:15,120
problem because if you had if let's just say everyone let's just say we have a

775
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,600
max exodus from the max and everyone comes over to Linux and now everyone

776
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,160
installs Linux on their MacBook that's a great first step but when those people

777
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,520
go out to buy a new computer it can't be a MacBook again if they go out and buy a

778
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,600
MacBook again they continue to give Apple their money and they continue to

779
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:33,080
put Linux on it then Apple can then then Apple continues to win they continue to

780
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,000
they're gonna continue putting what's what's the difference if I buy a Lenovo

781
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,520
with Windows on nothing nothing but but that and that's where things like system

782
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:45,240
76 where the Librem laptop come in is where where you're not supporting

783
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,600
Microsoft by buying a Lenovo laptop or where you're not supporting Apple by

784
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:53,920
buying a MacBook although I will throw this in there I think that Apple goes a

785
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,280
lot further out of their way to make it difficult to run alternate operating

786
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,560
systems on their computer than than Lenovo does with with Windows Lenovo

787
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,560
would more than happily sell Linux on their laptops that people were willing

788
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,560
to pay for it I don't know that Apple feels the same way sure although I would

789
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:14,120
I would argue that we've solved greater challenges and also I think you know

790
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:18,040
obviously what you say is ideal like if you know we get hardware that was ready

791
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,280
to go with Linux that'd be amazing in the stores that'd be great the reality

792
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,200
is the store experience is awful it's only getting worse and the Apple stores

793
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,720
are better than going to Best Buy to buy hardware from a consumer standpoint so

794
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,800
that's where they're gonna go and I think it's impractical if we don't

795
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:38,480
assume that not only is the MacBook appealing but that Apple is not standing

796
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,840
still they're gonna make better newer MacBooks like there's a rumor right now

797
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:46,800
that there's the next MacBook will only have one connector USB the new USB

798
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:52,240
reversible C connector one connector one connector you guys okay I don't know if

799
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,880
that's true or not but you could see a world where that happens and you know

800
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,920
what it's still gonna sell the reality is it's still gonna sell and if Linux

801
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:04,160
isn't there for it it's our loss yeah that's true you know and I also think

802
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,520
that you talked about that single connector you can guarantee there's

803
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,200
gonna be lots of add-on connectors so that you can adaptively connect other

804
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:16,820
legacy devices and whatnot yeah poppy did you see Lenovo's new x1 carbon

805
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:24,520
announced at CES yeah and the new x2 x0 series you know the 220 230 240

806
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:29,400
looks like they've gone back to the proper keyboard mm-hmm not the stupid

807
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:36,720
one that was on the x1 8 gigabyte max RAM yeah yeah which is stupid yes yes

808
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,080
yes no good that's entry-level these days really isn't it yeah yes I've got

809
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:45,400
virtual machines three doubles I have to get here okay go ahead so first I

810
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,800
boycott Apple products but to me this seems like it's possibly clinging to a

811
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,680
single example in order to move an opinion that this community tends to

812
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,360
lean toward other other examples I would say it was actually three examples but

813
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:07,400
yeah meeting to the fact that there was you know a caveat that their product was

814
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:12,760
aimed more towards power users which iPhone and iPad other similar mobiles

815
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,400
aren't you know what it really is I have a gut sense that I have a gut sense

816
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:22,840
that because when I have to sit down and use OS 10 I become very aware of

817
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,120
certain limitations that I think to myself anybody anybody who's sitting

818
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,200
there that just has a job to do you know you don't give a crap about with the

819
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,080
with the rest of the with the company's big overarching goals are it's really

820
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:36,720
none of your crap you know that's why I think honestly Ubuntu Mate edition is so

821
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,840
appealing to so many people because it is it is the representation of the idea

822
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:46,320
of the classical desktop before the vendors vision altered what the desktop

823
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:51,000
must look like so that way it matched their bold Steve Jobs Ian vision and I

824
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,640
think people are rebelling against that and that's why there's such a strong

825
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:57,960
appeal to Ubuntu Mate I think that same sort of undercurrent where

826
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,440
you're in OS 10 you feel like you're going against the grain you feel like

827
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,380
it's it's in an ecosystem that's not used for you you don't want any of the

828
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:09,240
native apps that is something that that it transcends a lot of people like

829
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,040
that's something that I think a lot of people will feel over time so that's

830
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,320
where some of this comes from but what we're citing is three examples Marco

831
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:22,600
Armit the Georgia Wozniak or whatever his name was and panic which is a huge

832
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:27,520
development shop for Mac and iOS so it is arbitrary examples but it's three

833
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:32,360
pretty pretty solid examples as far as examples go so there but there is an

834
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,440
angle that I actually liked just to bring some light to which is it seems

835
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:41,240
that people are forgetting one of the things that made Apple as successful as

836
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,440
they are now is exactly that they didn't have functionality and someone could

837
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,480
make money out of making that functionality maybe they're abusing on

838
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,080
the removed functionality and the people using to build things there are feeling

839
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:58,480
that pain however that's exactly what gives the money in the first place is

840
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,760
that the platform is lacking functionality they provide a core basis

841
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,360
and they give you the grounds to start running and you start running and put

842
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,880
the functionality in and people buy that's why there's a market there what

843
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,520
actually makes it even difficult to get into Linux you have almost a version of

844
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:20,960
something always there and you have to be really good on the flip side did you

845
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,760
see that yesterday HP announced $180 stream PC that runs Windows it's like a

846
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,000
Chromebox for Windows and of course the number one question is how do you put

847
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,760
Linux on that and could that be maybe the ultimate new low-cost Windows

848
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,400
machine or Linux machine ships with Windows and like you know unfortunately

849
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,280
yes you're voting for Windows with that purchase but if you can pull it off and

850
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,640
make it a cheap Linux box that could be a nice little rig too I mean how much

851
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,400
better are you gonna get than some of the Intel looks especially the lower

852
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,400
priced ones like this it's just cheaper it's like $180 well I don't think they're

853
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,280
gonna risk selling this in Europe as many countries imply applied a law that

854
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,120
allows you to avoid the Microsoft X you don't know how will they feel about it

855
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:06,840
avoid it no I don't think so I don't Italy Italy hacks least by its Supreme

856
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,840
Court ruled out that you cannot charge for the OS if the user rejects the

857
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:16,600
license so they actually have to refund Windows a few stories yeah I've heard a

858
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:20,160
few stories which actually works too which is really cool that's really

859
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,640
without it mr. corpse am I correct in in in

860
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,360
remembering that we have an interview with a mattei developer this weekend on

861
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:34,040
the Linux action show yes Stefano will be there well hey wimpy who is who is

862
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,400
Stefano will you tell the audience Stefano is the lead developer and

863
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,840
project lead for the Marte desktop and what should I ask him and he got you got

864
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:48,960
any burning questions oh boy I don't know ask him anything you like okay ask

865
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,320
him anything you like that'll be on Sunday's live access he's a super bloke

866
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,600
very friendly I'm looking forward to it a lot so and I think he's got good

867
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,320
timing alright well so that'll wrap up this week's episode of Linux unplugged

868
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,960
we've got links to the articles and blog posts that we discuss if you'd like to

869
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,120
read the numbers over for yourself you can find them in the show notes and of

870

tuning in this week's episode of unplugged see you next Tuesday

881
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:30,040
I wasn't gonna put in the show but you know where all these Mac users are

882
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:34,160
switching to don't you don't don't don't even doubt it they're switching to arch

883
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:40,200
and gnome 3 ah don't don't doubt it don't doubt it it's happening if our

884
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:45,600
Linux is to be believed at least according to the most recent package

885
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:50,120
survey stats for the Arch Linux project Firefox comes in at the number one

886
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,520
browser chromium comes in at number two nano is the number one editor VI at

887
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:59,160
number two the number one desktop on Arch Linux gnome 3 followed very closely

888
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:06,400
by KDE, XFCE, Cinnamon, LXDE, Mate and Enlightenment number one file manager no

889
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:15,800
not files or Nautilus since gnome nope then are there you go I wonder how

890
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:20,560
they're measuring that though I might have to dig into the gutter together yeah

891
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,680
you have to have the you have to have that voluntary I forget it's like Pac

892
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,800
Man stats or something like that there's like a standard yeah well there's two

893
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:31,120
things there's first of all you need that stats package installed which is

894
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:36,080
like the popularity contest on Debian and Ubuntu but also you have to nominate a

895
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:43,640
package that represents that something is installed so if Thunar is the

896
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:49,600
largest user base of file manager that kind of implies that XFCE is therefore

897
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:54,520
the largest desktop deployment and that could it be that what they're using to

898
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:59,280
measure the gnome shell installs is actually some generic thing very

899
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,120
possible would have on the system people just prefer Thunar because I kind of

900
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:10,560
prefer it who want it for the look like the lowest you know resources so they

901
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,760
feel like they're telling window managers like I well and here's why I

902
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,040
think it might have a leg up because definitely if I'm using KDE I'm

903
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:22,560
mandatory of Thunar because if I'm gonna connect to any SMB share I want that as

904
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,880
a GVS mount I do not like the way Dolphin handles SMB shares so the minute

905
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,720
I go do anything on my network I fire up Thunar so I think a lot of KDE desktops

906
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,280
probably use it for that reason too because it's a really easy way to get

907
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:43,360
you know a Samba mount on your SFTP master race yeah Eric is mobile and

908
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:49,280
opinionated JBtitles.com JBtitles.com everybody both see you mentioned that HP

909
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:53,800
device that was released earlier today yeah the steam PC or the stream PC

910
01:08:53,800 --> 01:09:02,320
sorry yeah this stream it is ugly ooh I like proprietary Exodus did you see

911
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:06,880
there did you see the silver and white one yeah that's still ugly yeah yeah it

912
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:13,040
does yeah it does you not order them with no OS installed from HP I don't

913
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,200
know no no no not these no not these stream PCs because I think Microsoft is

914
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:21,320
subsidizing part of the cost subsidy okay that's right yeah we've got a local

915
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:27,040
local computer vendor that sells the the genuine Intel NUCs and also like the

916
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:34,320
the gigabyte pocket which is a NUC style device yeah and the box does that when

917
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:38,840
you open it it's weird but they'll sell them without licenses so you can buy it

918
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:43,600
with no operating system they'll send you a form which looks very official

919
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:49,360
which says that you you waive certain things and that you you waive all of

920
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:53,040
your technical support with them because you want no operating system but you

921
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,320
fill out this form and they'll send you the stuff with no iOS on it that's cool

922
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:03,280
this thing is actually good on a Celeron so yeah anything you want well yeah how

923
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,760
do they lock you into it that's the question what are they doing to get you

924
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,440
to keep running Windows 8 there might be something I don't I don't like it I'm

925
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:14,520
probably missing something here but the seller on NUC is a hundred and forty

926
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:20,920
is it I thought it was I thought it was 200 no no 140 RAM is 22 bucks and you

927
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,040
can buy it you could use a compact flash cut 32 gigabyte compact flash card you

928
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,280
have the same thing except it's not you know it's not all pre-built it's not

929
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,000
from HP and the price is getting close but yeah I agree it doesn't look like

930
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,240
Tupperware I don't understand why the NUC doesn't sell more crazy I think I

931
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:42,720
think you got to put it together oh it's not that hard oh yeah people who are

932
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:46,320
buying are not gonna be wanting to do that yeah well okay you're buying them

933
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:50,000
like crazy at work let me put it to you this way anyone who's buying one of those

934
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,920
HP boxes to put Linux on it is it's gonna be easier to install RAM and a

935
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,000
hard drive and a NUC with the direction yeah way better it is to that's true by

936
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,560
that agent and then you can get out installing Linux on these things

937
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:14,320
probably know how to put a RAM and hard drive yeah well exactly
