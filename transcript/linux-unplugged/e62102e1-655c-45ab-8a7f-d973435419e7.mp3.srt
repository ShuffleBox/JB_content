1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
It seems there's a rumor floating around that Pop OS will soon be available for

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,200
the Raspberry Pi and maybe even other ARM devices.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,360
Yeah, Jeremy Siler of System76, as he does, sent out a teasing little tweet

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,040
with a cryptic link just to a folder this week.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,040
Hmm, yeah, and you go in there, and it looks like it's a build of Pop OS and

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,680
some of its packages for the ARM architecture, that's pretty cool.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,040
I mean, yeah, I'd love to try Pop OS on a Raspberry Pi, but

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,600
I'll be impressed when they get running on a launch keyboard.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:42,160
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,040
My name is Chris.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,960
My name is Wes.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Hello, Wes, check out my work and robe.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,200
Today is definitely a robe day in the Pacific Northwest.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,680
Yeah, but if you could just wear underwear.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,320
All right, I'll take that note.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,640
I'll take that feedback.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,840
Thank you, Wes, I appreciate it.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,760
This episode's brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,440
They are the leader in learning for Linux, Cloud, and other modern tech skills.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,880
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs, get certified.

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,560
Get hired, get learning at a CloudGuru.com.

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,840
Well, coming up on the show today, you know we love getting a fresh Linux computer,

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,240
probably a little too much.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,520
But if you're looking for the best performance on Linux today,

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,200
you might actually wanna buy a used computer.

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,160
We have run the numbers and done the tests.

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,400
And this week, we're gonna cover what to look for

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,720
in a used PC to get a blazing fast Linux desktop.

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,440
Plus, we're gonna chat about PipeWire's renewed focus on video.

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,360
There's some great news for AlmaLinux.

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,960
And we've got all the other goodies you've come to expect from your weekly

32
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,640
Linux talk show.

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,280
So before we go any further, it's time we say hello to a packed virtual lug.

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,440
Hello, mama room.

35
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,520
Hello.

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,440
Hello, everyone.

37
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,520
Namaskaram.

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,280
Hello, good to see some old friends in there and some new friends.

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,240
I mean, I say old to make some, I mean, it's good to see long-term friends.

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,840
And I'm trying to find something that doesn't make poppy and wimpy sound old.

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,120
But guys, welcome back to the show.

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,040
Thank you.

43
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,960
We are old.

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,120
My goodness, that's great.

45
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,920
Well, I'm very glad to have you here.

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,200
So let's start with PipeWire this week.

47
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,680
Now, we did cover some of the nuts and bolts of this in Linux Action News 209.

48
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,040
But here's the cliff notes of what you need to know for our chat today.

49
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,960
If you're not familiar with PipeWire, it's a modern audio and

50
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,160
video pipeline that's being developed for Linux.

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,880
It's shipping now, and it's been built on the shoulder of Giant.

52
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,040
So that means it works with your PulseAudio, also in Jack applications.

53
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,240
And it's already become an important part of delivering video for

54
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,800
a lot of X11 and Wayland users today as we talk about this.

55
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,840
But recently, when we talk about PipeWire,

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,120
we're generally discussing improvements in audio.

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,120
That's where the project's been focused a lot recently.

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,920
But with audio mostly solved and now just kind of waiting for

59
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,000
that trickle down to distributions,

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,720
it seems the PipeWire project is renewing the focus on video again.

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,400
And this time, they seem to aim several problems,

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,400
from improving kernel security to a critical one,

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,400
allowing more than one application to use a video device at once.

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,520
Christian Schaller joins us.

65
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,080
He's the director, I think, is it for desktop and graphics at Red Hat, Christian?

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,480
Yes, that's correct.

67
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,800
You have a long title, actually.

68
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,960
I was gonna read the whole thing, but I just went for concise.

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,440
Welcome back to the show.

70
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,160
Thank you.

71
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,080
Thank you for having me.

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,960
So Christian, I'm reading through the announcement about the new focus and

73
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,040
about aiming to solve video problems on Linux.

74
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,640
From a high level, can you kind of explain the core issue we have today with

75
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,800
webcams and cameras and connecting them to Linux and running multiple applications?

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,280
To just start why we decided that this was the time to do this was actually

77
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,480
triggered literally by our hardware partners sort of coming to us and saying,

78
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,800
hey, you guys are aware that starting probably next year,

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,080
you will have laptops coming out that uses this thing called a MIPI camera.

80
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,520
And the support in the Linux is not great at the moment.

81
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,480
That was actually the starting point.

82
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,000
That's a huge advantage that the vendor gave you that heads up.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,400
Yeah, no, it's something we've been focusing on here to build those close

84
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,440
vendor relationships so that instead of sort of Linux being that thing,

85
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,960
we're like, you know, new hardware comes out and I'm like, oh, shit,

86
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,440
this doesn't work, and trying to reverse engineer something.

87
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,800
It's kind of a big problem, too, isn't it, because it's multifaceted, right?

88
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,200
It's how applications currently get access to video resources on Linux.

89
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
That's an issue.

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,280
But additionally, there's sandboxed applications, more and more of them,

91
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,440
that also have some limitations on how they access hardware.

92
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,040
And then another problem, it sounds like, just from what you just said,

93
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,800
is the cameras themselves are about to get a lot more complex.

94
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,560
Yeah, exactly correct.

95
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,480
So I think triggered by the need to support this MIPI camera,

96
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,720
we also decided that this was a good time to revisit these other things we wanted

97
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,160
to resolve, like, you know, as you said, multi-camera access is a big one.

98
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,400
And also there are security aspects of it.

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,680
And at the moment, right, you need to basically have current access

100
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,720
to get a camera feed.

101
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,320
And we thought, like, we can fix this and make it more secure,

102
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,000
so that when we say an application is sandboxed, it is, you know,

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,040
generally sandboxed and not sort of pretend sandboxed.

104
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,760
Right.

105
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,920
And it seems like a huge part of this is getting developers on board

106
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,160
with how they address video devices in Linux.

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,440
And part of what you want to do is bring in a Pipewire plug-in to Gstreamer.

108
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,560
And application developers can use Gstreamer and that API

109
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,240
and avoid using the video for Linux to API directly.

110
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,600
Is that a correct assessment?

111
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,680
Yeah, that's correct.

112
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,360
Because, you know, the way we dealt with this on the audio side

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,920
was that we literally re-implemented both the Pulse Audio and the Jacky APIs

114
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,160
so that applications didn't have to change.

115
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,600
Unfortunately, for various reasons, this is not an option on the video side.

116
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,760
So we need to basically get application developers moved over.

117
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,600
And to be clear, application developers are perfectly free

118
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
to target Pipewire directly.

119
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,560
But I think, as I said, my blog, of course, if you are starting from scratch

120
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,240
writing and you go to media application more often than not,

121
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,720
I would say that you probably do the better off just using Gstreamer.

122
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,600
And then, of course, you get the Pipewire for free through Gstreamer.

123
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,680
So the plug-in architecture, which that doesn't...

124
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,120
That Pipewire plug-in for Gstreamer, does that actually exist today?

125
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,040
Yes, it does.

126
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,120
I mean, we have, of course, had a Pipewire plug-in for a long time.

127
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,840
But in some sense, it's sort of been verified to work for audio

128
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,280
and now we're making sure that it also works fully for video

129
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,280
and handles this new use case as we're refocusing.

130
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,720
Because, call it in theory, the support for Capture has been there for a while,

131
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,480
but we haven't sort of polished it up or made sure it worked well

132
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,320
or even had any test applications using it.

133
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,480
So that's what we're trying to make sure we put in place now

134
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,480
to make it all work and work correctly and perfectly.

135
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,880
You know, as we were going through this and reading through your great post,

136
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,400
one thing that kind of confused Chris and I at first,

137
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,640
because we weren't really familiar with Lib Camera before,

138
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,160
was exactly who's behind that and what's the relation between the folks working on Pipewire

139
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,360
and the people behind Lib Camera?

140
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,840
I'm not 100% sure on the backstory.

141
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,160
What I was told that it originally started out as a Chrome OS effort

142
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,920
and then it was sort of taken over as an Android effort.

143
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,600
And from what I understand today, there is a group of people working on it

144
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,440
with the aim of supporting Chrome OS, Android, and Linux.

145
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,600
So they were in some sense just ahead of us in terms of seeing that there was

146
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,080
limitations or challenges that was going to be hit with V4Linux API

147
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,760
and decided let's put together a nice user space library

148
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,960
to make it easier for developers to use these things.

149
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,120
And then we sort of said, hey, instead of trying to compete with them

150
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,040
or reinventing the wheel, let's just build on what they have already done

151
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,400
and just sort of make sure we expose that through Pipewire

152
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,880
and then add the future set of Pipewire on top of Lib Camera.

153
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,080
And it's not just Chrome OS, Lib Camera also has Android support as well, is that right?

154
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,880
Yes, correct.

155
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,480
And I think actually, I mean, as far as the product is actually funded

156
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,920
partially by Google for that reason.

157
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,840
So it's probably going to be around for a little while.

158
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
It's a good one to build on top of, I would imagine.

159
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,640
Yeah, that's great.

160
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,680
That's good.

161
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,000
When I read through this, what jumped out at me,

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,360
and maybe you can help me understand this is, and I'm no desktop Linux developer,

163
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,280
but it seems like it isn't quite yet clear how developers

164
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,160
who want to ship an application as a flat pack are going to use this.

165
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,040
Because it seems like there's a bit of a debate

166
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,840
if this should be like the function of the audio portal

167
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,720
or if this should be the function of Pipewire.

168
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,760
And Pipewire figures out if it's a sandbox application

169
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,680
and then figures out how to route that audio.

170
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,880
Can you shed any light on where that situation is at

171
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,800
and how it's going to impact developers writing desktop apps?

172
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,080
What we know for sure is that we won't bottle them, right?

173
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,040
We won't portal there in order to have a way to punch through the firewall

174
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,880
when the user allows for that.

175
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,600
But I guess what we're still trying to figure out

176
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,880
and try to put in the blog post too is that there's two ways of doing it.

177
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,880
One, telling application developers, you call out to the portal API,

178
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,920
and then you get Pipewire handled through that.

179
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,840
And then of course, you start interacting with Pipewire through it.

180
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,960
Or you could say, start by calling out to Pipewire

181
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,680
and Pipewire in the background tries to do the call out to the portal API.

182
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
Both approaches work.

183
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,760
We're just trying to figure out A, what creates the most consistent developer story

184
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,240
and what is also most convenient for people to use.

185
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,760
So yeah, so both are going to play a part.

186
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,760
We're still thinking hard about what is the best way

187
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,800
and trying to get feedback.

188
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,360
And I think maybe once we start working with cheese,

189
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,560
as we said, we're going to be a test application,

190
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,280
and for that matter with the browsers,

191
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,960
that might also help us inform us a little bit on exactly how we want to do that API setup.

192
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,520
That makes sense.

193
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,920
And it seems we're really on the precipice of something that...

194
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,400
I got to a point where I had accepted this was never going to exist for Linux.

195
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,040
Like I thought the Mac had this unified audio video API pipeline pretty well established.

196
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,760
Windows had its system that seems to work pretty well for them.

197
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,680
But Linux had all of these various components and projects

198
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,760
that didn't really work together.

199
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,360
And pipeline refocusing on video now that audio has been fairly solved

200
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,320
is actually the first chance I've seen of solving this problem in a super modern way

201
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,760
that is really unique and specific to Linux

202
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,560
without flushing everything that's been done before.

203
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,960
And so I know for this to fully work, you've got to get community buy-off.

204
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,680
You've got to get distribution maintainers to support this.

205
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
You've got to get open source projects to support this

206
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,480
and maybe even commercial developers to support this.

207
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,280
What is kind of your thought on how that kind of community participation can be achieved?

208
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,760
Because I think the PipeWire project has demonstrated a pretty good success rate

209
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,520
with getting audio community adoption.

210
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,720
But this is a whole other level of complexity.

211
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,240
Definitely.

212
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,440
And I mean, part of my hope here is that we can use our success on the audio

213
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,000
to convince people to work with us on the video side.

214
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,480
I mean, in some sense, of course, it was a lot easier on the audio side

215
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,760
because most people didn't have to do anything.

216
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,960
It was like, oh, hey, my Jack application actually works on PipeWire.

217
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,560
Holy shit.

218
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,440
So it was sort of like a free transition.

219
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
But this time, we need people to actually do porting of applications,

220
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,400
like they have to move away from using the video volumes API directly

221
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,880
and start targeting PipeWire somehow.

222
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,320
And that, of course, requires us to convince the community to go in.

223
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,960
And I think what we want to do, of course, is A, making sure that we provide a good API.

224
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,000
And B, we want to provide good examples, like I mentioned cheese,

225
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,360
that we're also going to be trying to patch in the web browsers as heavy consumers of this

226
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,320
to make sure that they work correctly with PipeWire.

227
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,400
And then hopefully, the long tail of applications will follow from there.

228
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,800
So that's where I guess fingers crossed that we hope to get the community

229
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,880
to really join in with us and help us make this transition.

230
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,600
And of course, I think due to, once again, the success on the audio side,

231
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,840
I'm sure PipeWire will be shipping in every distribution soonish.

232
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,720
And that will hopefully also make application developers less hesitant to target PipeWire

233
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,160
because they do know that it is everywhere and you can trust it to be there and available for you.

234
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,240
Well, what kind of timelines do you think end users might start seeing some of these benefits?

235
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,400
You know, I think the work on the audio side of PipeWire progressed a lot quicker than I thought.

236
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,160
And it sounds like from your post, maybe now is not quite the time for testing, but maybe sometime soon?

237
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,720
Yeah, I mean, we hope to, I think during, I mean, we sort of often in our planning think in terms of Fedora releases.

238
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,800
So I think from our point of view, we hope to start having maybe some of these things ready in Fedora 35.

239
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,320
I mean, not for the release of Fedora 35, but sort of during the lifecycle of Fedora 35.

240
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,040
And then for Fedora 36 is where I think you can start maybe, for instance, things being ready for application developers

241
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,840
to really start porting over and trying to use this new API and the way of working with things.

242
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,560
Wow, that's actually pretty quick.

243
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,200
That's that's wow.

244
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,040
Well, Christian, thank you for coming on and helping explain some of this.

245
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,320
And we'll be watching. We are huge advocates of this project.

246
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,600
And please also pass along our endless gratitude to Wim and all of his hard work for making this actually all come together.

247
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,240
And thank you for continuing to advocate and spread the word online about it.

248
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,240
So we have things we can read to help understand what the progress is.

249
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,160
I mean, the whole thing is it's huge for us as, you know, media production people that use Linux every single day.

250
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,960
So thank you so much and keep up the great work.

251
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,160
Thank you for having me on.

252
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,360
Onto an item that came out just a little bit before the show started today,

253
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,320
Alma Linux has announced that their foundation memberships are opening up to the public, and that seems like a great move.

254
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:21,440
If you don't remember, the Alma Linux Foundation is set up as a 501C6 nonprofit, which is the same model used by the Linux Foundation.

255
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:31,760
Individuals and organizations will now be eligible to vote for and be voted into the Alma Linux Foundation's board of directors, as well as participate in committees.

256
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:40,480
Jack, the Alma Linux mayor and cat herder over at the Alma Linux community joins us in the Mumble Room most weeks, sometimes in the quiet listening, sometimes in the main room.

257
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,000
And Jack, I'm just super impressed to see this.

258
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,480
I think this was a commitment that you made to us early on, and now we're actually seeing it delivered.

259
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,880
So why don't we jump right to the chase here?

260
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,480
What does this mean for end users?

261
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,760
Well, I think it means for the community.

262
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:04,000
This is the realization and the fulfillment of something that has been going on since, you know, since Santos was announced since 2004.

263
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,920
And I did a small blog post about this earlier today where the NTS part of Santos was always there.

264
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:21,080
And the technological bits were, you know, as good as you can get and arguably better than anything else that you could get.

265
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,160
But the community part was kind of lost along the way.

266
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:40,280
And I think that, you know, if the plan was from the get go, that there should be a distro such as this that had communal ownership, that had its own real foundation where everyone can participate and everyone has a voice.

267
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,120
I think that is what, you know, that is what we fulfilled today.

268
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:57,240
So it's kind of hard, especially for people who don't know the whole backstory here, to appreciate the context and what this means, especially those of us who maybe have come into a world where Santos always existed.

269
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:09,120
And so if we rewind and bring ourselves back in time, it was a revolutionary idea to take an enterprise commercial operating system and make a free version of it for the community.

270
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:18,720
That got a little messy and it never really, truly like like Jackson, it never truly lived up to its promise because ultimately it was bought and sold and moved around and it wasn't actually owned by the community.

271
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,920
And that became its Achilles heel.

272
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:33,600
The lesson we all learned was there is a place for something that is that is a quote unquote enterprise grade, which generally means it's built from one of the LTS, you know, long term supported distributions out there that have commercial Linux support.

273
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,120
Right. It's something that's enterprise grade that is going to be supported for a very long time that is run by the community.

274
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,560
And while it's not for everybody, it's definitely for a set of users.

275
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,080
Is that now true with this foundation in place with the fact that community members can join?

276
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:56,840
Is it true to say that that the cloud Linux company and those people that they could they could vanish and Alma Linux and the Alma Linux Foundation and the distribution continue on?

277
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,720
It's funny that you ask that because you're going to be seeing more information about that in the next, I would say, week.

278
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,640
But yes, I mean, companies can vanish from the picture.

279
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:17,360
And, you know, the foundation is here. Hopefully we get the sponsors to commit there.

280
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,320
And of course, you know, every foundation needs funds to continue.

281
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,480
I mean, right now we are thankfully funded comfortably and we hope that that'll continue.

282
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,440
But yeah, I mean, anyone can come and go and disappear.

283
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
But this thing is its own entity, you know, its own being.

284
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,760
And the community has control to take it in whatever direction they see fit.

285
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,520
That seems pretty huge. You know, I mean, I mean, I'm naive.

286
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,600
I know there's still a lot of people that were originally involved.

287
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,640
They're still involved. And that's all that's all whatever.

288
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:53,680
But the idea that this is now like it's not going to get sold around as a property, right?

289
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,960
It's not going to get built up to a big revenue stream with a large user base and then be sold to whoever wants to buy it at a certain price point.

290
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,240
That's pretty impressive. I say congratulations to you.

291
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,760
And I'm I note two things about this.

292
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,920
Number one, you said you guys were working towards this.

293
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,280
You delivered on that. And number two, you're showing up in our community.

294
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,400
You're participating in the community. You're here almost nearly every week.

295
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
You don't always have something to say, but you're here. You're participating.

296
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,320
You're truly invested at that level.

297
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:31,760
And that, I think, is another data point which people can assess when they're looking at, you know, which distribution they want to run for 10 years.

298
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,880
So, Jack, just, you know, congratulations, really.

299
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,320
And we'll have a link to the details. You guys have a good solid post up on your website that has more information.

300
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,480
I think this is a big milestone.

301
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,760
Thanks, Chris. And I just want to say one thing.

302
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,760
You know, the credit definitely doesn't go to us. And I want to put a big shout out there to everyone in the community that supported us,

303
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,760
that's used the stuff that we've put out, that's helped us, that sent pull requests, that's given us, you know, RFEs.

304
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,800
And that's given us just enhancements of all kinds, whether that's on the technical end,

305
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,840
whether that's on the governance end, whether that's on the graphical end, the community end.

306
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,000
I just, you know, the community deserves a huge thanks.

307
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,440
And whether or not people realize it, they've been a huge part of this.

308
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,520
And the people that that have done it know who they are.

309
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:35,680
And I just really, you know, I mean, everything from like cloud images, containers, like we put out so many containers and just this whole thing.

310
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,520
It really blossomed into a movement.

311
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:45,320
And I really want to thank everyone because it is you guys or you all that are making it what it is.

312
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,000
And I just I have a tremendous debt of gratitude to everyone for that.

313
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,280
Well, that's great. I echo all of that here.

314
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,160
Linode dot com slash unplugged. Go there and get one hundred dollars in credit for 60 days on your new account and you support the show.

315
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,640
Linode's where we host all of our stuff, the stuff you interact with, the back end services,

316
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,240
the things we use to make these shows possible, like our automated encoding and deployment system.

317
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,360
Yeah, it's on Linode. That's where we run it.

318
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,800
And we've even recently been experimenting with actually doing project rendering in Reaper up on Linode.

319
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,040
Right now, it's we're going to get to this in the show.

320
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:30,960
Actually, it's pretty hard to get a decently spec'd PC that we'd run in the studio that meets all of our requirements when it comes to noise and heat and CPU performance.

321
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,720
So why not just spin up a powerful Linode and run it there?

322
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,080
And with things like Web Top, it's pretty easy to get a desktop environment going on a Linux box.

323
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,080
There's limitations, of course. You don't have like the responsiveness.

324
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:49,640
But when you're just rendering a project, why keep investing in hardware here in the studio when I can fire up a Linode with tons of awesome AMD epic CPUs?

325
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,880
It's just, you know, and for you out there, when you get a one hundred dollar credit, you can mess around with stuff like that, too.

326
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,640
Their infrastructure is fast, too. That's one of the reasons we really stick with it. It's fast, it's reliable.

327
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:07,280
They have a great dashboard to give you just a snapshot of like if your system's working hard or what your memory usage is at, your CPU, your network transfer.

328
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,160
There's 11 data centers to choose from. So there's going to be something near you or your customer or your client.

329
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,440
They've got over probably a bajillion users. No, actually, I think it's about a million customers now.

330
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,840
They've been around for 18 years. That matters. You know, they've been around for 18 years and they've remained independent.

331
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:31,960
JB, you know, I'd be really proud to make it 18 years independent. I'm on my way. But a couple of those years, you know, I got to take off the calendar.

332
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:38,800
I just really am impressed by that, you know, like not taking the VC funding when you're watching all these other flyby hosting companies pop up.

333
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:46,480
Could you imagine the temptation but staying true to their mission of just making great Linux hosting and then refining the product to remain competitive with these other companies?

334
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:54,640
They're just getting cash dumped into them while keeping their pricing 30 to 50 percent lower than those cloud providers themselves. It's just it's so impressive.

335
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,240
And they started out as Linux geeks, too. So go check it out at Linode dot com slash unplugged.

336
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,400
Get one hundred dollars, play around, try this stuff out, build something, learn something.

337
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:11,560
I mean, it's just fun to play around with. It's a great experience. Linode dot com slash unplugged.

338
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,080
And we have a bit of housekeeping for you today. Thank you to our members at unplugged core dot com.

339
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,720
Some of the best bits of this show are in the live stream.

340
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:28,000
We did a breakdown of the Linus Tech Tips switch challenge that's going to be in the live stream, although I may also release that one as an extra at extra show.

341
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,800
But our members get access to the live version of the show, which has tons of additional content and all of our screw ups.

342
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,960
And they get access to a limited ad tight version. So maybe you got a shorter commute.

343
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,920
That's a great one for you and you're supporting the show.

344
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,920
So unplugged core dot com to become a member, support the show and get access to that.

345
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,720
If you got feedback, you got ideas, maybe something you want us to check out, we'd love to hear them.

346
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,240
Linux unplugged dot com slash contact. Also join our matrix community.

347
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,520
The new spaces have rolled out. They're beautiful, looking really good.

348
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,200
And you can join the fun and see what's happening over there at Linux unplugged dot com slash matrix.

349
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,880
But here's yet another reason. If you're a Python or Go developer, you know,

350
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,160
if you're familiar with either one of those stacks and you're looking for a job,

351
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,600
there's an open engineering position where there's several of them open at Red Hat right now.

352
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,800
Get in our matrix room and contact Link DuPont at Sub Pop in our matrix chat.

353
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,640
He's fielding those and he's looking for Python or Go software developers.

354
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,280
He's hanging out in the J.B. chat. Link DuPont at Sub Pop in there.

355
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,400
Get in touch with him. Maybe you could get a gig at Red Hat.

356
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,680
Don't miss our Luplug. That happens every Sunday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

357
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,240
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar to get it in your time zone.

358
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,400
And our Mumble server details are at Linux unplugged dot com slash Mumble.

359
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,920
It's a party in there. When I went out on the road, I talked to people and I said, you know,

360
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,320
they'd say, Chris, this is what they say, Wes. They'd say they'd say, Chris, there's no lug where I'm at.

361
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,080
You probably heard this, Wes. There's no lug. Oh, I heard that so many times.

362
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,040
And what do we say every single time, Wes?

363
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,840
We've got the virtual lug for you every gosh darn Sunday.

364
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,280
Gosh darn right. And Linux unplugged dot com slash Mumble has all the deets.

365
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,160
And then when you can, maybe you're home on a Tuesday.

366
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:21,120
Come join us in there. Hang out. Get your thoughts in the show.

367
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,200
Now, we all love getting a new computer.

368
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:30,040
I know I sure do. But these days, if you're looking for the best performance on Linux,

369
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:38,160
you might actually want to go used depending on what you expect to get done and how you have your work environment set up.

370
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:48,640
It could be that an older PC with the right design is actually faster under Linux than a brand new PC with the wrong strategy for how to use it.

371
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:56,920
And while it'd be great if you could spend a lot of money and be guaranteed a super fast desktop Linux experience,

372
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,360
our testing shows that's not always going to be the case.

373
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:08,200
And right now, maybe that's just fine. It's harder than ever to buy or build a new PC with high end parts right now.

374
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:17,400
I mean, AMD CEO Lisa Su said just recently that there's probably going to be a chip shortage all the way through some part of 2022.

375
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,200
I know I'd hoped the GPU shortage would end sometime and I could upgrade that old 1060 that I've got hanging around.

376
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,360
But it appears we might be stuck for a while. Might be time to dust off that old desktop.

377
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,240
Yeah, I think you're right. And man, that's bad.

378
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,240
If AMD is saying it's going to be at least until the first half of 2022 is over.

379
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,880
I wanted a new desktop or machine at the beginning of this year and I ended up going the laptop route.

380
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,680
You've got limited options right now, especially if you want something with Linux first support.

381
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:56,560
And so I received the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and I decided to use that as my new daily driver for a bit.

382
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,080
You know, it's a Linux first computer. Seems like you should have plenty of power to spare.

383
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,400
It's got Thunderbolt for external expansion, which I've already got several Thunderbolt devices.

384
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,560
There's open source upstream drivers for every major part. It's got a 10th gen Intel i7 CPU, NVMe storage.

385
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:17,560
I already own an eGPU with an AMD RX 570 in it, so I can just use that with this laptop.

386
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,120
I mean, I think on paper, Wes, it all looked pretty good. It all looks solid.

387
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:27,200
Yeah, I mean, you were buying this computer almost meant to run Linux in some ways, right?

388
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,800
It's like almost as close as a Linux first machine as you can get.

389
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,120
And I kind of recall you making a big fuss about getting it and totally switching over,

390
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,440
packing up that old desktop PC that you built with Noah way back when.

391
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,480
Yeah, I did. I looked up the parts for this episode because I thought we built it in 2017 and maybe we did.

392
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,720
But Intel considered my CPU end of life in 2014.

393
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,000
Oh, ouch.

394
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,360
Yeah, it was older than I remember. At least the parts were. And so I was done with it.

395
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,880
I just I wanted something that felt really, really pretty great and pretty fast because I had set up an ASUS gaming laptop for my son.

396
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,720
And it had a high refresh rate monitor and it was really pretty quick system.

397
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,320
And I'm like, I'd really like my desktop to feel like this.

398
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,880
And then I set off to find like the perfect Linux setup.

399
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,360
I thought I had found it. Well, yeah. Right. And this thing shipped with Fedora pre-installed.

400
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,440
All the drivers were upstream as you're talking about, like really should have been a best case for having a modern Linux setup.

401
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,080
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it has been pretty stable.

402
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,160
I'll give it that. You know, it's been nice. I can mess around with a lot of the latest stuff and everything's upstream.

403
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:39,080
Wayland works pretty good, but performance and usability, it has not been very good.

404
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,880
And I was shocked when I actually dug in and did some testing.

405
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:48,440
But I want to tell you before the results and how I actually ended up back on my old computer.

406
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,960
I want to tell you a little bit what I expected, I expected to have a machine that I would sit down at my desk with.

407
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:03,120
And, you know, after being mobile, connected to a Thunderbolt cable and then use a full size keyboard and mouse and a couple of monitors,

408
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,360
just as a daily driver, just sit down with the laptop, use it like that, maybe play a video game every now and then.

409
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,920
But for the most part, just basic terminal chat, web browsing, audio editing, that kind of stuff.

410
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,440
It's your office workstation machine. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

411
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,680
And, you know, sometimes I like to have a little fun with it.

412
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,440
But for the most part, I just wanted to be super rock solid, reliable and responsive.

413
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:34,880
And then at the end of the day, I liked the idea of unplugging the Thunderbolt cable, putting the laptop in my bag and taking my main machine home and having everything I really needed with me if I needed to use it on one monitor.

414
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,840
Or I eventually even opted to have a couple of monitors at home and set up another Thunderbolt set up there.

415
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,480
And, you know, I admit I made things a little challenging.

416
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,480
My external displays were 1440p resolution.

417
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,040
One of them is one hundred and forty four hertz.

418
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,680
The others rotated vertically.

419
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,720
So my external monitors were mixed refresh rates, you know, slightly challenging.

420
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,760
But what I ended up with was a substandard experience by any possible measurement.

421
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,560
And this is on X11, Wayland, Plasma, Gnome, Wayfire.

422
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,320
I mean, really, I'm just I tried everything.

423
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:18,520
If I have my external monitors hooked up and I put any windows on my external monitor, it was just awful input lag, awful glitchiness, dragging windows around.

424
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,560
I've complained about it in the pre show before.

425
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:29,040
And I mean, and God forbid the system was busy, it would just lag out worse and worse and it would manifest itself slightly differently.

426
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,640
If it was on Nome or Plasma or X11 or Wayland, like, you know, different kinds of performance characteristics.

427
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:47,080
But the core problem just seemed to be any time I was trying to share screen information between my Intel GPU and my AMD GPU, things just would go sideways.

428
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,320
And Neil, you and I were talking about this a little bit in the pre shows before.

429
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:57,960
It's like there's a perhaps like a fundamental plumbing issue happening here or or some kind of decision that's led to poor performance in the setup.

430
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:14,440
This is mostly because the way that things work in in the X world is all the displays are stitched together and synchronized to a larger virtual display head.

431
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:23,680
And so like if you have three or four or six monitors or whatever, they're all stitched together internally into one big virtual monitor.

432
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,360
And that's how everything gets rendered.

433
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,280
So the synchronization issues are taken care of.

434
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:36,440
Your monitors are already downgraded to the same refresh rate as your slowest monitor, so on and so on.

435
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:54,800
And so because of all that, moving things across displays becomes very fast because from its perspective, all it's doing is drawing on the pixels in the virtual representation and then mapping that back to the physical displays in the Wayland world.

436
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,920
That's not how it works.

437
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:07,080
Instead, each display, so each monitor is a separate surface with its own control, its own refresh rates, its own resolution, its own DPI, all those things.

438
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,160
This is good and bad.

439
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:17,440
So good in that now it means that your displays can actually operate at their native performance levels independently of each other.

440
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:27,040
But it's bad in that because there's no underlying synchronization, no virtual display underneath, none of that stuff that forces everything to be in sync.

441
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:35,120
Moving things across it and handling, you know, keeping things working, you know, stitched across displays is now very expensive.

442
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:43,800
It is certainly going to be an interesting challenge to see how this has improved over time, but it is definitely fixable for sure.

443
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:57,280
There are a number of strategies to do it, and I think one of the reasons why it didn't get tackled before now is because actually multi GPU just hasn't worked in Wayland because NVIDIA didn't work in Wayland very well in the first place.

444
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,400
Sure. Yeah. So I could see that kind of causing it not to get worked on, particularly until that was solved.

445
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,840
And in a way, funny enough, right, if I just got like a giant forty nine inch single screen, I probably would have been fine.

446
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,880
Absolutely. Especially if it was a like super high refresh rate one, you'd get all the benefits of it and it would just it were great.

447
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,880
But no one tells you that when you're buying hardware or trying to set up, you know, is there like a ultimate Linux workstation guide out there?

448
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,920
Not one that I found anyway. There should be. And I already own the monitors, too, when I bought this thing because I had them connected to my desktop.

449
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:33,360
So, you know, I I played around with various configs for months and, you know, like Wimpy will buy a really nice, powerful system.

450
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,720
He gets everything working just great and gets great results. So I'm not trying to take away from building brand new, powerful systems here.

451
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,400
But I got the combo wrong, even though I thought I knew all my, you know, all my specs and everything like that.

452
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:51,840
I got it wrong. And so because of the config that I chose to go with, I was suffering for months as I tinkered with this thing.

453
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,800
I mean, I I attempted to run all the monitors off the AMD GPU.

454
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,320
I attempted to run as much as I could off the Intel GPU.

455
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,760
I I could go with no monitors and things would be fine, but then I'd feel sad and feel like Linux couldn't live up to my, you know, use case.

456
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:11,880
And so I attempted to improve overall system performance just to reduce load that would cause things to lag out more.

457
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,120
So I tried attacking that route and I'll share some of those tips with you in a moment.

458
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:22,480
But about two weeks ago, guys, I just kind of gave up when I decided to put Fedora 35 on my ThinkPad.

459
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,000
I just said to myself, you know what, this is going to be a single monitor machine and it's not my daily driver,

460
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,480
although I actually ended up using it pretty much as such.

461
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,520
But anyways, I'm removing all the expectations that this is my main workstation.

462
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,840
This is just my portable machine now with a single screen.

463
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:45,080
And I took out my old 2014 era desktop, the unceremonious unboxing.

464
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:52,200
It's a nice seven. It's got like a one time upgraded AMD GPU in there now that's also an RX 570.

465
00:32:52,200 --> 00:33:00,720
And I dusted off quite literally and I just kind of connected all the monitors to it and re hooked everything back up to the to the machine.

466
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,240
And it had been since the beginning, I mean, since I got the ThinkPad, things just been sitting there collecting dust.

467
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,240
And I was kind of, you know, contemplating reusing it for maybe in the studio or I hadn't really decided what I wanted to do with it yet.

468
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,680
So I was kind of glad I still had it. I fired it up.

469
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:24,320
And of course, it's an old Endeavor OS install that I had put on there forever ago, like when Endeavor OS first came out, like, oh, yeah, right.

470
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,840
So I I do the update and sure enough, I mean, everything updated just fine.

471
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,800
And I rebooted and I had the latest plasma. I had the latest kernel. It was pretty good.

472
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,280
That's kind of just great, isn't it?

473
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:43,400
Wes, I have to tell you, man, like immediately on this old busted system, they've been sitting around collecting dust.

474
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,800
It was immediately noticeably faster with the multiple monitors and everything.

475
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Even just launching applications was faster than this brand new ThinkPad with, you know, a fast NVME storage.

476
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,080
I had to kind of think about this for a moment.

477
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:05,240
Like, why is this older machine in my use cases perceptually so much better than a brand new computer, essentially?

478
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,560
And I think it came down to fundamental architecture issues.

479
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:15,280
And, you know, the laptop had a hard time sharing information between the eGPU and the Intel GPU.

480
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,280
And I think it'd be true if it was two GPUs, one was Thunderbolt or not.

481
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:27,320
And I think also in terms of desktop usage, the laptop's single hard drive setup, its NVME disk.

482
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,400
Even though it's NVME, it still leads to I.O. contention sometimes.

483
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,920
And the Linux desktop, while better, doesn't really handle I.O. contention with grace.

484
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:45,400
And if you're also slamming the GPU and you're slamming the network at the same time, it would really leg out bad and desktop hardware.

485
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:53,960
You know, it's not only more capable in this area, but you're able to architect it in such a way that the disks can be set up,

486
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:01,560
maybe where you avoid I.O. contention and maybe maybe your PCI bus is such that there's more bandwidth.

487
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,200
And so, like in the case of my old desktop, I have a NVME boot disk.

488
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,840
It's small, but I recommend if you want decent performance on Linux, you go with a desktop and you go with multiple disks.

489
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,520
So I have like a 256 gigabyte NVME for my root.

490
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:24,240
I have a 500 gigabyte like Samsung Evo, 512 gigabyte Samsung Evo for my home.

491
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,640
It's not it's not like, you know, it's not a killer.

492
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,200
It's not something like screamer, but it works. Right. And then I have a RAID 0 of like three or four days.

493
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,920
I can't remember some old that I'll put my sync thing or my next cloud or my my editing scratch on or steam.

494
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,080
You know, any kind of process that might run in the background and need to write to disk a lot.

495
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,040
I move that over to that RAID 0.

496
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,720
Oh, yeah. Stuff you don't care about, stuff that's already backed up or synced elsewhere.

497
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:55,880
Yeah, you got it. You got it. And then then it sort of spreads out the workload across the disk.

498
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,840
And so there's not one disk that's generally responsible for everything.

499
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:08,640
And it allows for the package cache to be refreshed while I'm launching an application while sync thing is pulling down a large file.

500
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:16,880
And I don't experience any desktop lag, even though the machinery is from 2014 and some upgraded components.

501
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,400
Because of the way it's architected, I don't experience performance issues in this is just in my assessment here.

502
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,680
And I actually thought, well, let's go benchmark this. Let's see if some of this bears out.

503
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,560
And so I decided to just use Geekbench because you get a simple number.

504
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:38,560
And the X1 does win Geekbench in single core performance, scoring 1039 is the number it gives it.

505
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,000
The old core i7 5820K scores nine hundred and twenty three on the single core benchmark.

506
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,840
So the laptop beats it by one hundred and sixteen points in a single core work. The laptop beats the old desktop by one hundred and sixteen points, according to Geekbench.

507
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,720
And Geekbench runs a bunch of different tests at it to come to that number.

508
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,960
But OK, you know, that makes some sense. It's a it's a much newer machine, much newer processor.

509
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,800
It probably should win, right? Yeah, it's five generations newer.

510
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,400
We think so, right? Yeah. So multi-core, though, is where it got kind of fun.

511
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:19,040
West, like I didn't know what to expect here. The X1 scored three thousand seven hundred and seventy three on the multi-core benchmark.

512
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,800
The 2014 era desktop scored four thousand nine hundred and ninety three.

513
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,520
The old desktop beats the X1 by over twelve hundred points in multi-core benchmarks.

514
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,880
That's a pretty big gap. Dang. Yeah.

515
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:42,160
I suspect over the years, Linux has gotten pretty good at handling multiple cores and it does a good job of throwing things around to different cores,

516
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,120
even if the applications themselves are single threaded.

517
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,400
And so you benefit pretty substantially on the Linux desktop by having more cores.

518
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,080
Now, you got to make sure your workload, you know, maybe you have a workload that's single core performance is what matters all day long.

519
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:08,240
But for general desktop use, I think multi-core having more cores than having very, very fast cores may may actually pay more dividends because of the work that's been done for years to manage all of that.

520
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,960
Right. Especially on this kind of machine where you write your you know, you're checking your email, you've got multiple electron apps going.

521
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,120
Maybe you're working on an audio or a video project on the side. There's just a lot of stuff you can spread around.

522
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:25,760
I also want to mention I ran these benchmarks with my daily driving applications loaded because I felt like that was a good representation of

523
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,960
I almost always have these applications going and then I'm using the system to do something on top of that.

524
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,000
So they weren't fresh systems, they were freshly booted, but then my base applications loaded.

525
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,520
Wimby, I feel like I want to ask you what your thoughts are on this, because I always drool over the hardware that you get to play with these days.

526
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,360
Does this track so far with with your experiences?

527
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:53,000
Not exactly. What does track is that you can get decent performance out of older hardware on Linux for sure.

528
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:03,480
And, you know, I've got not as many as poppy, but I have a modest number of slightly antique ThinkPads that are still very usable today.

529
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:15,120
And those that are considerably antique, I have replaced, you know, spinning rust with SSDs, even, you know, SATA or in some cases, IDE SSDs.

530
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,120
And that makes a considerable difference to the oldest of systems.

531
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:26,520
I think your point about mixing display refresh rates is an interesting one.

532
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:38,360
And potentially one that could come and bite that Linux gaming challenge that we discussed earlier that Linux tech tips are doing because they have lots of high refresh monitors.

533
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:46,840
And I'm almost certain that they're going to be mixing them and they are going to run into this, I should imagine, at some point.

534
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,840
But I found modern hardware works very well, extremely well, in fact.

535
00:39:52,840 --> 00:40:00,280
Oh, I agree. In terms of it's better than it ever has been for Linux support and the performance is incredible if you build the right system.

536
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,960
But I what I was surprised by is just how boggled this system was, which essentially came down to plumbing issues.

537
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:16,320
Because if if I put a and I hate to say this, I don't normally do this, but if I put a MacBook Pro in that same position, in the same exact configuration,

538
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,920
it works perfectly. There's no lag, everything's fine.

539
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,120
So it's clearly a plumbing issue. Oh, also, it also stung is for like a week or a weekend.

540
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:34,160
I can't remember. I think it was just a weekend. I put Windows 11 on that same ThinkPad to try out Windows 11 and I tried the multi monitor setup, tried the Thunderbolt stuff.

541
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,920
Perfect. No lag, no multi GPU issues at all.

542
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,520
It all just worked. It downloaded the drivers. It set up the displays.

543
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,960
It was pretty good. So it seems like you can buy a new machine.

544
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:55,360
But if you do it wrong, some plumbing issues in Linux can actually make it such that a machine from 2014 can still kick its ass in some configurations.

545
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,880
I'm not trying to say, though, that all new hardware is going to crap out because that's definitely not true.

546
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:09,600
So I've got recently got a X1 Carbon ThinkPad is my work laptop and I've hooked up a couple of displays to it.

547
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:16,600
And I find the Intel GPU internally is really struggling with multiple GPUs.

548
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,560
So I ended up using, sorry, multiple monitors.

549
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:28,880
And so I ended up using an external GPU and it's only an Nvidia, I say only an Nvidia 1050 Ti in a Razer Core external box.

550
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,720
And that's running three displays. And that helps, obviously.

551
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,720
But there's still something in the plumbing somewhere that makes this slow.

552
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:46,960
And I get what Neil says about the all three displays under X are one big canvas on which it paints, which is great for me dragging windows around.

553
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,240
But there's tearing and windows glitch out now and then.

554
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,240
And I'm dangerously close to putting windows back on this thing because that's what it shipped with.

555
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,600
But I tolerate it because I'm a Linux nerd and I prefer Linux.

556
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:07,200
I tolerate this nonsense and I close windows when they start glitching out and I just relaunch them.

557
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:15,400
And I'm a fool to myself because I probably would have a less stressful life and probably a lower heart rate if I just remove Linux and put windows on here.

558
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,360
And then I wouldn't have to deal with all this nonsense.

559
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,360
That's how I was feeling. I was getting to that point, like not doing it.

560
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:29,480
I went back to a desktop and it's just so much better by just going all off of one GPU and having, I think, maybe the desktop plumbing.

561
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:35,000
And I guess part of what I was thinking is, you know, maybe it's just not so bad if I'm finding this fast now,

562
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,520
now that I've gotten switched back from my new PC to my old PC and I find my old PC faster,

563
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,560
maybe I can hang out for another nine months before I replace it.

564
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,840
That's, ah, it stinks, though.

565
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:52,440
Yeah. So the other thing to bear in mind based on sort of the configuration that you were describing,

566
00:42:52,440 --> 00:43:03,200
as in the one that you've created, is that you need to bear in mind there are two motivations for things working well on the Linux desktop today.

567
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:10,200
And that's that the configuration that you have is the same as the developers have.

568
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:21,080
And by and large, that is somebody working on a laptop workstation with a single screen attached to possibly a single IGP,

569
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:26,000
sometimes with a discrete GPU. That's like the most common configuration.

570
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,600
And then the only other time you're going to run into a configuration where you're guaranteed that it's supported well

571
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:42,400
is that an OEM decides to ship a class of workstation and they demand that whichever Linux vendor that they're working with

572
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:50,120
makes that configuration work as well out of the box as it does if they ship Windows on that same model.

573
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:59,120
So those are really the only two ways you're going to get a good, or guaranteed to get a good experience unless, you know,

574
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:05,440
you put in the hours and do the research and buy components that you know are going to work well together.

575
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,600
And that's less of a requirement in terms of just general compatibility.

576
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:18,920
But when you want complete, harmonious operation of your system, then it does still require a bit of upfront research and due diligence.

577
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:26,000
Right. And that's where the value that Linux vendors like System76 or the selection of Dell PCs come in.

578
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,920
They've done that kind of selection process in that work. And, you know, this is in my case, I kind of thought I was going that route with this ThinkPad,

579
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,800
but I ended up, I think, using it in exactly a situation like Wimpy just said, in a way that the developers don't really use it.

580
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,040
And that's with multiple screens and that's with external GPU and an internal GPU and all these little edge cases and the multiple refresh rate.

581
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,880
And it all just built up. And I guess I ended up ultimately finding that the desktop was better.

582
00:44:50,880 --> 00:45:01,280
But through this process, through this process, I realized going forward, I'm going to take all these things I kind of already knew and I'm going to apply that to my next decision on what I do.

583
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:09,760
And I think before I replace my machine here at the studio, I'll probably be setting up a permanent recording machine in the RV.

584
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:19,200
So that way, the next road trip I go on, I have a recording station that's built into the to my setup there and I'll take these lessons learned and apply it to that rig.

585
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,680
And some of the things I did to my desktop, I think I'm going to keep doing because I just I prefer the performance when I can.

586
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,400
Like, I think I'm going to try to do the multiple disk setup, have home on its own thing, have my scratch disk, have have root on its own disk.

587
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,640
I think I'm going to try to keep doing that. Yeah. I mean, if you have the space, why not?

588
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,400
Right. If it prevents you from problems down the line, get it right at the start.

589
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,280
Yeah. I mean, some laptops let you do multiple disks. And of course, you can do that with a desktop.

590
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,880
And I've mentioned this before, Wes. I'm just going to plug it again because it's pretty slick.

591
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:56,000
I'm a big fan of Profile Sync Demon. It's that little tool that just moves your browser cache and profile to RAM.

592
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,680
There's a couple of extra steps if you have Chromium, but it moves that cache to RAM.

593
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,840
And I think you might be shocked if you actually dug into it.

594
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:11,520
In fact, you might actually be a little pissed off if you learned how much your browser writes to your SSD.

595
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:20,840
It's abusive. And while it will make your browser faster by moving its cache and your profile to RAM, obviously, I'm assuming you got the RAM to spare.

596
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:31,880
It's actually for me, it's more about reducing disk I.O. and wear and tear on my disk, minimizing SSD wear and just leaving the disk I.O.

597
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:40,200
available for other things on my system than the fact that, you know, I mean, there was literally a time when Firefox had an intermediate update that I think it was a bug.

598
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,480
And it was just constantly spamming the disk nonstop while it was running.

599
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,400
This is a while ago. And that kind of stuff you just completely avoid.

600
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,680
And you think about it like RAM is is fast, right?

601
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:57,240
Accessing Rams in like the nanosecond range and accessing going out to the disk.

602
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,560
It's like an order of magnitude. It's like a thousand. I mean, it's a million times.

603
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,400
I mean, it's way, way slower to access the disk. I mean, you already know that, right?

604
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,600
So not only are you going to get something that's just going to make your browser feel faster, which is nice,

605
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,840
but it just, I think, reduces overall wear on your SSD and overall load on your disk.

606
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:18,440
I recommend it. It can be a little tricky to set up, but it's profile syncing and I'll have a link in the show notes.

607
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,880
And then there's this last one, the one that I'm trying to get West to try out to sanity.

608
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,400
Check me, try this out on a VM or something before you buy this tip.

609
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,440
This is one of those maybe don't do as Chris does.

610
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,360
I thought that was this whole segment. Yeah, I suppose.

611
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:40,040
This is my last tip. If you're comfortable swapping kernels, I know a lot of you guys out there hate this kind of stuff,

612
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:46,160
but I've had some great results using like a Zen kernel or a CK kernel,

613
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,600
which is really easy to get going on different distros and really tricky and other distros.

614
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,760
But what they essentially are, it's kind of like the good old days of Linux.

615
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,880
It's a kernel with a set of patches that are just designed to make it a little better under a desktop load.

616
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:07,320
Just kind of if you were to tweak the kernel just a little bit to make it a little more desktop focused and a little less server focused.

617
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:12,000
And, you know, I think it improves my desktop responsiveness under load.

618
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,520
I personally have had good results with it.

619
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:21,160
The people that maintain these kernel and these patch sets seem like pretty sharp individuals, but it is swapping out your kernel.

620
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:27,160
And if you want support from your vendor or you want application support or you're on an LTS or something like that, I don't recommend it.

621
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,360
I like how you make this sound like it's like back alley patches that, you know, hush, hush.

622
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,800
You know, I pass you a note and then you're slipping me these patches.

623
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,000
No one's supposed to know.

624
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,680
It's just the kind of thing I shouldn't even say, you know, it's like one of these things.

625
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:43,120
It's like I'm talking about Fight Club a little bit right now and I'm going to get in trouble for it.

626
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,480
But I've got to admit, I have found great results.

627
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,920
I primarily have the most experience like a year plus with the Linux CK patch set.

628
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,160
But when I tried out Garuda Linux, they have the Zen kernel in there and it's basically kind of the same mix.

629
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,400
And you know what? I admit I like it.

630
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:07,760
I know that makes me like some sort of like, I don't know, like custom Linux tinker or something like that that Windows users would roll their eyes at.

631
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,200
But well, you've convinced me enough to try it.

632
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:18,840
I think, you know, this whole thing, you switching back, I've dug out this old Dell XPS desktop that I had laying around that I stuck this 1060 in.

633
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,160
Yeah, I think I'm just going to go Garuda on there and make it a standalone little gaming rig.

634
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,480
Have you got a sense of what it's like performance wise?

635
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,600
I guess it's rust, spinning rust and stuff like that.

636
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,040
Or is it SSD? It is.

637
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,080
I've got it. I've got an SSD on the way to upgrade it.

638
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,560
Ah, good thinking. But boy, is Windows on there just atrocious.

639
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:42,360
The SSD makes a huge difference and so does a decent GPU, which is hard to come by right now.

640
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,320
But I mean, you got at least something, right? That's decent ish.

641
00:49:46,320 --> 00:50:01,360
But that I know this is so stupid to say, but that's it's so great that in desktops, you can unplug the old slow hard drive and plug in a new fast hard drive and you can take out the old slow GPU and you can plug in a new slightly faster GPU.

642
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:11,040
And that's just critical right now. And you can hardly get your hands on anything like the prices for GPUs are the prices that used to be for an entire computer right now.

643
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:18,760
It's nuts and CPUs to my old crappy CPU is going for three hundred dollars right now.

644
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:25,080
That piece of junk from 2014, 300 bucks. It's crazy. It's crazy.

645
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,040
So it just seems like for a lot of us, now is the time to try to make the best of what we got.

646
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:39,960
And I think you can mix and match some of these tips, like maybe you can get an SSD off of eBay or something, or maybe you have one laying around and maybe you could do something like Profile Sync Demon and just kind of free your system up a little bit.

647
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:48,440
Or maybe something crazy like the Linux CK patch set might make your system feel just slightly more responsive under load on a desktop, especially if you can't do multiple disks.

648
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,560
There's things we can do today to get the most out of these systems.

649
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:58,320
If we got to hunker down and wait through this this whole thing for a little bit longer, I don't think it's the end of the world.

650
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:03,160
I think we can do it. And I'd be curious to hear how it goes for you, Wes, because I think that SSD will make a big difference.

651
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:10,160
Oh, yeah, I'm sure you hear me complaining or congratulating myself one way or another.

652
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:24,680
All right, well, we heard back from the developer of Tube Archivist, which was our pick last week, and he pointed out that there actually is a Docker compose file ready to go that also pulls in Elasticsearch, which was my reservation and sets it all up for you.

653
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,880
So there's that. Do you think you'll actually try it then?

654
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,280
I might, although we have another we have another alternative that was submitted that we'll talk about in a minute.

655
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,440
I thought we'd save that for a pic. Did you see that?

656
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:44,720
We also got a feedback from Tim on why NixOS would be great in our server poll, which we're going to get to as well here in just a moment.

657
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:51,880
We got a lot of opinions on that. Tim has some some solid reasons here on why we really should try NixOS.

658
00:51:51,880 --> 00:52:01,760
I mean, OK, number one, I agree. Number zero, Wimpy agrees. Number one, we've ran Arch long enough now to show it works right.

659
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:08,360
We were trying to prove something that, OK, maybe you shouldn't run Arch in production, but you can if you try.

660
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:21,200
Number two, Fedora and Zeus are popular enough that while the rolling variance might be interesting, they're ultimately close to well-established server distros that just can't compare to the weirdness of Nix.

661
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,120
That's number three as well. Nix is just so off the beaten path. It might actually teach us something.

662
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,680
It's not just about testing the operating system. It's about testing our own boundaries as well.

663
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,120
Nix is the future.

664
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:38,880
Yeah, this is I heard a compelling argument on the last and great Ubuntu podcast.

665
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,480
And do you want to recap your your profound statements here?

666
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:55,240
Yeah, I think that with the growth of the container ecosystem around Linux, that will start to penetrate desktop workstation engineers more and more.

667
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:02,360
And NixOS and the Nix package manager, you don't require NixOS to use Nix, of course.

668
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:11,240
But NixOS and its package manager are absolutely fantastic if your daily commodity is containers.

669
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:26,560
And within the circle of container engineers that I move within these days, who are not by and large Linux nerds, but they care about containers, Nix is growing in popularity.

670
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:33,080
Yes, it does seem to be. Poppy, are you rolling your eyes now at this point every time you hear this spiel about Nix or do you buy it?

671
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:46,760
I can see where he's coming from. And I've noticed that the people who are passionate about Nix are as passionate about Nix as Arch users are about Arch.

672
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,560
So, yeah, I can kind of see. And they have a good compelling argument.

673
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:57,000
I'm not sure I'd buy Martins, but I can see why people like it.

674
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:04,120
Well, Jonathan, the NixOS release manager reached out after last week's episode and offered to answer your questions to help get us started.

675
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:10,160
I have not looked at the poll results yet because I felt like if I looked at them, I would influence it.

676
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,840
You know, like it's like a Schrodinger's distro, Schrodinger's distro, Schrodinger's distro, that.

677
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,600
Thank you. And so I didn't want to look at it yet.

678
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:25,280
So we're going to look at the poll results and see what the audience voted for our next Linux distro on our garage server.

679
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,240
The new server has arrived. The Dell box is here.

680
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,440
Wes and I unboxed it this weekend. It's beautiful. It's amazing.

681
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:40,960
Yeah. Wow. I mean, you know, I expected a used server with with all the pros and cons that comes with that, you know, just when servers are used.

682
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,680
But this thing looks brand new. Yeah. I don't think there was a speck of dust inside.

683
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,360
I mean, Mr. Real Zombie Geek hooked us up big time with this thing.

684
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:57,120
It is loaded to the gills with RAM and CPU. So we're off to the races now and we're going to get sleds and discs.

685
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,920
And that takes, you know, I think it's two and a half inch SAS disk.

686
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:07,400
So if you've got a batch of two and a half inch SAS disk that I would need for a Dell PowerEdge server, let me know.

687
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,360
Maybe we could buy it at a good price. It also needs some caddies for that sucker.

688
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,480
But that's all like we're all getting that ready. So the distro is definitely gonna be a big part.

689
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:22,080
But before we reveal what the results are, I wanted to touch on feedback that we got from Chris from Linux after dark or a.k.a.

690
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:30,720
the green sis admin. He wrote in talking about our pontificating on using the Raspberry Pi as a wire guard gateway.

691
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:37,640
And he says, you know, I don't know if it actually be up for the task for what you guys are doing, but I did want to defend the little box.

692
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:56,480
And he points us to some great resources, including over at the open WRT forum where folks did some benchmarks and showed that a Raspberry Pi four as a wire guard VPN gateway can actually sustain about five hundred megabits all the way almost up to a gigabit on, you know, for for the for the WAN link.

693
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,520
You can actually perform with using about twenty five percent of its CPU capacity.

694
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,680
He doesn't think you need much more than probably the two gigabyte version of the eight gigabyte. He says it'd be a big waste.

695
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,040
And the open WRT community has gone all in with the support.

696
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:19,880
He also mentions another option might be the compute module, but you're going to be sharing some of your PCI bandwidth with the USB bus.

697
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,800
And all in all, this is a final note. I've been running wire guard server on my open WRT router.

698
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,840
It's a flash links is consumer unit and it's he's had great results.

699
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,840
So if you're out there, you're still thinking about doing that. He says it works great still.

700
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,280
He says there's really no point in setting up several boxes. He can just do it on there.

701
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:41,640
He says enjoys the show and thanks for the shout out for Linux after dark podcasters unite.

702
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,640
Go podcasting. Hey, man, thanks for writing in.

703
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,280
And, you know, I think this this seals the deal in my mind.

704
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,200
We got to try it. Right. I mean, five hundred megs.

705
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,760
That's plenty for the studio. We sure could.

706
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,920
I mean, why not? What could go wrong, Wes?

707
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,720
All right. I have not yet revealed the results to myself because I have to hit the little button.

708
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,200
So I'm going to our options.

709
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,840
When we asked the community to vote on what our next district should be, we wanted a rolling distribution.

710
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,920
We thought, should we stick with arch? See how far we can take it.

711
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,480
Try out Nix. Maybe it's time to give Tumbleweed a go.

712
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,920
Or could we somehow get rawhide to perform?

713
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,880
And the community said, Tumbleweed, Tumbleweed.

714
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,680
I don't know how to feel except a little crazy.

715
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:35,200
I think this is a karma vote because I gave the lizards a hard time on Coder Radio.

716
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:41,680
I think the Coder Radio audience ganged up and came over here and voted Tumbleweed as a spite vote.

717
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,920
I think that's what happened. Nix had a pretty good showing, though.

718
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,640
So Tumbleweed got forty nine point nine percent of the votes.

719
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:54,080
Oh, wow. Yeah. I mean, Tumbleweed got it by a huge margin.

720
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,640
Nix came in second place at twenty one percent.

721
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:03,160
Arch at third place, sixteen percent and rawhide at eleven percent.

722
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,240
Oh, my goodness, Wes. I how do you feel about this?

723
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,760
Are you ready to deploy a Tumbleweed box?

724
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,360
No, not really. I was hoping this was going to be close enough.

725
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,120
We could sort of fudge the numbers and just go with whatever we wanted.

726
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,840
But now this is a knockout win for Tumbleweed.

727
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,280
I guess our fate is chosen.

728
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,480
Do you think somebody monkeyed with the results here?

729
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,440
Do you think there was some election tampering happening?

730
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,760
You know, some outside influence, if you will.

731
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,320
I wouldn't put it past our clever audience, but I mean, here we are.

732
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:38,280
I still think especially, you know, with Jonathan reaching out from from Nix, like we got to try that in some capacity,

733
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,360
even if it's not this version of the server.

734
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,280
So I'm sure there'll be more next to come.

735
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,160
But I guess we got to look forward to Tumbleweed and figure out how to make it make it our own.

736
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,360
I completely agree.

737
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,960
We'll we'll find something to do with Nix and we'll have a we'll have a go at it.

738
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,080
And I think it's a great opportunity to learn more about it and and share that with the audience.

739
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,440
Something else we got asked about on the show was why not Gentoo?

740
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,640
It's technically rolling. You guys could have gone Gentoo.

741
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:09,320
And it just it really came down to we also and we didn't implicitly say this, but we also wanted something.

742
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,000
Maybe I did. Actually, we wanted something we could update during the show.

743
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,720
So that way we could capture the results for you live as they happen.

744
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,240
We're not like doing it after the show and like fixing it off air and then coming back.

745
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,840
You know, we wanted we wanted to be held responsible and accountable for it.

746
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,680
So that meant we had to be able to update it during the show.

747
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,720
You could update it through a season of shows if you're using Gentoo.

748
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:35,280
Yeah, yeah. Come back next week when we have the updates installed.

749
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,680
You know what, with all the cores this thing has, maybe we actually could have.

750
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,200
But no, for now, we it looks like we're going with Tumbleweed and I will make peace with that.

751
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,040
And you know what? My commitment is this.

752
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:55,800
If Tumbleweed performs and it does a good job, I will own that and I will acknowledge that I'm not going to hate on it the entire time.

753
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,800
I will give it a good, honest go and report back our findings.

754
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:05,880
And some of you who've been listening for a while may recall I was a huge butter of a skeptic for a very long time,

755
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,200
especially once when I had a data loss issue.

756
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,800
But over time, as the software has improved, I've changed my tune.

757
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,440
And now I probably have butter fs deployed on nearly 20 systems.

758
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,960
That's a huge about face. And I'll own up to it here with Tumbleweed as well.

759
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:29,800
If we get through this and it's a rock solid rolling performer that makes a great on premises server, I'm going to tell you guys about it.

760
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,440
So you voted for it. We're going to see what happens.

761
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,320
But that also means that if it disappoints, I'll also I'll also address that.

762
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:40,120
So it isn't there is both sides of it, but I actually I'm feeling pretty good.

763
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,920
I've noticed a change in tune with the audience. They seem pretty hyped about it these days.

764
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:49,240
And I think that played a role in the voting, too, is it legitimately has become more popular amongst our audience as well.

765
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,720
I mean, it almost makes me think we should put it on one other machine, you know, besides the server so we can get some experience with it.

766
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,880
Hmm. It's not the distro. It's how you use it. All right.

767
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,800
We have two picks to get into this week.

768
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,320
The first one's right on topic with the show.

769
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,120
You found this West. It's like a patch bay for pipe wire.

770
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,360
Found it. A.K.A. read Christian's blog post where he linked it.

771
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,160
Yeah, it's written in rust.

772
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:22,280
It's a GTK based patch bay explicitly for pipe wire inspired by the jack tool, Katia, which many jack users will be familiar with.

773
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:27,840
So we have a bunch of patch bays up till now, though, they're basically all stuff that was written for Jack.

774
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:35,360
And if we ever want to have similar functionality for the video side of stuff and pipe wire going to need something pipe wire specific.

775
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:43,160
This is pretty neat. This is what it lets you do is connect blocks to wire up your audio system.

776
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:54,840
So you have applications like maybe Chrome and maybe you want to take something from VLC or MPV and you want to play that audio into a video call that you have in Chrome or Firefox.

777
01:01:54,840 --> 01:02:05,200
You can use something like this pipe wire graph editor now to draw connections between applications or input and output devices and actually make things like that happen.

778
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:12,160
This is great. And it's it's the realization for end users of what the advantage of moving to something like pipe wire is.

779
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:24,120
And it double checks the box because like I said, rust.

780
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:35,720
And even if you have no use for something like this, go check out the link in the show notes just so you can visualize what we're talking about here so you can see kind of why people are kind of getting pretty excited about being able to do that kind of stuff.

781
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,320
Yeah, I mean, it's tools like this that actually make the show today possible.

782
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:51,480
That's very much, very, very much. I wish I could I wish I could show people how we have things wired up so that way we can have a mumble room and a guest and remote hosts all on one system.

783
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:57,320
Everybody hears each other. It's all wired up virtually using Jack and it's pretty powerful.

784
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:02,760
And I think it enables a type of production that people might not even know is possible for not familiar with the technology.

785
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,120
So go check it out. Number two, we have to pick. That's right.

786
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:11,320
Not one, but two crazy picks for you this week is another alternative that came in over to archivist.

787
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:17,920
It's called Tube Sync. Think of it as like Sonar or some of those automatic built in Web apps where you say,

788
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:24,560
I want this thing to be downloaded every time it has a new release and it goes off and it gets that for you.

789
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:34,400
It's like TiVo for YouTube. So you give it a channel or you give it a feed, give it some sources and then it monitors those sources and then automatically downloads those channels or whatever.

790
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,640
It might be a YouTube playlist to your file server for you to watch later.

791
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:46,960
And it tries to pull down the metadata information, the thumbnail, and it tries to preserve the original URL for you as well.

792
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,920
It just need Docker or Podman to get it going.

793
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,320
It's pretty straightforward and you end up with something maybe a little closer to what I was looking at.

794
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,480
I'm going to play with both of them. Yeah, this looks great. Wow.

795
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,360
I know. Isn't this just so neat to see this?

796
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:03,480
And I knew other people out there must be trying to solve this problem.

797
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:08,320
So if you are, too, we got a couple other folks who sent in like their personal scripts and stuff like that.

798
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:20,480
If you're looking for or if you know a great tool or something to essentially watch a YouTube channel and automatically download it and store releases somewhere on your file system so you can easily watch them offline.

799
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,000
Let us know. Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

800
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,680
We'd love to hear about it. It's just so neat.

801
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:31,040
And so it's TubeSync and we'll have a link to TubeSync in the show notes at Linux Unplugged dot com slash four to six.

802
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:36,560
Better get cracking, Wes. Get syncing your tubes, you know, I'm already downloading it.

803
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,320
And you can find our friends, a cloud guru on social media.

804
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,960
They're just slash a cloud guru on Facebook, on the YouTubes.

805
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,960
I mean, if they're up. But, you know, when the social medias are up, you can find them at slash a cloud guru.

806
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:53,040
It can be rough there. However, respect to Twitter and Telegram.

807
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,680
Telegram saw a massive wave of new users and and mostly held.

808
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,760
And so did Twitter. They mostly. Yeah, it's you know, some of them got it right.

809
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:07,880
This show, our Twitter account, remarkably just didn't see a huge flood of new users.

810
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,160
But maybe you want to go follow it anyways at Linux Unplugged on the Twitter.

811
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,440
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

812
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:23,040
And of course, all of the whole network of podcasts like self-hosted Linux Action News and Koda Radio all over at Jupiter broadcasting dot com.

813
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,040
And don't miss Linux Action News.

814
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,600
Things like that pipeline story about the nuts and bolts of how that's going to work.

815
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,320
That's in there.

816
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:34,760
Linux Action News is covering the stuff that really matters every single week in a nice, tight, concise way.

817
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,960
Go get it at Linux Action News dot com slash subscribe.

818
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:43,240
And then you can just find out about what happens every single week in the world of Linux.

819
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,280
And we invite you to join us live every Tuesday.

820
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,080
We do this show at noon Pacific, three p.m.

821
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,040
Eastern. See you next week.

822
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,520
Same bad time, same bad station.

823
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,160
Yeah. Come on over. Hang out in our Mumble Room.

824
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:03,080
Participate in our live stream chat or just kick back and watch live while you're, I don't know, working.

825
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,080
I don't know what you do in the middle of a Tuesday.

826
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,640
Weirdo. I don't know.

827
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,240
Hopefully at least you're using Linux, but I don't know.

828
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:14,840
I mean, if you're not, you could kind of make up for it by watching a Linux stream.

829
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,760
Yeah, right. You're trapped on Windows there.

830
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,760
Just pull up the latest Linux Unplugged.

831
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,680
Pull up the live stream. You'll feel a little better about yourself.

832
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,320
There you go. JBLive.TV on a Tuesday.

833
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,440
Or, you know, download it.

834
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,280
We do go through all the trouble of editing and publishing.

835
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,960
Might as well do that, too. Thanks for joining us.

836
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:59,560
See you back here next Tuesday.

837
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:09,720
JBtitles.com.

838
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,840
Let's go pick our title this week.

839
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,920
You know, I hope the Ashi Linux team is successful.

840
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,240
I saw they had another update today, but I didn't get a chance to parse it.

841
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,760
Did you parse through it all, Wes?

842
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:29,280
There's a lot of stuff in there, mostly a whole bunch of different updates on the various patches and driver bits that they've been working on to slowly get upstream,

843
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,880
which parts are working and what's in progress.

844
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,600
I'm half kidding when I say this, but only half kidding.

845
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:50,040
In a way, if Ashi Linux got really great desktop Linux support on the M1 Macs, it'd be a viable option for people like me who want to get fast hardware right now that doesn't suck a ton of power.

846
01:07:50,040 --> 01:08:03,800
Because I'm looking at this from the RV perspective where more and more I'm living off solar and there's a just a massive cost difference for me in terms of power from 33 watts and 300 watts.

847
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,000
And, you know, that's maybe like the PC not even working that hard.

848
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,320
I'm not playing a video game.

849
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,280
I'm not doing anything that's rendering right.

850
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,680
I'm just kind of maybe I have my basic apps open.

851
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:20,800
It's going to have 180, 200 watt draw versus the absolute max of an M1 is like around 33 watts.

852
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah, that's like a days of difference for me in power usage.

853
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,920
And but I'm just I'm not going to pull the trigger on that until I know I can run Linux on it and it's going to run well.

854
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:38,120
But it's like this weird situation we're in with this part shortage that might extend out in the middle of 2022.

855
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:46,920
If we're if we're lucky, it's weird that an M1 may actually be a viable option to get a decent performing Linux desktop if they pull it off.

856
01:08:46,920 --> 01:09:01,840
Did you see the in the responses to Jeremy's tweet about 64 X availability for people who are going, oh, M1 might be interesting.

857
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,360
You know what? If I were them, I might do it. Why not go for it?

858
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:08,520
Be like the premier M1 Linux distro for the desktop, right?

859
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,440
You're going to have Linux, which is going to be this great vehicle for upstream development.

860
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,520
And maybe I don't know what it turns into.

861
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,280
Maybe it turns into a desktop distro.

862
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,040
Maybe it's a development distro.

863
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,200
But, you know, they could move in.

864
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:28,960
It's a little bit naive to see and think Apple M1 Silicon, because, yeah, it's just cool.

865
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,840
And the instruction set that's the same.

866
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:40,920
