1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
I was trying to come up with an excuse for doing this episode, like I was going to blame

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,660
it on, like, oh, it's summer solstice time, and then we kind of missed that.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,060
And then I was just kind of trying to come up with ideas, like, what's the hook for doing

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,060
this episode?

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,220
And then I realized we just kind of want to.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,660
I think the hook is you need a vacation, son.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,660
Oh, yeah, that's true.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,100
I will be in Montana when this episode rolls out.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,200
But it's with three kids in an RV.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Is that really a vacation?

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,860
Have you ever seen any of the RV family trip movies?

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:37,240
They're pretty close to reality.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged episode 310.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
My name is Chris.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,440
My name is Wes.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
Hi there, Wes.

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
Nice to see you again.

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
Hello.

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Hello, cheese.

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Hey, how's it going?

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
Hey, buddy.

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
And hello, Elle.

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
Hey, hey.

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Hello, hello.

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
Good to have you here.

26
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,560
Well, this is another one of these specials that we've been doing recently.

27
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,920
We thought we'd look back at this point in the year at some of the stories that I would

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,500
say surprised us, the ones that really stood out.

29
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,000
And then we've brought a collection of our own personal, let's call them favorite stories

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,220
of the year.

31
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,760
And we'll tell you what those are and then tell you where we think they're going.

32
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,240
It's a fun special edition.

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,000
And we had sort of the perfect opportunity right here in the middle of the year.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,780
Often, summer is a hit and miss Newsweek.

35
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,320
It's been actually a pretty crazy, busy summer.

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,720
Actually, it really has, yeah.

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,360
And there's a couple of things that have already sort of stood out.

38
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,180
And so our crack research team put a few of these together.

39
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,040
So we'll go through theirs and then we'll go through ours.

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,520
And then we'll see where we end up.

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,120
Honestly, I'm glad we're doing this because as has quickly been revealed, a lot has happened

42
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,120
this year.

43
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,600
And it's interesting to see which trends are continuing.

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,340
On a personal note, we were looking at some of our data.

45
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
And it's interesting.

46
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,240
You can watch my journey in the data for our show.

47
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,520
So towards the end of last year, we were talking a lot about Plasma.

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,280
And then towards the beginning of this year and through this year, which we'll talk about

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,920
more later, we started talking more about Gnome.

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,320
And now here I am sitting here and I'm using Fedora.

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,800
So it's been, personally, a really interesting transition of a year for me going from all

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,840
these different desktops to a completely different distribution.

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,080
Fedora with XFCE, of all things.

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Yeah.

55
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,360
I always kind of wanted up-to-date user land applications like Firefox and Chrome and Guake

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,400
and up-to-date drivers because I tend to want to do a little bit of gaming.

57
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,000
But there's certain aspects of my desktop I don't need to change very often.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,320
And I think that's what happened for me this year is I sort of, I found the sweet spot

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,860
in something that is updated a fairly regular clip but also allows for me to have some staticness

60
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,860
where I need it.

61
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,200
That was an interesting journey for me.

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,280
I mean, really, a couple of years ago when I switched to Arch and just stayed there for

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
a while.

64
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,840
And then once I left Arch, I had this meandering.

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,480
You haven't settled down.

66
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,200
This is feeling like maybe you'll stick, though.

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Feeling good.

68
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
All right.

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,560
So here's something that has really stood out, I think a lot of you would agree with,

70
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,920
in 2019 is this battle to block ads in these different takes.

71
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,360
And Mozilla's really stood out here.

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,720
Google hasn't come across looking great as there's been the debate about shutting down

73
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,960
how many sites could be in this list that could be blocked.

74
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
You know what I'm talking about.

75
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
Ooh, yeah.

76
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,000
And that's still up in the air as we record right now.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,600
But I would say definitely, I agree with the team, one of the standout stories, this whole

78
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,960
battle for global ad blocking.

79
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,800
Plus, you also have on iOS and Android built-in blockers now.

80
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,280
And it's all really at the core of it about how people are gonna make money.

81
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Yeah, right.

82
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,240
It's an important driver of economics all over the place.

83
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,680
And as more people use devices, use mobile devices, ad blocking has gone from something

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,840
that was kind of for the niche, for the nerds, for Linux-unplugged users, perhaps to something

85
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,120
that everyone needs because ads are everywhere.

86
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,200
Cheesy, what do you think about Mozilla announcing, let's say, I think it's around $5 a month.

87
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,160
I don't know what the exact is after all fees and stuff, but $5 a month for ad-free news.

88
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,320
When you look at how hard it is to find trusted news and you look at how ad blocking is really

89
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,800
putting pressure on what is already a super tight market for monetization, maybe Mozilla

90
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,880
has an actual strategy here?

91
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,640
Well, I mean, I will say, first off, it kind of popped up out of the middle of nowhere

92
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
it seemed like.

93
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,760
I personally like the idea.

94
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,060
I'm a news hound myself.

95
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:27,000
And for anyone that's ever gone to any other news site, The Sun, you know, just anywhere

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,440
and you see how inundated you are with ads, so just to have that clean news reading ability,

97
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,120
I'm in on it.

98
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
I do like that.

99
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
I like that idea.

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,200
But I'm curious how you feel, Elle, paying per month for access to news, which is out

101
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
there for free.

102
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,960
I mean, there's ways to get free news.

103
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,400
How do you feel about it?

104
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
There's bills to pay.

105
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
There's water heaters to fix.

106
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,960
Is $5 a month for news worth it?

107
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,640
You know, I'm starting to wonder if they can just give me bulk pricing because they keep

108
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,640
coming up with more things to kind of $5 a month me on.

109
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,520
But then there are times that I'm trying to read a news article and I can't even get to

110
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,400
the X on the screen because there's so many pop ups and I try to use ad blockers and it

111
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,280
just won't give me the site and says, hey, we see you're using an ad blocker.

112
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,880
If you want to see it, disable it.

113
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,320
So at some point it's going to be picking, hey, do I use their ad blocking service or

114
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
do I use their VPN?

115
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,160
Because that $5 is going to add up quickly.

116
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
That's a great point.

117
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,680
I think Mozilla should offer some kind of bundle for like maybe it's $14.99 a month

118
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,360
and it's everything they're about to roll out.

119
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,840
The Firefox suite of services.

120
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,080
Because you really get the sense they're just getting started too.

121
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Right.

122
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Absolutely.

123
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,960
You got the news, you got the VPN, there's going to be other things that will roll into

124
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
that.

125
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,120
Honestly, a bundle would be pretty appetizing.

126
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
I like the idea.

127
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,560
I mean, I already fund some news organizations myself.

128
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,600
I generally like what Mozilla is doing and I wouldn't mind giving Mozilla some cash also.

129
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Yeah.

130
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,760
I wonder what the new sites revenue share is on that.

131
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,080
I'd be keeping my eye out for that.

132
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,280
How do they choose which partners?

133
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Yeah.

134
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,120
I mean, with the Apple news, there's a rev share deal there where... I'm sure Mozilla

135
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
is working that out.

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,760
Maybe it's their partner that does it, but... There's that news story, which has been

137
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,040
an interesting trend and it's obviously going to continue through the rest of 2019, no doubt

138
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
about it.

139
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,280
Then we had a couple of unexpected losses.

140
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,400
Some friends that discontinued their projects in 2019 that I don't think we saw coming,

141
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,080
number one, that I didn't see with scientific Linux.

142
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,000
I think it makes sense.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,080
Maybe it's time.

144
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,680
Now we know a little bit more, too, about what was involved in maintaining it and how

145
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
much work it was.

146
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,920
It seems pretty clear that if there's other means to do it, if they can do it through

147
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,160
software modularity and containers and-

148
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Yeah.

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,600
That's why this one kind of didn't surprise me.

150
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,480
I think it was time and a lot of them... I think a lot of the surprise came from communities

151
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,440
outside of scientific Linux, people that were... It was interesting to have.

152
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,620
It made sense that a Linux distribution would be there to fit that niche.

153
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,860
We all know there's a ton of Linux used in scientific work.

154
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,560
It turns out most of that's just the tools, though, right?

155
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,040
Having a specific distribution now that we have better tooling available to make these

156
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,760
things, it's just too much work.

157
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Okay.

158
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
What about Antegros?

159
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Okay.

160
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,920
That one caught me off guard.

161
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:14,460
I'm a Arch... Well, maybe not quite by the book, but doing it yourself kind of Arch user,

162
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,080
but if I wanted a nice little GUI to have an Arch environment to install from or to

163
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,560
push onto others, Antegros, that was my go-to.

164
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,240
I think the best thing about Antegros was it was an easy way to show someone how freaking

165
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,320
great Pac-Man and the AUR is.

166
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,880
Right, because it's not like it was super customized, but it looked good out of the

167
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,660
box and you had all the Arch goodness, so you didn't have to show them, oh, well, here's

168
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,440
the console you'll be installing from.

169
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,240
With the exception of four packages, it's mainline Arch, and...

170
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,520
That was the other part, too, right?

171
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,040
It works for when you're starting out, but it was also still easy to understand, still

172
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,200
simple, stupid, and so you could use it as an advanced Arch user.

173
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,100
Developing habits like following the Arch news and watching the Arch updates was worthwhile

174
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,600
because it was the same thing you were going to get in Antegros, but the thing is, is getting

175
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,680
someone that hands-on, and Manjaro does this, too, but getting someone that hands-on with

176
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,080
Pac-Man and the AUR and things like that, that is such a great experience that it kind

177
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,400
of makes it worth... It kind of makes it worth doing the whole thing.

178
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,280
Later on, you'll be like, you know what, now that I know how great it is once it's all

179
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,720
set up and how powerful it is and what all the flexibility and options are and the software

180
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,880
availability, well, now it's worth going through the process of installing it.

181
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Yeah, right.

182
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,360
You're excited, and you know there's a good end goal at the end.

183
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,440
And let's not forget EndeavorOS, which is some of the original developers of Ant-er-grose,

184
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:47,320
which, thankfully, we won't have to hear you butcher that again all of the time.

185
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,880
But EndeavorOS has their first beta release, and I think the 15th of July is when they're

186
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,040
trying to have their first stable release out.

187
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,000
So you can check that out over at EndeavorOS.com.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm looking forward to it.

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think it's cool.

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So I think I'm still mourning the passing or the death of Korora.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,480
It was a really easy distro for me to get started when I was just starting out because

192
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,280
the graphical interface was just so user-friendly.

193
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:22,200
I think the developer had a lot to do with keeping me on Linux when I first started out.

194
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,200
And I'm kind of afraid that with these other Linux distros kind of going away, maybe I'm

195
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,940
missing out the chance to get the same experience with Arch without having to go through and

196
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,480
actually compile everything myself.

197
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,280
Yeah, there is something to both losing Ant-er-grose and Korora in the same year.

198
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,520
I wonder if Manjaro would work for you in that scenario, or maybe in a release or two

199
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,920
we should all just give Endeavor a go and just kind of see what we think.

200
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,960
Maybe, you know, it could be possible.

201
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,000
Like you already have a lot of the work done by the Ant-er-grose folks and you're following

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,040
upstream Arch, which is moving fast, but it does seem like it's a possible job.

203
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
It does.

204
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,960
You know, I wonder if these are a little different too, at least seeing your rise in Fedora usage.

205
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,560
I wonder if there's just things Fedora has now, like Fedora has changed a lot and maybe

206
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,040
there's less need for Korora to exist.

207
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,640
That could be it too, because the drivers are super easy to install right now.

208
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,360
You even have H.264s there, right?

209
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,520
And with certain RPM repos, which are becoming less and less important to me, and Flatpaks,

210
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,600
it's kind of like everything's available now.

211
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,760
I really don't have any software availability issues.

212
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,240
It doesn't look bad by default?

213
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,720
Yeah, it's come a long way.

214
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Okay, so there's just a couple other gotta talk about stories before we get to our personal

215
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
favorites.

216
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,880
Elephant in the room, almost this one.

217
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,640
It's this really rocky, slow death of 32-bit.

218
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,360
LibreOffice 6.3 dropped 32-bit Linux builds at the beginning of June.

219
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:56,780
Obviously, we just recently had a hoopla about Ubuntu 1910s 32-bit i36 architecture support.

220
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,940
And other projects are looking at dropping 32-bit support.

221
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,520
Some projects are just as dependent on it as ever, like Wine and others.

222
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,880
We didn't talk about this much at the time of the coverage, but elimination of 32-bit

223
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,920
would really impact us.

224
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,720
A lot of our plugins for audio processing, gosh darn it, are 32-bit.

225
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
And some of them...

226
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,400
What's this system called where it kind of actually runs them through Wine?

227
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
What's that called?

228
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Do you remember?

229
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Well, there's multiple things.

230
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,200
Carla has a bridge, but linvst...

231
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
That's what I was thinking of.

232
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Yeah, linvst.

233
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,440
There's a lot of, let's say, black magic hackery going on to integrate things over to the Windows

234
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,120
world just enough to get this stuff to work.

235
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Yeah.

236
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,120
And so it would have an impact on the production industry as well.

237
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
And even...

238
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,720
And I guess maybe I should have talked about that, because I really got...

239
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,560
People did not like my take on it, because my take was, all right, well, let's look at

240
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
it.

241
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,120
Let's start pulling it out and then see if we can't use something like snaps or flat

242
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,280
packs or cheroots or containers or...

243
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
I don't care.

244
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,560
Just update the Steam runtime library with 32-bit libraries.

245
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,960
I just felt like there was ways to solve the problem.

246
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,940
However, at the end, I think they came to a pretty good compromise.

247
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,200
And now we just see which other distros push it next.

248
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Do you have any guesses?

249
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Oh, hmm.

250
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,000
Guys, do you have any guesses on which distro might...

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,440
I kind of think it could be Fedora, to tell you the truth.

252
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
That's who I was thinking.

253
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,080
I mean, at this point, what do they really have to lose in this battle?

254
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,120
You know, they don't.

255
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,760
And don't you think RHEL is going to go 64-bit at some point?

256
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,440
Because, I mean, I would think...

257
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,520
That's the future, bros and broettes.

258
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,440
We're going to have to deal with it at some point.

259
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,040
If they're ever going to take RHEL to 64-bit only, which would, in theory, make it more

260
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,600
secure, don't they kind of have to take Fedora there first?

261
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
They have to start with Fedora, right?

262
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
I would think so.

263
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,280
I think it could be Fedora.

264
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,280
So I may be dogfooding this very soon, if my prediction's right and I stay on Fedora.

265
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,840
Is this ever going to come to Windows?

266
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,080
I mean, because that's part of the reasons we need it, right?

267
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,440
If we lived only...

268
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,320
If we were only using open source stuff and not messing around with Windows things, would

269
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,720
we care about 32-bit?

270
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
I don't think so.

271
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Hmm.

272
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,040
Windows and Windows legacy, right?

273
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,680
That Mac ecosystem, it's jumping right over it in a faster way than we are.

274
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Mm-hmm.

275
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Mm-hmm.

276
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
And mobile, too.

277
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,160
Is Microsoft only keeping 32-bit around because they're getting the same pushback from devs

278
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,600
that have been writing 32-bit code forever and are still writing 32-bit code?

279
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,440
I mean, they've got a whole other approach to legacy and compatibility with the past,

280
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
you know?

281
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Yeah, that's got to be part of it.

282
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
That's got to be part of it.

283
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,960
The amount of customers that we had as of two years ago still running RAIL 4 makes me

284
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,120
think, no, they're going to keep these things alive for a while.

285
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Is this when you were at Rackspace?

286
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,760
Yeah, when I was still there.

287
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,060
And they were still being supported.

288
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,000
They paid enough money to have support when they needed it.

289
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,120
Yeah, see, that's just it.

290
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:50,680
Every time I, as a contractor, had gone into a client's super old systems, there's software

291
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:57,320
updates and support by the vendor are not what drive...

292
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:04,060
From operating systems to custom-created industry-specific applications that are two or three releases

293
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,400
behind that don't have any support, they're still running them for whatever reason.

294
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:15,960
I think with this decision that Canonical has made, and because RAIL hasn't made any

295
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:23,680
changes yet, I think it's pretty easy to bet today that there will still be systems that

296
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,720
you can load with 32-bit support by 2030.

297
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,960
I think you're right about that, yeah.

298
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,760
That's so crazy.

299
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,760
We might not be using any of these systems, but they'll be sitting in boxes and closets

300
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
somewhere.

301
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Oh, for sure.

302
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,900
But I mean, I think there will still be vendor-supported operating systems by Red Hat and Canonical

303
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,440
that support 32-bit.

304
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,720
That'll still be like the OS still officially supports it if you get the LTS or if you're

305
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,920
shipping RAIL.

306
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
I just think that's...

307
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,080
I mean, at what point, but it is what it is.

308
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,760
It's the slow fade of technology.

309
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
And then the last...

310
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,960
And there's a whole list.

311
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,160
We're just really kind of picking from the highlights here.

312
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,360
The other one that I think we just all have to talk about is obviously, in a word, you

313
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,920
could say Microsoft, but I think specifically the subsystem version two that is running

314
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,380
an actual Linux kernel.

315
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,520
The new big Linux distribution in the room.

316
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,000
I was so sick of that joke.

317
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,880
I was so sick of people calling like, it's the best Linux desktop.

318
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
I didn't say best.

319
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
I didn't say best.

320
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
I know, but you know people have been saying that.

321
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Mr. Dominic.

322
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
I can think of...

323
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Right.

324
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,560
The thing is, is like, you're still booting Windows, okay?

325
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,820
You're still loading a Linux kernel in the VM.

326
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,080
It's not like you're booting a Linux kernel.

327
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,240
Yeah, the NT kernel gets to do all the real work there, yeah.

328
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
Yes.

329
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,120
It's still Windows with its Windows things and millions of little paper cuts here and

330
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
there.

331
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,680
But it's still a huge win for Linux and people trying to use it and target it as a platform

332
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,360
even if it doesn't do much for the desktop user.

333
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Yeah.

334
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,100
Well, so we were just cracking jokes about Michael Dominic from Coder Radio, but he's

335
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,120
in a situation right now where he's shipping a couple of Windows applications in production

336
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
that he's actively maintaining.

337
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,320
It turns out people use that operating system and want to buy software for it.

338
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,160
And the backend software is on Linux.

339
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,640
So he's able to maintain and support the front end on Windows, which is a Windows application,

340
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,880
and still continue to develop and push to production and testing from Windows using

341
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,640
Visual Studio Code into the subsystem for Linux, out to a Docker container.

342
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,800
I mean, like the whole workflow for both sides of the app.

343
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
It's probably more...

344
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Unfortunately, fortunately, I don't know.

345
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,120
It's probably more seamless that way, right?

346
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,240
Because Microsoft's spending a lot of time getting their hooks into this little minimal

347
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,160
WSL2 VM.

348
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,360
There are some solutions for running Windows pretty well virtualized on the Linux side,

349
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,360
but I don't think it's going to be nearly as slick.

350
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:50,920
Man, the future tie-in between that system, Visual Studio Code, and Visual Studio itself,

351
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,360
as well as GitHub and Docker and Azure.

352
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,640
It's your cloud workstation, buddy.

353
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Ooh.

354
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Wow.

355
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
I mean, that is...

356
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,720
What we are witnessing in 2019 is just the beginning.

357
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,320
That is what people want, right?

358
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,800
It seems like a pretty smart move.

359
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Is it?

360
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Michael Nominick does.

361
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Yeah.

362
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
And I actually totally understand.

363
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,640
If I was stuck on Windows, I'd totally understand.

364
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:20,800
I try not to be that guy who's just reactionarily worried about it, but my take on where Microsoft's

365
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,820
at right now with this whole thing, having watched them this year and the last couple

366
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:30,160
of years, is they are legitimately doing what they say they're doing.

367
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,920
And they have every incentive to do that, as they are in a growth industry right now,

368
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,400
where there is lots of opportunity for them to grow and make money.

369
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:48,360
And being open source friendly and standards compliant and interoperable is a great way

370
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,880
to get market share.

371
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,480
And I don't think there's any evil intent behind it at all, none.

372
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
I think...

373
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,800
I mean, other than the motive to make profit, but then we could condemn every company.

374
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,240
I don't know what their intent will be in, say, 10 years or 15 years when the market

375
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,260
is completely saturated and it's no longer easy pickings.

376
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,680
It's much harder to make money.

377
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:18,160
The temptation may come back to start tightening down the screws again, but that's a long ways

378
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
out.

379
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,960
And it seems silly to forfeit the benefits now just because of something that could happen.

380
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
It's hard, right?

381
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,200
They're a huge part of the software industry, field, history, culture, and it's hard to

382
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,520
say what companies do, right?

383
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,880
So even if you get open source ingrained into culture and management now, in 20 years, that

384
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,080
could be a totally different setup.

385
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
You just don't know.

386
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Same thing with Google.

387
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Same thing with Google.

388
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,940
When you get different leadership in, things change.

389
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,160
Maybe there are certain leaders that won't cross certain lines today.

390
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,240
Future leaders may be in different situations and not have the same background and be willing

391
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,740
to cross those lines.

392
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,000
And you just have to stay vigilant, informed, and just continually reevaluate and make your

393
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
decision.

394
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I do think you're right, though.

395
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,120
If anything, Microsoft's a little easier to evaluate because they're being pretty plain

396
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
actors.

397
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,400
You know, open source technology is working.

398
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
It's what customers want.

399
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,600
They can leverage it for business reasons.

400
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,280
And it's sort of easy to understand the profit motivation.

401
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,240
Well, I think this absolutely makes sense for Microsoft to do this, especially when

402
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:24,060
you look at Red Hat, IBM, Red Hat's new universal base image, Alpine, other kind of base images

403
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:29,320
that people can develop from and to have it within the desktop that you're doing your

404
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
work in.

405
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,000
I mean, that is pretty handy.

406
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,680
But to say it's the best Linux desktop, I mean, first, we have to start at it being

407
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,960
a desktop, which it is mediocre at, at best.

408
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Say it, baby.

409
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Well, I'm just saying, I mean, look, I work on all of these.

410
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:54,360
I have all of these operating systems on a computer, on actual metal in my house.

411
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:02,000
And really, Microsoft could step it up a little bit in their desktop game and their consistency

412
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,320
and just the look and feel of the OS in and of itself.

413
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,560
I mean, if you want to look up all of your development questions in Bing, go ahead, right?

414
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,360
Hey, have you tried Edge?

415
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
It's really fast.

416
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
That's what I hear.

417
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,360
But no.

418
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,640
Well, Microsoft, it's been a good year for them, really.

419
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
The GitHub acquisition's done.

420
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,760
I do need to spend some time playing with that terminal.

421
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,140
It's another one of those things where sometimes you have to use Windows, so these are nice

422
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,680
things to have when you're in that situation.

423
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,320
Sometimes you do have to use Windows.

424
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
It happens.

425
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,680
I recommend when you use Windows to use safe practices and run it in a VM if possible.

426
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,200
Boy, not a ton in housekeeping today, but there's a few items.

427
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,760
As I've been mentioning this for a couple of weeks, Linux Academy is hiring.

428
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,640
I just recommend going to linuxacademy.com and scrolling down, they've got a careers

429
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
link there.

430
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,280
There's quite a bit of positions open from a range of development to training to some

431
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
admin stuff.

432
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,460
A lot of it's remote, full-time, with full benefits.

433
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,120
Some of it's also at certain offices, so just check it out, linuxacademy.com.

434
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,840
Scroll down to the careers section there.

435
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
Maybe get some work.

436
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,180
Also, I think System76 is still looking to hire for their tech support team, so shout

437
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,180
out to them.

438
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,800
They're doing some hiring right now.

439
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Now, I just want to make a quickie plug for the Friday stream.

440
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,240
If you haven't listened to the Friday stream yet, it's like a bonus version of the show.

441
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,160
A lot of the same caskets on that, and plus, everybody has a plus one sometimes, I swear.

442
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,760
Somehow it's even more fun.

443
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,840
We've been doing some fun stuff.

444
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,600
In the show notes, we should put this in there, Wes, because we don't have it right now, we

445
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,480
have a link to a form you can help us fill out.

446
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,600
We're going to do some Linux quiz questions on the show and test people's Linux trivia

447
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
knowledge.

448
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,960
We have a lot of different kinds of interesting things like commands, history, anything you

449
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
could think of.

450
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
We need different levels of hardness too, like easy and hard and all that kind of stuff.

451
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,080
We'll have a link if you want to help out with that.

452
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,320
It's a Google form that goes into a spreadsheet, and we track everything about you.

453
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,200
No, not really.

454
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
That's not true.

455
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,920
Check out youtube.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for some of our more recent meetups that we've

456
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,760
been holding, the virtual ones, different kinds of study groups on many different topics.

457
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,520
I really, really like that burnout one that was just posted a few days ago.

458
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,760
There's a lot going on.

459
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,600
In fact, we got a whole new batch just on the horizon, don't we?

460
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Yep.

461
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,280
We are getting AWS certified, so this is a great certification, even if you aren't really

462
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,960
sure what the cloud is all about.

463
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,160
If you want to find out more, join us at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

464
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Yeah.

465
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,760
They'll have the details there, including some stream info and all of that.

466
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,880
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, where we also schedule our in-person events as well.

467
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,600
I also just got to give a hearty plug to Mr. Wes Payne over there rocking the tech snap.

468
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,040
We don't mention enough on the show, TechSnap.Systems.

469
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Go check it out with him and Jim Salter from Ars Technica.

470
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
The one, the only.

471
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,320
Yeah, I love Jim.

472
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
You guys are great on that show.

473
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Well, thanks.

474
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,700
So much better than when I was on that show.

475
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
So much better.

476
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,700
So check that out.

477
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,200
We're just taking it to the next level, that's all.

478
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,760
You guys are like a good pair, too.

479
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,120
You guys balance each other out really well.

480
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Check that out, TechSnap.Systems.

481
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:05,920
All right, well, now let's get into our favorite moments, the things that have really grabbed

482
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,120
us and joining us now as we get into the segment.

483
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Perfect timing.

484
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Alex is here.

485
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Hello, Alex.

486
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Hi, baby.

487
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Hey there.

488
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Hey there.

489
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Thank you for joining us.

490
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,440
And I think you're going to have some input on some of these.

491
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,800
So let's start just really a quick acknowledgement.

492
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,680
2019, we saw Elle, Cheese, and Drew join the team.

493
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,720
And that's kind of amazing because it's like a variation.

494
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,520
Drew was in the community, but he was new.

495
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,120
Elle was in the extended community and now is like been the perfect fit.

496
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,040
And Cheese had been in the community for like a decade.

497
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Basically forever.

498
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,520
And I'm curious, I kind of want to take Elle's first impressions of what it's been like to

499
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,400
podcast and then Cheese's since he's been on the outside for so long.

500
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,020
So let's start with you, Elle.

501
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,280
First impressions now that you've joined this team of podcasters, how's that gone?

502
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,680
What do you think?

503
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,160
I ask cautiously.

504
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,200
Yeah, I think you were scared to ask that.

505
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,120
No, it's been a lot of fun.

506
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,200
It's been a big learning curve that I wasn't really prepared for.

507
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Everybody has a podcast.

508
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,060
That's what everybody wants to do.

509
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:19,320
And nobody, I think, really realizes if you're doing quality podcasting, how much work, how

510
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,800
much research, and how many things you have to learn to do it right.

511
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,640
Yeah, to do it right, it does take a lot of extra work.

512
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,800
Turns out Chris doesn't just give you the script and then you read it on the microphone.

513
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,360
I thought that's how it worked.

514
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,560
Sorry about that.

515
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
That's an option.

516
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,320
And then Cheesy, I'm curious, your impressions having watched it from a long time from the

517
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,160
outside, and now you've been brought inside the sausage factory, seeing how we put everything

518
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
together.

519
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,800
You know sometimes the meat hits the floor.

520
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,720
What is your before and after impressions?

521
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:54,120
Well, very much like Elle said, I've been listening forever, for a decade or more, and

522
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:00,640
then never really, I guess, respected how much work went into it.

523
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,640
But it was definitely interesting, especially whenever you were doing the video, how much

524
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,120
work was going into that, I can only imagine.

525
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,680
But being on the inside, it's great, man.

526
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
I love it.

527
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
It is a lot of work.

528
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,720
There is a lot of research to do.

529
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,440
But it's all stuff that's right up my alley.

530
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,620
So I feel kind of privileged now because I get to find some of these news sources and

531
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:26,560
some of these little tasty, juicy morsels of the Linux community before they drop for

532
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
everyone else.

533
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,200
And so to me, that's one of the coolest parts of this job.

534
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Yeah.

535
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Plus the community is just great, man.

536
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Best.

537
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,760
Just a great group of people to work with.

538
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
The best.

539
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,080
Linux Academy is great.

540
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
My team is wonderful.

541
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,840
I mean, it's been a great experience for me.

542
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
I love it.

543
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,360
Alex is also a new member of the community and to the team.

544
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:53,120
And Alex, I think one of the interesting aspects of your story is you are new to the United

545
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
States.

546
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:02,440
So that's a moving from London to the United States is it's a fundamental life change.

547
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,400
And you kind of found your people almost immediately.

548
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,520
I can't thank the community enough.

549
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:14,320
So my wife and I came on holiday vacation to America last year, and we met you at Texas

550
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,520
Linux Fest for the first time.

551
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,080
I met Cheese also, props to him.

552
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,520
And we stayed in touch on Telegram as part of the JB Texas group after that.

553
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,960
When I went back to Texas Linux Fest this year, it was like meeting a group of old friends,

554
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
genuinely.

555
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,800
I mean, and the community is just, how can you describe it other than wonderful?

556
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,720
It's really like there's these rings of community.

557
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,520
There's people that are lightly involved.

558
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,720
They listen and they kind of follow.

559
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,760
There's folks that get more engaged in the different interaction mechanisms like Telegram

560
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,360
or IRC or email or whatever.

561
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,760
All kinds of different ways to communicate.

562
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Yeah.

563
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,120
So it's a little bit more of a niche.

564
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,360
And then there's like that niche of a niche where it's the people we see in person a lot

565
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,680
and we talk to a lot.

566
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,000
As people kind of filter into that smaller inner circle, they do become lifelong friends.

567
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,120
It's really something.

568
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,120
And we've just got through this massive push of events, which we'll talk about in a moment.

569
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,360
But it has really kind of been, we've been like in a pressure cooker of events recently.

570
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,140
So we've gotten a full dose of it.

571
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:19,600
But before we go there, Wes, let's start with your big standout items of the year so far.

572
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
We got to do this now.

573
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
We just got to do it.

574
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,440
If we did this at the end of the year, it'd be like a four-hour show.

575
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
So we got to do it now.

576
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,800
And I think I would have forgotten half the stuff.

577
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,120
There's already a lot to keep track of.

578
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Yeah.

579
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,340
Yeah, big time.

580
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:37,640
You note in here, and I agree, it has been an impressive year for gaming on Linux.

581
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,960
Technically Proton launched August of 2018, but it's really hit its refinement phase

582
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
in 2019.

583
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,480
We also got Wine 4.0 in 2019.

584
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,800
And that's all great.

585
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,640
But the story that really got my attention while I was doing some research for this show,

586
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,280
that's the story of AV1.

587
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,800
Because, Chris, I'm sure you remember the dark old days of media playback on Linux when

588
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:05,160
MP3 was still super duper patent encumbered and you had to go to extra miles to just find

589
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,520
the right codecs to install.

590
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,360
I paid hard-earned money for the Fluendo codecs so that way I could legally watch movies and

591
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
play MP3.

592
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,360
You good citizen, you.

593
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,880
Thanks to things like AV1, that's just not happening anymore, right?

594
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,600
I mean, even H.264, we're in a good place now, but it hasn't always been that way.

595
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,720
I think AV1 is a wonderful success story of different actors in this space recognizing

596
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,920
that this is a shared layer that they can all develop in the open with open source.

597
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,880
They don't have to compete there, and they've done it in a great way.

598
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,480
So one example is they needed a faster decoder for AV1, right, and they have a reference

599
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,560
one, but it's really just designed as a reference for the spec, it's not for performance.

600
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,280
They reached out to the nonprofit behind VLC and contracted them to develop one.

601
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,840
And now that's chipping in Firefox and it has amazing performance.

602
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,960
Yeah, and they're seeing some adoption.

603
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,520
I think they, you know, it's early days, like 12% of media playback is not a lot, but it's

604
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
12%.

605
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,460
And you also see, you know, big names getting involved, people like Intel and Netflix this

606
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,440
year who are working on improving the encoding side, which might be something we'll have

607
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,620
to play with as well.

608
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,840
That's going to help a lot.

609
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,880
Oh, let's give Elle a chance here.

610
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,600
Elle, what kind of stood out to you this year so far in 2019?

611
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,320
The one that stood out the most to me was the one that affected me coming before I came

612
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
here.

613
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,960
I came from an OpenStack background.

614
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,520
So when OpenStack Summit announced that they were going to be turning into the Open Infrastructure

615
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,880
Summit, I didn't think a lot about it and now looking back, I really wish I would have

616
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,200
because I think it really would have outlined what my year was going to look like.

617
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,680
It really has gone from having several different types of conferences to almost every conference

618
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,600
that I go to being focused around containers and more specifically Kubernetes.

619
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Yeah.

620
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,080
I think the moment when you, when you report it back from DockerCon and you're like, ah,

621
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,020
Kubernetes is basically taken over.

622
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,740
It's like a Kubernetes conference now.

623
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
That's when it hit.

624
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
That's when it really hit us.

625
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,680
It's like it is that the Docker hype has been superseded by the Kubernetes hype and it's

626
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,120
taking over these different events.

627
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,840
It's like maximum hype mode now.

628
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Hyper hype.

629
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,280
Hybrid cloud, hybrid cloud hype.

630
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,720
Now, there's also the community aspect for this year too.

631
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,360
And I think that's something that I don't know if I just kind of took it and ran from

632
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,600
it or it's something that you guys were doing before I came here, but when I went to scale

633
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,200
and it was my very first scale I've ever gone to, you guys hosted a dinner after the event

634
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
and it was different.

635
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,400
Like you get to meet people at conferences and you have short talks during the halls

636
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,120
or when you're waiting for talks to start, but you don't get to really know someone.

637
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,800
And when we were sitting there having dinner, people start talking about the projects that

638
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
they were working on.

639
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,480
You know, you'll hear somebody just kind of like, well, you don't know where I work at,

640
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,740
but hypothetically, and you kind of get to find out what people are really doing on their

641
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,740
spare time.

642
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,740
Yeah.

643
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,740
I love that.

644
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,740
So I just kind of kicked off with that.

645
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,920
And then I have what I call hacker family dinners where we just get together and it's

646
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,560
NDA is understood and we just come, we break bread and we get to really know one another.

647
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,960
And it's been an amazing experience.

648
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,960
It really is a great way to get to know someone, sharing a meal.

649
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
Yeah.

650
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
Yeah.

651
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,920
It has been, it has, like I was just saying, Cheese, it's been like the pressure cookers

652
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
section of events.

653
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,320
Like we've just been doing event after event, a lot of stuff going on in 2019 so far.

654
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
Absolutely, man.

655
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,640
So the first half of the year, right before I came on and Ella had mentioned it, you guys

656
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,160
were at scale, super jelly, just missed it, just missed it.

657
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,640
And I really, really, really, really, really wanted to go.

658
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:43,960
But you know, and then on the family dinner thing, we should do a potluck.

659
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,440
That would be interesting to see what everyone would bring, right?

660
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,560
That would be good.

661
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,080
So scale was the first part of the year and then moved into Linux Fest Northwest, which

662
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,760
is kind of the Jupiter Broadcasting home base conference.

663
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
So fun.

664
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Wow.

665
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
Linux Fest was so crazy.

666
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Crazy.

667
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
I hope it wasn't peak Linux Fest.

668
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,440
You know, the thing that was, the thing about Linux Fest this year is we just said, Chase,

669
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,040
just take care of the video for us.

670
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Just I'm done with videos.

671
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,600
I am so glad we did.

672
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,320
And then we used that extra time to start up that room and it was packed.

673
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Amazing.

674
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,520
I think that's going to be something we'll have to repeat.

675
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,520
Absolutely.

676
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,040
I think the room was, we had to end up turning people away from the room and they still came

677
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,440
in anyway.

678
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,000
But Elle had a talk there, Alex had a talk there.

679
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Jim had a talk there.

680
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I did.

681
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Jim just joined us.

682
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Hey, Jim.

683
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
What's going on?

684
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh, you know, just doing some podcasting.

685
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,200
We were just talking about TechSnap a little bit ago.

686
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Yes, Jim did talk.

687
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Anyways, continue on, cheese.

688
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Can't forget Alan.

689
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,680
Alan was there too doing his talks.

690
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Oh yeah, Mr. Jude.

691
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,000
That was an amazing JB family turnout.

692
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,080
That was really good.

693
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,080
It was really awesome.

694
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
It was really awesome.

695
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,840
And then right after that, two weeks after that, Chris, myself, and Wes were all off

696
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,880
to Boston for Red Hat Summit, of course, where all of that news kind of trickled out.

697
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,760
I shouldn't say trickled out, but all that news kind of came out of that.

698
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Burst it out.

699
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,040
And that was the release where the new RHEL was out, new version of OpenShift was out,

700
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,220
Satya Nadella up on stage.

701
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,880
The Red Hatter over here was very jealous that he wasn't there.

702
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,520
Ironically, you weren't there, but we were.

703
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,240
Red carpet treatment, lasers, like it was a real show.

704
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,480
And we have blog posts of all of these that we were at, so if you'd like to go back and

705
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,520
look at some of these and read and kind of look at some of the pictures and kind of check

706
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,920
out the event, you can do that at LinuxUnplugged.com.

707
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,800
Also Clear Linux, you and Brent went off to the Intel campus to check out Clear Linux.

708
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,100
Yeah, down to Portland.

709
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,480
And you all had an interesting stay at, I think it was the Jupiter Hotel or something

710
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
like that?

711
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:50,360
Yeah, we stayed at the Jupiter Hotel and made good connections with the community manager

712
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
for Clear Linux.

713
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,840
That was really nice.

714
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,160
And got unique swag from the Jupiter Hotel, which we actually still have in the studio

715
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
with us right now.

716
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Oh, do you?

717
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,280
You'll have to listen to the episode, though, to find out what it is, because let's just

718
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,700
say I don't want to bring the episode down.

719
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:10,200
And then after that was KubeCon, where Wes and El were off at KubeCon.

720
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,280
Oh, yeah.

721
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,880
In Spain.

722
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,400
I was super jealous of that one as well.

723
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,280
Not jealous of your travels per se, but that it looked like a blast.

724
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
Work is so hard.

725
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Yeah.

726
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,640
Yeah, but that flight, you paid for it with that flight.

727
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
That sounded awful.

728
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
Yep.

729
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:31,380
And then after that, Texas Linux Fest, of course, where it was pretty much a big chunk

730
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,600
of the crew there.

731
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,600
El gave a killer talk at Texas Linux Fest.

732
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,760
She gave her confessions of a sysadmin talk.

733
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,920
Alex has done his talk again there, his home automation talk at Texas Linux Fest.

734
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,800
And then right after that, the week after, because El is like a machine, she was down

735
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,840
at B-Sides in San Antonio.

736
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
She is a machine.

737
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,560
So it's been a busy, busy, busy season for us so far, and I expect we're going to have

738
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,000
a few more coming down the pike.

739
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Yeah.

740
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
We're not done yet.

741
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,920
A little birdie tells me we may be at Texas Cyber Summit in October.

742
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
See, what?

743
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Leak alert, leak alert.

744
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
A little birdie tells me that.

745
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,720
You know, those little birdies, if they're talking about October, they got to be talking

746
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,600
about All Things Open and Raleigh, right?

747
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Oh, maybe.

748
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
We could do both.

749
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,800
Are you coming to Raleigh, Jim?

750
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,240
Oh, I'm absolutely going to Raleigh.

751
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,560
I'm at All Things Open every year.

752
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
It's a huge show.

753
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
Oh, awesome.

754
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
I'll have to buy you a beer.

755
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
I live like four miles from the tower.

756
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Oh, yeah.

757
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,560
Cool.

758
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Awesome.

759
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Look forward to that.

760
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
I kind of want to be there.

761
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
I want to be at that table.

762
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
I want to be sharing those beers.

763
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,120
So, Jim, what's struck you about the news so far in 2019 in Linux and open source?

764
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,360
Well, I mean, for me, it's a no brainer, man.

765
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,800
ZFS 0.8 coming out, it's huge.

766
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Yes.

767
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Yeah.

768
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,640
Also, I mean, the rebase, right, on ZFS for FreeBSD and other projects, rebasing on ZFS

769
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
for Linux?

770
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
Yeah, absolutely.

771
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,520
I mean, so, you know, all the new features in 0.8, like native encryption and, you know,

772
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,800
encrypted send and receive, those are all like, those are the big sexy things, right?

773
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,440
But the rebase is really cool because it means that all the platforms get to get more tightly

774
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,240
integrated in the future, you know?

775
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,640
Removing BSD and Linux are going to be, you know, kind of one happy family in the same

776
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,800
GitHub repositories and, you know, open ZFS is going to become more of a thing rather than

777
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,920
like a concept that, you know, ZFS on Linux and FreeBSD ZFS and, you know, on down the

778
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,360
line are just sort of adhering to, you know?

779
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,320
I'm really glad you joined to point that out because that wasn't on any of our lists for

780
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
some reason.

781
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
That's a big oversight.

782
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,000
Having had some great ZFS on Linux success just in the recent past.

783
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,880
We take it for granted because it's so awesome.

784
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Yeah, definitely.

785
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Definitely.

786
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,800
Just to highlight the value of community and things like that, Jim, you gave an excellent

787
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,760
talk along with Alan at Linux Fest Northwest about ZFS and ever since I have been using

788
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,800
it and we exchanged messages on Twitter and things like that and, yeah, I just want, you

789
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,480
know, when people talk about community, that's the kind of thing that we mean, right?

790
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,600
You meet these people in meet space, in the real world, you exchange messages on Twitter

791
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:06,560
afterwards and you end up changing your workflows and adopting new technologies as a consequence.

792
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Absolutely.

793
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,560
So, Alex, if you hit the point now where you're like, I don't know how I ever got by without

794
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,080
ZFS.

795
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,200
I kind of did recently.

796
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
I did that.

797
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,880
When we switched from FreeNAS over to Fedora and we could keep the same pool and we just

798
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,560
swapped out the operating system and we installed a radically newer, more updated operating

799
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,080
system and we were able to reconnect those pools and everything worked just fine, I was

800
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,360
like, okay, that's legit.

801
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
That's legitimate.

802
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,320
I must admit, my mind blew a little bit when I started using ZFS Send over WireGuard this

803
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,680
weekend though.

804
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
That was cool.

805
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Yeah.

806
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:47,280
I mean, the remote replication, there's just, yeah, unless you're spending, you know, $100,000

807
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,400
and using some proprietary system, there's just nothing else like it.

808
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Yeah.

809
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Yeah, it's been really cool.

810
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
All right.

811
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,720
Let's get us up here.

812
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,680
Honorable mentions from Drew because he couldn't join us.

813
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,880
Gnome's readoption and just the flurry of improvements since now multiple different

814
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,600
teams like Canonical and LIS and obviously Red Hat and whatnot are working on it as well

815
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,480
as just the rapid pace of improvement in general.

816
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,360
I had a couple of call outs, number one, going back to Microsoft, the fact that Microsoft

817
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,000
is now publicly admitting and I use that word intentionally that Linux is the dominant OS

818
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
on Azure.

819
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I've been hearing that for a while.

820
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,320
I'd heard 60% a year ago from somebody who would know.

821
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,600
So I think it's been that way for a while and I think it's a lot more now.

822
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,440
And that kind of tells you the direction their compass is pointed right now.

823
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,040
The story that surprised me, Pi 4 in 2019, expected I'd have to wait.

824
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,280
Who'd have thought?

825
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
And I got one.

826
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,760
I ordered it, it hasn't arrived yet, but I got the four gig desktop.

827
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,880
Oh, I'm excited.

828
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,800
Did you see the news about the USB-C flaw on the fours though?

829
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,720
That really bugs me, Jim.

830
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,520
I hate that crap.

831
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,760
USB-C's already been a hot mess as it is.

832
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,800
We didn't need this complication.

833
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,760
Yeah, I did order with a power adapter though.

834
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
I suppose nothing can be perfect.

835
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,240
And hey, winter is coming, so you've got a free space heater right there.

836
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,800
I might try one of those water coolers.

837
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,400
I've seen a couple of water cooling solutions pop up online, that's just adorable.

838
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,600
It's just adorable, so I may do that.

839
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,160
And then if they launch an eight gig next year with the USB-C fix so it can take any

840
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,640
power adapter, then I'll buy that too, because you know what, it's 30 bucks.

841
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,440
So the other thing I didn't quite see coming, but it makes sense, is Mozilla's hard shift

842
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,160
into services.

843
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,160
There's been a lot of different things around this recently, but I just, I think it's time.

844
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,640
It kind of makes me sad a little bit on the inside that this is the way it has to go,

845
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,100
but if this gets them off Google Sauce, good enough.

846
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,480
And then the last two.

847
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,920
Number one, I got to admit when I was wrong, Pop!OS has had a damn good year.

848
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,720
You know what, part of it has been hustle on System76's part.

849
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,960
Oh yeah, absolutely.

850
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,920
Part of it has been a keen, consistent design language that has connected with people, and

851
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,460
then making those easily available online, which helps sort of spread the hype.

852
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:11,200
And then part of it has been good media coverage, because they positioned their desktop OS in

853
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,560
a way that made it presentable to certain individuals, and it got good coverage.

854
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,800
And when you combine those things, it's been a pretty good year for Pop!OS.

855
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,640
I didn't see it coming.

856
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,360
Just in the last two weeks, you've had Linus Tech Tips do videos on Pop!OS.

857
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:31,200
You've had Wendell from Level One extolling the virtues of Pop!OS with PCI Pass-Through.

858
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,920
So yeah, whatever they're doing, they're doing a good job.

859
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
I'll say this too.

860
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:41,400
I think in retrospect, my biggest concern was a lack of time to work on it, just because

861
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
they have so many other initiatives.

862
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,160
There's a lot going on, yeah.

863
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
You know what though?

864
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,200
There are a lot of popular distros out there that are much smaller teams, when you think

865
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
about it.

866
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,000
And they're not even full-time employees of a company, where there's a no-consistency

867
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
story.

868
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,800
I think when I first came out, we were kind of wondering, all right, well, is this just

869
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,520
a slight customization, you know, a distro for their machines?

870
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,160
But no, I mean, it's grown into much more than that.

871
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,760
I am glad I always couched it with, I'm curious to see where they take it, because they could

872
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,040
add more stuff.

873
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,480
And when they switched up the installer, when they worked with the elementary OS team to

874
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,760
do their own pop shop and stuff, I think they added a few key differentiators there, and

875
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
they're continuing to build on that.

876
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
We'll see where it goes.

877
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,640
I'm not running it yet, but I'll probably give it a go soon.

878
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,440
And then last but not least, this one didn't surprise me.

879
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,560
I'm just, I guess I'm impressed with the very, just sort of like everybody showed up to this

880
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,240
game, which is streaming, game streaming.

881
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,440
Stadia is sort of the forefront in our community, but Microsoft has a solution, Nvidia has a

882
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:43,360
solution, Sony has a solution, and then Apple has their subscription service, which is not

883
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,080
game streaming per se, but it's sort of like all-you-can-eat games that download to the

884
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,920
iOS device as you need it.

885
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,480
So kind of like game streaming, except it's offline.

886
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,280
On-demand games as you need them.

887
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Yeah.

888
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,200
Those have been sort of my eye poppers or surprises or, like I said, sometimes corrections

889
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,680
I think I need to make.

890
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
That Pop OS one.

891
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,360
How did you not see gaming as a service coming, though, Chris?

892
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,600
Not so much I didn't see it coming.

893
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:12,760
I think, you're right, because I actually was an OnLive beta user back in the day, and

894
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,160
I actually have an Nvidia GeForce streaming service active subscription, so I actually

895
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,420
do some gaming streaming, but I think what I didn't expect is that everybody would show

896
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,420
up.

897
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,000
It kind of popped all together right at the same time.

898
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Yeah.

899
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,800
Like Microsoft, Sony, and Google all just like, hey, by the way, boom.

900
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,640
But you know, it's really, when you look at it in the term, like the services world where

901
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,080
everybody's trying to grow their services revenue, they've got to do everything they

902
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,080
can, right?

903
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,080
Everybody's got to get that reoccurring revenue.

904
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Woo.

905
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,360
It does make sense in that context quite a bit.

906
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,960
I hate to admit it, but I bought the Stadia Founders pack thing.

907
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,720
Why do you hate to admit it, Chris?

908
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,040
Because it's 180 bucks for a Google game streaming service that is probably going to get shut

909
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,520
down in four years.

910
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,120
Well, it could be more expensive.

911
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,840
You just divide it by four, it's fine.

912
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Yeah, yeah.

913
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,840
Actually, but you know what?

914
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
I do it for the people.

915
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
Well, at least-

916
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,880
I am very curious.

917
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,760
At least you still end up with a Chromecast, right?

918
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,760
You know what?

919
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
Good point.

920
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,640
It's a controller I could probably use for something else.

921
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,640
Exactly.

922
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,880
Well, and let's not pretend any of us hasn't wasted more than $180 on some project that

923
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,880
didn't pan out.

924
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
Touche.

925
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,880
Man, thanks, guys.

926
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,440
You're making me feel a lot better about my impulsive decisions.

927
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,000
We just all bought it too and want to play there with you.

928
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,280
Yeah, that's what it is.

929
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,880
I'll have it set up here at the studio.

930
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,120
I compare those kinds of media boxes to the Nvidia Shield.

931
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:38,640
I bought one four years ago for 150 pounds, and yeah, that thing's still my main media

932
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,640
machine.

933
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,920
But if you get four or five years out of it, I think, for that kind of money, it's good.

934
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,880
The future of this technology is all virtual GPUs and that kind of thing, so it's not a

935
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,940
one-to-one relationship with the hardware they have to have in their data centers.

936
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,600
And they're using some of the pass-through type technologies we talked about a couple

937
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,640
of weeks ago to make this a reality.

938
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,640
This technology is just super duper cool, and these are the use cases that happen as

939
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
a consequence.

940
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,240
It's a lot of fun.

941
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,520
And Stadia could have longer-term ramifications for Google's other platforms, obviously, Chromebooks.

942
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,320
I mean, that's a given, but you could imagine a future where game developers could accelerate

943
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:23,680
a portion of their Android game on a Google GPU cloud if they're on an Android client

944
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,240
that doesn't support those GPU extensions or isn't fast enough or the battery life is

945
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,240
low.

946
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,680
Why not just sort of offload some of that and have some bits of it just stream back

947
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,680
down to the client?

948
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,680
I like that.

949
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,680
You break your phone.

950
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,680
You switch to your backup phone.

951
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,680
You keep playing all the games you have.

952
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,680
Not if you're Huawei, though.

953
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,680
No.

954
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,680
Oh, too soon.

955
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,680
Too soon.

956
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,680
Way too soon.

957
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,840
Go get some Jim and Wes over at TechSnap again, TechSnap.Systems.

958
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,800
It's a great show.

959
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,240
Go check out Elle over at Choose Linux.

960
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:59,400
She joins Drew and Joe on a new revamped, refreshed, and better-than-ever Choose Linux.

961
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,680
Love the last couple of episodes.

962
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,160
Go check those out, ChooseLinux.Show.

963
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,400
And maybe we can get them to try Endeavor and report back to us.

964
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,360
I like you delegating, Wes.

965
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,360
Look at you.

966
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,360
Whoopsie.

967
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,680
That's some management-level thinking right there.

968
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
All right.

969
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,840
In the meantime, go to LinuxOmplug.com for all of our links, subscription stuff, and

970
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
whatnots.

971
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:46,080
It's Live on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv, where we'll see you then.
