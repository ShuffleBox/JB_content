WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.860
Look at this cool toy that Wes found.

00:01.860 --> 00:04.500
It's a bootable CD and a retro game,

00:04.500 --> 00:06.480
and it all fits in a single tweet.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.700
How is this shenanigans possible, Wes?

00:08.700 --> 00:09.540
Well, a little bit,

00:09.540 --> 00:12.960
just by abusing the El Torito standard,

00:12.960 --> 00:14.160
and being exceedingly clever,

00:14.160 --> 00:16.360
and then also because the dark arts,

00:16.360 --> 00:17.500
you use a little pearl.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.600
Yeah, it's a little pearl

00:18.600 --> 00:21.240
with a long string of characters,

00:21.240 --> 00:23.840
and then you pipe that through Base64,

00:23.840 --> 00:27.040
and then you output that result to an ISO image.

00:27.040 --> 00:27.920
Yeah, exactly.

00:27.920 --> 00:28.760
And then you can,

00:28.760 --> 00:30.240
I just tested it out here,

00:30.240 --> 00:31.960
boots right up in QEMU,

00:31.960 --> 00:34.680
and you've got yourself a little retro game.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.100
The game may be not super fun,

00:37.100 --> 00:40.520
but the write-up about how this all works is a lot of fun.

00:40.520 --> 00:41.360
Back in the day,

00:41.360 --> 00:43.120
you used to try to fit an entire bootable environment

00:43.120 --> 00:44.880
on a floppy disk.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.680
Now, in 2018, it's fitted in a tweet,

00:47.680 --> 00:49.560
and it's actually possible.

00:49.560 --> 00:50.580
God, I love Linux.

00:52.080 --> 00:54.940
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 260,

00:54.940 --> 00:59.940
for July 31st, 2018.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.920
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged,

01:09.920 --> 01:11.520
your weekly Linux talk show

01:11.520 --> 01:13.320
that is surrounded by machines,

01:13.320 --> 01:14.680
trapped in a hot room,

01:14.680 --> 01:16.400
and jacked up on caffeine.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.240
My name is Chris.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.080
My name is Wes.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.000
Hello, Mr. Payne, and of course,

01:20.000 --> 01:21.680
back again, like every week,

01:21.680 --> 01:22.500
is Mr. Brent.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.340
Hello, Brent.

01:23.340 --> 01:24.180
Hello, guys.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.020
How's it going?

01:25.020 --> 01:26.320
Fantastic, always doing well

01:26.320 --> 01:27.880
when we're all together to do a podcast,

01:27.880 --> 01:30.040
and we have a great episode today.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.120
One, Mr. Barton George from Dell

01:32.120 --> 01:33.380
will be stopping by the program

01:33.380 --> 01:35.400
to update us on the Sputnik program,

01:35.400 --> 01:36.960
how things are going,

01:36.960 --> 01:40.640
the challenges that Chromebooks may pose

01:40.640 --> 01:42.400
to the Sputnik program,

01:42.400 --> 01:43.360
and much more,

01:43.360 --> 01:45.240
including a little looking forward.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.360
So I'm really looking forward to that chat.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.560
He's coming up in just a little bit,

01:47.560 --> 01:49.600
but before we get there,

01:49.600 --> 01:51.800
we're gonna do a bunch of community news,

01:51.800 --> 01:54.520
some big news for us neon fans.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.520
Microsoft is switching to a service model,

01:56.520 --> 01:59.280
and we wonder how that's gonna affect Linux,

01:59.280 --> 02:01.100
and then we need to talk about security,

02:01.100 --> 02:02.600
and where it really begins,

02:02.600 --> 02:03.840
and that's at your home router,

02:03.840 --> 02:05.560
and some open source projects

02:05.560 --> 02:08.680
that can help you achieve better security on your edge.

02:08.680 --> 02:11.560
Then Corita's got some great news,

02:11.560 --> 02:13.500
but you'll never guess

02:13.500 --> 02:15.140
where some of their money's coming from,

02:15.140 --> 02:16.360
and then later on in the show,

02:16.360 --> 02:17.880
after we chat with Barton,

02:17.880 --> 02:19.680
we're gonna wrap it up with not one,

02:19.680 --> 02:23.000
not two, but yes, my friends, three great app picks,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.040
because I don't know, sometimes we just go crazy.

02:26.040 --> 02:26.880
You can't stop us.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.560
We were just finding great stuff throughout the week,

02:28.560 --> 02:29.800
and we're like, we gotta put that in the show.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.020
We gotta put that in the show.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.520
So there's so much to cover,

02:33.520 --> 02:35.700
and the only thing left to do before we can get into it

02:35.700 --> 02:36.840
is bring in that mumble room.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.760
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.160
What's up? Hello.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.080
Good evening.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.560
Hello, good evening, good afternoon, good morning.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.240
As I always say now, time approves,

02:45.240 --> 02:47.360
because it's different for all y'alls,

02:47.360 --> 02:50.800
and I'm very happy to start the show off

02:50.800 --> 02:52.820
with some news about one of my favorite,

02:52.820 --> 02:54.900
don't call it a distributions, distributions,

02:54.900 --> 02:56.160
and that's KDE Neon,

02:56.160 --> 02:57.960
and we've all been kind of wondering,

02:57.960 --> 03:01.880
when's this thing gonna land on an 18.04 base?

03:01.880 --> 03:03.520
KDE Neon, if you're not familiar,

03:03.520 --> 03:06.360
is a rebasing of Ubuntu LTS,

03:06.360 --> 03:08.920
and then they take the latest upstream

03:08.920 --> 03:10.680
plasma desktop components,

03:10.680 --> 03:13.680
cute components, and put it on top of 16.04.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.520
It's great.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.720
So it's just everything that you might want

03:15.720 --> 03:17.440
if you had 16.04 and didn't wanna go through

03:17.440 --> 03:19.760
the rigmarole of getting that plasma desktop

03:19.760 --> 03:20.680
set up for yourself.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.400
Yeah, I mean, and its main appeal really is

03:23.400 --> 03:26.880
that you have a stable, predictable 16.04,

03:26.880 --> 03:30.840
or soon 18.04 base, which is kind of boring,

03:30.840 --> 03:31.960
doesn't really change a lot.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.400
But that good kind of boring.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.000
Yeah, exactly, the right kind of boring,

03:36.000 --> 03:40.160
with a really aggressive, fresh desktop environment,

03:40.160 --> 03:43.600
where the desktop level applications are kept pretty fresh,

03:43.600 --> 03:47.040
and that is a super appealing approach to me,

03:47.040 --> 03:49.280
and now that I'm all in on the plasma desktop,

03:49.280 --> 03:52.080
Neon really fit well in that spot for me.

03:52.080 --> 03:56.000
But I do admit, since Kubuntu came out based on 18.04,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.640
really haven't been installing much Neon anymore.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.880
Too little, too late?

03:59.880 --> 04:02.040
Well, no, it's just, if I'm gonna be building systems

04:02.040 --> 04:03.760
that I wanna last for five years,

04:03.760 --> 04:06.840
I would like to base them on 18.04, not 16.04.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.920
Plus, I've been waiting for them to make this transition

04:08.920 --> 04:11.160
to 18.04, so that way I don't really have to weather it.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.480
I still have two Neon systems left in production,

04:13.480 --> 04:16.440
one of them is the one I'm reading this off of right now.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.680
And one of them, the other one is my XPS 13,

04:18.680 --> 04:20.680
which I've been using extensively on these road trips

04:20.680 --> 04:22.200
and other trips that I've been on.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.200
Do you notice any difference in stability

04:24.200 --> 04:26.440
or upgrade problems or any other maintenance issues

04:26.440 --> 04:27.280
between the two?

04:27.280 --> 04:29.360
I remain to have, actually I have it on three systems

04:29.360 --> 04:30.480
now that I think about it.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.840
And on one of the three, I have issues

04:33.840 --> 04:36.040
where my background, my desktop goes away,

04:36.040 --> 04:37.600
certain things break for a little bit,

04:37.600 --> 04:39.160
and then I have to log out and log back in

04:39.160 --> 04:40.000
to get it to work.

04:40.000 --> 04:40.820
Nothing major.

04:40.820 --> 04:41.660
Still not great.

04:41.660 --> 04:42.640
Doesn't come up on Kubuntu,

04:42.640 --> 04:45.200
only manifests itself on my Neon systems.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.480
It's not a big deal, it's not the end of the world.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.680
But I am looking forward to them making that transition

04:49.680 --> 04:54.060
to 18.04, and Jonathan Riddle posted over on his blog,

04:54.060 --> 04:55.720
that we'll have linked in the show notes,

04:55.720 --> 04:58.120
that they're getting really close to that now.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.100
They really just have a few things to work out.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.100
They're testing the ISOs, and then it's some tidying,

05:03.100 --> 05:03.940
and they're done.

05:03.940 --> 05:04.760
They already have a bunch of things

05:04.760 --> 05:05.960
that are kind of working.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.900
Some of it just has to be done a little more officially

05:07.900 --> 05:10.200
instead of like a hack or a script or something.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.460
But it looks pretty good for the Neon distribution,

05:12.460 --> 05:15.720
and 18.04 could be just around the corner.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.160
Then you've got elementary OS,

05:17.160 --> 05:20.200
which is just around the corner with its base on 18.04.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.280
And you now have 18.04.1 that's recently shipped.

05:23.280 --> 05:27.360
So it's a good cycle right now for 18.04.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.820
And in six months, that will start to slow.

05:30.820 --> 05:33.200
In a year, we'll be out of cycle a little bit,

05:33.200 --> 05:34.120
starting to get a little old.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.000
But right now, it's really in that sweet spot.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.680
And if you're building a system to last for a few years,

05:38.680 --> 05:40.140
there's not a lot of distributions

05:40.140 --> 05:43.760
that offer a ton of desktop application availability

05:43.760 --> 05:45.640
and five years of support.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.160
So they're really in a powerful position,

05:47.160 --> 05:48.720
more so than they've been in a long time.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.040
And that's not to downplay the competitors,

05:51.040 --> 05:53.240
who are also in a really great position,

05:53.240 --> 05:55.140
and offer a lot of the same functionality

05:55.140 --> 05:58.560
now that Canonical is switching back to GNOME.

05:58.560 --> 06:02.640
But when you combine it with the overall network effect,

06:02.640 --> 06:03.920
the application availability,

06:03.920 --> 06:05.800
the increasing Snap Store availability,

06:05.800 --> 06:08.960
and then these other really nice flavors,

06:08.960 --> 06:12.200
like Kubuntu and Ubuntu Mate, and even Neon,

06:12.200 --> 06:14.720
don't call it a flavor, don't call it a distribution,

06:14.720 --> 06:18.160
all offer essentially this Ubuntu base

06:18.160 --> 06:19.860
that we all know and understand

06:19.860 --> 06:21.080
with their own fresh takes on it

06:21.080 --> 06:24.120
in a way that I still don't really see happening

06:24.120 --> 06:26.040
in the rest of the Linux distribution world.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.000
Do you agree with that assessment?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.600
Yeah, it's kind of hard to put your finger on,

06:28.600 --> 06:30.960
but when you have that level of consistency

06:30.960 --> 06:35.920
on that far end of just your main core of your system,

06:35.920 --> 06:36.880
it's a part of your mind

06:36.880 --> 06:38.080
that gets to go to sleep for a while.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.240
You don't have to think too hard about it.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.720
You kind of focus on everything else

06:40.720 --> 06:41.960
because you don't have to fight like,

06:41.960 --> 06:44.060
oh, nope, on that system I have Phish,

06:44.060 --> 06:47.360
and this system I have Apt, and that one is Pac-Man.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.200
None of it.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.640
I'm not even really saying this as like,

06:50.640 --> 06:52.740
I'm not trying to sell anyone on Ubuntu.

06:52.740 --> 06:55.400
I'm not trying to advance the Ubuntu agenda here.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.380
It's just an observation that I seem to have realized

06:58.380 --> 07:00.960
is that they have a really strong market here

07:00.960 --> 07:03.240
where they have this LTS base

07:03.240 --> 07:06.100
that these other flavors or derivatives even

07:06.100 --> 07:08.680
that aren't official can base off of,

07:08.680 --> 07:11.600
and as an end user, that's a known quantity.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.920
It's like a brand almost.

07:12.920 --> 07:16.160
It's like the Ubuntu base is a known brand

07:16.160 --> 07:18.280
that you can recognize as an end user.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.880
It makes you maybe a little more comfortable

07:19.880 --> 07:22.440
in other degrees of uncertainty or customization

07:22.440 --> 07:23.280
because you're like, okay,

07:23.280 --> 07:24.360
well, they're not going to mess it up so bad.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.760
It's still going to be a great Ubuntu LTS base.

07:26.760 --> 07:27.600
That's what I was, yeah,

07:27.600 --> 07:29.440
that's exactly what I was trying to get to.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.640
Again, I don't say that to detract

07:30.640 --> 07:32.060
from like what the work Fedora is doing

07:32.060 --> 07:35.000
or OpenSUSE and Arch, and look at Antigros.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.040
I love Antigros.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.440
Or Manjaro, all of that's really kind of the same thing,

07:39.440 --> 07:42.800
but nothing has the market penetration that Ubuntu has.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.520
And in my personal opinion,

07:44.520 --> 07:47.240
if you're going to go with one of these Ubuntu derivatives,

07:47.240 --> 07:51.120
Ubuntu, Monte, Elementary, and KDE Neon

07:51.120 --> 07:53.620
are like the best of the best, really.

07:53.620 --> 07:54.800
Not to take away from the other flavors,

07:54.800 --> 07:56.040
but man, if I don't just-

07:56.040 --> 07:57.960
You get some pretty unique setups and experiences

07:57.960 --> 07:59.280
even being in this one family.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.120
Yes.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.680
I find it funny that you don't mention Ubuntu,

08:02.680 --> 08:05.160
you know, main classic, whatever you want to call it,

08:05.160 --> 08:07.720
just known, like you're all about the flavors.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.160
I think when you're talking about trying to get a unique

08:10.160 --> 08:13.960
kind of interesting take on the Linux desktop

08:13.960 --> 08:16.640
that's truly different than anything you see other places,

08:16.640 --> 08:20.080
that's where these other flavors or derivatives come in.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.520
Not to take away from the great work

08:21.520 --> 08:23.760
that's happening in mainline Ubuntu.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.120
I got love for it all today, I really do.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.120
But it's hard to beat those three

08:29.120 --> 08:31.320
kind of standout derivatives or flavors,

08:31.320 --> 08:32.800
whatever you want to call it.

08:32.800 --> 08:35.560
This is all kind of academic though,

08:35.560 --> 08:37.960
compared to what the Windows world may be going through

08:37.960 --> 08:39.600
in the next couple of years.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.640
Microsoft is making some big changes

08:42.640 --> 08:45.400
and they're getting ready, I should say,

08:45.400 --> 08:50.400
to replace Windows 10 with the Microsoft Managed Desktop.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.920
This will be a desktop as a service offering.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.160
Instead of owning Windows, you would rent it by the month.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.780
The acronym for this is DAS, D-A-A-S,

08:58.780 --> 09:00.280
and it's not really new.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.480
Citrix has been doing this, VMware has been doing this.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.480
I think Amazon offers, yeah.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.100
But the Microsoft Managed Desktop is a new take on it.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.680
It avoids the latency problem

09:09.680 --> 09:12.160
of other desktop as a service offerings

09:12.160 --> 09:16.240
by keeping the bulk of the operating system on your PC.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.480
But you would no longer be in charge of the PCOS

09:18.480 --> 09:19.800
or the hardware itself.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.360
Instead it would be automatically provisioned by Microsoft

09:23.360 --> 09:25.580
and then maintained by Microsoft.

09:25.580 --> 09:27.160
Now that is very vague,

09:27.160 --> 09:29.800
so I wanted to get some more details on this.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.960
So I went over to Mary Jo Foley's blog

09:31.960 --> 09:34.840
and she actually got a Microsoft representative

09:34.840 --> 09:35.660
on the record.

09:35.660 --> 09:36.500
Really?

09:36.500 --> 09:37.540
So this is some serious stuff here.

09:37.540 --> 09:39.360
This isn't just like hearsay.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.840
Let's see, let me see the name of this guy.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.800
Do you see the name of this guy here in this article?

09:43.800 --> 09:45.520
I think that's probably relevant,

09:45.520 --> 09:48.620
but I'll read it and then if we see it, I'll call it out.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.280
But it turns out, she says,

09:50.280 --> 09:51.160
Mary Jo Foley writes,

09:51.160 --> 09:53.000
I'm hearing that Microsoft Managed Desktop

09:53.000 --> 09:57.880
is basically the Microsoft version of desktop as a service.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.520
It will provide customers with the ability

09:59.520 --> 10:01.440
to lease Windows 10 devices

10:01.440 --> 10:03.800
that automatically are provisioned for them

10:03.800 --> 10:06.160
and have the operating system kept up to date

10:06.160 --> 10:09.080
for more than a single monthly fee,

10:09.080 --> 10:10.680
up to date for no more than a single monthly fee

10:10.680 --> 10:12.000
or something like that.

10:12.000 --> 10:12.920
Now here's what she writes

10:12.920 --> 10:15.320
that I think is the more insightful bit to this article.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.360
Oh, and by the way,

10:17.440 --> 10:19.320
the contact that she spoke to at Microsoft

10:19.320 --> 10:21.440
was the director of the Windows Insider Program

10:21.440 --> 10:23.360
and OS Fundamentals team,

10:23.360 --> 10:25.960
Bill Kagarugas or something.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.080
It looks like Kangarugas,

10:27.080 --> 10:28.840
but do you see that, do you see that name?

10:28.840 --> 10:30.400
K-A-R-G-O-U.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.040
K-A-R-G-O-U-N-S maybe, I don't know.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.680
But he's the director of the Windows Insider Program

10:34.680 --> 10:35.860
and OS Fundamentals team.

10:35.860 --> 10:37.480
So that's where she's getting this from.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.800
And so she says, here's the thing to think about,

10:39.800 --> 10:42.080
is Microsoft already has a number of the pieces in place

10:42.080 --> 10:43.120
to make this happen.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.800
This past year, Microsoft has been broadening availability

10:46.800 --> 10:49.680
of its Windows Autopilot Automatic Device

10:49.680 --> 10:51.240
provisioning service.

10:51.240 --> 10:54.280
It's been honing its device financing skills

10:54.280 --> 10:55.960
with programs like Surface Plus

10:55.960 --> 10:57.560
and Surface Plus for Business,

10:57.560 --> 10:59.760
so there's a leasing aspect of the hardware there,

10:59.760 --> 11:04.520
as well as Surface as a Service leasing program.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.880
I didn't even know they were offering Surface as a service.

11:06.880 --> 11:07.720
Me either.

11:07.720 --> 11:10.120
Boy, they love their acronyms.

11:10.120 --> 11:13.960
And it currently offers Windows 10, Office 365,

11:13.960 --> 11:16.560
and the Intune device management and security products

11:16.560 --> 11:18.600
from the Microsoft subscription bundle,

11:18.600 --> 11:21.280
all for one low monthly price.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.300
They've been working to put all of this together

11:23.300 --> 11:24.820
into a new service.

11:24.820 --> 11:26.600
This is what the director of Windows Insider Program

11:26.600 --> 11:27.860
talked about, he said,

11:27.860 --> 11:30.160
they're in charge of what's being called the Microsoft

11:30.160 --> 11:31.120
Managed Desktop.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.800
That's what he's been, he's been put in charge of that.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.800
And they're bringing these existing sort of separate

11:37.800 --> 11:42.080
programs that they have together under one umbrella program

11:42.080 --> 11:43.920
and then offering it to consumers.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.440
So this is a lot of Microsoft news, Chris.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.600
What does it mean to me, the Linux unplugged listener

11:47.600 --> 11:48.880
who was trying to escape?

11:48.880 --> 11:52.220
That's the big, big question is,

11:52.220 --> 11:56.000
do we just have a whole new value story now for Linux?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.600
Did Microsoft just give us a whole new value proposition

11:58.600 --> 12:02.360
in that you download a free desktop,

12:02.360 --> 12:04.520
and you install it on your hardware,

12:04.520 --> 12:06.360
and then you get free updates for life.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.440
No subscription required, you know, you can use,

12:10.440 --> 12:12.520
you can use Dropbox with your LibreOffice,

12:12.520 --> 12:14.980
you could use your Google Drive, you could use NextCloud,

12:14.980 --> 12:17.480
like whatever syncing service you want to use.

12:17.480 --> 12:21.720
The only thing is, these people that will be buying this

12:21.720 --> 12:23.220
are paying for convenience.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.360
That's the market, right?

12:24.360 --> 12:26.320
I mean, it's like leasing a car, you know, you're like,

12:26.320 --> 12:28.360
I want the abilities that you're offering,

12:28.360 --> 12:30.160
and I don't want to have to think about how you implement it

12:30.160 --> 12:31.440
or how it happens under the hood.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.880
Yeah, and they want it to just work.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.160
They want the device to show up on their desk and just work.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.880
So the problem with the Linux approach

12:37.880 --> 12:39.580
is you can argue on the money side,

12:39.580 --> 12:44.240
but then you can't really successfully argue the tool side

12:44.240 --> 12:45.440
because if the user has to implement

12:45.440 --> 12:46.680
their own cloud syncing service,

12:46.680 --> 12:48.520
if the user has to implement their own office suite,

12:48.520 --> 12:51.080
if the user has to implement their own email client,

12:51.080 --> 12:52.880
and they have to set all these things up.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.400
You're going to have to offset it with training

12:54.400 --> 12:56.120
or dedicated staff or...

12:56.120 --> 12:58.280
Contractors or something.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.280
And so what they're offering here is,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.560
well, you'll use Office 365, obviously.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.400
Of course you will.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.400
You'd use our Edivirus product,

13:04.400 --> 13:05.960
you'd use our mail services,

13:05.960 --> 13:07.240
you would use our...

13:07.240 --> 13:09.520
You probably get a couple of Azure credits

13:09.520 --> 13:11.360
to get you set up there too.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.200
Why not?

13:13.060 --> 13:16.160
I think for some markets, it'll make Linux more attractive,

13:16.160 --> 13:19.080
but I don't think for all of the markets we'd hope.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.360
I wonder, I feel like we've been talking about it

13:20.360 --> 13:22.560
maybe from a lot of the enterprise use case,

13:22.560 --> 13:25.880
but is there a security angle for people running it at home

13:25.880 --> 13:28.680
that maybe might have a better experience with Windows?

13:28.680 --> 13:30.560
I wonder if we shouldn't flip the question around

13:30.560 --> 13:33.040
and propose it to Brent as this.

13:33.040 --> 13:38.040
So if I could come to Brent and say for $45 a month,

13:38.080 --> 13:38.920
ah, let's make it 50.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.280
Let's make it kind of hurt a little bit.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.840
So for 50 bucks a month, you get a fully managed,

13:43.840 --> 13:48.280
fully set up, fairly high-end Ubuntu 18.04 device

13:48.280 --> 13:51.760
that you choose what kind of screen, that kind of stuff.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.200
If you set some of the basic parameters

13:53.200 --> 13:54.800
and that sets your monthly billing.

13:54.800 --> 13:58.480
With that is included Google Drive storage,

13:58.480 --> 13:59.880
all access to Google apps

13:59.880 --> 14:01.200
that are all branded under this initiative.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.000
So you pay 50 bucks a month, Brent.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.440
Every two years, you get a brand new Linux 18.04 machine

14:08.440 --> 14:10.200
with every cloud service pre-provisioned,

14:10.200 --> 14:12.120
pre-paid for, pre-setup.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.120
Would you do something like that

14:13.120 --> 14:16.320
or would you prefer to buy the machine once

14:16.320 --> 14:17.760
and then set all that stuff up yourself

14:17.760 --> 14:20.380
and pay for the individual services ad hoc?

14:20.380 --> 14:23.120
I love that question because I was gonna ask you,

14:23.120 --> 14:27.200
I was just gonna comment, well, in the Linux case,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.220
we can say that you actually own your hardware

14:29.220 --> 14:30.620
and your software in a way

14:30.620 --> 14:32.080
because you have control over it, right?

14:32.080 --> 14:34.880
But now that you asked me that question,

14:34.880 --> 14:37.800
it kind of changes my outlook on it

14:37.800 --> 14:40.180
because actually I think the convenience

14:40.180 --> 14:45.180
to having a monthly fee to just have everything taken care

14:45.240 --> 14:47.520
for you from hopefully someone you trust, right?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.280
I think that's a big one.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.200
Yeah, I was thinking like, imagine like it's system 76

14:52.200 --> 14:54.080
running this program or something.

14:54.080 --> 14:58.640
I think it reduces the barrier to entry for Linux,

14:58.640 --> 15:00.800
first of all, if you had that kind of option,

15:00.800 --> 15:03.840
but also just for technology, period.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.080
Because if all of these services are already

15:06.080 --> 15:09.240
all configured for you and updated,

15:09.240 --> 15:11.960
then there's a real security benefit there

15:11.960 --> 15:16.400
and a hands-off that might be nice for the end user.

15:16.400 --> 15:19.240
Like we're already used to paying for various services,

15:19.240 --> 15:23.480
like phone stuff and things like that.

15:23.480 --> 15:24.780
There's obvious markets for it

15:24.780 --> 15:27.820
if they have a surface as a service program.

15:27.820 --> 15:30.240
And this is a big appeal to Chromebooks.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.580
Let's not forget how successful Chromebooks have been.

15:32.580 --> 15:35.080
They're essentially a managed device

15:35.080 --> 15:38.200
in a less structured form than Microsoft is offering here.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.240
And thinking about it, when Brent was answering,

15:40.240 --> 15:43.360
I was thinking to myself, well, why wouldn't I do that

15:43.360 --> 15:44.500
for my studio systems?

15:44.500 --> 15:46.440
Imagine if I could just have these

15:46.440 --> 15:48.120
three or four Kubuntu systems.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.200
Well, okay, one, two, three, yeah,

15:50.200 --> 15:53.040
four, five Kubuntu systems.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.880
I mean, I'd still consider paying 50 bucks a month

15:54.880 --> 15:58.120
if it meant I could get decent new hardware

15:58.120 --> 16:01.760
that had a consistent support contract all the time.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.760
I think I might do that.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.160
I don't know for sure.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.880
But for the business case, I can totally see it.

16:06.880 --> 16:07.800
I would definitely be compelled

16:07.800 --> 16:09.760
to at least run the numbers, don't you think, Brent?

16:09.760 --> 16:13.200
I think you'd be silly not to consider it.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.280
I do wonder, and maybe the Mumble Room

16:16.280 --> 16:17.520
has something to say about this,

16:17.520 --> 16:20.000
but I wonder if we think that Linux

16:20.000 --> 16:21.720
would be ready for something like this.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.800
Yeah, and who would deliver that?

16:23.800 --> 16:25.260
And how would you deliver it?

16:25.260 --> 16:27.160
I would like a ThinkPad as a service.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.120
Well, I mean, as a small business owner,

16:29.120 --> 16:32.140
I've really been considering something like this.

16:32.140 --> 16:36.320
And I've been educating myself on SaltStack.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.120
And with everything being in a file in Linux,

16:39.120 --> 16:41.680
you can take something like Puppet or SaltStack

16:41.680 --> 16:43.920
or something like that, and you can deploy a desktop

16:43.920 --> 16:47.800
just as easily as you could deploy a server.

16:47.800 --> 16:51.240
And then you're just restoring users' configuration files

16:51.240 --> 16:53.900
in their home directory and their.files.

16:53.900 --> 16:56.320
So this is actually something I've been considering

16:56.320 --> 16:59.120
as a potential way to grow my business

16:59.120 --> 17:00.400
into something self-supporting.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.240
Yeah, you're right.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.200
That does make it so much nicer to support end users

17:04.200 --> 17:06.400
when compared to something that has like a registry

17:06.400 --> 17:07.360
or something like that.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.080
It's just a totally different level.

17:09.080 --> 17:10.360
Well, and then when your user goes

17:10.360 --> 17:12.080
and breaks their system inevitably,

17:12.080 --> 17:15.920
then you just rerun your recipe

17:15.920 --> 17:17.480
that redeploys their desktop.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.940
And within five minutes, they've got a brand new

17:19.940 --> 17:22.600
working image that's already connected

17:22.600 --> 17:24.080
to their network drive,

17:24.080 --> 17:27.320
because no one saves anything onto their local disk, right?

17:27.320 --> 17:29.520
Yeah, yeah, I can tell they do.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.280
But going back to the Microsoft story,

17:32.280 --> 17:35.800
my gut, here's why I think it's gonna be a good thing

17:35.800 --> 17:37.900
for Linux, because my gut wants it to happen.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.080
Because I think like, deep down,

17:40.080 --> 17:42.120
like it feels like that's a win for Linux somehow.

17:42.120 --> 17:46.320
Like anytime you make Windows more ongoing expensive,

17:46.320 --> 17:47.960
I feel like you're making people constantly

17:47.960 --> 17:49.720
reevaluate its worth.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.840
Whereas if I just buy it like once every five years,

17:52.840 --> 17:55.680
like say I'm a corporate IT environment,

17:55.680 --> 17:58.920
I'm either subscribing to the large bulk licenses,

17:58.920 --> 18:03.320
the volume licenses, or I'm refreshing my machines

18:03.320 --> 18:05.960
if I'm aggressive every few years,

18:05.960 --> 18:08.720
but probably more likely every five to 10 years.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.960
And that's when I'm addressing the license problem.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.840
As a business, that's not an unmanageable expense,

18:13.840 --> 18:16.720
especially because they are productivity tools,

18:16.720 --> 18:18.120
like they're necessary for the job.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.800
Right, and you can probably find a good quarter

18:19.800 --> 18:20.800
where it makes the most sense,

18:20.800 --> 18:22.720
and okay, yes, we'll buy a big bulk here,

18:22.720 --> 18:24.480
we didn't spend as much elsewhere.

18:24.480 --> 18:27.200
But when it's a line item every month that you're...

18:27.200 --> 18:28.280
You're looking at that going,

18:28.280 --> 18:30.560
well, what are we paying for?

18:30.560 --> 18:32.340
Because that's what we're paying for all the time now,

18:32.340 --> 18:34.160
and it's a per head cost now.

18:34.160 --> 18:36.400
And that adds up, that makes a difference.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.960
You can write monthly costs off as OpEx rather than CapEx,

18:39.960 --> 18:42.120
so that's better for tax purposes.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.080
Yeah, there are advantages.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.920
Plus, if you wrap in licensing and you wrap in cloud storage,

18:46.920 --> 18:49.840
it's probably likely to be cheaper,

18:49.840 --> 18:51.400
but that bundling only gets you so far,

18:51.400 --> 18:52.840
like the cable industry knows that too.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.360
So I think, I mean, it also really depends

18:54.360 --> 18:56.440
on just how easy is it to administer,

18:56.440 --> 18:58.400
what's the customer service aspect like?

18:58.400 --> 18:59.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.480
I wonder if this isn't the real cost

19:01.480 --> 19:03.480
of Windows 10 being free.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.520
I have thought this from the moment they announced it

19:06.520 --> 19:08.640
as free, I always thought this.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.080
And why they've encouraged it,

19:10.080 --> 19:12.480
why they've called it the last version of Windows.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.200
I think this has been in the works

19:14.200 --> 19:16.440
since Balmer was running the place.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.760
And now they've just kind of figured out

19:17.760 --> 19:20.560
how to put it all together by having different experiments

19:20.560 --> 19:22.400
with the Surface Books and their different services

19:22.400 --> 19:24.360
that have given them some experience.

19:24.360 --> 19:27.280
They managed to do it pretty well with Office 365.

19:27.280 --> 19:31.160
So it's just another checkbox on a feature list.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.440
I was just about to say, we're gonna move on,

19:32.440 --> 19:35.040
but then it dawned on me too, as a Linux user,

19:35.040 --> 19:39.480
what if the price was legitimately affordable?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.160
So let's just say for a moment, it's like,

19:41.160 --> 19:42.520
I mean, it's not gonna be this,

19:42.520 --> 19:45.640
but let's just say for $25 a month,

19:46.520 --> 19:49.440
you could get like a pretty decent Windows 10 device

19:49.440 --> 19:50.600
in your home.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.080
As a Linux user, I might consider that

19:53.080 --> 19:57.640
just so I have a Windows machine from time to time.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.720
And to be honest with you,

19:59.720 --> 20:00.960
that's dropping whatever it is,

20:00.960 --> 20:03.160
100, 200 bucks on Windows 10 Professional,

20:03.160 --> 20:04.080
has been a barrier for me.

20:04.080 --> 20:04.920
I just don't wanna do it.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.480
I just can't bring myself to do it.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.760
Well, look at cell phones.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.680
Yeah, exactly.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.120
You pay, I don't know how much in the states,

20:10.120 --> 20:13.720
100 bucks a month, but that includes cell connection.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.920
So if you're paying half that for your connection

20:15.920 --> 20:18.080
and half that for the device every month,

20:19.040 --> 20:21.000
a laptop probably costs the same or less

20:21.000 --> 20:22.120
to make than a phone.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.080
So yeah, it's possible, definitely.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.080
Yeah, it could be.

20:26.080 --> 20:26.920
All right, all right.

20:26.920 --> 20:27.760
I saw JJ had some more thoughts,

20:27.760 --> 20:28.960
but we'll save them for the post-show.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.800
Let's move on.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.160
We don't need to talk about Microsoft that much more.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.440
I think that's probably good.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.320
And I wanna talk about security for a moment.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.120
I wanna talk about something that has been very apparent

20:37.120 --> 20:39.680
on the TechSnap program for a while.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.600
This is a very TechSnap program topic.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.640
So if you're into this kind of stuff,

20:42.640 --> 20:43.920
check out TechSnap.systems.

20:43.920 --> 20:47.160
But in recent days, the VPN filter malware

20:47.160 --> 20:49.320
has been attracting a lot of attention,

20:49.320 --> 20:51.680
much of it in the wake of the May 25th

20:51.680 --> 20:54.040
public service announcement by the FBI

20:54.040 --> 20:56.800
that was also covered by a number of announcements

20:56.800 --> 20:58.800
from vendors and security companies

20:58.800 --> 21:01.880
around routers being susceptible to an issue.

21:01.880 --> 21:05.240
You might recall the FBI issuing a recommendation

21:05.240 --> 21:06.200
to need to be rebooted.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.440
They were susceptible to runtime malware.

21:09.440 --> 21:12.360
And if you restarted and they reinitialized from the ROM,

21:12.360 --> 21:16.160
the malware would be gone, but they may remain vulnerable.

21:16.160 --> 21:20.200
So Cisco's threat blog posted on VPN filter a while ago.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.120
We covered it in TechSnap,

21:21.120 --> 21:22.760
but they do provide some good details

21:22.760 --> 21:24.480
on devices' impact by this vulnerability,

21:24.480 --> 21:28.760
which affected around 500,000 networking devices worldwide.

21:28.760 --> 21:32.360
Yeah, it works a lot in the way like the Mirai,

21:32.360 --> 21:34.040
Marie, Mirai botnet,

21:34.040 --> 21:37.560
where it specifically goes after home routers.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.480
It also uses several zero-day exploits

21:40.480 --> 21:42.560
that the lazy vendors just haven't patched

21:42.560 --> 21:43.680
that have been known about now.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.240
Turns out that works really well.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.840
Yeah, among the reported vendors impacted by VPN filter

21:48.840 --> 21:51.360
are Linksys and Netgear,

21:51.360 --> 21:54.520
which is 77% of the home router market just right there,

21:54.520 --> 21:56.040
Linksys and Netgear. Wow.

21:56.040 --> 21:59.400
Yeah, and by just exploiting typical vulnerabilities,

21:59.400 --> 22:01.240
you can get access to a lot of stuff

22:01.240 --> 22:02.560
on these two devices in the wild,

22:02.560 --> 22:06.200
including redirecting your DNS to their DNS servers

22:06.200 --> 22:08.720
and all kinds of really kind of nasty things

22:08.720 --> 22:10.880
that you can do when you're in a trusted position

22:10.880 --> 22:11.960
on the edge of the network.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.560
It's the new holy grail too,

22:13.560 --> 22:15.600
because so many of you bastards out there

22:15.600 --> 22:17.760
are using Linux and Android devices,

22:17.760 --> 22:20.960
and you're not using Windows XP and Windows CE devices,

22:20.960 --> 22:23.040
and they can't keep writing malware for Windows

22:23.040 --> 22:23.880
and get to everybody.

22:23.880 --> 22:24.920
You're just making it too hard.

22:24.920 --> 22:25.760
Jerks.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.720
Especially you Mac users and you iOS users.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.080
Don't even get me started.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.960
So why not go after the thing

22:31.960 --> 22:33.920
that y'all have to route through?

22:33.920 --> 22:35.680
And that is the router.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.320
And that's whenever you want to talk out to the internet,

22:37.320 --> 22:38.640
you got to go through that little bastard.

22:38.640 --> 22:41.280
So that's the thing they're going after now.

22:41.280 --> 22:44.840
And so we should talk about security right at that spot,

22:44.840 --> 22:46.440
at the edge of your network.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.280
That's where security has to begin.

22:48.280 --> 22:51.800
And that's why open source at that part of your network,

22:51.800 --> 22:54.480
I think is maybe one of the most critical spots.

22:54.480 --> 22:59.480
If nothing else, then as a remedy to vendor negligence.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.160
I think that's fairly,

23:02.160 --> 23:03.840
because with these open source projects,

23:03.840 --> 23:06.200
as long as the project's alive, they're issuing updates.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.840
It's at least an escape hatch in a world of...

23:08.840 --> 23:09.800
For a long time,

23:09.800 --> 23:11.640
it's gotten a little bit better perhaps these days,

23:11.640 --> 23:13.920
but for a long time, just not very many great options.

23:13.920 --> 23:14.800
No.

23:14.800 --> 23:19.800
So OpenWRT 1806 has just come out today.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.800
And it's a significant release because it's the first one

23:23.800 --> 23:28.520
since the OpenWRT and LEDE projects decided to merge.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.560
Wow, that is a big deal.

23:29.560 --> 23:30.400
Yeah.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.400
And so now this is their combined effort

23:32.400 --> 23:34.200
under the OpenWRT umbrella.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.040
We're back together.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.200
Yeah, that is great, right?

23:36.200 --> 23:39.320
It's been, we talked about this two years ago.

23:39.320 --> 23:40.160
Wow.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.000
That's how long it's been,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.720
which it doesn't feel like it's been that long, but yeah.

23:43.720 --> 23:46.200
So the Linux Embedded Development Environment

23:46.200 --> 23:51.200
and OpenWRT came together and now we have OpenWRT 1806,

23:51.320 --> 23:53.200
which is replacing 1505.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.440
So it's a pretty big jump there

23:54.440 --> 23:59.000
because it's a combination of LEDE 1701 and OpenWRT 1505.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.680
So they just went right to 1806.

24:00.680 --> 24:03.200
It adds support for network flow offloading,

24:03.200 --> 24:05.200
which is bad ass,

24:05.200 --> 24:08.120
modernizes support for some of Atheros chipsets,

24:08.120 --> 24:10.480
a bunch of kernel updates and package updates

24:10.480 --> 24:12.840
among other areas of improvement.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.000
And we'll have links in the show notes

24:15.000 --> 24:16.080
so you can check it out.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.000
This is the kind of thing where it's a simple step.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.640
I mean, if you've got a good hardware vendor

24:20.640 --> 24:21.920
who's updating your firmware

24:21.920 --> 24:23.560
and you feel pretty comfortable in it,

24:23.560 --> 24:24.920
then more power to you.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.320
That's great.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.840
But this has been the solution I've taken in the past.

24:29.840 --> 24:30.960
You and I were also recently talking about

24:30.960 --> 24:33.040
maybe checking out some more Microtech stuff,

24:33.040 --> 24:33.880
but this is really nice.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.560
And they have a wide range.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.920
It really comes down to the chips in your box.

24:37.920 --> 24:38.760
So you got it.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.440
I think you can also sometimes find a nice middle ground

24:40.440 --> 24:43.360
where like, if you can set up an OpenSense or PF sense box,

24:43.360 --> 24:45.000
great if you know how to set up your own router

24:45.000 --> 24:47.200
from running whatever Unix-like

24:47.200 --> 24:48.480
or Unix-based operating system,

24:48.480 --> 24:50.480
also great if you know how to do that,

24:50.480 --> 24:52.680
but you might just be someone who's already invested

24:52.680 --> 24:54.560
in one of the common router brands,

24:54.560 --> 24:56.400
but you know someone who listens to this show

24:56.400 --> 24:57.240
or whatever else,

24:57.240 --> 24:59.000
and you can go through, spend a Sunday,

24:59.000 --> 24:59.840
get that on there,

24:59.840 --> 25:02.040
and then not have to buy a new device,

25:02.040 --> 25:03.480
but have more control

25:03.480 --> 25:05.720
and have a better, more secure platform.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.240
You should be able to be completely done

25:07.240 --> 25:09.400
by the time you've finished a Linux Unplugged podcast,

25:09.400 --> 25:10.280
I think.

25:10.280 --> 25:11.800
So try that out.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.760
Like Wes said, maybe help out a family member.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.200
There's other solutions, obviously.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.680
We could list so many other possibilities.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.120
You guys know I'm a big fan of PF sense,

25:19.120 --> 25:20.720
but if you've got hardware

25:20.720 --> 25:22.640
that is one of these devices,

25:22.640 --> 25:25.040
one of these 77% of the devices in the market

25:25.040 --> 25:27.880
that is possible to load OpenWRT on,

25:27.880 --> 25:29.160
maybe it's just time.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.720
Because these, like on Tech Snip,

25:30.720 --> 25:32.160
we're constantly talking about back doors

25:32.160 --> 25:34.040
and all this stuff that even with Linux on there

25:34.040 --> 25:34.880
or BusyBox on there,

25:34.880 --> 25:37.480
they still just screw up the basic implementations.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.600
It's not enough that it's based on Linux.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.640
It has to be well implemented.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.480
For some reason, they just,

25:41.480 --> 25:43.160
the firmware developers just don't feel comfortable

25:43.160 --> 25:45.240
unless you've got a unsecured telnet port open

25:45.240 --> 25:46.080
at all times.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.520
And it's just like baked in, baked in usernames and passwords.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.160
One of my favorites that we talked about on Tech Snip

25:51.160 --> 25:53.640
was the root password was just the MAC address

25:53.640 --> 25:54.520
of the network card.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.600
So if you knew the MAC address of the router

25:56.600 --> 25:58.440
and then you just copy and pasted that,

25:58.440 --> 25:59.960
say from your terminal,

25:59.960 --> 26:01.200
and you could just paste that in the password

26:01.200 --> 26:03.520
and log right in, is root.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.360
Makes it easy.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.160
And there's, but there's even ones where there's like,

26:07.160 --> 26:08.720
no, no password necessary.

26:08.720 --> 26:09.960
Absolutely no password necessary.

26:09.960 --> 26:10.960
Just knock on the door.

26:10.960 --> 26:11.920
There has literally been some,

26:11.920 --> 26:13.320
it's like you knock on this port

26:13.320 --> 26:14.400
on a certain amount of times

26:14.400 --> 26:16.480
and you just get telnet root access.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.320
Have that at Haas.

26:17.320 --> 26:19.320
It's really something.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.760
So yeah, you gotta go replace these things.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.760
But you really do still have to keep them up to date.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.760
You do still have to implement best practices.

26:26.760 --> 26:28.360
It's not just a matter of the firmware,

26:28.360 --> 26:30.120
but getting something open source,

26:30.120 --> 26:32.160
supported by a community that gets frequent updates

26:32.160 --> 26:33.440
is a good first step.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.160
That's how I look at it.

26:35.160 --> 26:39.600
Corita is getting some decent funding

26:39.600 --> 26:43.680
and it's allowing for one of their developers to go,

26:43.680 --> 26:47.400
if not full-time, near full-time.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.160
Now, Corita's been publishing,

26:49.160 --> 26:50.920
wow, this is another Microsoft story, really,

26:50.920 --> 26:51.760
if you think about it.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.000
Corita's been publishing to the Windows Store

26:53.000 --> 26:54.200
for quite some time.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.480
Not quite a year,

26:55.480 --> 26:58.760
but they've updated their store listing almost 20 times.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.360
And by far, the majority of users get Corita

27:01.360 --> 27:02.200
from the website,

27:02.200 --> 27:04.200
about 30,000 downloads a week from their website.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.800
Nice. Yeah.

27:05.800 --> 27:08.880
The store downloads from Microsoft's store

27:08.880 --> 27:10.640
are about 125 a week.

27:10.640 --> 27:14.440
Still though, the income that has been generated

27:14.440 --> 27:16.680
by the Windows Store makes it possible

27:16.680 --> 27:19.240
for the Corita maintainer to work on Corita full-time,

27:19.240 --> 27:21.440
which would never have been possible otherwise.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.680
Interesting.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.600
30,000 downloads from their website

27:25.600 --> 27:28.680
and they couldn't make enough money to go full-time.

27:28.680 --> 27:32.760
125 downloads a week from the Microsoft store

27:32.760 --> 27:34.240
and they're going full-time.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.680
It's an interesting different philosophy

27:35.680 --> 27:38.800
when you're in that app store idea, right?

27:38.800 --> 27:41.040
I mean, you can easily send donations

27:41.040 --> 27:42.240
through their main website,

27:42.240 --> 27:44.920
but I guess you're just in that mindset of ready to...

27:44.920 --> 27:46.280
Well, it's price per download, right?

27:46.280 --> 27:47.960
So in the Windows Store, you pay a little bit.

27:47.960 --> 27:48.920
And you expect to.

27:48.920 --> 27:49.760
Yeah.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.680
And it makes open source development

27:52.680 --> 27:55.200
of a pretty important open source application

27:55.200 --> 27:58.880
that is competitive with things from Adobe possible.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.680
I just wonder if we should just take a moment

28:00.680 --> 28:01.880
and reflect on that.

28:01.880 --> 28:05.160
Because to me, it seems like there's a big lesson

28:05.160 --> 28:06.520
to learn from that.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.800
And I think about what the App Center,

28:08.800 --> 28:10.520
what elementary OS is doing with the App Center.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.360
I think it's also interesting

28:11.360 --> 28:12.920
because the article goes on to discuss

28:12.920 --> 28:15.440
some of the problems they've had in that environment.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.520
And maybe that is why we do need

28:17.520 --> 28:19.360
more open source friendly things

28:19.360 --> 28:21.400
like the App Store and other efforts.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.240
Yeah, they talk about being powerless.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.680
They talk about all the rules that are made by the store.

28:25.680 --> 28:28.120
And if there's one particular store rule

28:28.120 --> 28:29.560
that gets interpreted the wrong way,

28:29.560 --> 28:31.760
the curators can just decide,

28:31.760 --> 28:33.280
you know what, no good.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.040
And if you're not native English,

28:35.040 --> 28:36.760
then it makes it even harder

28:36.760 --> 28:39.360
to then communicate with the store curators.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.240
And sometimes things can be just simply misunderstood

28:41.240 --> 28:42.560
because of a language barrier.

28:42.560 --> 28:45.040
So what's the answer then?

28:45.040 --> 28:46.840
If you have an uncurated store,

28:46.840 --> 28:51.080
like the AUR or like the snap repositories, et cetera,

28:51.080 --> 28:54.080
you end up with crypto software in there.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.880
I mean, there has to be somebody somewhere,

28:55.880 --> 28:58.840
I think, verifying these packages

28:58.840 --> 29:01.320
and maintaining that trust.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.080
Is it that or is it there's a price?

29:04.080 --> 29:05.760
You know, I mean, really.

29:05.760 --> 29:08.760
Nothing says that cryptoware doesn't sneak into these stores

29:08.760 --> 29:10.320
from time to time that are curated.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.720
But I think for Corita, the big difference here is

29:12.720 --> 29:14.280
if you wanna download it from the Windows Store,

29:14.280 --> 29:16.480
if you want that convenience, you gotta pay a little money.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.680
I don't have the Windows Store on me.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.920
So, oh, here it is, it's $9.79.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.520
If you wanna download it from the Windows Store,

29:22.520 --> 29:24.840
you have to pay $9.79.

29:24.840 --> 29:28.400
And 125 a week, they can go full time.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.520
That seems to be the crux of the issue.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.920
That's an uncomfortable thing, I think,

29:31.920 --> 29:33.760
because the numbers are devastating.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.840
30,000 downloads, right?

29:36.840 --> 29:38.480
I mean, if you look at this show, right?

29:38.480 --> 29:40.600
This show will get that.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.360
And then you look at our Patreon,

29:42.360 --> 29:44.520
which this is just always how it works, right?

29:44.520 --> 29:45.360
You look at the Patreon,

29:45.360 --> 29:48.160
there's much less than that on the Patreon.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.800
Totally understandable, because we're also ad supported.

29:49.800 --> 29:53.640
But I think there is a massive difference

29:53.640 --> 29:55.680
when something's free and just available online.

29:55.680 --> 29:56.920
The return you get, I think,

29:56.920 --> 29:58.800
is probably often less than a percent.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.040
What do you think about this, Brent?

30:00.040 --> 30:01.800
Trying to imagine for myself what would happen

30:01.800 --> 30:04.520
if those 30,000 weekly downloads went through

30:04.520 --> 30:08.200
a similar app store and gave them a similar revenue.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.880
That would be huge for an open source project like this

30:10.880 --> 30:12.960
who's trying to really break some ground.

30:12.960 --> 30:13.800
Yeah.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.120
Arthur, you were mentioning too

30:15.120 --> 30:16.640
that there's an open source game

30:16.640 --> 30:17.920
that sort of struggles with the same issue,

30:17.920 --> 30:19.640
perhaps even on a larger scale.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.240
There's actually several open source games.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.880
I'm involved in one of them.

30:23.880 --> 30:28.040
But recently I talked with a 080 developer.

30:28.040 --> 30:33.040
And they have about 100K downloads a year.

30:33.120 --> 30:38.120
But they only get about $90 per month in donations.

30:38.880 --> 30:42.240
And they have $100 per month in server costs.

30:42.240 --> 30:46.040
So they're going negative each month.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.520
Yeah, boy, that is some bad math.

30:48.520 --> 30:49.920
So 100,000 downloads a year

30:49.920 --> 30:51.880
and they're making 90 bucks a month?

30:51.880 --> 30:53.560
Yeah, that's not gonna work, is it?

30:53.560 --> 30:55.440
They have some slack

30:55.440 --> 30:58.680
because they did some donation drives a while ago.

30:58.680 --> 31:03.680
But still, it's very discouraging for them

31:04.520 --> 31:07.680
and for us with our game.

31:07.680 --> 31:12.680
So, especially since there are so many people

31:14.560 --> 31:19.040
happy to buy early access games for Linux,

31:20.240 --> 31:25.000
but not happy to donate to a free game.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.320
So this issue that we're touching on in part

31:29.320 --> 31:32.120
is often why when people ask me,

31:32.120 --> 31:35.440
why do you want more users on the Linux desktop?

31:35.440 --> 31:37.520
Why do you want Slack on the Linux desktop

31:37.520 --> 31:42.480
if it means a slow electron proprietary service application?

31:42.480 --> 31:44.120
Then what's the point of having a free desktop?

31:44.120 --> 31:46.480
Why have new users at the cost

31:46.480 --> 31:48.360
of gaining proprietary applications?

31:48.360 --> 31:50.080
And this is my answer.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.600
Having a larger user base on Linux,

31:52.600 --> 31:54.600
on the desktop in particular,

31:54.600 --> 31:59.200
facilitates an economy to pay developers to do hard work.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.000
And as a user base grows,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.760
the demand for more sophisticated applications

32:03.760 --> 32:06.920
that connect to more sophisticated services will also grow.

32:06.920 --> 32:11.160
And if we don't have a way to facilitate financing this work,

32:11.160 --> 32:13.480
the people that are capable of doing that work

32:13.480 --> 32:15.440
are gonna go get paid to do it somewhere else.

32:15.440 --> 32:18.120
And I think it's a bit of egg on our face

32:18.120 --> 32:21.280
that the fricking Microsoft Windows store

32:21.280 --> 32:24.400
is now paying to make creative development possible.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.920
And I also can't sit here and say the solution

32:26.920 --> 32:29.040
is that every developer should go to Patreon

32:29.040 --> 32:31.680
or something like that because that's not gonna scale either.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.080
We're getting patron out at this point.

32:33.080 --> 32:34.560
Let's be honest, everybody is.

32:34.560 --> 32:35.760
I'm getting a little tapped out myself

32:35.760 --> 32:37.480
and I'm still trying to support people.

32:37.480 --> 32:41.400
The reality is we have to facilitate some mechanism

32:41.400 --> 32:42.800
to reward hard work.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.600
A value for value model has to exist

32:45.600 --> 32:47.480
for free and open source software.

32:47.480 --> 32:50.480
And I think that's in part why I follow

32:50.480 --> 32:52.760
what Daniel and the team at Elementary OS

32:52.760 --> 32:54.200
are doing with such interest

32:54.200 --> 32:56.880
because that is at least a possible solution.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.240
It might not be your favorite solution,

32:58.240 --> 33:01.640
but they are definitely trying and innovating in that space.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.880
It's an incubator of what could perhaps work

33:04.880 --> 33:06.840
on a wider scale someday.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.720
And I don't know if that's the right solution,

33:08.720 --> 33:09.960
but maybe what's going on with Carita

33:09.960 --> 33:11.880
gives us some perspective.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.840
Especially exploring things of,

33:13.840 --> 33:15.640
it's still open source, still free,

33:15.640 --> 33:17.240
but maybe there's a few hurdles

33:17.240 --> 33:20.080
or it's not the thing that you find the easiest anymore.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.520
You're more encouraged to donate.

33:21.520 --> 33:22.400
There's a lot of different angles

33:22.400 --> 33:23.880
and I think we'll have to adapt to that

33:23.880 --> 33:26.120
and the philosophy of it as a community.

33:26.120 --> 33:26.960
Yeah.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.360
So let's talk about how to grow that user base,

33:29.360 --> 33:31.080
especially when it comes to the hardware side

33:31.080 --> 33:32.360
with Mr. Barton George.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.960
So let's bring Barton in just a moment.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.840
But first, I wanna thank DigitalOcean

33:36.840 --> 33:38.560
for making this episode possible.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.000
Go to do.co slash unplugged

33:41.000 --> 33:44.680
and get a $100 credit for 60 days over at DigitalOcean.

33:44.680 --> 33:47.160
That's do.co slash unplugged.

33:47.160 --> 33:49.480
So many great open source projects

33:49.480 --> 33:52.480
are provided infrastructure by DigitalOcean

33:52.480 --> 33:54.800
to take care of the hassle of the backend infrastructure

33:54.800 --> 33:56.520
and just let them get work done.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.320
And you can do the same thing.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.480
It's easy to get set up, less than 55 seconds.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.880
The dashboard's crazy great and easy.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.880
They have an API that's well documented

34:06.880 --> 34:08.760
and tons of open source applications

34:08.760 --> 34:10.680
are already built around that you can just start using.

34:10.680 --> 34:13.360
One click deployments for tons of great open source

34:13.360 --> 34:14.920
entire stacks of applications

34:14.920 --> 34:17.000
or just deploy the base rig.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.440
They got just about every distribution

34:18.440 --> 34:19.640
you'd wanna run in a server.

34:19.640 --> 34:22.120
My favorite system has four gigs of RAM,

34:22.120 --> 34:26.160
two CPUs, 80 gigabytes of enterprise grade SSDs,

34:26.160 --> 34:29.120
three terabytes of them transfers for three cents an hour.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.560
Now every system has enterprise grade SSDs.

34:31.560 --> 34:33.200
They've all got 40 gigabit connections

34:33.200 --> 34:34.160
coming to the hypervisors,

34:34.160 --> 34:36.000
data centers all over the world,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.120
cloud firewalls that block the traffic

34:38.120 --> 34:39.040
at the network level

34:39.040 --> 34:40.680
so they never even have to hit your rig,

34:40.680 --> 34:44.920
monitoring and alerting built in and much, much more.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.200
But instead of listening to me go on about it,

34:47.200 --> 34:48.720
just go try it.

34:48.720 --> 34:49.960
Just try it.

34:49.960 --> 34:50.880
Maybe spin up a project

34:50.880 --> 34:52.320
you've been wanting to work with for a while.

34:52.320 --> 34:53.400
Something you wanna learn about

34:53.400 --> 34:54.920
or something you wanna put in production.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.080
dio.co slash unplugged

34:57.080 --> 34:58.400
and a big thank you to DigitalOcean

34:58.400 --> 35:01.120
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.160
Wes and I often experiment with different things

35:03.160 --> 35:04.000
on DigitalOcean,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.200
just sort of like when we're prepping for a show.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.400
Awesome, all the time.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.960
I know, it's fun.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.520
dio.co slash unplugged.

35:10.520 --> 35:13.000
Also a huge, huge thank you to Linux Academy

35:13.000 --> 35:15.080
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.920
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.760
You can sign up for a free seven day trial

35:18.760 --> 35:20.000
and support the show.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.400
This is a platform to learn everything about Linux

35:22.400 --> 35:26.120
and the huge industry around Linux now.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.080
Everything that runs Linux or Linux runs on,

35:28.080 --> 35:29.520
they basically have coursework for that

35:29.520 --> 35:31.160
from the essentials around Linux,

35:31.160 --> 35:33.240
which just got a refresh today

35:33.240 --> 35:37.760
or the big topics like AWS and Azure and OpenStack

35:37.760 --> 35:39.160
and the nitty gritties

35:39.160 --> 35:42.920
and now also really a lot of great content around security.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.360
But something that I don't talk about very often

35:45.360 --> 35:47.880
and maybe something you should be made aware of

35:47.880 --> 35:51.960
is they have a really epic team system.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.800
So if you're in an IT department

35:53.800 --> 35:57.200
or if you're at a business that wants to train up new staff

35:57.200 --> 35:59.360
or have staff get up to date on something

35:59.360 --> 36:01.960
or just provide continuing education,

36:01.960 --> 36:03.760
Linux Academy will work with your business

36:03.760 --> 36:06.000
to set up a team plan for all of them

36:06.000 --> 36:07.600
where there's metrics for you to look at

36:07.600 --> 36:09.680
and all kinds of cool dashboard stuff for you

36:09.680 --> 36:11.960
and you get to work hands-on with a salesperson

36:11.960 --> 36:12.800
that can actually help you

36:12.800 --> 36:14.040
get the right stuff for your business.

36:14.040 --> 36:16.080
Like it's a full professional package

36:16.080 --> 36:17.520
that I don't normally talk about

36:17.520 --> 36:19.480
because normally I'm talking to you individuals out there,

36:19.480 --> 36:21.280
but this is something to consider too

36:21.280 --> 36:24.200
is if your work is interested in something like that,

36:24.200 --> 36:25.840
you might pass that along to them

36:25.840 --> 36:27.000
because that was a big area

36:27.000 --> 36:28.880
that I didn't realize that they operate in,

36:28.880 --> 36:30.560
but it makes total sense.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.440
It would be awesome as an IT department

36:32.440 --> 36:33.720
to have that as a resource.

36:33.720 --> 36:37.960
So today Linux Academy launched a whole bunch of new content.

36:37.960 --> 36:40.640
They've been doing this for over a month now,

36:40.640 --> 36:42.160
been releasing more and more.

36:42.160 --> 36:45.200
They were claiming 150 new bits of content.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.320
I think it's over 200.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.920
I mean, I think they just way overshot.

36:47.920 --> 36:49.880
They under-promised and over-delivered.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.760
Today they just updated the LPI DevOps tools

36:52.760 --> 36:54.440
engineer certification,

36:54.440 --> 36:57.800
as well as a ton of other Azure and other great things

36:57.800 --> 37:00.160
like just basic Chef courseware.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.160
Nice. Yeah.

37:01.160 --> 37:05.160
I'm gonna link in the show notes the link to the video

37:05.160 --> 37:08.640
because I think they had like the chief community guy on

37:08.640 --> 37:10.560
from Chef on the live stream.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.280
And they just streamed this earlier today

37:12.280 --> 37:14.760
where they announced like the new Azure concepts courseware,

37:14.760 --> 37:17.000
the Microsoft Exam 705033,

37:17.000 --> 37:20.360
which is implementing Microsoft Azure infrastructure solutions

37:20.360 --> 37:22.640
and a whole bunch of Linux Essentials,

37:22.640 --> 37:24.840
certified Jenkins engineer courseware,

37:24.840 --> 37:26.360
just a ton of stuff.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.120
And like I said, the Chef community guy

37:28.120 --> 37:29.400
all got announced today.

37:29.400 --> 37:30.240
So check that out.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.800
I'll have a link in the show notes at Linux Unplugged

37:31.800 --> 37:34.680
slash 260 and get started at Linux Academy

37:34.680 --> 37:37.800
by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.480
And a massive thank you to Ting

37:40.480 --> 37:43.760
for all of the years of keeping this show on the road,

37:43.760 --> 37:45.720
literally while I'm on the road

37:45.720 --> 37:47.760
and while I'm figuratively on the road,

37:47.760 --> 37:48.840
like, I don't know,

37:48.840 --> 37:50.360
maybe I'm just out of the office mentally,

37:50.360 --> 37:51.760
but they've still kept me on the road.

37:51.760 --> 37:52.600
You know what I'm saying?

37:52.600 --> 37:53.440
They're so good.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.260
They just know what's happening.

37:54.260 --> 37:56.280
They really do because it's smarter than unlimited wireless.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.020
If you use less, you pay less.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.560
And it's just $6 for a line.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.280
And then when you need it, it's there.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.600
Holy crap has that been useful.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.880
The average Ting bill is just 23 bucks per phone per month.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.080
Cause it's paid for what you use wireless,

38:08.080 --> 38:10.240
minutes, messages, megabytes, whatever you use,

38:10.240 --> 38:11.080
that's what you pay.

38:11.080 --> 38:15.080
$6 for the line and then just your usage on top of that.

38:15.080 --> 38:17.200
Like, well, I think I should probably also mention,

38:17.200 --> 38:19.920
sometimes depending on your area, Uncle Sam has a cut.

38:19.920 --> 38:20.760
You know what I'm saying?

38:20.760 --> 38:23.240
Like he's got a cut, Uncle Sam.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.000
That ain't Ting's fault.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
They can't help that.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.440
He's got his hands in everything, Wes.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.280
Watch out.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.100
I know.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.360
No contracts, no early termination fees,

38:31.360 --> 38:33.120
and a great control panel to manage it all.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.980
Turn individual services off,

38:34.980 --> 38:37.160
get complete usage at a glance,

38:37.160 --> 38:39.660
take control of every aspect of your account,

38:39.660 --> 38:41.020
and turn things on or off.

38:41.020 --> 38:42.560
Like I've activated several devices

38:42.560 --> 38:43.520
just through the webpage.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.000
And they also have a bunch of great devices

38:45.000 --> 38:45.960
you can buy directly,

38:45.960 --> 38:48.680
including just getting a $9 SIM card.

38:49.540 --> 38:50.380
Is this?

38:50.380 --> 38:51.220
Oh, whoa.

38:51.220 --> 38:52.120
Oh, no, no, no, no.

38:52.120 --> 38:52.940
Don't tell me.

38:52.940 --> 38:54.400
Do not tell me they have a $1 sale.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.980
Oh, snap.

38:55.980 --> 38:58.080
They got a $1 sale going on the Ting SIM.

38:58.080 --> 38:58.920
What?

38:58.920 --> 38:59.740
No.

38:59.740 --> 39:00.580
At least the GSM SIM.

39:00.580 --> 39:01.420
I've been waiting.

39:01.420 --> 39:02.240
I'm gonna put a link in the show notes.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.040
That's the best deal of the year, right there.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.360
The $1 SIM is when no one,

39:06.360 --> 39:07.720
I'm gonna send a link to Noah too.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.880
You stock up on these SIMs.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.040
You just put them in your bag.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.920
And then when you need data somewhere,

39:11.920 --> 39:13.720
you pop it in there, you're good to go.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.840
It's $6 a month and you turn it off when you're done.

39:15.840 --> 39:19.120
And plus, when you get that SIM at a dollar,

39:19.120 --> 39:21.200
if you go to linux.ting.com,

39:21.200 --> 39:23.500
they'll give you $25 in service credit,

39:23.500 --> 39:25.080
which is probably gonna pay for more

39:25.080 --> 39:26.160
than your first month of using that thing.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.880
Maybe even the first two months of using that thing,

39:27.880 --> 39:29.120
depending on how much you use it.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.800
So go grab a $1 Ting SIM card.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.540
I'll have a link in the show notes.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.160
And then get started at Ting

39:35.160 --> 39:37.440
by going to linux.ting.com.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.280
That's awesome.

39:38.280 --> 39:43.280
That is like Christmas in July when that happens.

39:43.440 --> 39:46.040
Now you can be a cell phone hero.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.080
Friends are out of data,

39:47.080 --> 39:49.240
you have someone visiting from another country,

39:49.240 --> 39:50.560
boom, Ting's got your back.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.920
A cell phone hero, I love it.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.240
linux.ting.com.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.080
Big thanks to Ting

39:55.080 --> 39:57.280
and thank you everybody for supporting our sponsors

39:57.280 --> 39:59.420
and that helps keep us going too.

39:59.420 --> 40:00.520
All right, so every now and then

40:00.520 --> 40:02.880
I like to sit down with Barton George.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.120
You guys remember Barton.

40:04.120 --> 40:06.240
He was the guy that really kicked

40:06.240 --> 40:08.360
the whole Sputnik project off at Dell

40:08.360 --> 40:12.480
and was an advocate and used some internal funding they had.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.560
Like there was their own seed funding internally,

40:14.560 --> 40:15.800
if you will, that's not what they called it.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.100
But it's kind of like, it was like,

40:17.100 --> 40:19.320
here's some project money, see what you can do with this.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.460
It wasn't a ton, it wasn't a ton.

40:21.460 --> 40:24.580
But with that money, Barton assembled a small team

40:24.580 --> 40:26.800
and they begun working on the Sputnik project.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.220
Well, just a few months ago,

40:28.220 --> 40:31.600
they released the seventh generation of the XPS 13.

40:31.600 --> 40:35.760
And then last week, they just updated it unusually quick

40:35.760 --> 40:39.080
to 1804 and there's been a ton of excitement around that.

40:39.080 --> 40:41.040
So we brought Barton back to the show

40:41.040 --> 40:43.560
to do some high level talking about all this stuff.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.440
Well, a big hearty welcome back to the show

40:45.440 --> 40:46.820
to one Mr. Barton George.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.520
Barton, welcome back to the Unplugged program.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.800
My pleasure is always, Chris.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.080
This is one of the things I enjoy doing most.

40:52.080 --> 40:55.200
Oh, he says, with I'm sure 100% legitimacy.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.040
Of course.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.800
It's for all the podcasters, what?

40:57.800 --> 40:59.120
Yeah, right, yeah, right, of course.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.280
Of course, good on you, good on you.

41:00.280 --> 41:02.060
In fact, I'll have to tell you,

41:02.060 --> 41:04.940
there was another podcast I was going to be doing

41:04.940 --> 41:05.780
and I don't know,

41:05.780 --> 41:07.920
they heard through the grapevine I was doing this

41:07.920 --> 41:09.440
and they said, oh, why don't we push it off

41:09.440 --> 41:10.280
for a little bit?

41:10.280 --> 41:12.080
Once you come on one of the Jupiter broadcasting shows,

41:12.080 --> 41:13.800
you basically, you've met,

41:13.800 --> 41:15.420
you've reached all of the audiences,

41:15.420 --> 41:16.340
I think what that's about.

41:16.340 --> 41:19.600
Well, exactly, exactly, there's no more.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.960
Yeah, there's no competing.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.220
So of course, if you're here,

41:22.220 --> 41:25.080
that probably means there's some new things to talk about.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.900
And I wanted to just kind of recap

41:26.900 --> 41:30.120
with maybe a few of the general updates

41:30.120 --> 41:31.560
to the whole Sputnik line.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.400
Where have things changed?

41:33.400 --> 41:35.540
Where have things gone in the last few months?

41:35.540 --> 41:37.000
Maybe it's, what has it been, six months,

41:37.000 --> 41:38.200
almost a year since we chatted?

41:38.200 --> 41:39.720
What's changed, what's new?

41:39.720 --> 41:40.600
Well, I'm trying to remember,

41:40.600 --> 41:42.760
you guys came down here to Dell

41:42.760 --> 41:44.600
and you did the whole shebang

41:44.600 --> 41:47.280
as far as what are we doing with regards to Linux?

41:47.280 --> 41:49.160
And you did things like on the client side,

41:49.160 --> 41:52.120
the server side, you did our HPC stuff.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.240
That was last April, right?

41:54.240 --> 41:55.480
Yeah, and then you did, in fact,

41:55.480 --> 41:57.160
that you did also the coffee maker,

41:57.160 --> 41:58.160
which also runs on Linux.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.240
That's right, yeah.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.480
You covered the whole nine yards.

42:01.480 --> 42:04.040
Well, since that time, lots happened.

42:04.040 --> 42:07.040
We had, in November, we celebrated our fifth anniversary.

42:08.040 --> 42:11.300
And then we, in January,

42:11.300 --> 42:16.300
we launched the seventh generation of the XPS 13.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.080
Oh, wow.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.720
And that, at the time, launched with 16.04.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.760
Fast forward to now,

42:23.760 --> 42:27.120
and we, about a month or two ago,

42:27.120 --> 42:29.200
we launched, we're starting to refresh

42:29.200 --> 42:30.340
our whole precision line,

42:30.340 --> 42:34.080
which runs on the Precision Mobile that runs on Ubuntu.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.560
So there's four that make up that line.

42:36.560 --> 42:39.200
In fact, I think you have one from the last gen.

42:39.200 --> 42:44.120
There's the 3530, the 5330,

42:44.120 --> 42:47.680
the 7530, and the 7730.

42:47.680 --> 42:48.720
You gotta give these some names,

42:48.720 --> 42:49.960
like the Ferrari, you know,

42:49.960 --> 42:51.280
like these names that stick.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.040
No, they do, all internal code names

42:53.040 --> 42:53.920
that I never remember.

42:53.920 --> 42:57.640
In fact, yes, they actually do use like Testarossa

42:57.640 --> 42:59.440
and other various fast car names.

42:59.440 --> 43:00.260
That's great.

43:00.260 --> 43:03.400
So, but you have, which one did you get?

43:03.400 --> 43:05.120
Did you get the 7720?

43:05.120 --> 43:06.800
Yes, that is what it is, exactly.

43:06.800 --> 43:07.640
Okay.

43:07.640 --> 43:08.480
Yeah, I was just gonna say,

43:08.480 --> 43:09.300
it's almost within arm's reach,

43:09.300 --> 43:10.280
but yes, the 7720.

43:10.280 --> 43:11.720
And it's a beast of a machine.

43:11.720 --> 43:12.740
One of the things I love about it

43:12.740 --> 43:15.380
is I can throw just about any workload at that sucker,

43:15.380 --> 43:17.080
and it never fails.

43:17.080 --> 43:18.960
It just churns and churns through it.

43:18.960 --> 43:22.760
I've done literally almost 40 hours

43:22.760 --> 43:24.600
of straight encoding on that machine before.

43:24.600 --> 43:25.440
Wow.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.280
Yeah.

43:26.280 --> 43:27.100
Dang.

43:27.100 --> 43:27.940
It really holds up.

43:27.940 --> 43:30.000
Yeah, and it just keeps getting beefier.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
So, and then just to decode the 77,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.100
the seven stands for 17 inch,

43:35.100 --> 43:37.720
the 75, the five stands for?

43:38.920 --> 43:42.920
I'm gonna say AMD.

43:42.920 --> 43:43.760
I don't know.

43:43.760 --> 43:44.680
I'm just taking a wild stab.

43:44.680 --> 43:46.000
No, it stands for 15 inches.

43:46.000 --> 43:46.840
But anyway.

43:46.840 --> 43:47.900
Oh, that makes way more sense.

43:47.900 --> 43:48.740
Yeah.

43:48.740 --> 43:49.560
Much better, yeah.

43:49.560 --> 43:50.400
Same.

43:50.400 --> 43:51.220
That's a good guess.

43:51.220 --> 43:52.060
Yeah, and I thought you were gonna Google it

43:52.060 --> 43:52.900
and find out.

43:52.900 --> 43:53.720
Oh, I should have.

43:53.720 --> 43:58.360
But we have the 35 is the one that's the value price,

43:58.360 --> 44:01.160
and then the 5530 is the one

44:01.160 --> 44:04.720
that most developers wanna get.

44:04.720 --> 44:09.720
So my favorite thing on Hacker News was somebody who wrote,

44:12.200 --> 44:16.400
Dell makes a better MacBook Pro than Apple.

44:16.400 --> 44:17.880
And I just thought, wow,

44:17.880 --> 44:21.280
that was the 5520 at the time was what he was talking about.

44:21.280 --> 44:23.480
And then he put, you know, didn't see that coming.

44:23.480 --> 44:25.440
So it's been great.

44:25.440 --> 44:28.600
That's just to get to wax nostalgic.

44:28.600 --> 44:33.120
When we launched originally now a little over five years ago,

44:33.120 --> 44:34.840
it was just the XPS 13.

44:34.840 --> 44:35.660
Right.

44:35.660 --> 44:37.360
And we just had one config.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.720
And what we got was a lot of people saying,

44:39.720 --> 44:42.160
well, that's cool, but that's not gonna do it for me.

44:42.160 --> 44:44.000
I need something big and beefy.

44:44.000 --> 44:48.520
And we kept sort of getting more and more of that feedback.

44:48.520 --> 44:51.120
And what we did was Jared Dominguez,

44:51.120 --> 44:54.840
who's our Linux OS architect,

44:54.840 --> 44:57.080
took one of the M3800s,

44:57.080 --> 44:59.680
that's the first precision mobile system.

44:59.680 --> 45:02.680
And in his spare time, he got Ubuntu up and running.

45:02.680 --> 45:06.960
So he posted that to his blog or to the Dell technical blog

45:06.960 --> 45:09.200
and got tons of excitement,

45:09.200 --> 45:10.960
but that didn't satiate the folks.

45:10.960 --> 45:13.400
They still wanted it to become real.

45:13.400 --> 45:16.140
And so the next year we were able to release that

45:16.140 --> 45:17.840
as a real system.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.800
So then from there it was one system.

45:19.800 --> 45:24.240
And then we did the current line, they went from 10.

45:24.240 --> 45:26.160
And then the next generation ends in 20,

45:26.160 --> 45:27.520
which is what you have.

45:27.520 --> 45:30.200
And as we said, now the next one is 30.

45:30.200 --> 45:31.760
Okay, so it does kind of make sense

45:31.760 --> 45:32.760
when you break it down.

45:32.760 --> 45:33.580
Oh yeah, yeah.

45:33.580 --> 45:35.120
Once you get the decoder rigged, it's-

45:35.120 --> 45:37.000
Yeah, once you have the key.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.640
I was looking at the original specs,

45:38.640 --> 45:40.840
the original XPS 13 developer edition,

45:40.840 --> 45:42.520
wasn't, I mean, it wasn't bad.

45:42.520 --> 45:47.360
It was eight gigs of RAM, 256 gigabyte SSD.

45:47.360 --> 45:49.960
The biggest weak spot really was the screen

45:49.960 --> 45:51.840
compared to what you have now on the XPS 13.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.600
It was a 1280 by 720.

45:53.600 --> 45:56.600
We got a lot of nasty comments about that.

45:56.600 --> 45:59.400
My phone has twice that, et cetera, et cetera.

45:59.400 --> 46:02.200
Luckily we were able to fix that within two months.

46:02.200 --> 46:03.680
So we launched in the States,

46:03.680 --> 46:05.840
then two months later when we launched in Europe,

46:05.840 --> 46:08.820
we were able to get a higher resolution screen.

46:08.820 --> 46:11.300
The other thing too is when we first were doing

46:11.300 --> 46:14.200
the beta work, it was only four gigs.

46:14.200 --> 46:15.880
So when we got to release, it was eight gigs.

46:15.880 --> 46:18.120
So yeah, not so bad.

46:18.120 --> 46:24.080
But just to finish my linear story of what's happening,

46:24.080 --> 46:26.320
we announced the new Precision line,

46:26.320 --> 46:31.040
the 3530 was available first, that's the value one.

46:31.040 --> 46:33.440
And then the two super beefy ones,

46:33.440 --> 46:38.120
the 15 inch and the 17 inch, we announced two weeks ago.

46:38.120 --> 46:40.680
And as I said, that's the one that you have.

46:40.680 --> 46:43.560
And the other thing too is we're targeting the higher end,

46:43.560 --> 46:47.800
the 7730 at AI workloads.

46:47.800 --> 46:49.240
Ah, does that mean more GPU?

46:49.240 --> 46:50.360
What does that mean really?

46:50.360 --> 46:52.320
Yeah, it's the cards that go in there

46:52.320 --> 46:54.040
and you're gonna start getting me out of my depth.

46:54.040 --> 46:57.160
So I'll just say, I'll just have a dip.

46:57.160 --> 47:00.160
Yeah, but it's like the hard, I mean, people throw it around,

47:00.160 --> 47:03.080
but there is like a hardware, a software stack

47:03.080 --> 47:04.120
that like goes into it.

47:04.120 --> 47:05.640
And I find that to be really interesting

47:05.640 --> 47:09.960
because it's really a lot of it is starting on Linux,

47:09.960 --> 47:11.520
you know, like this whole AI workload

47:11.520 --> 47:12.880
and machine learning is so new.

47:12.880 --> 47:15.140
And it's, did you see, I mean, not to derail,

47:15.140 --> 47:16.320
but did you see that coming?

47:16.320 --> 47:18.520
I didn't really quite see it being so strong

47:18.520 --> 47:19.420
a few years ago.

47:19.420 --> 47:21.300
Well, I mean, I think that's sort of where it began, right?

47:21.300 --> 47:22.960
If you think of with data scientists

47:22.960 --> 47:27.580
and people in the educational space,

47:27.580 --> 47:29.560
that's what they're gonna start off with is Linux.

47:29.560 --> 47:31.780
And then they get used to it and they really like it.

47:31.780 --> 47:34.460
So it's carried over from there.

47:34.460 --> 47:37.000
And it's actually, so we've got one system

47:37.000 --> 47:39.320
on the mobile workstation,

47:39.320 --> 47:43.220
but then the four desk side ones we offer,

47:43.220 --> 47:47.480
those are also well-targeted at AI.

47:47.480 --> 47:49.300
I mean, it seems like a sweet spot where you can do,

47:49.300 --> 47:51.160
you have both a user-friendly desktop

47:51.160 --> 47:53.660
and a production machine that can run real workloads.

47:53.660 --> 47:54.500
Exactly.

47:54.500 --> 47:55.900
And so you can do stuff locally

47:55.900 --> 47:59.720
and then you can always push it to servers on the backend.

47:59.720 --> 48:01.880
I know you were kind of wrapping this up,

48:01.880 --> 48:04.060
but before, you touched on something

48:04.060 --> 48:05.140
to go back to your story a bit.

48:05.140 --> 48:07.440
You mentioned, you know, you shipped it with the one screen

48:07.440 --> 48:09.740
and then pretty quickly realized needs a better screen.

48:09.740 --> 48:11.320
Prototypes had four gigs of RAM,

48:11.320 --> 48:13.500
final version had eight gigs of RAM.

48:13.500 --> 48:15.660
There's something that kind of caught my attention

48:15.660 --> 48:18.100
with just the most recent cycle of machines

48:18.100 --> 48:23.100
is if I'm not mistaken, they launched with 16.04,

48:23.220 --> 48:24.580
but then within a couple of months now,

48:24.580 --> 48:28.340
we're seeing a Dell sanctioned upgrade path to 18.04.

48:28.340 --> 48:31.180
And I believe new units will be shipping with 18.04.

48:31.180 --> 48:32.020
What's that like?

48:32.020 --> 48:33.580
I mean, how does that happen exactly?

48:33.580 --> 48:35.580
Because the timing of the new XPS hardware

48:35.580 --> 48:37.180
and the timing of the 18.04 release

48:37.180 --> 48:39.100
were really close together.

48:39.100 --> 48:40.300
I'm imagining behind the scenes,

48:40.300 --> 48:42.800
there must've been some consternation

48:42.800 --> 48:44.140
over is it worth holding back

48:44.140 --> 48:46.900
and shipping 18.04 originally or what?

48:46.900 --> 48:48.740
I'm just curious, how did that transpire?

48:48.740 --> 48:51.420
Yeah, and I think sometimes we get luckier than others

48:51.420 --> 48:52.300
depending on, right?

48:52.300 --> 48:54.700
So it was the seventh generation that we're talking about.

48:54.700 --> 48:56.620
So within those seven generations,

48:56.620 --> 48:58.660
sometimes we get lucky with the timing

48:58.660 --> 49:02.020
so that if it's, I don't know, 14.04,

49:02.020 --> 49:06.940
it came out in, say, August or October.

49:06.940 --> 49:09.780
So it looks we're pretty close to that number.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.060
And then other times, unfortunately,

49:11.060 --> 49:13.500
this is where we end up on the wrong end

49:13.500 --> 49:15.540
of the lucky factor.

49:15.540 --> 49:18.740
Because first of all, after it's launched,

49:18.740 --> 49:22.500
then the OEM drivers and bits like that

49:22.500 --> 49:25.500
have to be finally put together by Canonical.

49:25.500 --> 49:27.540
And then we need to do the work

49:27.540 --> 49:29.700
and there's a certain amount of lead time

49:29.700 --> 49:33.020
so that if people think, well, gosh,

49:33.020 --> 49:35.900
your system came out in, let's just say, May

49:35.900 --> 49:38.700
and 18.04 obviously came out in April.

49:38.700 --> 49:39.980
What's the deal?

49:39.980 --> 49:41.220
What's the deal, man?

49:41.220 --> 49:42.020
Exactly.

49:42.020 --> 49:46.140
And so unfortunately, the way that the cycle works,

49:46.140 --> 49:50.860
it comes out with what fits in the time frame of getting

49:50.860 --> 49:53.380
the release from Canonical for the OEM

49:53.380 --> 49:56.820
as well as the whole lead time with the product.

49:56.820 --> 49:58.020
Yeah, that makes sense.

49:58.020 --> 50:02.580
So in the case of 18.04 on the XPS 13,

50:02.580 --> 50:08.100
we're the first large OEM to launch with 18.04.

50:08.100 --> 50:12.420
So what we did is we knew the timing was coming up.

50:12.420 --> 50:15.060
And one thing I learned too, because we were taking stock

50:15.060 --> 50:21.500
the other day, we have over 150 systems that run Ubuntu.

50:21.500 --> 50:24.740
And I had no idea it was that many.

50:24.740 --> 50:26.140
When you say systems, what do you

50:26.140 --> 50:29.860
mean, like servers, IoT devices, desktops, laptops?

50:29.860 --> 50:31.660
No, these are just clients.

50:31.660 --> 50:37.500
So it would be things like Precision Desktop and Mobile

50:37.500 --> 50:40.860
as well as Vostro, Optiplex, blah, blah, blah.

50:40.860 --> 50:45.180
And so just as an aside, the difference between,

50:45.180 --> 50:48.620
and we've done that now for over a decade.

50:48.620 --> 50:54.820
The difference in Sputnik is that when I pitched it,

50:54.820 --> 50:56.060
I said, you know what?

50:56.060 --> 51:01.380
Developers will really pay for our best-looking system

51:01.380 --> 51:02.460
running Ubuntu.

51:02.460 --> 51:05.140
And that was counterintuitive because we

51:05.140 --> 51:07.380
had done really well with Ubuntu on some

51:07.380 --> 51:08.580
of the lower-end systems.

51:08.580 --> 51:11.060
And they still sell extremely well.

51:11.060 --> 51:13.540
But the idea that somebody would be

51:13.540 --> 51:17.060
willing to pay for our highest-end system, which

51:17.060 --> 51:20.900
is the XPS 13, and then put a free operating system on it,

51:20.900 --> 51:23.820
why would they want that?

51:23.820 --> 51:24.900
So that was the difference.

51:24.900 --> 51:28.060
But anyway, if I get back to, but I digress.

51:28.060 --> 51:31.540
If I get back to that 150 systems,

51:31.540 --> 51:34.260
there's a bunch that would be launching

51:34.260 --> 51:35.740
within a certain time frame.

51:35.740 --> 51:38.820
And what we did was we said, because this

51:38.820 --> 51:42.580
is a big deal with 1804, let's pick our flagship Ubuntu

51:42.580 --> 51:45.060
product, which is indeed the XPS 13.

51:45.060 --> 51:47.660
And so let's go and let's recertify that.

51:47.660 --> 51:50.300
And so that's how we made the choice with this one.

51:50.300 --> 51:54.100
Because traditionally, it would be just you certify once,

51:54.100 --> 51:56.980
and that's the way you stay.

51:56.980 --> 51:58.700
Yeah, that's what I was expecting.

51:58.700 --> 52:02.620
And I'm curious if you have any initial impressions

52:02.620 --> 52:06.940
on the customer's reaction to the switch from Unity 7

52:06.940 --> 52:08.780
to the GNOME Shell environment now.

52:08.780 --> 52:10.820
Have you gotten any kind of signal

52:10.820 --> 52:12.340
on how people are receiving that,

52:12.340 --> 52:15.380
even with your own team internally or customers?

52:15.380 --> 52:16.460
You know, I haven't.

52:16.460 --> 52:19.700
I think internally, well, I won't speak for others.

52:19.700 --> 52:23.860
But I think just from my sort of high-level view,

52:23.860 --> 52:25.780
it seemed to make sense.

52:25.780 --> 52:27.820
They had gotten some traction with Unity,

52:27.820 --> 52:30.580
and it was a great idea.

52:30.580 --> 52:35.540
But at some point, when you're looking to focus resources,

52:35.540 --> 52:37.140
unfortunately, you look for something

52:37.140 --> 52:39.340
that you can leverage that's not something

52:39.340 --> 52:42.340
you have to put a ton of resources in.

52:42.340 --> 52:46.460
And so it's interesting in the blog

52:46.460 --> 52:52.980
I did for the launching of 1804, which was just last week,

52:52.980 --> 52:56.180
that I did what was relaunched with 1204.

52:56.180 --> 52:59.220
And I wrote what was going on just quickly

52:59.220 --> 53:00.940
with Ubuntu back then.

53:00.940 --> 53:04.460
And that's when they were saying that you had the HUD.

53:04.460 --> 53:05.940
But the other thing, too, is that's

53:05.940 --> 53:10.180
when people were saying Unity is actually gaining traction,

53:10.180 --> 53:12.460
and it looks like it might be pretty cool.

53:12.460 --> 53:14.580
Right, and just to be clear, what you're talking about

53:14.580 --> 53:17.500
is the original Sputnik launch back in 2012.

53:17.500 --> 53:18.380
Exactly, yeah.

53:18.380 --> 53:23.820
So yeah, 1204, which had the specs that you just

53:23.820 --> 53:26.420
quoted earlier on.

53:26.420 --> 53:29.260
But yeah, then as I say, fast forward to today,

53:29.260 --> 53:32.340
and you have the big switch over.

53:32.340 --> 53:38.020
So with that specifically, I haven't heard yet from.

53:38.020 --> 53:41.540
I suppose in a way, no news is also good news at your level.

53:41.540 --> 53:44.700
Yeah, I mean, I think there was one comment about it.

53:44.700 --> 53:48.300
Usually, either through comments on my blog or through Twitter,

53:48.300 --> 53:50.860
somebody, if they like or don't like something,

53:50.860 --> 53:53.940
they're pretty good either way of saying, oh, I'm

53:53.940 --> 53:58.180
so glad you did X, or why the heck did you do Y?

53:58.180 --> 54:00.580
And I haven't really heard anything.

54:00.580 --> 54:02.500
Good, I think that's probably a good thing.

54:02.500 --> 54:04.340
I have just a couple of more questions for you

54:04.340 --> 54:07.300
that I'm pretty much done, but the next couple questions

54:07.300 --> 54:08.940
are looking forward a little bit.

54:08.940 --> 54:13.220
I've been really kind of pondering this whole Chromebooks

54:13.220 --> 54:15.300
running Linux apps situations.

54:15.300 --> 54:17.860
It seems like all of a sudden, Google

54:17.860 --> 54:20.820
has figured out what you figured out more than five years ago

54:20.820 --> 54:24.060
with Sputnik, and that is that you can hyper-target

54:24.060 --> 54:28.100
this developer market with a reliable Linux workstation.

54:28.100 --> 54:31.460
And now they're adding the capability on Chrome OS

54:31.460 --> 54:34.100
to actually run Linux applications.

54:34.100 --> 54:36.260
So you could run things that you normally

54:36.260 --> 54:38.180
would have to have a full Linux desktop for.

54:38.180 --> 54:41.220
Do you perceive that as competition

54:41.220 --> 54:42.660
to the Sputnik line?

54:42.660 --> 54:44.580
And I guess another way to frame that is,

54:44.580 --> 54:48.060
why would I necessarily buy an XPS 13 over, say,

54:48.060 --> 54:50.140
a future Chromebook in a year or so from now

54:50.140 --> 54:54.140
that has pretty decent specs, maybe is $300,

54:54.140 --> 54:55.580
and can run Linux applications?

54:55.580 --> 54:56.740
Yeah, I think, well, it's interesting

54:56.740 --> 54:59.660
because they obviously took the idea from us because five years

54:59.660 --> 55:01.860
ago when we were looking to sanity check this,

55:01.860 --> 55:03.740
we went out and talked to them.

55:03.740 --> 55:04.820
So they stole the idea.

55:04.820 --> 55:07.980
They just waited five years to act on it, right?

55:07.980 --> 55:10.460
I mean, it was insidious.

55:10.460 --> 55:13.020
But I think at this point, I think

55:13.020 --> 55:14.940
you're talking about Fuchsia as opposed

55:14.940 --> 55:18.140
to Christine with the running of the Linux apps.

55:18.140 --> 55:20.540
And Christine is the one where, and I

55:20.540 --> 55:21.700
don't know a ton about this.

55:21.700 --> 55:23.460
I can just throw these names around,

55:23.460 --> 55:26.660
is the one that's more developer-targeted.

55:26.660 --> 55:29.460
And so I think there will be certain use cases

55:29.460 --> 55:32.780
that Chromebook will be fine.

55:32.780 --> 55:36.420
But there will also be, they're going

55:36.420 --> 55:38.380
to be different a year from now, as will we, right?

55:38.380 --> 55:39.180
We keep progressing.

55:39.180 --> 55:41.580
We're not standing still.

55:41.580 --> 55:42.980
And it will be interesting to see

55:42.980 --> 55:46.740
which areas in particular they'll target.

55:46.740 --> 55:50.100
I know, just anecdotally, my cousin

55:50.100 --> 55:52.780
works on back-end systems at Google.

55:52.780 --> 55:55.500
And so when he started there, he wanted

55:55.500 --> 55:58.540
to get an Ubuntu-based system.

55:58.540 --> 56:01.040
And then he found out that you really can't work locally.

56:01.040 --> 56:02.780
And so he just got a Chromebook.

56:02.780 --> 56:06.260
So it depends on what kind of a use case you're using.

56:06.260 --> 56:09.780
If all you're doing is connecting back-end,

56:09.780 --> 56:13.700
then you really don't need something powerful.

56:13.700 --> 56:16.020
But if you're doing a lot of hacking on the plane

56:16.020 --> 56:21.260
or on the train or conferences, then that's

56:21.260 --> 56:24.420
something like the XPS 13 makes a lot of sense.

56:24.420 --> 56:26.700
Yeah, and I think just like Mac OS,

56:26.700 --> 56:29.140
only more pronounced Chrome OS has

56:29.140 --> 56:34.180
walls that more technical users will run into pretty quickly.

56:34.180 --> 56:35.800
And that can be a source of frustration.

56:35.800 --> 56:39.260
And something like the XPS 13 is a tool to do your job.

56:39.260 --> 56:41.220
And it's worth investing in the right tool.

56:41.220 --> 56:43.060
So I don't think it spells doom for anything.

56:43.060 --> 56:45.380
But it is interesting to see Google executing

56:45.380 --> 56:48.220
on what is clearly a Dell idea.

56:48.220 --> 56:51.740
I mean, it just looks like it from just the outsider's

56:51.740 --> 56:54.260
perspective, even, which is fascinating.

56:54.260 --> 56:56.300
I wonder what took them so long, you know?

56:56.300 --> 56:57.540
Well, exactly.

56:57.540 --> 56:59.940
They were plotting, and they were trying to figure it out.

56:59.940 --> 57:01.380
And then one day, boom.

57:01.380 --> 57:03.340
They're waiting to see if you made any money

57:03.340 --> 57:04.980
and sold some units, and then they realized.

57:04.980 --> 57:05.980
Oh, there you go, yeah.

57:05.980 --> 57:06.980
Yeah, exactly.

57:06.980 --> 57:09.220
In the first couple of years, it looked like it wasn't.

57:09.220 --> 57:14.840
But yeah, we've all of a sudden, it's gone like a hockey stick.

57:14.840 --> 57:17.260
It's crazy with Sputnik.

57:17.260 --> 57:21.140
And I think it's because it's the network effect, right?

57:21.140 --> 57:23.940
So it's more of a word of mouth.

57:23.940 --> 57:26.260
We haven't bought any Super Bowl ads yet.

57:26.260 --> 57:28.060
Although, we will this year.

57:28.060 --> 57:28.860
That was a spoiler.

57:28.860 --> 57:30.100
I shouldn't have told you that.

57:30.100 --> 57:31.020
Really?

57:31.020 --> 57:32.660
Yeah, Sputnik Super Bowl ad.

57:32.660 --> 57:34.980
I'm paying for it out of my own pocket.

57:34.980 --> 57:36.580
No, you're joking now.

57:36.580 --> 57:37.660
No, no, totally.

57:37.660 --> 57:38.380
Totally, I'm paying for it.

57:38.380 --> 57:39.260
Gosh, you got me excited.

57:39.260 --> 57:40.380
You got me excited there.

57:40.380 --> 57:42.460
Well, we'll do a Kickstarter to go fund me.

57:42.460 --> 57:44.720
Well, that is exactly what it's going to say.

57:44.720 --> 57:48.140
So if you want to see us in the Super Bowl, please,

57:48.140 --> 57:52.860
it's under Barton George, move to Bermuda account.

57:52.860 --> 57:54.660
That's just sort of a way we've set it up.

57:54.660 --> 57:56.300
Yeah, it seems legit.

57:56.300 --> 57:58.420
Yeah, exactly.

57:58.420 --> 58:02.380
So again, I digress.

58:02.380 --> 58:04.980
But I was just talking about how things have done,

58:04.980 --> 58:08.540
how it's really going up, which is really nice.

58:08.540 --> 58:09.860
It's been really gratifying.

58:09.860 --> 58:10.980
I bet.

58:10.980 --> 58:15.940
And so to see that it's caught a lot of attention

58:15.940 --> 58:19.820
internally because I think at the beginning, I don't think,

58:19.820 --> 58:22.420
I know in the beginning there's quite a few people who

58:22.420 --> 58:26.660
saw this as a distraction because any company you've

58:26.660 --> 58:28.460
got X number of resources.

58:28.460 --> 58:32.480
And why are you going to put them on this niche market

58:32.480 --> 58:36.500
as they saw it with a group that Dell really doesn't target

58:36.500 --> 58:39.300
or work with, meaning developers?

58:39.300 --> 58:43.060
And then now it's the money we made,

58:43.060 --> 58:45.980
but also the amount of positive feedback

58:45.980 --> 58:50.380
thanks to the community, reviews and press, et cetera.

58:50.380 --> 58:51.180
It's been great.

58:51.180 --> 58:54.500
I mean, the things that people say on Twitter are just,

58:54.500 --> 58:55.220
they're awesome.

58:55.220 --> 58:57.020
It's really nice to know that there's

58:57.020 --> 59:01.620
a group that really was looking for something just like this.

59:01.620 --> 59:04.300
Yeah, and it has net positive brand effects for Dell.

59:04.300 --> 59:08.100
I think it really does, even outside the core market

59:08.100 --> 59:09.380
that the Sputnik is targeting.

59:09.380 --> 59:13.860
Yeah, I've seen comments where people saying that I

59:13.860 --> 59:16.420
didn't consider Dell's before, but now that you got this,

59:16.420 --> 59:19.740
I'm very interested in checking out Dell.

59:19.740 --> 59:22.180
So that's been great.

59:22.180 --> 59:24.980
It's also, because it's a net new area for us,

59:24.980 --> 59:27.540
we are cannibalizing Windows systems.

59:27.540 --> 59:28.420
Right, interesting.

59:28.420 --> 59:29.260
That's a good point.

59:29.260 --> 59:32.020
And that turns out to be pretty important politically,

59:32.020 --> 59:32.900
I imagine.

59:32.900 --> 59:35.040
Well, Barton, I always enjoy our chats.

59:35.040 --> 59:37.280
Is there anything else you want to touch on or mention?

59:37.280 --> 59:39.160
I'll have a link to your blog and your Twitter

59:39.160 --> 59:40.740
profile in our show notes, so people

59:40.740 --> 59:42.180
can get that pretty easily.

59:42.180 --> 59:44.220
Yeah, I think the one thing I would say

59:44.220 --> 59:52.140
is the interest in the 18.04 release on the XPS 13 developer

59:52.140 --> 59:56.260
edition, I had no idea it would generate this much interest.

59:56.260 --> 59:59.540
Because the platform itself has been around since January.

59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.900
It's 18.04, great.

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:01.700
That makes sense.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:05.620
But I mean, this is, just for example,

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:09.300
the first day I posted my blog, I got 8,000 views.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:12.540
The next day, I got 13,000 views.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:20.860
And the days before, I'm looking at 122 views, 73 views, 127.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.460
And this happens with anything Sputnik.

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:26.660
I post, it's exponential compared to the others.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.980
But this in and of itself, just in these first few days,

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.220
has put it in my top 10 blogs.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.100
And like I said, I didn't think this

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:36.260
was going to be a big deal.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.300
I didn't think people were going to be that interested.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.700
So shows how much I know.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.460
There's something about the two combined

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.260
that just makes it a hot pair.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.860
Yeah, there's been a lot of interest

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.700
we've seen in the audience from 18.04 as well.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.420
And I follow with a lot of interest too.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.860
I think a lot of people right now, I don't know,

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.740
maybe I'm projecting, but I think a lot of people

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.100
are looking at their next few years

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.240
and wanting to get work done.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.460
And 18.04 kind of landed right in that window

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.380
for a lot of folks.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.180
Yeah, and then we obviously standardized

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:08.100
on the enterprise, the LTSs, as it would make sense.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.300
Because particularly if you're selling to enterprises,

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.180
they're not going to want the interim releases

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.340
and have everything change every six months.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.340
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:17.740
And plus, this is why 18.04 is still kind of the freshest.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.220
It's still new, so it's still competitive features

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.460
wise and all of that.

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.180
And it's had time to bake a little more now

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.180
that it's stable and most of the bugs are ironed out.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.500
Yeah, the dot one shipped.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.180
Yeah.

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:28.300
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:32.620
And so because the timing wasn't kind to us,

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:36.380
we were able to recertify, particularly given,

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:39.700
like I said, we're the first to certify in 18.04

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.020
and this is our flagship.

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.620
So we really went out of our way.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.500
We could have put it on one of the ones that was more

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.820
likely to ship at this point.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.300
So we've got one coming up soon.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:52.700
But we said, let's make a real effort

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:58.180
to go a little bit before that and do it on the XPS 13.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.060
Very good, Barton.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:01:59.580
Very good.

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:02.420
I really enjoy our chats and I'm really pleased

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:05.180
to see the continued upward trajectory of the project.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.260
Well, that's great, Barton.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:07.340
Have a great rest of your day, sir.

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:08.860
And thank you very much for coming on the Unplugged

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.380
program.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.060
Well, thanks for the opportunity, Chris.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.060
Keep on keeping on.

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:14.860
We will, Wes.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:15.540
Are we sure?

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:16.340
He can't stop us.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:17.340
No, he can't stop us.

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.020
Now, we have so many other things to talk about,

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:22.260
but I do kind of want to keep the show a little bit shorter.

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.700
I've been trying to keep it under an hour and 15 or so.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.660
So we'll probably leave a few things for the show notes.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.420
But it was a super great chat with Barton.

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.740
And I'm really pleased to see the progress

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:32.500
of their project.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:35.820
Now, we need some balance in the show for next week.

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.380
So if somebody from Red Hat wants

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:41.020
to come on and talk about, I don't know, CoreOS

01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:43.140
or something, let's just balance it out a little bit.

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.580
Because we had a lot of Ubuntu this episode.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:48.540
And while it's fine, it's a great product, obviously.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.340
Here's the platform.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:50.980
I feel like we've got to, yeah.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.740
Or maybe we should have somebody come on here and talk about,

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:55.260
not Gentoo.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.300
We've done that plenty.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:56.900
I don't know.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.580
But it's something we'll think about.

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.700
In the meantime, let's talk about some app picks.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.140
We've got a couple for you that we wanted to cover

01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:04.380
before we get out of here.

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.540
And what is more fun than stressing the hell out

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:07.220
of your system?

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.380
So we've got an app for you.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:12.900
I'm going to call it S2E, S-T-U-I?

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.740
The stress terminal UI.

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.540
Yeah, and you've got it installed on your machine

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:18.380
over there.

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.220
It is a super slick looking.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:22.820
Is it technically a terminal app?

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.940
Yeah, it runs right in that there terminal.

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:25.740
It's a terminal app.

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:27.740
It's a Python terminal app that runs right in your terminal.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.660
And it's going to be some of the coolest looking visuals

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.500
to visualize out the utilization of your system,

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:38.660
like CPU frequency, temperature, overall clock utilization,

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:41.620
and the power it's drawing in this really tight looking UI.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:42.140
How would you?

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.380
I mean, you almost describe that as pastel colors.

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.660
I don't really know how to describe that.

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.620
Yeah, the color scheme is lovely.

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:48.300
Yeah, it's nice.

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.980
And it's not going to bombard you

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.740
with a whole ton of information about just

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.660
every little process on your system.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.540
It just gives you a nice, easy to interpret holistic view

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.300
of what's happening.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.620
And it kind of works best with a companion tool, right?

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:03.380
Yeah, if you also have stress testing tools available,

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:05.580
then you can stress test your system

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.300
and then watch how it responds.

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.060
And that sounds like the most fun, right?

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:12.540
Is when you get a new box, which I have fantasies of.

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:15.740
I could also see maybe you have a couple boxes you're

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.020
evaluating, maybe for a big enterprise buy,

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.900
or just because you're a picky consumer.

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:20.620
Heck yeah, man.

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:21.740
You got to try it out.

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.860
You got to try it out.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.620
This is a simple tool that Joe found

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.200
that we're going to include in the show.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.300
It's called Odeo.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.700
And it does one job, and it does it pretty well.

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.180
You copy a YouTube URL, you paste it in the terminal,

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:37.260
you run this program, and it extracts the audio from it.

01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:37.820
And that's it.

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.740
So if you've got like MP4 audio you want to get from it

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:42.220
or something like that, Odeo will download your favorite

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:45.260
music to the current working directory of your terminal.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.340
And try to get the highest quality audio version

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.980
it can off of YouTube.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:51.820
It does depend on your favorite YouTube DL and FFmpeg

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.160
utilities, but it's pretty nice.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.100
And you could just install those from the repo

01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.420
and then go get Odeo.

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.820
This looks like, I mean, I'll be honest,

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.060
that's definitely a common workflow for me.

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.700
Oh, I do it all the time, yeah.

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:08.740
Mostly for Unfilter, but absolutely I do it all the time.

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:10.380
Now we're rocking it here.

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:14.340
I think we may overshoot, but we're moving right along.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.420
Last but not least, this is a really cool tool

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:17.380
that Joe also found.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:21.460
And it's not going to work for all of our shows yet,

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.660
but it may work if you want to go pretty far back for our shows

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.780
and a bunch of your favorite podcasts.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.540
It's called rewind.website.

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.460
And speaking of top level domains, there's a good one.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.100
And it is a really cool concept.

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.980
You go back in time and listen to a podcast

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:39.620
from its very beginning.

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:43.940
You can also put an iTunes URL in there or a SoundCloud URL

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:44.780
in there.

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:46.620
So the whole idea, and by the way,

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.740
the core code's up on GitHub, which

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.060
we have linked in the show notes.

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:53.660
The whole idea is start with a podcast

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:55.420
from the very beginning and then choose

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:58.940
a frequency in which you would like new versions

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.060
of that episode to be delivered to you.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.260
So you sort of re-experience it as if you

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:07.340
were listening during the time those episodes are

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:08.300
being released.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:12.780
So you can set a wait frequency of daily, weekly, and monthly.

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.900
And then it will deliver you a new episode

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:17.780
from the back catalog of your favorite podcast.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:18.740
Oh, that's super handy.

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.260
Yeah, and I love that it's AGPL.

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.100
You can go find it.

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.420
You can go run it yourself if you don't want

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:23.620
to trust them to run it for you.

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:24.100
Yeah.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:28.820
Yeah, the rewind.website is sort of like a demo, really.

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.020
I mean, it's up and running.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.860
It appears they're offering it as a service.

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:34.340
But you can get CastRewinder for your own system

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:35.860
and then get it up and running.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.220
Again, another Python app.

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.420
It's the best of all worlds.

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:38.900
Look at us.

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.380
We're all Python for the app pics.

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.340
Just about.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.540
So that's a neat idea.

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:45.220
You can check it out, rewind.website,

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.900
or go to the GitHub page and throw it up on your own box

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.260
if you're comfortable with Python.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:52.000
And yeah, like Wes said, it's AGPL version 3

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.580
if you want to host it yourself.

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:56.740
And I think that is such a neat idea

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.500
to re-subscribe and re-listen.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.540
It's, oh, man, is it painful.

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.540
You know, when you're used to marathoning something

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:03.660
and you listen to it weekly, you're like,

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.060
how do people do this?

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:05.580
I know, right?

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:08.340
But in that suffering, there is some amount

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:09.660
of gain and appreciation.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.460
And you won't just take it for granted.

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.100
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.260
So anyways, you can check those out in the show notes,

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:18.140
linuxunplug.com, slash 260.

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:19.100
And yeah, there we go.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:22.340
We're going to get out of here on our own imposed deadline,

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.380
not because we want to do less show,

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:27.380
but simply because we know you have a lot of podcast options.

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.260
And sometimes it's good to get a little tighter in here.

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:31.460
So I'm pretty pleased.

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:32.760
I think it's a good place to end.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.900
There's a lot more to talk about.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.560
There's more to do.

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.020
We may put it all in the post show.

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:39.180
But in the meantime, go get yourself some more Wes Payne.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.060
Where are you at, Wes?

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:43.420
TechSnap.systems or at Wes Payne.

01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:44.020
There you go.

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.100
There you go.

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:48.100
You can also get more of me at chrisles, the whole network

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.460
at Jupiter Signal.

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.860
And check our website for links to Brent's page.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:54.360
I think we're going to start putting other folks on there

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.580
from the community as well.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.620
So if you want to get more of them,

01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:59.180
find out what they're up to, what their websites are,

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.820
that's all going to be posted at linuxunplug.com as well.

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.700
So it's going to be a pretty great resource,

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.140
because we also have links to all that stuff

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.060
that we talked about.

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:07.640
Hey, did you know you can join us live?

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.700
You can participate in that virtual lug.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:13.020
You just need a working microphone, some headphones,

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.500
pass the audio check, and then you can join us.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.300
Check it out.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:22.300
And we'll see you in the next one.

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:50.580
Oh, next Tuesday.

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.660
There, I got it in there.

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:51.980
Nice.

01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:52.900
How's that, Brent?

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:54.180
Thank you.

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.620
That and a bell ring would be, yeah, make the show for me.

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:57.740
Oh, OK, right.

01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.700
There you go.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.260
Thank you.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.780
You got the actual bell, too.

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.260
So yeah, all right.

01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:04.260
Boy, I'm really glad it worked out with Barton,

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:07.180
because he has meetings and peoples and things like that.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:08.780
Important laptop-related business.

01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:09.900
Yeah, all that kind of stuff.

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.860
And they're in the middle of prepping the next release,

01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:12.660
so that was cool.

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:14.980
Yeah, I loved how he talked about the community feedback,

01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:17.420
how he was so, so positive.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.500
And that was a bit opposite to what

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.140
we heard last week about that hearing stuff,

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:22.740
so that was good to hear.

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:23.700
Very good point.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.820
Would you like me to put the word out,

01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:28.500
asking for somebody from CoreOS?

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.700
Or anybody in the area.

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.580
Yeah, they would like to come on and get some representation,

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:32.780
talk about something they're working on,

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:33.580
or anything like that.

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.060
Absolutely, I would love that.

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:38.100
I will drop a message in one of the internal mailing lists

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.100
and let you know what happens.

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:40.620
Thank you.

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:40.860
Yeah.

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:41.540
Amazing.

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.580
And you could say, I mean, legitimately,

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.780
Canonical and Ubuntu are a big part of the discussion

01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.380
because they're showing up.

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.020
And that is.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.500
Hey, you got me, bro.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.300
I know, and I really appreciate that, really,

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.500
in part because of that.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.740
Because there's not an inherent intent

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:02.100
to cover one company or distribution more

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:02.780
than the other.

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.180
Yes, the Ubuntu action show up in here.

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.260
Well, it's always going to be balanced on its dominance

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.780
in the market and the news making.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.940
I mean, if it's legitimately making news and dominating

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:14.100
markets, then it's going to get coverage regardless.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.860
But if there was other folks here,

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:18.180
like yourself, that are representing other distributions

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.340
and other community projects, I think

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.540
it would be good for the show.

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:21.820
Yeah.

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.580
Thing is, we're not as enterprisely focused

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:27.740
on this show, are we, as Red Hat's core is going to be.

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:28.860
Yeah, I appreciate that.

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:47.300
But that doesn't mean that we can't make something work.
