1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
You all laugh at me when I talk about using Vivaldi,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,000
but I don't know if you saw this the other week.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,040
They took to their blog, and they're

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,720
campaigning for Windows 7 users to switch to Linux.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,360
Wow.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:10,920
Come on.

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
I support those.

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,080
This is a great browser.

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,640
First of all, if you want something

10
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,680
that uses the Blink rendering engine that's

11
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,000
based on Chromium, but rips out all the Google stuff.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,200
I should use Edge?

13
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,440
No.

14
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:23,940
No.

15
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,440
Yes.

16
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:34,840
Hello, friends, and welcome into the Unplugged program.

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,920
My, you have chosen quite wisely.

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,720
My name is Chris.

19
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,520
My name is Wes.

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,120
I say that because you can listen to this episode

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,920
and then go home.

22
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,000
You're done for the rest of the year.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,460
We're going to tell you everything

24
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,720
that's going to happen in 2020 right here.

25
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,640
Can you believe I'm even saying that?

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
And to help us get it right, of course, the judge returns.

27
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,200
Hello, Joe.

28
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,760
Hello.

29
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,080
I'm going to be even stunner than last time.

30
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,920
Oh, good.

31
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,400
Oh, good, because that turned out so well for me.

32
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,560
And this time, adding their predictions into the pile

33
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,800
is Alex, Cheese, and Brent.

34
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Welcome back, guys.

35
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,760
Hello.

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,720
I'm so nervous.

37
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,160
I didn't know that was the homework.

38
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,760
Well, Brent, I'll let you just slide in.

39
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,080
I'll come to you last so you can pontificate as we put

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,560
our hearts and souls out there.

41
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,880
How are you feeling, Wes?

42
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,320
You got your predictions ready?

43
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,220
You know, I've spent a lot of time preparing

44
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,480
since the last episode.

45
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,320
So I think I'm going to do better this year.

46
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,040
All right, well, something I wanted to do from time to time

47
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,200
is check in on the old Arch server that we set up.

48
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,880
So get yourself an SSH connection there, Wes,

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,160
because for, I think, what feels like the 400th time

50
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,940
since we've installed this Arch box,

51
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,720
we have an update to the Linux kernel, to Linux headers,

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,160
to Node.js, and a wire guard.

53
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,360
All right, we're on 5.4.3 right now.

54
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,000
Are you ready, Wes Payne?

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,280
Go ahead and install the latest updates.

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,440
I am S-Y-U-ing right now.

57
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,520
Now, this, of course, is our commitment to the audience.

58
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
We're going to run an Arch server in production

59
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,800
so you don't have to.

60
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,360
Don't do what we're doing right now.

61
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,080
But we're going to install these updates

62
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,320
and reboot right here on air and see if it works.

63
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,440
Installation in progress.

64
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,320
Now, here's the thing.

65
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,620
You notice on that list, did you notice what's missing?

66
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,360
I don't see anything about ZFS on here.

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,680
Exactly.

68
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,480
No ZFS DKMS modules.

69
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,960
Hey, I see it building right now, though.

70
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,480
Oh, really?

71
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,980
Mm-hmm.

72
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,880
OK, good.

73
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,920
Good.

74
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,160
All right, that's a good, that is, that's good.

75
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,000
I also see some snapper pre-snapshots.

76
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,880
Also what we want to see.

77
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,560
I'm kind of loving this server.

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,640
I really hope it comes up after this reboot,

79
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,400
because this will be a pretty good,

80
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,400
this will be the third big series of rounds of updates

81
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,900
we've done.

82
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,800
Is it just me, or is Pac-Man just pretty?

83
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,520
I mean, I realize it's not the most sophisticated package

84
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,040
manager out there, but the output

85
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,280
is so clean and just what you need to know.

86
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,200
I love it.

87
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,000
And you can get little helpers that

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,520
add lots of different little colors and all kinds of stuff.

89
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
It's been a lot of fun.

90
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,000
There is a hidden flag in etsypacman.conf

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,020
to turn the little update bars into Pac-Man eating.

92
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,440
We should do that on the server.

93
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:04,940
You're right.

94
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,640
It's appropriate.

95
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,920
Yeah, so it's a little Pac-Man eating the dots

96
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,060
as it installs packages.

97
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,840
It's adorable.

98
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,980
Where are we at there, Wes?

99
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,760
We are currently installing the new ZFS modules,

100
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,800
as built by DKMS.

101
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,200
So it is rebuilding the ZFS modules,

102
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,520
even though there isn't a package update for ZFS.

103
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,040
That's good.

104
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,120
That means we have a good shot of this thing booting up

105
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,720
correctly.

106
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,320
So we still have a Wirecard to go.

107
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,240
I hope that goes as seamlessly.

108
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,200
Oh, my gosh.

109
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,520
Especially since after this, we're done,

110
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,600
and we're going to be remote.

111
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,560
So we really need this.

112
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,800
I'd like access to the studio.

113
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,320
We really need this to work.

114
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,880
Oh, we're getting a new Node.js too, so that's good.

115
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,840
Yeah, will that affect NetData?

116
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,960
Depends a bit, I think, on how we have installed it.

117
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,480
OK.

118
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,680
So are we going to wait in real time while the server reboots?

119
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,480
Yeah, we're going to find out what happens.

120
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,960
Then that's all we got for the show, folks.

121
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,680
Yeah, that's it.

122
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,320
This is the show.

123
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,000
That's installing Arch updates.

124
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
We'll come back to it.

125
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,760
I mean, we're not going to sit here while we wait,

126
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,440
but we are going to do this in the show.

127
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,760
You know what I mean?

128
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,640
Is it still going over there?

129
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,280
Yep, still going.

130
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,960
OK.

131
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,240
All right, so check in on that.

132
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,440
In the meantime, while we wait for that to complete,

133
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,160
which we will come back to, so brace yourselves,

134
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,320
why don't we do ourselves a spot of housekeeping?

135
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,000
I have great news.

136
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,800
The internet's one and only daily Linux news podcast

137
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,720
is back.

138
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,080
Linux Headlines is back.

139
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,280
Three minutes or less, find out everything

140
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,680
that's happening in the world of Linux and open source.

141
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,600
Boom.

142
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,840
I missed it when it was gone.

143
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,680
It's really nice.

144
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,720
It's a good team effort, good team working on that.

145
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,680
LinuxHeadlines.show.

146
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
Right?

147
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,840
Yes.

148
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,360
Is that right?

149
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,440
LinuxHeadlines.show.

150
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,200
OK, good.

151
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,960
I couldn't.

152
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,280
I wasn't sure.

153
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,080
And then.

154
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,680
You only do it twice a week, so.

155
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,320
You know, I know.

156
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm just one of the hosts.

157
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,840
What would I know?

158
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
And then also, something that Alex and I put together

159
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,680
recently, really it was all mostly Alex,

160
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,640
is a cheap do-it-yourself LED light strip

161
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,320
using two open source projects video.

162
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,840
It was a self-hosted live hack.

163
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,920
It's up on our YouTube channel right now.

164
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,160
And we'll have a link in the show notes.

165
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,960
It's really worth checking out, because there

166
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,480
is this really awesome firmware.

167
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,880
You can flash on a device.

168
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,840
I should let you tease it a little bit, Alex.

169
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,760
So we teased in SSH 8 a new firmware called WLED.

170
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:31,040
And that lets you take any ESP8266 or 32 device

171
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,440
and flash a firmware on it that requires no coding,

172
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,880
no Arduino code flashing, that kind of stuff.

173
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,240
It's really slick.

174
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,840
If I'm the referee for this episode,

175
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,640
I'm not going to allow you to call it SSH.

176
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,120
Call it self-hosted like it should be.

177
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,920
Wow.

178
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,040
Wow.

179
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,200
Getting a little power hungry over there, Joe.

180
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,920
Yeah, check out the self-hosted podcast, though.

181
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,720
I'm really enjoying some of the recent discoveries.

182
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
And as it turns out, Alex is in the process

183
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,640
of getting a new home.

184
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,920
And that makes for fantastic content for our podcast.

185
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,680
And like a maniac, I have launched a personal project

186
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,440
called Project Off Grid, and we're

187
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,160
talking about both these huge projects

188
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,760
in the self-hosted show, self-hosted.show.

189
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,240
As you listen to this, Alex should be in his new house.

190
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600
Oh, my gosh.

191
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,800
That's pretty exciting, buddy.

192
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,880
Congratulations.

193
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,000
All right.

194
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,560
There you go.

195
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,640
That's the housekeeping.

196
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,160
So Mr. Wes Payne.

197
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,040
I have no updates for you.

198
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,280
We're still chugging away.

199
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,480
It's the wire guard modules?

200
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,200
No, we're still doing ZFS.

201
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,560
Yeah, that's a big build.

202
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,320
Even with 24 cores, that's a big build.

203
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,840
I found the name of the Pac-Man setting that has,

204
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,440
it's called Candy.

205
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
And if you go in Pac-Man Conf and look for Candy,

206
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,920
you can enable Pac-Man eating pieces of candy.

207
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,320
We're going to do it.

208
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
We're going to put a link in the show notes,

209
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,560
linuxunplug.com slash 335.

210
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,800
You know, Wes, you've got to come up

211
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,320
with a way to do these faster.

212
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,160
I mean, if I'm going to make you do it live on the show.

213
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,440
You're right.

214
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,400
I need to expedite.

215
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,160
You've got to buy that Mac Pro.

216
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,960
Callback.

217
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,440
Callback.

218
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
All right, should we check in in a little bit?

219
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,200
You want to check in?

220
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,700
All right.

221
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,720
We could hammer out a few predictions.

222
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,040
You keep an eye on that.

223
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,840
Give me the old thumbs up.

224
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
Don't hit a reboot, though, because I want the reboot

225
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,920
to be captured live.

226
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,440
Absolutely.

227
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,920
All right, OK.

228
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,080
All right, well, I was trying to stall a little bit

229
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,120
because after last week's episode,

230
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,800
I took such a beating on my reviews

231
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,680
that I have been completely humbled.

232
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,440
And I changed my approach for this episode.

233
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,800
For this episode, I'm going more pie in the sky.

234
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,560
I hope to thrill a little bit with the idea,

235
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,280
and maybe I'll get lucky.

236
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,940
I feel like I'm going to have the same chances as I did when

237
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,800
I really thought about it.

238
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,520
And then for my series predictions,

239
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,200
the ones where I actually am trying

240
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,520
to get competitive with Joe, I'm going to put those in Linux

241
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,280
Action News.

242
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,160
So many predictions.

243
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,640
It's probably out by now.

244
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,440
All right, so I'll start with one of mine,

245
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,880
and then we'll go around the horn, and we'll each do one.

246
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,760
I think we'll do three each, OK?

247
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,480
That sounds good.

248
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,560
We'll pick one of your, I've got more than three.

249
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,840
Is the judge ready?

250
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,400
I mean, we've got to make sure we hone these in,

251
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,040
and then, of course, lock them in.

252
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,880
If we have the judge's approval, I will begin.

253
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,960
I will reveal one of my first predictions.

254
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,160
The Honorable Judge.

255
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,240
Yeah, let's hear it.

256
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,460
All right, thank you, Judge.

257
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,340
I appreciate that.

258
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,080
Now, one thing to keep in mind, we

259
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,740
will be stating our predictions such that we have to lock them

260
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,160
in because we have to be accountable next year.

261
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,320
So we'll probably talk through them,

262
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,220
and then I'll probably ask each one of you

263
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,260
to state it clearly for the lock-in, which

264
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:31,200
will be followed by the official lock-in sound, which means

265
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
you can't change it after that.

266
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,280
And that's it.

267
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,560
No going back.

268
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,440
So for my first prediction, I predict in 2020,

269
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,920
after Ubuntu 2004 is out the door,

270
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,200
one of the interim releases in 2020,

271
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:53,440
which would be the one in October, will switch to Wayland.

272
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,280
What do you think?

273
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,600
Is that like the default?

274
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,400
So you install it, you boot up, you're in a Wayland session.

275
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,200
Is that an admissible prediction, Judge,

276
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,660
or is there any quabbles with that particular one?

277
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,280
Well, you're saying specifically it's

278
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,600
going to be in Ubuntu 2010.

279
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
I think I am by process of elimination.

280
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,640
I could make that clear in the prediction.

281
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
I think I just have to.

282
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,720
There's no other interim release, so all right.

283
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,560
I'll make it now.

284
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,760
I'll lock it in.

285
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,840
I predict in 2020 that Canonical will switch the Ubuntu release

286
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,480
over to Wayland in their 2010 release.

287
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,280
Locked it in.

288
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,920
I feel good.

289
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,080
I've just realized that these Ubuntu releases are

290
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,520
going to be very confusing.

291
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,600
We're going to be thinking they're talking about years

292
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,080
gone by.

293
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,320
2010, it's too confusing.

294
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,880
It's actually already confusing, because I have a small mind.

295
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,600
No reboots yet, Wes?

296
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Nothing over there?

297
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,200
Do we have a?

298
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,680
Oh, oh, we're building ourselves a new initRAMFS,

299
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
so that's a good start.

300
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,160
So we're getting really close.

301
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,720
Do you want to try to squeeze in a prediction before it?

302
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,240
Yeah, OK.

303
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Well, so I had some reasonable luck last year

304
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,680
about your personal preferences.

305
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,560
I'm going to try that again.

306
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,480
I think that in 2020, by the end of 2020,

307
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,240
you will be on Manjaro.

308
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,120
You may have dabbled.

309
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,160
You may have switched away.

310
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,600
But by the end of the year, you'll be back on Manjaro.

311
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,160
OK, Judge, I feel like he's got to be

312
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,040
specific on at least what machines,

313
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,400
or at least a category of machines.

314
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,680
But I'll leave it up to you.

315
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,560
ThinkPad, workstation upstairs, both count in my mind.

316
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,440
Now, you're saying I may go away.

317
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
But at the end of the year, by the end of the year,

318
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,120
I'll be on Manjaro.

319
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,920
Yeah.

320
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,720
I think we need to specify exactly what we

321
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,080
mean by the end of the year.

322
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,600
So by the time we record the predictions review episode.

323
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,160
Yeah, that sounds good.

324
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,080
All right.

325
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,880
All right, lock it in there, Wes.

326
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,080
I predict that by the next predictions episode,

327
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,760
you, my friend, will be on Manjaro.

328
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,240
All right, it's locked in.

329
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,840
That's really an interesting idea,

330
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,960
because I have been thoroughly enjoying my time on Manjaro.

331
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,600
It's a bet for stability.

332
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
That may go wrong knowing you, but I won't get a chance

333
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,000
to reflect on it next year.

334
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,480
You get stability along with access to the AUR,

335
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,400
and then all of your packages update with one tool.

336
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,040
Plus, you're so hooked on containers, right?

337
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,320
So you have the ability to get all the stuff where you want.

338
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,200
Huh.

339
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
And I got snaps.

340
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,160
And I got flat packs.

341
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,320
And sometimes you're just lazy.

342
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,120
Thanks, Wes.

343
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,800
But what desktop environment, Wes?

344
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,720
Bonus prediction.

345
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,560
Oh, yeah.

346
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,360
Random, random extra credit.

347
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,080
What do you think?

348
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,720
Plasma.

349
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
Really?

350
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't know.

351
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm watching the Gnome Shell Mudder blog,

352
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,200
and I'm looking at some of the improvements they're doing.

353
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,400
And I'm thinking, that's speaking to me again.

354
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,080
But of course, you give me another cycle.

355
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,880
Yeah, there's a long time here.

356
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,560
They're going to remove some feature that you're using.

357
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,440
That's probably true.

358
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,720
That's probably a safe prediction.

359
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,140
These extra credit predictions are probably

360
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,760
going to turn out all right.

361
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,600
How's that server update looking?

362
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
Are you feeling good?

363
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
We are ready to reboot.

364
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,200
OK.

365
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,400
Let's do it, Wes.

366
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,840
Let's reboot our production server.

367
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,040
Now, will this disconnect?

368
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,600
Because it's also doing DNS.

369
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,680
So if we lose you guys, we'll pick you back up.

370
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,080
No, we should be fine.

371
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,600
All right.

372
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,240
Kick it off, Wes.

373
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,840
Let's do this.

374
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,280
Well, let's get our ping going over here.

375
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,720
Goodbye, sweet server.

376
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,640
I hope you come back.

377
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,160
Oh, no.

378
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,440
See, you got to type your studio password.

379
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,600
That's how that works.

380
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,840
And reboot in progress.

381
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,920
I got to say, that super micro we have in there is so solid.

382
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,640
Buying from Unix Surplus was one of the best tips

383
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,160
that Alan Jude ever gave me.

384
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,720
It's really just been great for us.

385
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,400
Yeah, it has.

386
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,920
All right.

387
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,920
The only problem is that it's a legit server,

388
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,600
so it takes forever to reboot.

389
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,640
My Raspberry Pis boot faster than that thing.

390
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,400
You know, if we had an LTS distribution,

391
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,560
we probably wouldn't have to update kernel so much.

392
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,240
We wouldn't have to reboot so long.

393
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
No, I'm just kidding.

394
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,640
Oh, huh.

395
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,200
You know, there's this live patch service I hear about.

396
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,960
Oh.

397
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,760
Yeah.

398
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,360
That's sounding real attractive right now.

399
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,540
You know what Arch ought to do is come up

400
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,660
with a live patch service.

401
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,720
Maybe it's in the AUR.

402
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,480
So with VFIO, I actually end up having to rebuild my kernel

403
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,960
relatively often.

404
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,760
And I found quite a lot of success

405
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,480
in switching to the Arch LTS kernels.

406
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,560
Why didn't we do that?

407
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,880
Yeah, that's a nice option.

408
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,800
Why didn't we do the Arch LTS?

409
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,560
When we did this whole minimal Arch install,

410
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,640
how did that not cross our minds?

411
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,560
There's ZFS LTS packages.

412
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,060
Oh, we could investigate switching.

413
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,560
Maybe that will be on a future episode of this show.

414
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,280
Yeah, we should definitely try.

415
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,840
We should definitely try.

416
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,880
All right.

417
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,920
Well, why don't we do another prediction?

418
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,680
We'll come back and see how this is going.

419
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,320
What do you say?

420
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,880
I'll rudely interrupt as soon as it's back.

421
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Yeah, just give me the signal, because it

422
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
does take a little bit.

423
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,640
And I bet Cheesy you might be able to get one

424
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,320
of your predictions in here.

425
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,720
So why don't you start?

426
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah, so I predict in 2020 that Linux

427
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,320
becomes a viable option in the mobile space,

428
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,720
whether that be on a tablet or, more importantly, on a phone.

429
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,680
And to measure that, I say that UbiPorts

430
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,560
will gain at least 1% market share in the mobile space

431
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,240
operating system world.

432
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,000
Whoa.

433
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,960
That's pretty specific.

434
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,600
Are you thinking the PinePhone here is going to play a factor?

435
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm thinking the PinePhone.

436
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,160
I'm thinking the LeaveRoom.

437
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,840
I'm thinking there are going to be other devices that

438
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,200
may come out later in the year that we're not aware of yet.

439
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,000
Have you used UbiPorts lately?

440
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,800
I have.

441
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,440
I've used UbiPorts on a Nexus 5 that's

442
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,080
practically falling apart.

443
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,120
It's come a long way.

444
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,520
We've got pings.

445
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,720
Oh, OK.

446
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
We're back alive.

447
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,680
All right, Cheesy, why don't you lock this in?

448
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
What do you think, Judge?

449
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,920
You got any clarifications you want before he locks it in?

450
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,000
Are you sure you don't want to say 0.01% instead of 1%?

451
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,120
You know, I thought about the 0.5 or the 0.5,

452
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,880
but I'm just going to go bold.

453
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,080
I say let's I'm doing it, too.

454
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,120
Let's go for the thrills, Cheesy.

455
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,840
Lock it in.

456
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,320
Yeah, so I'm going to lock it in and say

457
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,880
that Linux becomes a viable option in the mobile space.

458
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,760
And to assert that, UbiPorts gains at least 1% market share

459
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
in that mobile space.

460
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,080
All right, I hope that one happens.

461
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,440
That would be incredible.

462
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,320
That would be really incredible.

463
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,840
Now it's time to find out if all of our applications are dead

464
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,400
and if our ZFS pool came back online

465
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,440
and if WireGuard is viable.

466
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,200
Wes Payne.

467
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,600
We're back up and running.

468
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,400
That's it?

469
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,000
That's it.

470
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,360
Isn't there some sort of drama, like Arch failed

471
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,240
to do something or rolling caused

472
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,880
some sort of horrible disaster?

473
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,480
Nope, we're just on the latest kernel.

474
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
It's fine.

475
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,080
OK.

476
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,200
That was very unsuspenseful.

477
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,400
So far, that's how it's been.

478
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,920
Yet, I have still gotten really anxious

479
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,520
about every major kernel file system WireGuard update.

480
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,440
Every single time, I'm still getting anxious.

481
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,680
I have like range anxiety.

482
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,200
I think we do need to do a test run of our rollback strategy.

483
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,480
That probably would make me feel better.

484
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,720
Yeah, because otherwise, I'm feeling

485
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,640
pretty confident about it.

486
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,120
Yeah.

487
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,680
And we have been staying very current.

488
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,360
So that's good.

489
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,760
And I think that's keeping it easy.

490
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,200
Both of us are just always SSHing and updating.

491
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,760
That's how you admin, folks.

492
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,120
It's pretty funny that Frankenstein's monster

493
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,040
of a server reboots no problem.

494
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,720
And yet, my Ubuntu LTS-based NAS box, often it'll reboot.

495
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,480
And my ext4 volume is just read-only.

496
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,400
And I have to reboot again.

497
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,800
So maybe there is something to this arch business.

498
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,840
I'll tell you what, too.

499
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,800
This thing's no slouch.

500
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,640
It's got a dozen or so different containerized applications

501
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,200
running on it, maybe more, because Nextclub

502
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,080
pulls in like 100 of them.

503
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,600
It's all about the containers, not the OS.

504
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,200
Now, Mr. Alex, let's say you get yourself

505
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,680
an opportunity for a prediction.

506
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,180
Which one are you going to go with for your first prediction

507
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,000
for 2020?

508
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,720
I predict that there will be a consumer-grade 20-terabyte

509
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,160
hard drive available in 2020.

510
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,560
Wow, that's pretty specific, Judge.

511
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,320
That is specific.

512
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,600
Are we talking an internal SATA one, or are we talking USB,

513
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,240
or what?

514
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,680
3 and 1 half-inch SATA consumer-grade.

515
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,640
Spinning Rust.

516
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,880
Spinning Rust hard drive, yeah, 20 terabytes.

517
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,380
Are you going to tell us how much you think it's going to be?

518
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,280
Could be an extra bonus prediction.

519
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,240
OK, so yes, I'll do a bonus.

520
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,920
We'll do an addendum prediction.

521
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,480
14 terabytes just now at Best Buy went down to about $210.

522
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,080
So I would say $250, maybe?

523
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,200
I would have gone $380.

524
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,520
I think I would have said $380.

525
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,600
Well, it depends if they get in the easy store or not.

526
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,120
Because if they do, then Best Buy will sell them for cheap.

527
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,600
If they don't, then they'll be in that $300, $400 range.

528
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,560
All right, we'll put together your primary prediction

529
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,320
in a nice soundbite, and we'll lock it in.

530
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,960
There will be a 3 and 1 half-inch hard drive

531
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:33,880
available to consumers of at least 20 terabytes in capacity.

532
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,360
I hope that's true.

533
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,400
I really do hope that's true.

534
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,880
Because that would be nice to fill the NAS up with those.

535
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
You know what I'm saying?

536
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,440
OK, very good.

537
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:42,920
Very good.

538
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,800
Now, Brent, I'm going to come back to you in a little bit

539
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,680
unless you're ready to go.

540
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,640
But I was going to give you some time since you

541
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,400
were surprised by the work today.

542
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,800
You didn't have time for homework.

543
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,480
I've been inspired, and I've been scribbling.

544
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,000
So I think I got something.

545
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,960
OK, all right, Brent.

546
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,380
Then why don't you lay on us your first prediction for 2020?

547
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,840
Well, I predict that in Q3 2020, we

548
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,880
will see the Librem 5 be released just sort of publicly.

549
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,880
None of this falling-apart business.

550
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,640
Sort of their main phone available for anybody, Q3.

551
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,080
The final production unit available for purchase

552
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,000
or just shipping?

553
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,840
I think there's a difference.

554
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,440
They may finally get it out, but they might not.

555
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,840
They might wait.

556
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,120
I wonder if they'll make a.

557
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,560
See, my concern there is there might be a different version

558
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,000
that ends up for general purchase

559
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,160
than there was the one that was crowdfunded.

560
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,800
Do you want to make a call there,

561
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,720
or is there a way we could word it where

562
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,000
you think it includes both?

563
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,280
Well, that would be too easy.

564
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,560
I mean, the final production-grade version

565
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,080
of the Librem would be shipping in Q3?

566
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,640
I mean, the problem with that, when

567
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,720
you go with the crowdfunders, is what is production-ready?

568
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,000
So I think the public one, ready for purchase for public,

569
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,840
is easier to define, even though it

570
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,320
wrecks my chances, most likely.

571
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,360
It is a little more limited, but it's also bold.

572
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,560
I think if you're going to be specific,

573
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,800
you should say something along the lines of,

574
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,580
you can buy it from their website

575
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,720
and have it delivered to you in the US within a week.

576
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,360
That time frame, though, might get you,

577
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,480
because they can't really.

578
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,360
Oh, Amazon's going to get them.

579
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,600
All right, OK.

580
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,480
A bonus question on that is, how much

581
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,760
do you think that device will actually

582
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,240
ship for when it's all said and done?

583
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,720
They did just raise the price, I think, $100 or something

584
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,600
like that, didn't they?

585
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,240
Isn't it going to be $2,000?

586
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,640
No, that's the US version.

587
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,880
But the totally compromised, that you can't trust version

588
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,200
is, I just think, raised up to $700.

589
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,600
Isn't that the implicit statement?

590
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,760
If you have two versions, isn't the implicit statement

591
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,680
that the other one isn't secure?

592
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,400
I just think that's a weird statement.

593
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,240
All right, but anyways, I think it's great that one of us

594
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,000
is going to make a prediction around this,

595
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,160
it's anyone's game, and I think we'd all

596
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,320
like to see it actually ship.

597
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,480
So Brent, do you have a lockable version of that?

598
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,920
I predict in Q3 2020, the Librem 5 phone

599
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,680
will be available to purchase on their website

600
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,760
and shipable for anyone in the public, not crowd funders.

601
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:23,160
For a bonus, it'll be within the $800 to $899 price range.

602
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,520
All right, it's locked.

603
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,720
It's locked, Brent.

604
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,800
Good, I like that.

605
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,120
Why did you pick Q3?

606
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,920
I'm interested in that.

607
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,000
Because it's a long time from now, but not completely

608
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,600
at the end.

609
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,600
It seems, yeah, that's pretty reasonable.

610
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,120
OK.

611
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,000
I remember they've put out a lot of news in Q3,

612
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,520
not so much in Q4.

613
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,400
Are you ready for one of my little sillier ones,

614
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,560
but I would love to see it happen?

615
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,640
My prediction for 2020 is that Plasma Shell on Chrome OS

616
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,600
will become available somehow, either officially or hacked,

617
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,080
including potentially the Plasma Shell release that's

618
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,360
in a Docker container, which there is one already.

619
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,520
I think KDE Neon releases in a container.

620
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,240
What does it mean?

621
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,720
So unofficially, how do we, is this one person

622
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,080
who has a build up on GitHub, or is it a Linux post?

623
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,000
But it's reproducible.

624
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,560
It has to be like you and I could set it up.

625
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,280
So you get a Chromebook, you install the Linux environment,

626
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,840
you run this script, boom, you got Plasma Shell.

627
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,960
Well, I've got a Chromebook.

628
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,120
So you could say that Joe has to get

629
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,160
Plasma running on his Chromebook.

630
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,080
But then will I deliberately fail to do it just to spite you?

631
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,200
I wonder if the issue would be like you have

632
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,560
to have a GPU kwin supports.

633
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,600
So that could be tricky.

634
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,960
And if it's in a container, you'd

635
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,600
have to get a container that Chrome OS would run.

636
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,800
And it doesn't necessarily mean the things

637
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,440
would get passed through.

638
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,320
So this has a lot of ifs, ands, buts, maybes.

639
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,680
However, I just am in love with the idea

640
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,040
of an alternative free desktop getting

641
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,480
loaded on top of Chrome OS for some reason.

642
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,160
I was going to say Gnome Shell, but then thinking about it,

643
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,120
I thought, no, it's probably more likely

644
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,400
with the modularity of Plasma, they

645
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,920
could get different components working

646
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,880
with different workarounds.

647
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,920
It's going to be more flexible, easy to sort of hack it in.

648
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,120
Yeah, so I think that's my prediction now.

649
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,360
Do I need to tweak it a little bit?

650
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,800
I don't know if I'm going to say like your machine specifically,

651
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,320
because that could be GPU limited,

652
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,040
but I could get all the way there except for that one issue.

653
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,560
It's too limiting, I think.

654
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,160
I think essentially what has to have happened

655
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,080
is there has to be a reproducible method

656
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,040
to run the Plasma Shell on Chrome OS

657
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,200
by this time next year, which is late December as we record.

658
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,800
And if it's via Shell script on GitHub

659
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,000
or a full screen VM environment, I don't know,

660
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,880
but it'll happen.

661
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,760
What do you think?

662
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,040
Yeah, I think that's reasonable.

663
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,240
All right, I'll try to see, how can I summarize that?

664
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,640
I need to tighten that a little bit,

665
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,040
because it's kind of a little floaty, right?

666
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,560
Yeah, it is.

667
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,280
All right, I'll give a shot at it.

668
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,600
Tell me what you think of this.

669
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,040
I predict in 2020 that by some means,

670
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,560
it will be possible to run Plasma Shell on top of Chrome OS

671
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,840
before the end of the year.

672
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,400
All right, I mean, it's a little tight,

673
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,920
but I'd love to see it, you know?

674
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,000
I mean, if I could get a Chromebook for a couple hundred

675
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,520
bucks.

676
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,800
Yeah, I mean, I think if you get desperate enough

677
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,520
by the end of the year, sometime in early December,

678
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,880
you're going to buy a Chromebook and start hacking away on it.

679
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,280
Well, funny enough is I thought for sure by this time last year

680
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,320
I'd have a Chromebook, but it just never really quite

681
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,840
came up.

682
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,760
Joe ended up getting the Chromebook, so go figure.

683
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
All right, Mr. Painter, are you ready to trot out

684
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,600
another one of yours?

685
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,360
We're going to do three each, so this is your second pick.

686
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,480
I've enjoyed playing the game, but I'm

687
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,280
not sure I've enjoyed playing around with Stadia with you.

688
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,800
And unfortunately for this prediction,

689
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,080
I think that by this time next year,

690
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,920
Stadia will be on its way out.

691
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,360
Sunset, maybe not totally offline,

692
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,120
but plans announced that it's going to be discontinued.

693
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,200
That fast, huh?

694
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,680
Wow.

695
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,960
I wondered if one of us would make a Stadia prediction.

696
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,600
That was on my list of possible predictions,

697
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,760
because it's so up in the air.

698
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,760
And I think, Joe, you and I were spitballing

699
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,520
possible predictions, and Stadia came up in that batch, too.

700
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,480
Yeah, I think that if by the end of this year

701
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
they do announce that it is going to go away,

702
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,480
then they're going to have to also announce that people are

703
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,080
going to get refunds for their games.

704
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,040
Otherwise, people are going to be up in arms.

705
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,380
It seems clear to me, and I don't have any insider info,

706
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,180
but the game publishers must be setting these prices,

707
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,600
because they're all over.

708
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,480
As much as $99, $60, $40, they're all over the place.

709
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,000
So it would, I think, be up to the game manufacturers

710
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
to do those refunds.

711
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,120
And I think Google's going to just have to swallow it.

712
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,840
I think that's too soon, Wes.

713
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,440
Google like to have a long tail before they retire products.

714
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,880
So unless it is a genuine disaster,

715
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,360
I think you're premature.

716
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
Although they are kind of transitioning to a kill

717
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,760
fast and kill often culture, where something doesn't work,

718
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,440
they pull the plug more and more.

719
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,560
You know, knowing Google, I reckon

720
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,480
they'll probably launch a competitor to Stadia.

721
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,360
That's right there.

722
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,680
You don't have to hear everything, at least, right?

723
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,760
All right, I think you could lock that in, Wes.

724
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,800
I think that's probably admissible, so go ahead.

725
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,440
It doesn't make me happy to say, but I

726
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,920
predict that by the end of 2020, Google

727
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,960
will have announced the sunsetting of Stadia.

728
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,960
The sunsetting, not necessarily the end, but like a timeline.

729
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,840
Very good, very good, very good.

730
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,600
All right, Mr. Cheesy, you got two more to pick from.

731
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
I know you got a few.

732
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,340
So what's your number two prediction for 2020?

733
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,960
So my number two prediction for 2020

734
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,840
is that most Linux desktop environments will have

735
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,000
high DPI support out of the box.

736
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,780
And a metric to measure that is that XFCE

737
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,160
will have high DPI support in their next release

738
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
out of the box.

739
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,040
All right, because you could argue

740
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Gnome Shell, Plasma, and Pantheon do.

741
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,080
Right.

742
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,360
But you're right, there's still, what about things like LXQt?

743
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,360
And because I know you can turn it on there, can't you,

744
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,520
in LXQt?

745
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,560
Here's the question, Cheesy.

746
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,200
By default, do you mean that if I'm on a high DPI display,

747
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,960
not only will it support high DPI,

748
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,360
but it will actually be turned on or is just available?

749
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,560
I will say that it would actually be turned on by default.

750
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,360
The desktop environment will recognize

751
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,560
that you're using a high DPI monitor

752
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,040
and will switch into high DPI mode.

753
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,120
Just works.

754
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,280
That's risky.

755
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,440
That's risky, although it's got a lot of hope

756
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,400
in the Linux desktop.

757
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,320
I have heard of a couple of different desktop projects

758
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,840
that are working on that, and Pantheon already does it.

759
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Right.

760
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,040
Proved it out.

761
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,680
All right.

762
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,960
What do you think, Judge?

763
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,560
Well, I think that XFCE kind of has that already.

764
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,880
It's not quite fully baked yet, but I think

765
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,480
this is probably a dead cert.

766
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,040
So lock it in if you want, but you're not

767
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
going to get much credibility for saying it.

768
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,280
The idea that XFCE will actually release in the next year.

769
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
See, I think that's it.

770
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,560
I think that's where Alex and I are at.

771
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,240
It's possible that it's on their roadmap.

772
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,360
They're getting close.

773
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,600
That doesn't mean it's going to be shipping in a year.

774
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,880
Yeah, but you've got GTK 3 already,

775
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,400
and so with a point release, you could have this potentially.

776
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,560
Not in an Ubuntu LTS or whatever, but in Arch certainly.

777
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,880
I think it's still up in the air.

778
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,160
I think he'd definitely nail it with Plasma, Gnome Shell,

779
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,560
and a few of the others, especially the ones

780
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
based on Qt.

781
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,120
But when you throw XFCE in there, I don't know, man,

782
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,080
because they've already got GTK 3 support

783
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,880
and they haven't done it yet.

784
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,320
I think that's anyone's game.

785
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,560
I don't know, though.

786
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,280
If you want them to make it more specific, you're the judge.

787
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,800
Let me say that I believe that XFCE will have it enabled out

788
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,720
of the box, and as we spoke to before,

789
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,920
it will recognize your display and enable it

790
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,360
if you do have a high DPI display.

791
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,280
That's a big bar, too.

792
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,840
All right, Cheezy, put it up in a nice sound bite

793
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,880
and lock it in.

794
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,280
All right, so I believe that Linux desktop environments,

795
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,400
including XFCE, will have high DPI support out of the box

796
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,640
and will enable a high DPI display by default

797
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,000
if it's connected to your system.

798
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,880
We have a brand new XPS 13 in-house for review right now.

799
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,800
Wes and I have been testing it over the last few weeks.

800
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,220
We'll have a review coming up soon,

801
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,640
and it's got a high DPI display.

802
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,720
It's so gorgeous.

803
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,360
I always say that, but they really have just nailed it.

804
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,360
Yeah, it's really nice.

805
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,680
It really is great.

806
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,000
OK, Mr. Ironic Badger, a couple more predictions

807
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,640
available, these are your last two.

808
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,080
What's your next one?

809
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,120
My next one is about WireGuard, and specifically

810
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,040
that because it's going to be included in kernel 5.6, which

811
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,080
will miss the Ubuntu LTS release in April,

812
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,320
that that release will find a way

813
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,360
to ship with WireGuard baked into the kernel.

814
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,000
I see there's a second part of this prediction, too,

815
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,960
a slightly bolder aspect to this prediction.

816
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,120
The second part is that PF Sense will ship WireGuard.

817
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,880
Boy, that'd be great.

818
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,840
That would be really great.

819
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,600
I can see it.

820
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,840
I mean, we're going to probably see it most certainly,

821
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,080
but not for sure, mainline towards the beginning

822
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,960
of the year.

823
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,080
So it'll be in the main kernel, probably within Q1,

824
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,960
and then maybe Q2, and then it'll be, I would imagine,

825
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,040
getting baked into all kinds of things.

826
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,440
So the specific prediction here, Alex, just so I've got it,

827
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,720
is WireGuard will find its way into 2004,

828
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,960
even if it misses the kernel window,

829
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,560
and PF Sense will ship WireGuard.

830
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,500
So you're saying two specific products

831
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,200
will ship WireGuard in 2020.

832
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,480
Yes, and specifically, I think what I mean with 2004

833
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,320
is that it won't be a DKMS module.

834
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,640
Right, but are you saying it'll be before the point release,

835
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,680
before 2004.1?

836
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,080
I'm hoping.

837
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,920
I'm hoping here.

838
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,120
You know, reading Jim's article about it on Ars Technica

839
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,200
the other day, the developer for WireGuard

840
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,120
has offered to do a bunch of work with Canonical

841
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,320
to get it into the LTS release before the kernel ships.

842
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,000
All right, why don't you sum it up and log it in.

843
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,560
So I predict that Ubuntu LTS 2004 will ship with WireGuard,

844
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,920
not as a DKMS module.

845
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,400
And also, as a second half prediction,

846
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,040
that PF Sense will ship with WireGuard.

847
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,080
I hope that happens.

848
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,960
Oh, I hope that happens.

849
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,240
Brent, have you been inspired with a second prediction

850
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,160
by this time?

851
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:42,280
Well, I thought of one that touches on my hopes that

852
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,200
came up last year in January.

853
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,520
We had a hopes episode.

854
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,320
And so I'm going to, unfortunately, it didn't happen.

855
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,560
So I'm going to throw it out there for this year.

856
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:57,400
I predict that Dell this year will make available

857
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,840
a main Linux distribution on either, as a standard option,

858
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,160
on either their XPS or Precision line

859
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,520
on their website in the US.

860
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,080
They go pop OS style.

861
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,240
Yep, but they're not baking it themselves.

862
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,320
So not a developer edition, you mean?

863
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,800
Not a developer edition.

864
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,520
I mean, you can go to Dell.com, click on the Precision button,

865
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,160
and it's an option.

866
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,360
Oh, I see.

867
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,280
I thought you meant they're going

868
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,880
to make their own Linux distro.

869
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,760
No, sorry.

870
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,140
That's way too crazy.

871
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,480
So they're going to open it up beyond just the developer

872
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,760
focus in 2020 is what you're thinking.

873
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,040
Linux will be kind of a configurable option

874
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,000
when you purchase a laptop from Dell.com.

875
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,600
You know, what's interesting, Brent,

876
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,680
is I could riff on that a little bit

877
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,200
because I had a rough prediction that

878
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,400
didn't make it into the show.

879
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,720
And that was, in 2020, Linux would

880
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,880
become the bring your own OS of choice

881
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,520
to workspaces for developers and DevOps and system

882
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,720
administrators and people working on cloud native.

883
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,920
And I think, much like the Mac revolution

884
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,440
was really started by individual employees wanting

885
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,400
to use their own iPhones or their own Macs,

886
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,680
that's what really got Apple into the enterprise.

887
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,840
I think that's the same trajectory over 2020

888
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,160
that will accelerate for Linux.

889
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,880
I just didn't have a refined.

890
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,840
But what Brent's kind of on the other end of it,

891
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,200
he's saying it's going to go into consumer space.

892
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,920
It's perhaps bold.

893
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,480
It is.

894
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,120
It is.

895
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,880
But I could see them also wanting to hedge their bets,

896
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,940
potentially.

897
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,000
Do you think you could sum it up into a lockable prediction?

898
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,960
In 2020, Dell will make available on their US website,

899
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:38,280
Dell.com, Linux as a configurable option

900
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,360
on their standard either precision or XPS line

901
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,880
of laptops.

902
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,240
I love some of these.

903
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,000
If even just a few of these kind of semi-hopeful predictions

904
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,560
happen, that'd be great.

905
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,760
OK, so for my next prediction, this is my last one.

906
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,760
And I have three additional ones written down.

907
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,840
And I need some help picking.

908
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,560
So I'm going to throw out my three.

909
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,220
And you guys tell me which one you think I should officially

910
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,560
lock in, OK?

911
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,720
Number one, I have noticed a plethora

912
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,000
of projects cropping up attempting

913
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,720
to solve synchronized network audio playback.

914
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,520
And I've recently solved this problem myself in the RV.

915
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,920
And holy snowballs, if it isn't actually just really great.

916
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,100
And I could definitely see synchronized network audio

917
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,680
becoming a table stakes kind of any serious open source

918
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,720
media playback solution will have

919
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,080
some sort of baked-in support for synchronized audio

920
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
playback, whatever that might be.

921
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,160
That was one of them.

922
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,600
The other one was Home Assistant becomes the next free software

923
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,480
is Kodi.

924
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,720
How do you measure that?

925
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,680
That's the trick, right?

926
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,040
Devices become sold like Home Assistant boxes

927
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,400
start getting sold, like Kodi boxes.

928
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,240
So like pre-configured little setups?

929
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,920
Maybe with like HASS.io and different crazy add-ons

930
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,480
pre-installed, some of which may or may not be all that legit.

931
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,180
But none of them let you stream piracy,

932
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,080
so they're not going to be popular.

933
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,080
Maybe.

934
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,840
And then my third kind of pie in the sky,

935
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,760
but could possibly totally happen,

936
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,560
was a classic, Seuss gets sold again.

937
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,600
That's always here.

938
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,920
So those are my three synchronized.

939
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,080
I guess your safest bet there.

940
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,880
I know, right?

941
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,040
It is.

942
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,400
My three are synchronized network audio playback,

943
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,800
Home Assistant goes the way of the Kodi box,

944
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,920
or Seuss gets sold.

945
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,680
Which do you think has the, like I need a win.

946
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,000
I think Seuss, also it's the easiest one to sort of measure.

947
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,600
I think the other two we have some work ahead of us

948
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,520
if you choose.

949
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,360
Well, OK, what if the synchronized network audio

950
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,400
was measured by it coming to Kodi somehow?

951
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,560
So Kodi media playback or Plex, some sort of.

952
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,000
Home Assistant, how's it built in?

953
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,960
I did not know that, really.

954
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,720
Of course it does.

955
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,920
I love it.

956
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,200
Seuss sold obviously would be the easiest,

957
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,040
but I actually don't know if it's as likely.

958
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,560
I really don't anymore.

959
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,120
But of course, I haven't understood

960
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,060
why it's been sold the last couple of times.

961
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,460
So what do I know?

962
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,520
Maybe it will.

963
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,320
It kind of depends on what stage of the market hype

964
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,200
Kubernetes is in.

965
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,920
And I think it's in kind of a cooling and consolidating stage

966
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,400
now.

967
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,120
Not that it's not being used, absolutely,

968
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,600
but that it's just sort of maturing a little bit.

969
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,160
And so putting Kubernetes is about as effective

970
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,440
as putting blockchain in your name right now, I think.

971
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,040
So I don't think Seuss has got a strong play that

972
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,680
makes it super valuable, other than a really solid, great

973
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,640
customer base with some important people

974
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,800
in the industry, which is very valuable.

975
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,320
But I don't think it's likely to sell yet.

976
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,400
They probably want a nice return on them.

977
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,240
I don't think they're there yet.

978
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,200
I think they need to invest a little bit more

979
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,360
for a little bit longer.

980
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,100
So that leaves me with synchronized network

981
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,360
audio or Home Assistant.

982
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,120
We go on the way of the Cody box.

983
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,240
I think the Home Assistant seems the most hopeful.

984
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,000
That would really change the game for a lot of people.

985
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,920
I know you've kind of hoped this happened for a while.

986
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,280
So that's where my vote lays.

987
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,000
So rather than making it about Home Assistant,

988
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,120
maybe it should be about this news

989
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,000
lately around competing smart home standards.

990
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,600
There's consolidation in the market around Zigbee and Zed

991
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,100
Wave and MQTT and all these different things

992
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,280
that Apple and Google and whatever are releasing.

993
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,520
There's consolidation in the home automation market

994
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,920
or something like that.

995
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,720
Sure.

996
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,600
Sure.

997
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,040
And Apple just announced that they're

998
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,920
open sourcing part of the HomeKit development.

999
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,520
Is that right?

1000
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah.

1001
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,880
So they're open sourcing aspects of HomeKit,

1002
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,400
which is mind blowing, because that's actually

1003
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
my favorite home automation standard so far,

1004
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,320
since it's all over the land.

1005
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,280
I was sad to see that.

1006
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,400
That was going to be my prediction.

1007
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,960
And then they went and did it in 2019.

1008
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,040
So the thing about Home Assistant

1009
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,080
is it solves a problem that has a lot of momentum already

1010
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,400
in the marketplace.

1011
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
So even with all of these open standards, which

1012
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,000
will probably make things, if at all best case,

1013
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,160
better in the future, today people

1014
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,240
have bought a bunch of crazy different little devices

1015
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,480
on their Wi-Fi network, or they might have older Z Wave devices.

1016
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,400
And Home Assistant is just honey badger.

1017
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,040
It brings it all together.

1018
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,160
You can have a proprietary TP-Link adapter.

1019
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,520
You can have a GE Z Wave adapter.

1020
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,080
You can have a HomeKit device.

1021
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,160
It just doesn't care.

1022
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,320
It brings it all together.

1023
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,920
It reads the smart electric meter on the side of my house.

1024
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,880
It plugs in with literally everything.

1025
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,920
Sort of like how Kodi just will play any file.

1026
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,760
It'll play it over NFS, Samba.

1027
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,080
You can do a Plex add-in.

1028
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,120
It's that same kind of flexibility

1029
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,560
that makes it attractive to third party installers

1030
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,340
to make it a product.

1031
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,160
I've honestly fantasized about creating

1032
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,200
a business around a appliance Home Assistant kit.

1033
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,160
And I even made one for a family member as a gift,

1034
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
just because it's so simple with the Raspberry Pi.

1035
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,540
And I put in a little flirt case,

1036
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,280
and it looks like a legitimate product.

1037
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,400
So I think I want to go with the Home Assistant one.

1038
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,320
I'm talking myself into it.

1039
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,480
And I think the way I'll make it specific is there's

1040
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,840
going to be some box you can buy,

1041
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,960
either officially from the Home Assistant project

1042
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,800
or a third party that loads like Haas IO or Home Assistant.

1043
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,240
And you can buy that, and it's called like a Home Assistant

1044
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,280
box or something.

1045
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,240
I don't know what they'll call it.

1046
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,520
All right.

1047
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,080
I'll start selling those boxes, so you

1048
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,720
can slip me a tenner later.

1049
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
What do you think, Judge?

1050
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Is that admissible?

1051
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Yeah, I'd say so.

1052
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,520
All right.

1053
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,800
In 2020, we will see the introduction

1054
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,320
of a Home Assistant box, either by the project directly

1055
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,640
or a third party bundler that creates a Home Assistant

1056
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,840
appliance.

1057
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,680
Nicely done.

1058
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,520
I think that should happen.

1059
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,600
Somebody should take that idea and run with it.

1060
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,880
No chance.

1061
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,920
Thanks for the optimism.

1062
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
All right, Wes.

1063
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,600
I think people underestimate this project.

1064
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,760
It's so great.

1065
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,760
OK, Wes, it's your last prediction for 2020.

1066
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,800
What do you got for us?

1067
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,920
Well, I'm trying to decide if I should, you know.

1068
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,840
Do I want to play it safe here and try to get something

1069
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,600
I think I might have a reasonable chance of?

1070
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,320
Get a solid win.

1071
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:09,820
Right.

1072
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,840
Or do I just, you know, keep on having fun?

1073
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,120
I know.

1074
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,360
It is a lot of fun to just kind of go for the pie in the sky.

1075
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,200
But I think I'd like to be consistent here.

1076
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,120
And I'm just going to take one from last year's.

1077
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,760
I think BcashFS actually makes it this year.

1078
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,640
Into the mainline tree.

1079
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,960
You know, Linus pulls it in.

1080
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
I don't know if it'll actually make it out in time

1081
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,480
to make it to a distro ship or a kernel ship by Ubuntu or so.

1082
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,320
But it'll be in the main kernel tree.

1083
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,200
Yeah.

1084
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,240
I'd love to see that.

1085
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,840
I think that would be fantastic for those of us that

1086
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,680
have MVNE drives.

1087
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,160
NVME.

1088
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,320
NVME.

1089
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,080
Am I doing it on purpose now?

1090
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,560
All right.

1091
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
What do you think, Judge?

1092
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,360
Is that admissible?

1093
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,280
Yeah, I'd say so.

1094
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,240
All right, Mr. West, lock it in then.

1095
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,920
I predict that in 2020, BcashFS makes it

1096
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,240
into the Linux kernel mainline.

1097
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,440
I hope that's a slam dunk.

1098
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,160
Fingers crossed.

1099
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Now, Cheesy, there's a couple left on your list.

1100
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,200
Which one do you want to pick as your final 2020 prediction, sir?

1101
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,920
Well, I'm going to be that guy.

1102
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm going to pick two.

1103
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,240
One is I don't believe that Chris will learn

1104
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,400
how to pronounce NVME in 2020.

1105
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,680
But since I'm not going to win any of these,

1106
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,120
and since none of these are going to work out in my favor,

1107
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,920
I'm just going to go with the pie in the sky here.

1108
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,480
And I'm going to say that Amazon or Google

1109
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:32,080
will launch a consumer-based robot assistant akin to Butler

1110
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,600
or something a little more than a robot vacuum cleaner.

1111
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,600
But I think that one of the big players

1112
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,240
will launch a consumer-based robot assistant.

1113
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,560
I was thinking of that exact sound effect, Chris.

1114
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,640
Yep, it's Rosie the robot.

1115
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,760
You know, that'd be semi-compelling.

1116
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,960
There was a third party assistant robot.

1117
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,560
And ironically, there is a really sad documentary

1118
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,960
on YouTube about the life of this robot.

1119
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,240
It entered into families' homes.

1120
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,920
And then the cloud service that powered the robot

1121
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,360
was shut down in this weird, awkward way

1122
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,840
in such that the robot slowly died and lost

1123
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,360
certain functionality.

1124
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,520
That's so sad.

1125
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,440
So the documentary covers families

1126
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,360
that are experiencing the degradation

1127
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,560
of their little friendly robot.

1128
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,360
It's really something.

1129
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,480
But it has been done.

1130
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,280
It had a screen.

1131
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,000
It had eyes.

1132
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,160
It could follow you around.

1133
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,320
It could roll around like a little R2 unit.

1134
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,320
So I could see it cheesy, especially

1135
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,120
with all of the investment that they have

1136
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,200
to put into something like this.

1137
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,280
Now, are you picturing something that's

1138
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,720
like Roomba-style mobile?

1139
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,040
Or is it in one room?

1140
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,560
Is it walking?

1141
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,800
Is it more like an R2 robot style?

1142
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,360
Give me a mental image.

1143
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,440
So I don't think it will be bipedal.

1144
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,440
I don't think it will be walking around.

1145
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,680
I think it will have some sort of a motor system and wheels.

1146
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,760
But I do believe that it will be able to go from room to room

1147
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,120
and assist you in different ways.

1148
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,400
Tank, set a timer.

1149
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,400
More than just a specialized kind of robot,

1150
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,480
but something that can actually assist you in the home.

1151
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,600
Have you seen the Boston Dynamics robot

1152
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,440
that can do parkour now?

1153
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:18,920
I have.

1154
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,720
I have.

1155
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,680
This is so freaky.

1156
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,680
And not like one of these 70s robots

1157
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,560
where they actually just put a little person

1158
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,800
inside of the robot.

1159
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
It just rolls in on its little tank treads

1160
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,920
while your family's sleeping and murders everyone

1161
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,560
in their sleep.

1162
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,520
No, I got you.

1163
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,200
Well, that's only if you tell it to.

1164
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,200
Guys, I've just put into the chat a little YouTube video

1165
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,560
to show you what is possible with high-end robotics

1166
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,040
these days.

1167
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,280
It's incredible.

1168
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,040
Boston Dynamics.

1169
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,160
Yeah, it's pretty freaky.

1170
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,400
So as long as you don't install the murder skill, though,

1171
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,040
right, Cheese?

1172
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,800
That's right.

1173
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,840
Yeah, the murder container, I think, is what it would be called.

1174
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,800
All right, so Judge, what do you need from this

1175
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,760
to make this a lockable prediction?

1176
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,800
I need specifics.

1177
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,360
I don't know.

1178
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,040
There's a lot being said there.

1179
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,840
How can you boil that down to be something specific?

1180
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,160
There's a very, very scary future

1181
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,640
that Cheese could possibly be predicting here.

1182
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,320
It's listening, and it follows you around

1183
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,520
so it can capture everything.

1184
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,760
And there's no way it runs open source.

1185
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,840
What do you think, Cheesy?

1186
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,080
Can you nail it down a little bit?

1187
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,080
Give us a couple of specifics we can sink our teeth into.

1188
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,880
Maybe ask your robot to nail it down.

1189
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,280
I don't feel like it's that crazy,

1190
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,000
because they would get even more data into their systems

1191
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,460
if they're watching you all the time.

1192
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,640
So could happen.

1193
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,480
I would say, more specifically, that Amazon or Google

1194
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,480
will launch a consumer-based robot that

1195
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,640
is mobile in your home to assist you with various tasks,

1196
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,960
including getting you a beer from the refrigerator.

1197
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,880
OK, Alex, it's your last prediction for 2020.

1198
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,440
What do you want to throw into the pile?

1199
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,480
I predict that Brent will never switch laptops.

1200
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:50,960
Hey, now.

1201
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,800
That's a nice and easy one, Judge.

1202
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,840
I mean, how long ago did you buy that thing, Pat?

1203
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,560
Over a month?

1204
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,800
How have you not switched yet?

1205
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,240
Come on, but you've got Linux Fest Northwest to think of.

1206
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,080
If nothing else, it'll happen at Linux Fest.

1207
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,600
All right, let's do a real one.

1208
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,680
OK.

1209
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,440
I predict that Plex will continue

1210
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,280
to alienate their core user base.

1211
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,760
And as a result, one of the open source replacements,

1212
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,760
such as MB, Jellyfin, or Olaris, will

1213
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,560
become a viable alternative by shipping apps

1214
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,920
on a major platform, such as Roku, Android TV, or Apple TV.

1215
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,060
Seems like Roku should be pretty doable for Jellyfin or MB.

1216
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,720
As well as Apple TV, you just got to get it

1217
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,440
in the iOS app store, which you'd probably want to get it

1218
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,880
on iPads and phones, too.

1219
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,480
Well, I mean, Plex is already available for the Roku, so.

1220
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,980
This feels like two different predictions to me.

1221
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,280
This feels like prediction number one

1222
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,960
is that Plex alienates core users by doing more things

1223
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,040
people don't like.

1224
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,880
And prediction number two is that MB or Jellyfin

1225
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,160
end up on a commercial device.

1226
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,280
But the selection that Plex have in their latest free movies

1227
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,080
thing, their leading movie poster was The Terminator.

1228
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,640
I mean, what does that tell you?

1229
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,200
It tells me that's a great movie.

1230
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:01,680
I'm in.

1231
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,120
Retro goodness, yeah.

1232
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,000
OK, one good movie.

1233
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,320
I actually did watch one.

1234
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,120
I did watch one just, and it wasn't that bad.

1235
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,200
It was some old cheesy sci-fi movie.

1236
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,600
I totally think this is possible because Plex is

1237
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,680
in a absolutely impossible position.

1238
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,560
And that is they are number one with a bullet

1239
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,840
in enabling streaming piracy from your own hard drives.

1240
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,480
But they make it really easy to not pay for any

1241
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,360
of these new streaming services.

1242
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,800
And there's Disney+, and Apple, and NBC, and HBO.

1243
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,360
And of course, all of the ones that

1244
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,600
have been around forever start to really get

1245
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,760
serious about streaming.

1246
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,640
They're going to look at the tools that

1247
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,520
enable people to steal.

1248
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,440
Just like the Cody boxes were targets,

1249
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,640
I kind of wonder if Plex as an organization

1250
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,400
won't become a target.

1251
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,120
And what is their business model?

1252
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,080
At the moment, it's selling Plex Pass,

1253
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,440
which is $5 a month, I think.

1254
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,320
Or sometimes it's on sale for $90 lifetime.

1255
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,040
And what is the core feature of Plex Pass?

1256
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,120
Offline sync.

1257
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,120
Offline sync, and there's also some streaming.

1258
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,800
Easier access to all your pirated stuff.

1259
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,040
Yeah, it just makes it easier.

1260
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,400
And it's also very easy to stream and play Plex content

1261
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,520
from other people's servers.

1262
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,840
So you don't even have to do the pirating yourself.

1263
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,440
You can just have a network of friends

1264
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,200
that have done the pirating and use Plex to watch it.

1265
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,480
So I could see them, because of the optics of this,

1266
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,080
having to just launch more and more

1267
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,320
into sort of commercial, legitimate streaming services

1268
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,600
to make Plex from the outside look

1269
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,440
like a brand that's based around streaming internet content.

1270
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,240
Because if you look at this year, they've added Tidal.

1271
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,600
They've added podcasts.

1272
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,200
They've added the free movie streaming thing.

1273
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,920
None of those things are things I want from a server that's

1274
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,600
playing media that's stored locally for me.

1275
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,000
Yeah, that's why I really do think this is Jellyfin's gain

1276
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,560
to have here, other than its UI is atrocious, just like MB's.

1277
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,400
And that's where Olaris comes in for me.

1278
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,080
That thing is beautiful.

1279
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,680
Yes, but really, starting all over again

1280
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,600
in a brand new product when Plex is getting

1281
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,360
mature and feature rich, and you've

1282
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,480
invested all of your time in organizing your library,

1283
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,520
that's a tough sell.

1284
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,280
It's hard, but then again, these guys

1285
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,080
making these open source alternatives

1286
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,400
know that Plex is a captive market to aim at.

1287
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,760
And so they can write tools to pull out

1288
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,640
the metadata from your Plex library

1289
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,920
so that watch status and that kind of thing

1290
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,040
just comes over no problem.

1291
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,440
Not everyone cares about that.

1292
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,560
I don't care about that at all.

1293
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,560
Yeah, if you're starting from.

1294
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,920
I move them back and forth all the time.

1295
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,180
Yeah, if you're starting from a very small batch or from

1296
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,960
scratch, it doesn't matter at all, I suppose.

1297
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,560
I think you're right, Alex, in that the real kind of tell

1298
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,800
would be if you could get this on a Roku or an Apple

1299
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,900
TV or an Android Google Play.

1300
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,560
So I think we've got to whittle this down

1301
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,120
to kind of a more specific prediction.

1302
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,040
And I fire you.

1303
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,000
I'd go for the Jellyfin or MB one,

1304
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,320
because I think that's really what you need to see,

1305
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,760
and then Plex will lay its own bet.

1306
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,280
All right, so I predict that MB or Jellyfin or Olaris

1307
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,640
will become a viable alternative to Plex

1308
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,280
by shipping apps on one of the major platforms,

1309
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,920
such as Roku, Android TV, or Apple TV.

1310
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,840
That's solid.

1311
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,960
Nice.

1312
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,360
That's another one I'd really like

1313
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,840
to see, because that's really what it would take for me.

1314
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,520
Import my library metadata, make a great streaming application,

1315
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,960
have it support auto bit rate adjustment,

1316
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,280
and let me have at it.

1317
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,840
I think that'd be pretty good.

1318
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,360
Brent, you don't happen to have one third last prediction

1319
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,200
for 2020, do you?

1320
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,860
Could always steal one you like from the doc

1321
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,480
that hasn't been used.

1322
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,240
That's true.

1323
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,740
That's true.

1324
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,400
Drew has a couple of good ones in there.

1325
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,360
He wasn't able to make it, but you could

1326
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,600
pick one of Drew's in there.

1327
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,960
Well, OK, I'm going to crowdsource this one then,

1328
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,200
since I'm delinquent and don't have the doc in front of me.

1329
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,000
Can we go through Drew's and decide collectively

1330
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,600
which one I should go for?

1331
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,260
All right, a major hardware vulnerability

1332
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,160
near the scale of Spectre is found in ARM.

1333
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,040
Oh, good one.

1334
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,800
AMD continues to gain against Intel,

1335
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,720
surging to more than 50% market share for the year.

1336
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,400
Ooh.

1337
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
So that's just probably, he means probably the year sales.

1338
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,480
That seems possible.

1339
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,720
And finally, a major voice assistant, Alexa, Google,

1340
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,080
Cortana, or Bixby, it's his list,

1341
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,400
has an exploit seen, quote, in the wild.

1342
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,920
Ooh.

1343
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,600
Define exploit.

1344
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,640
I think something, hmm, yeah, what does that?

1345
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,900
Probably eavesdropping, right?

1346
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,320
That would be the ultimate exploit,

1347
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,200
is to enable third party eavesdropping.

1348
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,240
Isn't that what they're built for?

1349
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,920
Right, because is this like an exploit on the device locally,

1350
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,120
or is it like another exploit in the cloud service?

1351
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,000
Are those the same?

1352
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,960
I think one and the same.

1353
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,880
You could, I think, I read this as if you could enable

1354
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,760
this to do malicious actions, that's an exploit.

1355
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,360
So if you're taking advantage of the cloud service,

1356
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,000
or what would really be awful is if you get on the LAN,

1357
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,160
turn on the microphones, and not turn on the lights.

1358
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,600
Because a lot of these are wired in such

1359
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,360
that when the microphones are active, the lights turn on.

1360
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,000
So you'd have to be able to do it really in a way

1361
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,240
that really fooled the consumer.

1362
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,960
That's a tricky one to pull off, but doable.

1363
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,760
I imagine anything's possible.

1364
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,160
A major hardware vulnerability,

1365
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,840
that was his first one in ARM,

1366
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,640
like that's like Spectre class in ARM.

1367
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,160
That seems possible.

1368
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,040
You gotta imagine people are looking.

1369
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,880
They gotta be looking.

1370
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,320
And then number two, AMD gets a 50% sales in that year,

1371
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,120
in 2020.

1372
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,400
So Brand, out of that batch,

1373
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,400
you got AMD getting great sales for the year,

1374
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,880
you got a major vulnerability in ARM,

1375
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,760
and then you got perhaps an exploit of some type,

1376
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,240
quote unquote, in the wild, he adds,

1377
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,960
for one of the major voice assistants.

1378
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,160
Yeah, it touches on like data breach stuff.

1379
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,360
I kind of like that topic.

1380
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,120
So I think I'm gonna lean there.

1381
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,480
Do you wanna try to sum that up and lock it in?

1382
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,760
I believe in 2020,

1383
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,640
we will see one of the voice assistant platforms,

1384
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,640
one of the Pepsi or Cola,

1385
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,560
get a malicious exploit that is active in the wild.

1386
00:50:59,120 --> 00:50:59,960
Nice.

1387
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,320
I like that we drafted one of Drew's.

1388
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,160
That was perfect.

1389
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,600
That was great.

1390
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,920
Well, there you have it.

1391
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,920
It's pretty much indisputable at this point.

1392
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,760
We've laid it down.

1393
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,840
There's no going back.

1394
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,520
And now all we have to do is wait a year

1395
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,720
to find out how bad we did.

1396
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,560
Wow.

1397
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,400
I hope it's a long year.

1398
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,560
I have a whole batch of audience submissions

1399
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,840
that I think we'll do in the post-show.

1400
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,520
So why don't we just take care of a couple items

1401
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,360
before we get out of here?

1402
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,200
How's that sound to you?

1403
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,040
Yeah, let's do it.

1404
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,000
You know, one thing that I would like to hear

1405
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,760
is if our judge for this glorious episode

1406
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,400
has a prediction for next year.

1407
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,760
That's the whole point of being the judge.

1408
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,280
I don't have to make any predictions.

1409
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,840
Well, well played, sir, well played.

1410
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,120
He's going to do it in land for sure.

1411
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,640
Do you have any that you've saved, Joe?

1412
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,960
Any crazy ones that you don't actually

1413
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,280
care if I write it wrong?

1414
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,240
All right, well, I'll give you an absolutely crazy one.

1415
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,400
Chrome OS will add ZFS support.

1416
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,240
Wow.

1417
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,400
Nice.

1418
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,400
That's exactly the kind I was thinking of.

1419
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,600
Very nice, sir.

1420
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,440
I love it.

1421
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,280
You know what? Go ahead.

1422
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,280
I'm going to lock that in.

1423
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,440
And that kind of brings us to an end.

1424
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,040
We're just about done here.

1425
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,160
No more holiday episodes.

1426
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,840
Go back to our regularly scheduled shenanigans.

1427
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,680
How do you feel about that?

1428
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,120
You ready to be live again, Wes?

1429
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:10,960
Oh, I'm excited.

1430
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,800
Get that virtual love going again.

1431
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,920
It's been a nice little break.

1432
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,760
Yeah, it has been nice.

1433
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,600
By now, we've been off for the longest time

1434
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,160
in the history of the show.

1435
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,200
We'll be coming back fresh or really hungover.

1436
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,040
I'm not sure which.

1437
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:21,960
Probably both.

1438
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,120
So I've got some more predictions

1439
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,480
that we'll get to in the post-show.

1440
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,120
So before we get to that,

1441
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,280
I'll just mention a little bit of business.

1442
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,400
Number one, you can find all of our live times

1443
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,560
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1444
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,560
You can join us live at jblive.tv.

1445
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,520
We do stream it on Twitch,

1446
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,200
which is one of our lower latency streams,

1447
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,440
twitch.tv slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

1448
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,080
And we have the JBLive FM stream up again.

1449
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,920
Audio only.

1450
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,120
Audio only if you're on the go.

1451
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,640
It's a great way to listen.

1452
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,480
But join us live.

1453
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,520
That Mamba Room's open.

1454
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,680
You can be part of the lug.

1455
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,640
You can get in that irc.geekshed.net

1456
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,640
Pound Jupiter Broadcasting chat room.

1457
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,640
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1458
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:06,640
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1459
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,640
Get it out of here.

1460
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,040
Well, I can promise we got a couple of listener predictions

1461
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,320
here for the post-show.

1462
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,200
This one came in from Tin Tin.

1463
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,480
Tin Tin predicts that Canonical will go public

1464
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,680
and Microsoft will buy a big chunk of the shares,

1465
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,640
one of the big initial investors.

1466
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,600
There was also a Hayati.

1467
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,480
I think that's how you say it.

1468
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,320
Probably not.

1469
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,520
Microsoft will buy Canonical.

1470
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,640
How about this one?

1471
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,640
Deep Grewal says Microsoft will put Windows

1472
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,240
as a official Linux distro by swapping out the base

1473
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,440
with Linux and listing on distrowatch.com.

1474
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,440
Wouldn't that be the day?

1475
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,280
Never gonna happen.

1476
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,880
KDE and GNOME will produce

1477
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,200
a unified compatible desktop environment.

1478
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,040
That seems almost less likely than the Windows.

1479
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,760
That's what Nashem says, I know.

1480
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,320
Byte Bitten says that Intel will introduce

1481
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,640
a legitimate ARM competitor.

1482
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,480
Don't know how they're gonna get it,

1483
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,680
but they're gonna get there.

1484
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,440
Also, Byte predicts that Photoshop for Linux

1485
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,200
will ship likely a stripped down version of Photoshop,

1486
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,160
could be an Electron application.

1487
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,880
Hey, the Adobe suite is never coming to Linux,

1488
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,240
I can assure you.

1489
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,640
Well, I mean, I thought that too,

1490
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,000
but then they made it for the iPad.

1491
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,360
I'm thinking to myself, are there more desktop Linux users

1492
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,280
than iPad users?

1493
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,120
Maybe.

1494
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,440
But Apple cut them a fat check for that.

1495
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,040
Wasn't there a survey a while ago

1496
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,600
that went out asking this kind of stuff?

1497
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,680
Was that two years ago?

1498
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,680
It's never gonna happen.

1499
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,720
Hey, but Byte says it's gonna happen.

1500
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,880
We put it on there.

1501
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,680
Nick at the Linux experiment on Twitter says

1502
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,680
that he thinks that Microsoft will bring

1503
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,640
another Office application over to GNU slash Linux.

1504
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,000
And here's one that I put in LAN.

1505
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,160
He says that Nvidia will open source their drivers

1506
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,320
and start contributing to Nuvoo directly.

1507
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,360
Nuvoo.

1508
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:26,360
Never gonna happen, Joe.
