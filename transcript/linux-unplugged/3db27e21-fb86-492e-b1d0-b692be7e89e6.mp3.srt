1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Wes's buddy, Leonard Pottering, the creator of Pulse Audio

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,720
and SystemD, says that we should popularize image-based OSes

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,320
with modern security properties built around immutability,

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,040
secure boot, TPM2, adaptability, auto-updating, factory reset,

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,600
and uniformity deployed via images.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,680
And they've updated SystemD to help start this.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,700
It's kind of like creating a Chrome OS-like update

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,600
or a Silverblue-like update process.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,600
SystemD sysupdate automatically and atomically updates

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,800
the host OS, container images, portable service images,

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,960
or other sources.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,720
And of course, you get a new config file, sysupdate.d.

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,520
I think you might be a fan of this.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,440
You're pro images.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,800
I am pro images.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,280
I know it's funny because I'm going

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,680
to be like the devil's advocate guy, I think,

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,720
this week on the show.

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,320
And so I guess I'm starting early.

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,560
I think this is a great idea.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,960
I know it's probably not going to get adopted

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,640
by maybe anybody but Fedora and a few enterprise distros.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,800
But the idea is you always have a known good OS partition

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
available that you can boot into.

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,440
And you could have a scenario where perhaps SystemD is taking

26
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,440
care of the A-B image stuff and making sure you've always

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,220
got a working base image.

28
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,940
And then your favorite distributions package manager

29
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,700
is taking care of applications and stuff like that.

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,380
You could have a world where these two things coexist.

31
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,840
It does seem especially nice.

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,880
It's probably going to do a better job than the sort

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,640
of sketchy bash script I might write

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,800
if I was trying to do this myself,

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,000
say, with Arch or something.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,160
So in that sense, I'm for it too.

37
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,800
I could see it.

38
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,720
I mean, look it.

39
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,080
Other OSes are getting these features.

40
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,480
It's about time, right?

41
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,560
It's about time, Linux.

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,320
Come on.

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,880
Let's not patch this one out.

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,200
Let's try it.

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,880
Give it a go.

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:02:00,480
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

47
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,120
My name is Chris.

48
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,920
My name is Wes.

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
And my name is Brent.

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,600
Hello, gentlemen.

51
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,320
Hello.

52
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,480
Nice to see you.

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,860
Well, guess what?

54
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,520
Linux just landed support for something

55
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,080
called software-defined silicon, kernel-level support

56
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,800
to enable or disable a built-in CPU feature.

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,320
As in, the CPU ships with all the features,

58
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,440
but only certain ones get turned on,

59
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,080
depending on what the user has or hasn't paid for.

60
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,240
Intel can issue a license.

61
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,680
It's coming in the next generation of systems.

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
And Linux is already getting support for it as of this week.

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,720
And as you can imagine, we've got a whole range of thoughts

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,240
on this.

65
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,360
So we'll dig into that.

66
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,480
And then we'll round out the show with some boosts, some picks,

67
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,360
and more.

68
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,280
So before we get any further, let's

69
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,480
say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,920
Hello, Mumble Room.

71
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,560
Hello, Chris.

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,440
Hello, Wes.

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,080
And hello, Brent.

74
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Hello.

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,520
More and more folks showing up in the quiet listening

76
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,880
and just getting a free software version encoded in Opus

77
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,120
straight from our mixer.

78
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,720
We can't hear you, but we see you.

79
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,320
We see you.

80
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,960
And I'm going to give that another mention this week,

81
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,040
because we have a project that I think we're going

82
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,400
to work on after the show.

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,680
And I think Mumble could be an option that's

84
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,120
more viable for people who like low-latency versions

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
of the stream, because we may be changing things up and going

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,960
to a peer-to-peer system in the future.

87
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,200
More on that.

88
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,320
So our Mumble is the best way to get absolutely low-latency,

89
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,920
high-quality audio, and you can get in that quiet listening.

90
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,160
And if you want to move into the lobby and chat with us,

91
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,580
or the on-air area, I should say, you totally can.

92
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,200
So you can get the details at linuxunplug.com slash Mumble.

93
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,560
And then we do the show live on Sundays at noon Pacific,

94
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,360
3 PM Eastern over at jblive.tv.

95
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,780
And we'll have more details to share on that kind of stuff

96
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,080
coming up in the future.

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,620
This week, though, we wanted to talk

98
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,800
about this software-defined silicon that

99
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,380
is landing the support that's coming in Linux in 5.18

100
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,820
and is probably something that's going

101
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,320
to be a huge topic in tech circles,

102
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,640
I would imagine, within a generation or so of Intel

103
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,160
processors.

104
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,680
We touched on a lot of the details in Linux Action News

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,560
this week.

106
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,080
And we got some feedback in our matrix room

107
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
that it was probably worth bumping this

108
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,260
to a wider discussion because it seemed that people were not

109
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,160
aware that this was a thing that was even coming.

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,760
And we haven't talked a lot about it

111
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,120
because we didn't want to sound like the sky was falling.

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,000
We didn't want to sound to the alarm

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,600
that the next generation of Intel CPUs

114
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,560
are going to have essentially feature DRM,

115
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,040
and Linux is totally supporting it

116
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,520
because it's the capability to do it.

117
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,360
It's all free software.

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,040
It's all GPL.

119
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
That's right.

120
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,480
This is a tricky spot.

121
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
And so we thought, let's talk about what it is so you guys

122
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,760
have the right context.

123
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,240
We're not going to hype it up or anything like that.

124
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,720
We're just going to talk about what software-defined silicon

125
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,480
is.

126
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,080
And LWN has a good write-up, too, that we'll link to.

127
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,320
But can you give us, I don't know,

128
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,520
the highlights that you think we should probably know, Wes?

129
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,760
Yeah, so software-defined silicon, or SDSI,

130
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,440
if you want to be hip and abbreviate it,

131
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,480
is kind of, as you say, it's a quote unquote feature that

132
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,160
lets Intel ship some hardware capabilities that have to then

133
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,200
later be enabled.

134
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,760
A little more technical, it appears

135
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,920
as a device on your system that offers

136
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,920
a couple of new operations.

137
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,480
One is to install an authentication key certificate

138
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,000
or a capability activation payload.

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,540
But basically, you have a certificate

140
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,640
that is then used to verify the requests that

141
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,240
are contained in the payload.

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,440
And the idea being here that you've

143
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,200
bought this chip or some piece of hardware,

144
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
it has a base set of features.

145
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,060
And then if you want to enable those additional features that

146
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,940
are kind of hidden behind this new SDSI capability,

147
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,240
you have to go talk to Intel in some capacity to pay them

148
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,720
a fee.

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,520
Maybe it's a recurring monthly fee.

150
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,280
We don't really have details yet on what exact features this

151
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,200
is going to be used to gate or how you're going to get access

152
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,280
to them process might be.

153
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,760
Yeah, is it going to be like they issue you

154
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,160
a package that writes the files to these places

155
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,960
now that these devices are on your system?

156
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,400
Or is it some service that's calling home

157
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,800
to their cloud service?

158
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,760
I don't know.

159
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,200
The stuff in the kernel is really just the bare bones

160
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,840
stuff so that user space can make it work at all.

161
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,480
That's how the nuts and bolts of it work.

162
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,720
From an implementation standpoint,

163
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,680
it's sort of almost perfectly Linux.

164
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,660
It's you drop a file in a directory

165
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,080
that the file says yes, no, properly licensed,

166
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,120
and then another one that is the actual license.

167
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,160
And then there's code in the CPU that verifies those files,

168
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,380
verifies the functionality request,

169
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,760
and then either turns it on or turns it off.

170
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,880
It's really at this point kind of up in the air

171
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,680
how all of that's going to work.

172
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,440
But of course, the kernel team isn't necessarily

173
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,520
looking to block this kind of stuff.

174
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,120
There's not a whole lot of arguments

175
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,760
that can be made against denying this.

176
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,240
It's GPL software.

177
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
It's just adding a couple of devices.

178
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,600
It simply enables another piece of functionality

179
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,680
in the upcoming CPUs.

180
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,220
And the kernel community hasn't made a practice

181
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,200
of rejecting this kind of stuff for other devices

182
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,360
out there that do this that are maybe not CPUs.

183
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,880
Right.

184
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,280
Yeah, I mean, there's all kinds of weird gadgets

185
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,440
or proprietary things that end up running Linux,

186
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,520
even if it's in a data center that I'm never

187
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,640
going to have access to or hardware I'm never going

188
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,940
to be able to purchase outright.

189
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,200
So this is what's coming.

190
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,640
It landed in 5.18.

191
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,280
It's going to be probably a little while

192
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,160
before you get it trickled down to your distribution

193
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,040
for most of you.

194
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,720
I am using it right now, though.

195
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,960
Actually, let me double check.

196
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,880
But I think, yeah, I have 5.18.0 installed on this machine.

197
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,000
You hipster, you.

198
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,720
I love it.

199
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,840
And this is an Ubuntu box.

200
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,280
I'll tell you how I did that later in the show.

201
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,560
So my system hasn't broken.

202
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,640
In fact, when Linus announced this release,

203
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,080
he was pretty low key about it.

204
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,480
And he's like, yeah, pretty minor update.

205
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,200
Nothing really too big in here.

206
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,000
I think his words were, nothing's too surprising.

207
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,880
Maybe not too surprising for you,

208
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,440
but I don't think most of the community realizes that we're

209
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,560
just kind of laying down and letting this stuff land

210
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,520
in the Linux kernel.

211
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:57,920
Yeah, right.

212
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,760
I suppose his commentary is more on the like,

213
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,260
oh, there's no crazy new subsystem or radical change,

214
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,080
or we didn't suddenly enable Rust everywhere.

215
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,040
Yeah, no wild bug.

216
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Yeah.

217
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,560
Right, yeah.

218
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,800
That kind of stuff.

219
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,920
So it's just sort of unceremoniously went out.

220
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,600
And there was really no red flags,

221
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,080
like because Linus didn't say, hey,

222
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,680
this is the one that includes the Intel.

223
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,880
You may not want to upgrade.

224
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,260
Yeah.

225
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,760
So it was just sort of a low key release.

226
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,520
We'll link to LWN, which has thoughts on this

227
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,760
before it came out.

228
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,800
And we'll also link to the actual original patch

229
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,240
conversation.

230
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,120
I'm also not quite clear on the parties involved here,

231
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,680
because it seems to be that the parties introducing the idea

232
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,320
is a developer from Red Hat working on behalf of Intel,

233
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,400
even though Intel has plenty of kernel engineers on their own.

234
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,960
But so there is some relationship with this

235
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,800
there as well.

236
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,000
Linode.com slash unplugged.

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,600
That's where you go to get $100 in 60-day credit

238
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,520
on a new account, and that's where

239
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,080
you go to support the show.

240
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,940
I love getting to talk about Linode.

241
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,840
This is my moment every single week,

242
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,920
and I really appreciate it, because there's always

243
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,040
something to talk about.

244
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,760
How great is that?

245
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,160
And Linode really has been our secret sauce.

246
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,840
I was just thinking about this morning.

247
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,780
There's a project I'm working on.

248
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,880
Of course, I'm going to Linode to deploy this thing, right?

249
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,720
And I realized sometimes it's like I just pop off a server

250
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
super quick, and I get up and working,

251
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,720
and I probably have the thing done in two minutes.

252
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,280
And then sometimes, sometimes I sit here,

253
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,520
and I really think, how am I going to build this?

254
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,880
What do I want to do?

255
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,800
What should we use on the back end to deploy it?

256
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,760
Because Linode works with all of that stuff too.

257
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
So if you like to just do a one-click deploying, get up,

258
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,580
and running really easy, you can.

259
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,400
But if you want to tie it in with some infrastructure

260
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,560
management, maybe do a little Terraform and some bulk,

261
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,220
yeah, Linode supports all of that.

262
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,160
You see, they've been around for nearly 19 years,

263
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,360
and in that time, they figured out

264
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,280
what features are worth spending energy and effort on,

265
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,240
and which features are just silly platform features

266
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
that are checking a box.

267
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,400
And their mission has remained unchanged in that 19 years.

268
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,280
Make cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible

269
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,340
to all.

270
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,400
And that really has led to the best-in-class experience.

271
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,280
Support, performance, flexibility, 11 data centers

272
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,240
around the world.

273
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,280
In that time, they became their own ISP.

274
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,400
You know what I'm saying?

275
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,680
It really pays off over time.

276
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,160
And now, we just get a great experience

277
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,880
as customers with the best support in the business

278
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,140
backing it all up.

279
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,400
And of course, I'm taking advantage of their object

280
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,720
like a maniac these days, powerful DNS manager.

281
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,320
And the bottom line matters, right?

282
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,200
Pricing 30% to 50% cheaper than all the major cloud providers

283
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,600
out there.

284
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,720
And you get Linode's great support, great performance,

285
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,080
and you get a member that's friendly to our community.

286
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,440
Somebody who plays nice, who buys local.

287
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,680
So go try them out, support this show,

288
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,200
and get $100 to really kick the tires.

289
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,480
Go to linode.com slash unplugged.

290
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,640
So let's talk about the moralities of this software

291
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,920
defined silicon.

292
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,200
And really, if the free software community

293
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,520
should be taking a stand here.

294
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,560
Because you could make the argument, perhaps,

295
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,760
that Linux is big enough and relevant enough

296
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,200
for enough market segments, not just the server,

297
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,520
that if we put up a hard stand and said,

298
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,940
no, this is a free software platform.

299
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,600
It's not just the license that's free.

300
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,480
It's about making something for people that is forever, right?

301
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,640
It's about creating something that's

302
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,580
for the general good, for humanity.

303
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,040
It's not a tool for corporations to have successful platforms,

304
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,200
although it can be.

305
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,280
It's free software.

306
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,640
It's GPL software.

307
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,760
It's code for the people.

308
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,080
And it should be commons.

309
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,920
And so when we add things that restrict functionality,

310
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,960
it's sort of inherent to the spirit of what

311
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,200
we're trying to do here.

312
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,160
Maybe it's not against the law of the GPL.

313
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
It's definitely against the spirit of the GPL.

314
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,920
That's, I think, the big argument being made.

315
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,000
I think I'll play devil's advocate on this one.

316
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,640
And I'm going to take Intel's side.

317
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,960
Because I think I actually could make an argument for why

318
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,440
it could be a good thing, too.

319
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,360
But I'm curious, Brent, because Wes and I

320
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,760
have dug into this a lot for Linux Action News.

321
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,080
I know you caught that coverage.

322
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,120
And you're coming at this with some information.

323
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
But it's newest to you right now.

324
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,240
So I'm curious what your impressions are

325
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,760
on just the moralities around software-defined silicon

326
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,560
being able to turn CPU features on and off through Linux.

327
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,520
I'm looking forward to hearing your perspective

328
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,880
as the Intel spokesperson in this hour.

329
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,200
My initial sort of internal gut reaction

330
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,960
is that it feels like a really slippery slope, or it could be.

331
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,600
Is it going to lead to subscriptions

332
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,240
for all your hardware, you know, like five years down the road

333
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,120
where you're very, very hampered with what

334
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,760
you can do with the stuff you, quote unquote, own?

335
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,000
And thus, you are limited because you're not paying them

336
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
on a monthly basis or whatnot.

337
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
That is the first thing that comes to mind for me

338
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,960
and is a bit of a scary perspective.

339
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,240
Locking features up behind a monthly subscription.

340
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,840
Well, that's it.

341
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,000
I mean, we're subscriptionifying everything these days, it seems.

342
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,120
And the last sort of thing that we have that's our own

343
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,600
is the hardware that we've purchased or come by.

344
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,160
And it seems to me like it would be a darn shame

345
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,120
to see that go away and to have it

346
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,560
be sort of like the Peloton model,

347
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,520
and they can take it away from you anytime.

348
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,280
That's my initial sort of reaction when I hear this.

349
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,600
I could definitely accept that from a business point of view,

350
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,240
it probably makes a lot of sense.

351
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,840
They're creating the same chips for a whole bunch

352
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,600
of different sort of, as you might say, models of their CPU.

353
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,060
But for them, it's much, much easier

354
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,520
to do the manufacturing and stuff.

355
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,360
So I could see that point of view.

356
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,000
I love that we're talking about this

357
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,560
because it's not an easy answer, is it?

358
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,760
Not as black and white as it might be on Windows

359
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,280
or on the Mac platform.

360
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,940
This might just be par for the course.

361
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,680
But here, we kind of are the beacon of freedom

362
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,880
in the software world, Linux is.

363
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,120
And where does that freedom, where

364
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,620
do we draw the line on that freedom?

365
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,120
And what role does Linux have on protecting that freedom?

366
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,680
Because we've pushed this until the breaking point with Nvidia.

367
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,640
We just kept dogmatic at the issue.

368
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,280
The kernel team is currently pushing this

369
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,080
to the breaking point with ZFS.

370
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,520
They will just not relent on that.

371
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,080
There are some hills they are just willing to die on.

372
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,160
Why not this hill, Wes?

373
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
And should they be dying on this hill?

374
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,440
Well, you're the devil's advocate, huh?

375
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,240
I don't think we've heard your position yet.

376
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,360
You've got me to do your work for you over there.

377
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,080
No, my take on why is a little more cynical.

378
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,200
I think it's because Intel is an influential partner,

379
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,560
a major code contributor, and because the code they

380
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,760
are contributing is GPL.

381
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,000
But I'm curious if there's a moral obligation there.

382
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,080
Yeah, I mean, it does make us ask some questions

383
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,760
around the relationship with Intel.

384
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
It's not even just some random provider.

385
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,360
This is a company we like to laud

386
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,160
as sort of doing open source and working

387
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,520
with the kernel the right way.

388
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,240
So you can see if the kernel were to take a stand here,

389
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,800
I mean, that could really affect the way Intel

390
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,960
is used to doing business.

391
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,160
It seems like they are willing to do that model.

392
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,520
They've adopted to that model.

393
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,280
So then having to sort of, would they start shipping their own?

394
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,240
Or would we be booting into FreeDOS

395
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,760
to sort of load these certificates

396
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,080
or doing some other, you know?

397
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Would the alternative be that this would still

398
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,280
have to happen until it would keep moving forward?

399
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,840
It would just be a worse interface

400
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,000
to do so because you couldn't do it as easily directly

401
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,760
with the kernel.

402
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,160
Yeah, I guess we don't know.

403
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,160
It seems like with the dominance of the x86 world

404
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,720
and the popularity we see amongst developers

405
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,200
and Hollywood production shops, Intel

406
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,520
would have to be pressured into at least a few workstation

407
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,160
and consumer line Intel chips, too,

408
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,760
that were functional enough.

409
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,440
But here's the devil's advocate's position,

410
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,760
I think, for doing this.

411
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,480
And I don't know if I fully buy it,

412
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,960
but this is where I think Intel's coming from.

413
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,160
And because, Brent, you touched on it,

414
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,640
there are real genuine economies of scale when it comes here.

415
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,720
And we've seen how screwed up chip manufacturing has gotten

416
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,080
in the last couple of years.

417
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,120
And so if there is a way for Intel

418
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,840
to create a chip at one price point

419
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,080
that they can then make millions of,

420
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,000
and that makes it possible to actually meet demand, supply

421
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,760
demand, and that makes it possible to sell at price

422
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,960
points that give us devices that are like Chromebooks in cost

423
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,440
or give us high-end workstation devices,

424
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,040
depending on what people are willing to spend, I get it.

425
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,240
I mean, it also helps Intel maximize revenue.

426
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,800
But having a company that's making good revenue,

427
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,080
there's one of the few American-owned companies.

428
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm just going to throw that in, too.

429
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,040
Maybe that's a good thing.

430
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,920
While also, they reduce the amount

431
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,320
of different testing surfaces they have,

432
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,880
so perhaps the products become more reliable.

433
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,140
And it also means that you could buy something today

434
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,800
for a cheaper price, like a $300 laptop or something

435
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,680
like that.

436
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,260
And then later on, you could add another feature,

437
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,880
like maybe you could turn on virtualization for $80

438
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,000
or something like that.

439
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,680
And it means customers who have minimal needs

440
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,160
but are very price-sensitive could technically

441
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,480
get access to something that later on could

442
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
become more advanced as their skill set becomes more

443
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,760
advanced.

444
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,960
So it really opens up the world to a whole new price point,

445
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,520
and it gives a whole new stability and production

446
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,900
pipeline for Intel.

447
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,080
And we've seen in the last few years how important that is.

448
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,840
It is just a shame.

449
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,240
It feels like we're going backwards in some ways.

450
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,760
It makes me think of the whole stuff

451
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,780
with getting your Pi codecs in place

452
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,040
and just what a pain.

453
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,000
It's all fine, right?

454
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,640
You can do it.

455
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,320
You can run the right scripts or figure it out.

456
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,800
But just practically, it sucks.

457
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,760
There have been some interesting questions,

458
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,920
like Kenji in our IRC room wondering,

459
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,600
how's this going to work around?

460
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,500
Is it per machine or CPU or person?

461
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,960
So I buy it, and then I give my computer to Brent.

462
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,040
Is that a separate thing?

463
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,440
Does he need to buy a new copy of that from Intel himself?

464
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,920
Or can you transfer it from one machine to the next,

465
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,060
for instance, if you have a personal license

466
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,880
and you have two computers and you change the workload on one

467
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,440
and you decide it's more suited to the other,

468
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,920
can you just move that over?

469
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,280
Yeah, or what happens when you reload your box?

470
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,160
Because these are getting written to this virtual device.

471
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,560
That has to happen somehow.

472
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,720
And if you nuke and pave your system,

473
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,040
what makes that stick around?

474
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,160
Yeah, the administration side will be interesting, too.

475
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
What's persisting this, and is it, yeah?

476
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,360
Devil's advocate aside now, this is clearly a step back.

477
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,600
This is absolutely something that I will

478
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,800
be voting with my wallet on.

479
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,680
I made that comment quickly in land,

480
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,880
but just to expand on that, the Ryzen systems

481
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,960
have never looked any better as far as I'm concerned.

482
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,160
And I could live a long, happy life with Ryzen systems

483
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,000
and Apple M-based systems.

484
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,960
And as long as I can run Linux on both,

485
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,880
I may never need Intel again.

486
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,560
You combine that with Raspberry Pi's,

487
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,920
Intel's been less relevant than ever for me.

488
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,160
And I see this kind of stuff, and I

489
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,360
understand that because it's GPL software

490
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,640
and they're just creating a device that you write files to,

491
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,120
it's going to land in the kernel.

492
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,000
Because it's Intel, there's not going to be a lot of pushback.

493
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,520
I wish this stuff got more scrutiny.

494
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,680
I have a ton of love and respect for the kernel team.

495
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,960
I think they get away with this kind of stuff all the time.

496
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,120
The University of Minnesota stuff

497
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,580
should have gotten more scrutiny.

498
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,080
This should be getting more scrutiny.

499
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,440
But because we love these people,

500
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,320
and because they work so hard, I think

501
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,240
we are hesitant to criticize.

502
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,520
I don't know if criticism is the right place, though.

503
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,960
Like, I don't know that insisting

504
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,440
that they take this moral judgment is.

505
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,280
I think I could see you making the opposite argument of wanting

506
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,960
them to remain a useful, neutral tool to be used for whatever

507
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,760
purpose, especially considering that that's so much of what

508
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,080
makes it successful.

509
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,160
We often, on the show, talk about,

510
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,080
yeah, there's the philosophy part, which I think

511
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,360
matters to us, at least the hosts of the show,

512
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,480
a fair amount, but matters seemingly less and less

513
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,040
to the general cloud public who just use it as a tool.

514
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah, I think where I really get concerned

515
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,600
and I feel like where I've kind of landed on this one is,

516
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
you're right, it's not their role,

517
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,280
but it's sort of like our last line of defense.

518
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,240
That's where I just go, if anybody was going to stop this,

519
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,560
or if anybody was just going to embarrass Intel for doing this,

520
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,460
it would be these developers with this platform,

521
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,480
even if it just kind of raised awareness in the consumer

522
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,760
population so they could start voting with their wallets.

523
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,480
But instead, it's just been totally quiet.

524
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,600
Yeah, it has been very quiet.

525
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,240
It does make me think it's one of those areas that

526
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,880
seems to come up a lot these days of sort of not

527
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,480
necessarily the letter of the law, but the spirit

528
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,520
and what their behavior will be.

529
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,740
If this is really a thing that's limited to, say,

530
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,000
a feature that's only used by giant data centers

531
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
when they're training models or doing some specific task that

532
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,880
really is not applicable to my sort of use case,

533
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,880
even as a somewhat odd user of software,

534
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,120
a technological enthusiast, then maybe it's

535
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,080
not that big of a deal.

536
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,960
But if it's something that most Intel buyers start running

537
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,600
into, that'll sour things pretty quick.

538
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,000
I imagine not, right?

539
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,240
I imagine it's the enterprise that's really going to get it.

540
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,880
Well, I mean, they're the ones who are going to shell out

541
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,000
the money anyway, right?

542
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,500
Right.

543
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,240
And there's so many nickel and dimey ways you can do this.

544
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,680
And you could see a CPU that maybe has more cores you

545
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,800
can turn on.

546
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,280
And you've got to license it for that.

547
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,840
And then it's a lot more manageable problem, too,

548
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,040
because then you're making Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian packages.

549
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,640
And you've pretty much covered all of the enterprise

550
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,920
deployments that are going to be using this thing.

551
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
I suppose so, right?

552
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,560
You know, but again, I want to just mention LW one more time.

553
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,080
Because there was a bit in here that I think resonated with me.

554
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,440
They're talking about business models in here

555
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,520
and talking about how car manufacturers like Tesla

556
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,960
want to include features that you pay for to turn them on.

557
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,920
And we've kind of just accepted this.

558
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,200
They're calling these rent-based business models.

559
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,400
And they say it's been spreading through the technology

560
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,960
industry for some time.

561
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,480
Many of us have no longer purchased and even run

562
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,120
our own servers.

563
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,920
We run them from a cloud provider.

564
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,320
Companies are still in the proprietary software business.

565
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,480
But they're finding that monthly subscription models are appealing.

566
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,720
Simply, it just works better than regular software licensing.

567
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,360
And of course, there's dodgy websites

568
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,160
out there that handle payments for all kinds

569
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
of different content.

570
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,600
He's making a joke about LWN, which is a paid-for content

571
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,760
website there.

572
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,560
But the issue really comes down to free software

573
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,640
is supposed to enable freedom and access to these machines.

574
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,760
But now we're going to find ourselves using it to our free

575
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,880
software is going to ask the hardware for permission

576
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,640
to be available to do things.

577
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,400
Essentially, we're going to a model where free software

578
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,480
enabled us to explore and use these computers, perhaps

579
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,240
in ways that were never intended.

580
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,280
And now we're going to a model where free software is relegated

581
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,240
to the rest of the world asking for permission

582
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,720
to get these features.

583
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,360
If this approach is commercially successful,

584
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,240
we're likely going to see more of it.

585
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,240
And you combine that with kind of like the monthly subscription

586
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,680
thing or something like that that Brent was saying.

587
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,600
And then I think we kind of have a dystopia scenario.

588
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,040
Oh, you can see like a weird, it's

589
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,480
a range of CPUs that are targeting the netbook thing

590
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,240
comes back or whatever right there.

591
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,640
And you can't enroll your own TPM keys or something like that

592
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,200
or the trust secure boot keys anymore

593
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,920
unless you subscribe to the enterprise model.

594
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,000
Is there an opportunity here for some of the reverse engineering

595
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,320
that we're seeing in like the M1, for instance?

596
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,720
Is any of that even possible in this case?

597
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,160
That's a good question, Brent, because some

598
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,080
of what's made the M1 Linux port possible

599
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,800
is a lot of the functionalities at the firmware level.

600
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,280
So the drivers just hand it off and the firmware does it.

601
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,820
We see this with the Nvidia card.

602
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,040
Like this new open source driver is really

603
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
being made possible because the firmware is

604
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,200
going to handle a lot of the stuff that Nvidia wanted

605
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,880
the driver to handle in the past, for better or for worse.

606
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,760
But we're definitely seeing this transition

607
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,880
to the software side is a lot simpler

608
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,600
and the complexity is being offloaded

609
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,620
to the individual hardware components.

610
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,240
And these are like little micro operating systems

611
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,160
and microcomputers all in their own.

612
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,640
And it's just becoming more and more common.

613
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,840
Well, just at the same time as we see, yeah, and way

614
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,020
more specialized chips for various roles

615
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,360
instead of just one big old generalized CPU.

616
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,820
Yeah, I think it's a good and bad thing.

617
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,520
I think we're seeing the pros and cons of it.

618
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,200
I think in the example of the M1 stuff,

619
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,360
it's meant the Linux port has gone very, very rapidly

620
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,540
from what I thought it would.

621
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,880
And it seems like there's a nice little halves and gets

622
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,720
that the developers are getting because of the functionality

623
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,600
that the firmware handles.

624
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,000
Same thing with Nvidia.

625
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,960
If you want the functionality of an Nvidia card,

626
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,200
or you want access to CUDA and Nvidia Compute,

627
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,700
but you didn't want to have to hassle

628
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,200
with the proprietary driver, well, they

629
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,440
found a solution around that.

630
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,840
And this is the future we're going into.

631
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,400
And it's built in at the hardware level.

632
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,760
And it's going to be trickier to navigate.

633
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,800
There's going to be different things

634
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,280
to consider for consumers now when we're buying hardware.

635
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,920
It's not just going to be speed and specs.

636
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,320
Yeah, there's more in there because it's

637
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,360
running its own, basically, software as well.

638
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,880
And you're going to have to care about how well that's

639
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,440
implemented.

640
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,520
Yeah, you're going to have to care about,

641
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,940
how does that firmware work?

642
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,440
What kind of driver does it have now?

643
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,760
It's a whole new kind of nuance that we're going

644
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,000
to have to help people navigate.

645
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,400
And a reminder that as far as we've

646
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,240
gotten in some areas with free and open source software,

647
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,760
there's a whole other layer down there.

648
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,920
So Jonathan has a great post at LWN.

649
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,040
Again, I've mentioned that.

650
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,620
We'll link it.

651
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,440
I'd love to hear the audience's reaction to this

652
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,040
because my question to you out there,

653
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,520
where do you personally draw the line?

654
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,360
Is your Android device fine because that

655
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
requires a bunch of firmware?

656
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,520
What about a Nintendo Switch?

657
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,880
What about electric cars like the Tesla

658
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,120
that you can buy self-driving or whatever for $10,000

659
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,800
or whatever it is after the fact?

660
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,960
Where do we draw that line?

661
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,020
And are you concerned about the slide

662
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,880
into subscriptions for every little component there?

663
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,040
So send us a boost in with a new podcast app

664
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,680
or use the Breeze app if you don't switch podcast apps.

665
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,000
Or send us an email at linuxunplugged.com

666
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,040
slash contact and let us know what you think.

667
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,860
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

668
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,160
Go get started with a free trial for Teams, Enterprise,

669
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,520
or a personal account at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

670
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,400
As an individual user, I love it.

671
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,920
But of course, as a business owner,

672
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,400
it's been, I think, a big part to what keeps our information

673
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,720
secure and protected.

674
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,200
Bitwarden is the easiest way for an individual or a business

675
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,240
to store, share, and sync sensitive information.

676
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,600
And Bitwarden is open source.

677
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,160
It's trusted by millions of users in their community.

678
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,960
It has a self-hosted component as well.

679
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,520
And it's what Wes and I use to store all of our passwords,

680
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,720
manage our two-factor codes.

681
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,960
We're both customers of Bitwarden Cloud, which is just

682
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,680
an unbelievable great deal.

683
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,280
Man, and you know they keep adding new features too.

684
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,560
Bitwarden has rolled out account switching.

685
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,640
That's great.

686
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,640
But now they've just recently added the ability on Android

687
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,360
to switch accounts while you're at the password fill out.

688
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,840
You know, this is so nice because I

689
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,440
have a business account and a personal account.

690
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,400
And now, right there, when you're at the prompt,

691
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,000
you can tap the avatar bubble and switch

692
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,680
to another account quickly, get the password access,

693
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,740
authenticate, and deploy that one password.

694
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,600
How nice is that?

695
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,160
Account switching has been great.

696
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,080
And one of the features I'm just getting into,

697
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,280
and it just got better, is their username generator.

698
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,760
Now, this makes it easy to create a random username

699
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,300
for a website you're signing up for or a service

700
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,720
and add an extra level of security.

701
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,640
That's just genius.

702
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,120
But now, they're making it even easier to use.

703
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,560
When you generate a new username,

704
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,060
there will now be an option to create an email address

705
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,960
with a subselection for choosing something

706
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,480
like simple login, a non-addy, or my favorite, Firefox Relay.

707
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,040
Yeah.

708
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,440
So you just enter the API key for your individual account

709
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,760
for that service, like Firefox Relay.

710
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,080
And then, upon generation of the username and the password,

711
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,240
it'll also generate that email address that's

712
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,560
just for them and unique.

713
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,760
A new alias is instantly registered to your account.

714
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,300
And it's all saved in Bitwarden and then synced across

715
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,320
your devices automatically.

716
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,920
Using a good password manager is probably

717
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,640
one of the number one things you can do for your security.

718
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,540
You probably already know that.

719
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,040
But if a friend or a family or a colleague or your workplace

720
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,600
hasn't really wrapped their noodle around that,

721
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,760
have them try out Bitwarden.

722
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,960
It's the best way to do this.

723
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,240
And you can support the show and get a free trial

724
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,520
for Teams, Enterprise, or an individual plan

725
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,800
by going to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

726
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,600
That's where you go.

727
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,200
Go right now.

728
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,760
Support the show and try it out.

729
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,240
It's like a low-hanging fruit to protect yourself.

730
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,920
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

731
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,000
As always, we got some great feedback this week.

732
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,320
Chris wrote in.

733
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,000
Last week, you mentioned the new HP laptop running Pop!

734
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,560
OS.

735
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,360
And it did get me wondering about whether devs really

736
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,520
use laptops all that much.

737
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,400
I'm not a dev.

738
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,040
And it would drive me nuts to sit in front of the laptop

739
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,360
all day trying to get anything serious done.

740
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,580
Wouldn't the standard pony for a dev or any other heavy PC user

741
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,080
be the most powerful desktop with the biggest

742
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,760
monitor you could afford?

743
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,280
I seem to only use my laptop when I'm on the road.

744
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,600
Well, Wes, you're a developer by day.

745
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,720
Do you use a laptop?

746
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes, I do.

747
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,480
Yeah, you know, I think you probably

748
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,720
would assume it would be a nice big workstation.

749
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,860
I think for folks open source work or at homework,

750
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,440
that probably is often the case.

751
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,680
Maybe this is one of those things

752
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,080
that needs to get caught up for our post-pandemic working

753
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,160
remotely life.

754
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,920
But I think a lot of it comes down

755
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,000
to just sort of the lowest common denominator, right?

756
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,280
Like, your folks need to sometimes go to meetings.

757
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,560
They sometimes travel for work.

758
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,000
They sometimes go to conferences.

759
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,480
And therefore, you're either going to get them two machines

760
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,000
or you just get them one.

761
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,600
And to be clear, no one's really sitting there just

762
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,800
typing on a single laptop unless they have to, right?

763
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,160
Like, these days, you've got sort of hotel stations

764
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,880
where you just plug into a dock at a little

765
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,160
wherever you're sitting down and you've got all the monitors

766
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,640
you need.

767
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,520
I wonder, too, if the work from home trends

768
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,480
have maybe accelerated this a bit so that way you can take

769
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,720
your machine back and forth.

770
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,040
But if you look at the sales numbers,

771
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,720
laptops are selling like gangbusters over desktops.

772
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,400
And if you look specifically at Apple,

773
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,800
they sell way more MacBook Pros than they

774
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,840
do regular desktop machines.

775
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,920
And they target those things hard at developers.

776
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,720
And I think they've done a pretty good job

777
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,760
of balancing dedicated CPU versus integrated CPU or disk

778
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,000
and except for when they didn't with the bad keyboards

779
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,600
and stuff.

780
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,160
And you see Dell adopt the Sputnik model.

781
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,800
You see HP with the Dev1.

782
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,880
And of course, System76 is catering to that audience.

783
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,400
I think there's something nice about having everything in one.

784
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,960
That's why the iMac's popular, too.

785
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,000
I think there's people that like the all-in-one.

786
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,520
But I get where you're coming from,

787
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,260
other Chris, because it's like for me,

788
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,680
I can tell the difference when I'm

789
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,800
using a workstation still versus a laptop.

790
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,480
It's beginning to change, but I still

791
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,240
feel like there's a performance delta

792
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,760
between a laptop and a desktop.

793
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,000
Right, so you'd be the one sort of complaining to IT,

794
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,200
I really need a desktop.

795
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,240
I need one, and a laptop, and a tablet, and a phone,

796
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,800
obviously.

797
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,760
Oh, and a projector, too.

798
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,760
Now, we did get a lot of questions around the Pop OS

799
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,360
and HP sort of project that we touched on last week.

800
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,160
And we got some boosts about that, too.

801
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,240
And now, it is time for Le Boost.

802
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,760
Nick wrote in with some feedback,

803
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,920
and the golden dragon wrote in with a boost six days ago

804
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,280
with two, two, two, two sats, which

805
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,000
apparently is a row of ducks.

806
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,840
I'm a duck, D-U-K, duck, loaded with talent.

807
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,360
It is.

808
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,160
If you type in two, two, two, two into a calculator,

809
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,520
it looks like a row of those yellow duckies.

810
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,840
I think we got a sat amount last week as well.

811
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,640
That was one of those old calculator secrets, which

812
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,560
maybe we'll have to look back on that.

813
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,400
So the golden dragon wrote in.

814
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,680
Now, this sounds promising.

815
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,400
HP plus Pop with AMD seems like a stellar dev system.

816
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,000
The one question I would have is,

817
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,920
what is a killer system like this going to cost?

818
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,320
Well, I think we'd know it's going to start around $1,000.

819
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,400
I thought it was like $1099, something like that, right?

820
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,800
Yeah, something like that.

821
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,000
What we don't know is what the price goes up

822
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,480
to when you tweak the specs.

823
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,160
Because that came with 16 gigs of RAM

824
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,240
and one terabyte of disk space, which is really

825
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,440
not too bad for that price.

826
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,520
And 16 gigs of RAM might be the max,

827
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,760
but you might be able to tweak storage and processor.

828
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,360
We are collecting these questions,

829
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,720
so keep sending them in.

830
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,680
Boost.

831
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,800
Yeah, Nick wrote in about the same lines

832
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,000
with some great questions I think are worth exploring

833
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,640
in the future as well, one of them

834
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,840
being, how long is the laptop going to be supported?

835
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,680
Firmware updates, how are those going to work?

836
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,000
Will it use the existing Pop OS firmware delivery method?

837
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,880
I thought those were all really good questions.

838
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,920
Yeah, you know, I haven't really used an HP machine for a while.

839
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,320
Are they playing nice with some of our fancy new Linux

840
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,920
firmware stuff?

841
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,240
Yeah, I hope it has LVFS support, right?

842
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,720
It needs that LVFS.

843
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,200
Come on.

844
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,800
It needs that.

845
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,040
Yeah, that's a good question.

846
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Magenta Sheep boosts in using Buries no less,

847
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,920
six days ago, with 3,142 SATs.

848
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,720
Is that Pop OS HP system running Core Boot?

849
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,680
That is probably the number one question we got.

850
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,480
Yeah, right there.

851
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,440
Oh, I've written that one down.

852
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,360
I don't know how much can be shared yet or not too,

853
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,000
so I got to get information on the NDAs around this thing.

854
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,160
Keeping secrets from us.

855
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,520
I don't have the info, but I just

856
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,640
know that once I get it, there's going

857
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,400
to be that kind of thing, so.

858
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,680
Core Boot's definitely the number one question though.

859
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,520
We got a double boost from Magenta Sheep

860
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,240
six days ago, 3,142 SATs again.

861
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:26,600
They write, ZFS's killer feature for me is sending

862
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,360
encrypted raw snapshots.

863
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,360
Nothing else I know of lets me have

864
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,680
better security and integrity.

865
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:38,080
Not just an encrypted snapshot, but an encrypted raw snapshot.

866
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,720
I hear from the audience all kinds of clever ways

867
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,360
they're using ZFS send and receive.

868
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,920
Totally.

869
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,920
To move things around between data centers and servers.

870
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,280
And that's an awesome feature.

871
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,400
When we get to poking at BcashFS in a real way,

872
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,800
I think we've got to play around with some of these features

873
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,400
that people love about ZFS and ButterFS.

874
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,480
Speaking of BcashFS.

875
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,880
Oh yes, user 7620 boosted in five days ago with 10,000 SATs.

876
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,760
B-O-O-S-T.

877
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,640
Hooray for BcashFS.

878
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,800
I can't wait.

879
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,280
Hey, well, user 6720.

880
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,960
We agree.

881
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,520
We agree.

882
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,040
I still have it on that laptop.

883
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,600
I'll run it for a little bit.

884
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,240
I got to also figure out a good set of benchmarks.

885
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,680
So we'll be chatting about that in the future.

886
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,760
I agree, though.

887
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,440
Very exciting.

888
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,480
You know, I'm curious about those two touch on kind

889
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,960
of the same topic we explored last week.

890
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,440
And I wondered how ButterFS dealt with,

891
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,400
I've been reading tons about it this week,

892
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,520
but I wondered how you mentioned ZFS's encrypted raw snapshots.

893
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,920
Well, how does ButterFS compare in there?

894
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,480
I want to know for my own purposes here.

895
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,120
Sounds like you have some experimenting to do.

896
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,840
I do.

897
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,800
Young master brand.

898
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:57,960
Michael wrote in with a boost as well one day ago, 30,000 SATs.

899
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,920
He writes, helping you helping others, smiley face.

900
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,280
Supporting open source projects is a great idea.

901
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Ah, this is in reference to sending a 15% split

902
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,280
to OpenSATs, which we're doing this episode as well,

903
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,040
which is a nonprofit charity that

904
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,240
gives 100% of the revenue sent to their general funds

905
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,080
to free software projects.

906
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,560
And so when you boost this here podcast and office hours,

907
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,120
we're doing a little experiment.

908
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,760
15% goes to OpenSATs.

909
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,000
So for this episode, if my rough quick math as we're doing this

910
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,840
is right, we've sent about 3,200 and change to OpenSATs.

911
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,480
Nice.

912
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,200
Yeah, that's pretty great.

913
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
So thank you, everybody, for helping us experiment

914
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,120
with that.

915
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,840
You did note in there, we have a couple of folks

916
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,320
that are now boosting in with Breeze.

917
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,920
That's B-R-E-E-Z. I think it's breeze.technology

918
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,160
for the website.

919
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,920
This works on Android or iOS.

920
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,360
And what it essentially does is it gives you a lightning node

921
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,400
in your pocket.

922
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,120
I thought you were just happy to see me.

923
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,040
Well done, sir.

924
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,520
Well done.

925
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,880
Breeze is sort of a front end to different services

926
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,080
on the Lightning Network, including

927
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,800
value for value podcasts.

928
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,200
And so it's a way to send in a boost

929
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,440
without having to switch from your favorite podcast app.

930
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,720
Eventually, there is discussion for folks

931
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,400
like AntennaPod, which AntennaPod supports

932
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,080
a lot of podcasting 2.0 features,

933
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,040
but not value and boost yet, although they

934
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,440
are looking at integrating Breeze to accomplish that.

935
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:26,960
Oh.

936
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,640
Yeah.

937
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,340
So you get a little head start right now.

938
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,720
It is pretty cool, for better or for worse,

939
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,520
to run a lightning node in your pocket.

940
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,680
You can also grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

941
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,080
I'm using Fountain FM these days.

942
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,240
You can follow me on Fountain.

943
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,680
I'm at chrislas.

944
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,840
And I'm clipping the podcasts that I listen to,

945
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,880
including JB shows and others.

946
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,120
So if you're interested in the podcasts I listen to,

947
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,380
you can follow me on Fountain.

948
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,880
I'm just at chrislas.

949
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,480
And it's fountain.fm, I think, for that.

950
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,680
newpodcastapps.com has them all.

951
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,360
And with that, gentlemen, you know what it's time for?

952
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,280
The picks.

953
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,080
It is time for the picks.

954
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,600
And I had a hard time picking one

955
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,400
that I felt was on theme for this week.

956
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,560
So that's the thing I've been trying to do.

957
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,680
Yes, you have.

958
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,240
Not just some random dirty pick, but one that's on theme.

959
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,080
And I think I found it.

960
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,360
I mentioned earlier in the show

961
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,420
that my Ubuntu system was using Linux 5.18 already.

962
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,320
And it's this tool I'm using to do it.

963
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,160
I was suspicious you were compiling these things by hand.

964
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,440
Actually, if you recall, what were we doing, Wes?

965
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,960
You and I were in here recently recording,

966
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,680
and a pop-up as we finished came up and said,

967
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,720
5.18's ready.

968
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,600
It must have been last week's.

969
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,960
It must have been last week's, yeah.

970
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,760
It's really just that.

971
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,960
It's not an app you should use.

972
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,080
Don't do what Chris does.

973
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,040
Don't do this.

974
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,880
To tell you what kind of a lunatic I am

975
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,120
and why you should never do this,

976
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,440
I'm actually doing this on KDE Neon, too.

977
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,280
So it's not even like,

978
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,600
it's already kind of a Frank and Ubuntu setup.

979
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,320
So I got Neon on top of Ubuntu,

980
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,320
and then I'm also on top of that role on my own kernel.

981
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
Don't do this.

982
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,880
But if you want to, it's called Ubuntu Mainline,

983
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,480
and it lets you pick your version.

984
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,280
And you can have multiple versions.

985
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,480
You can go way back.

986
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,720
You can do all kinds of stuff.

987
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,440
Or you can be a madman

988
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,040
and literally get a new kernel the day it's posted,

989
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,600
and a little pop-up will come up

990
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,480
if you leave the notifications on,

991
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,600
and it downloads and installs.

992
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,440
It's just a PPA away.

993
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,160
Does the thing have like RC releases, too,

994
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,000
if you wanted to help test out?

995
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,080
I think it does, Wes.

996
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,920
Yes, it does.

997
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,760
In fact, it does.

998
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,720
I just skip them.

999
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,680
Yeah, sure, sure.

1000
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,680
Yeah, and you can purge older kernels,

1001
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,120
and you can choose some of this stuff.

1002
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,840
I should mention, it gives you a GUI to manage all this,

1003
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,560
which is handy.

1004
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,440
You can also get the header packages

1005
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,400
if you need to build stuff and whatnot

1006
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,320
for your other modules and stuff.

1007
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,800
And honestly, as much as I say don't use this,

1008
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,640
Maybe use it.

1009
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,480
I've been using it for 10 months on this machine.

1010
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,960
You're just telling us about this now?

1011
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,800
Yeah.

1012
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,040
That's what's been putting that skip in your step.

1013
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,400
You know why I did it?

1014
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,560
Is initially, I was just a little disappointed

1015
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,400
in the performance.

1016
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,800
It felt like the machine was getting slow,

1017
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,120
and I'm like, I need a little more pep in my step.

1018
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,400
Maybe a newer kernel will do it.

1019
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,920
And you know what?

1020
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,600
It did break my NVIDIA driver, however.

1021
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,400
So I'm using the free NVIDIA driver again.

1022
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,040
This is why we can't have nice things.

1023
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,920
I probably could fix that,

1024
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,920
but I just give no crap at all.

1025
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,120
You know what I mean?

1026
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,360
It's an old NVIDIA card,

1027
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,840
and I've spent so many years fighting the NVIDIA driver

1028
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,040
on laptops and stuff,

1029
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,840
that now that it's the lights at the end of the tunnel,

1030
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,000
I just can't be bothered.

1031
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,840
You're done.

1032
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm playing Race the Sun on this thing.

1033
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,160
What do I need 3D acceleration for?

1034
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,200
So, good enough.

1035
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,360
But that might also explain

1036
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,120
why the machine's been a little laggy.

1037
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,560
If you'd like to give us a pick idea,

1038
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,800
you can go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact

1039
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,880
and send an idea in.

1040
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,680
We'd love to have them over there.

1041
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,200
If you want more show,

1042
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,680
well, there's a few ways you can do it.

1043
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,320
You can become a member.

1044
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,400
Linux Unplugged does have a membership program

1045
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,320
at unpluggedcore.com.

1046
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,080
These members get special access to two different feeds.

1047
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,520
One that's an ad-free feed,

1048
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,840
nice, tight, full production with all of Drew's editing,

1049
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,600
who's our summer editor right now.

1050
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,840
Or you can choose the live version.

1051
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,080
And then you'd know I just screwed that up right there.

1052
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,920
But because editor Drew is so smooth, you don't know.

1053
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,000
But if you listen to live version,

1054
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,200
you hear all the mess ups,

1055
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,600
all the times we stopped the show

1056
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,120
because Wes has got to go to the bathroom.

1057
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,520
Okay, that doesn't happen very often.

1058
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,800
But if it did, you'd know.

1059
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,000
Actually, what you really get with the live show

1060
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,920
is just more show.

1061
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,840
There's like almost an entire additional show

1062
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,160
in the pre and post show.

1063
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,040
It's just a lot more casual.

1064
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,680
And as a thank you,

1065
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,520
because you give us runway to decide which sponsors we do

1066
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,880
or don't wanna work with.

1067
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,360
It's not something we talk a lot about,

1068
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,160
but I've just for a little while,

1069
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,080
I'm gonna just mention

1070
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,760
that we get the most ridiculous pitches on this show.

1071
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,400
They get sent in for just all these kinds of crazy products

1072
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,000
and services that they want us to pitch to you guys.

1073
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,760
And it's so nice that our members give us the option

1074
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,760
to just hit the delete button on all of those emails, right?

1075
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,000
That's powerful.

1076
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,120
It keeps us independent.

1077
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,800
It keeps us focused on making content

1078
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,200
that's true to our audience and true to our members.

1079
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,920
So thank you to our members at unpluggedcore.com.

1080
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,120

we'd love to have you join us live.

1091
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,640
See you next week.

1092
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,080
Same bad time, same bad station.

1093
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,120
Yeah, that's right.

1094
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,720
Why don't you come on over?

1095
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,400
We do the show on Sundays.

1096
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,400
We may be experimenting with some new tools,

1097
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,920
maybe experimenting with video streams for this year's show

1098
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,960
so you can see us doing the show live from the JB1 studio.

1099
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,200
Could have some announcements in that regard.

1100
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,600
Perhaps next Sunday would be a good one to join us for

1101
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,800
at jblive.tv, 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1102
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,520

of the Unplugged program.

1112
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:52,180
The cone of silence.

1113
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,960
Do we have any more details on the London meetup?

1114
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,560
Because we didn't mention that in the show and I'm wondering we could like record a thing

1115
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,560
but is there any updates?

1116
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,280
Well, I think is our resident Canadian which is like halfway to England is my understanding

1117
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,280
Brent might know.

1118
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,080
You got anything new for us, Brent Lee?

1119
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,800
Last time we talked about this, which was on office hours last Tuesday.

1120
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,080
There were about 40 people signed up to go to the meetup.

1121
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,240
And as far as today, this update as this minute, there are 53 people.

1122
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,000
So I think the numbers are going up quite considerably.

1123
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,720
I think that might end up being a problem in terms of venue, but that's a good problem

1124
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
to have.

1125
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,560
So I feel like there and those are probably 53 really amazing people to go and meet.

1126
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,240
I feel kind of jealous.

1127
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,160
I see one Martin Wimpress on there, so perhaps Martin Wimpress could do some local advising.

1128
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
Mm hmm.

1129
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,160
All right.

1130
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,840
So this is I think this thing's happening, though, on August 6, 2022.

1131
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,160
I think this is happening.

1132
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,600
So what we'll do is let's we'll just play it cool.

1133
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,440
We'll pretend like we planned to do this in the post show the entire time.

1134
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,920
So get ready.

1135
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,920
The cone of silence.

1136
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,520
Hey, everybody, I just want to make sure that you know that London meetup is on.

1137
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,520
Go get details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

1138
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,240
Hey, guys, look at this.

1139
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,760
Fifty three people attending already.

1140
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,760
Can you believe it?

1141
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,760
That is wow.

1142
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,760
I never expected that at all.

1143
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:32,080
What a surprise.
