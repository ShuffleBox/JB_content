00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 32 for March 18th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's stockpiling bananas in preparation

3
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
for this Sunday's Monkey Suit Spectacular. My name is Chris.

4
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
My name is Matt.

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,840
Hey there, Matt. We've got a good show lined up today. Falling right on the heels of our

6
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,640
review of SolidXK on last, we'll be discussing the distribution with the co-founders themselves

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,600
coming up in a little bit. And I don't know, I'm really conflicted because there's a lot

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
we could talk about this week, but I also kind of have to keep it a short show because

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,640
right after we get off the air, I've got to run to meet up with an electrician at the

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,960
new studio. That's going down like crazy. Rekai landed yesterday. He's at the studio.

11
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,540
He's actually getting goodies right now to get ready in preparation to prepare his body

12
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,120
for editing of these shows. So he's got to have sustenance. So Angelo's out with him

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,920
right now taking care of all that. It's been a pretty crazy couple of days driving back

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,280
and forth with a lot of gear. And so one of the other things I have to do for all the

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,400
studio shenanigans is meet with the electrician. I've got to start up a new conversation with

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,520
a new contractor. I know why contractors have a bad name now, Matt. Let me tell you.

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,120
Well yeah, I'll tell you. There's a lot of back and forth. Although I will give a shout

18
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,480
out to your previous contractor. He did kind of have some life circumstances.

19
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,360
That's true. What are you going to do, right? The universe is a cruel place sometimes.

20
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,480
But nonetheless, we're going to just go for as long as we can and get as much covered

21
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,800
as we can today because there's been some interesting developments even just since Sunday

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,120
that I want to discuss. And I'm really looking forward to talking to the Solida XK guys.

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,440
So stay tuned for all of that stuff. But first, I thought maybe we'd cover a little feedback

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:15,080
and see if we can't solve a Mac user's problems. Yes, that's right. Because he wants to switch

25
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,960
to Linux. We should also tease, in case we forget later in the show, this Sunday on the

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,200
Linux action show. It is monkey suit time. The bet comes due this Sunday. Now, for those

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,720
of you that don't remember, Matt made a bet, and he's willing to pay up, that Mir would

28
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,480
ship on another distribution outside of Ubuntu within a year, and it didn't happen. Now,

29
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,640
I think some folks at Canonical at the time probably agreed with Matt.

30
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,360
Oh yeah. I won't say there were promises because that's not fair, but I will absolutely say

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,480
that support was given on my behalf.

32
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,280
They said they would do their best, but it just didn't work out. But we'll just use the

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,040
opportunity to kind of just look at the state of Mir development, alternative display managers

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,480
on Linux, and if everything goes as planned, we'll have Kevin on from Canonical to talk

35
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,900
a little bit about the state of Mir. So I think we're going to have monkey suit shenanigans,

36
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,520
we're going to have a good conversation around where all of it's at a year later. So it'll

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,720
work out to be a great episode coming up on Sunday. But why don't we start by seeing if

38
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,120
we can help out Simon's problems here. Simon really wants to switch from the Mac. He says,

39
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,880
hey there Chris and Matt. I'm a web developer and a Mac user, and I feel it's time to move

40
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,520
on. I feel that Apple is focusing more and more on their iOS platform and losing sight

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,240
of its desktop power users. I'm not blaming them. That's where the money is. I get that.

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,440
But that's not the computer experience I'm looking for.

43
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,780
I have some experiences with Linux, both on the server and on some older desktop machines

44
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,040
here at home. But I want to go all in and use Linux on my desktop, the machine I need

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,880
nine hours a day to get my work done. But now I need some help from you guys. What distribution

46
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,260
should I go for? I'm tempted to go with Ubuntu as I feel it might make the switch easier

47
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,560
for me. He says maybe I can even replace an iPhone with an Ubuntu touch device down the

48
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,040
road when it's ready. It's close to the Mac user experience and might be the smoothest

49
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,360
transition without preventing myself from getting any real work done. Later I learned

50
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,240
the pros and cons. Maybe I could switch to a different distro at that point. But with

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,920
most Linux users, they don't seem to like Ubuntu. Lots of you complain about Unity

52
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,760
and Mir, but no one likes to explain why. What's up with that? It's simply a matter

53
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,120
of personal taste? Is it envy because of canonical success? Is that the reason for the hate?

54
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
Thanks for helping me choose. Simon.

55
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,400
Boy, you know, I think the first question I would have to ask him is what is he using

56
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,520
for web development? Are there legacy applications at work that could potentially create a bit

57
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,000
of a hurdle making the switch completely? Now, if he's just doing this straight from

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,320
like a notepad or something like that, no big deal.

59
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,280
Yeah, he said web developer. So I'm going to just give him the benefit of the doubt

60
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,280
that, you know, he could probably he'd maybe he's using a sublime text on the Mac. He could

61
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,560
use sublime text on Linux.

62
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,480
Sure. Okay. So let's say he's going that route. I think he's going that route. I think Ubuntu

63
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:59,200
does make sense simply because it does feel very natural to a lot of Mac users. My wife,

64
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,480
if she's going to use Linux, will generally prefer Ubuntu simply because she finds the

65
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,680
flow is more familiar to her. Generally speaking, compared to other distros, although she's

66
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,920
pretty comfortable in most distributions, it's really not such an issue with that. And

67
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,000
I also think the App Store coming from the Mac also then going to Ubuntu is also fairly

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,120
familiar in that regard as well. What do you think as far as hatred, though?

69
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,480
What about the idea of making his Linux desktop match whatever web server platform he's deploying

70
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,280
on? So if he's deploying on a CentOS box, maybe Fedora might make more sense or CentOS

71
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,000
is enough, maybe? I can't think of very many situations where

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,620
a newcomer in Fedora would ever fit the same sentence. I think Fedora is a great distro,

73
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,840
but it is not. And anyway, I couldn't picture that unless it's maintained for them and then

74
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
that's different.

75
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,680
What do you think, Mumble Room? So you got a Mac user. He's a web developer. His name

76
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,320
is Simon and he's thinking about switching from the Mac to Linux. What distro would you

77
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,520
say he should pick?

78
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,600
I think something very similar. I came from Mac to Linux, and I felt very comfortable

79
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,040
at the time with Unity on Ubuntu.

80
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,280
It really depends on what sort of workflow he's desiring. If he's desiring a Mac-like

81
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,960
workflow, I'd almost recommend elementary OS, and therefore maybe GDK.

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Please no.

83
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Ouch, wow.

84
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,680
Their packages are so out of date that it's not worth using them.

85
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,120
They're based on a stable 12.0 for LTS.

86
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,600
Right. If they just updated their packages, that'd be fine. They update the security stuff,

87
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,440
but they don't update any of their packages. For example, my app hasn't been updated in

88
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,040
Ubuntu for like two years. So by default, the package in elementary is also two years

89
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
old.

90
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:58,520
There will probably be an update when the new LTS comes next month.

91
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:10,880
I'd probably recommend Ubuntu, maybe. Partly because it's awesome, but partly because with

92
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,800
the LTS just around the corner, he'll get a nice shiny new kernel, long-term support,

93
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,680
and every app he needs, basically.

94
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,400
To be fair, I think the hate against Ubuntu is purely Unity and pretty much preferences.

95
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,320
I don't like the Dash, but everything else in Unity I like. The local menus, it's in

96
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
14.04. Awesome.

97
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,560
Okay, so he could get the benefit of having the kernel and switch and use XFCE or Gnome

98
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,160
Shell or any one of a bazillion other desktops that are all in the repository. You don't

99
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,840
have to switch to show some random distribution from some guy in his bedroom. You could use

100
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,160
Ubuntu and just not use Unity if you don't want to. That's fine.

101
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,600
I think he should just try out some different distros, maybe start with Ubuntu and just

102
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,760
see what he likes because we're not going to be able to...

103
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,960
You're saying Linux from scratch? Is that what you're saying?

104
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:08,080
I think he was saying Gentoo. I think I would recommend SolidXK. That's what I would recommend.

105
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,480
Seriously, that might be worth consideration.

106
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,080
The other thing I want to recommend to Simon is he said that in his letter, he said that

107
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,560
he's got some older machines that he's had some experience with Linux on, both a server

108
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,060
and an older desktop machine. I would not recommend you say switch from a relatively

109
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:31,440
recent MacBook Pro to a several-year-old PC machine and load Linux on it and experience...

110
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,480
You're not going to have a great experience because you're going from pretty high-end

111
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,960
hardware to lower-end hardware. So give Linux a chance to breathe. If you're used to...

112
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,720
If you work at a machine, like you said, for nine hours a day to get work done and you're

113
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,840
used to that machine being very powerful, then don't limit yourself with a resource-limited

114
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,400
machine just because that's the one you can load Linux on. So position your hardware correctly.

115
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,760
Try out some different distributions. Try Integros. Try Solid. Try Ubuntu. Try SUSE.

116
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,540
Try all of them, really. I'm betting like the most of the chat room, you might end up

117
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,720
liking the more recent Ubuntu versions.

118
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah. Well, and I go back to what I said about the user interface. For a lot of Mac users,

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,440
that's a big deal. And I think Ubuntu nails a pretty close match for my experience.

120
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,280
Yeah. Yeah. Gnome 3 is pretty refined these days, too.

121
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,560
Yeah. Gnome 3 is okay. Gnome 3 would be all right. I could see that, especially with a

122
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
little dock action going on.

123
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,240
Yeah, a little dock action. But I just say, just try it out. And like you said, it sounds

124
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,120
like you're pretty open to the idea of moving later on. The Ubuntu hate kind of just comes

125
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,080
from... There's a lot there. You basically... Just listen to the back catalog of the show

126
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,000
and it'll actually explain it pretty well.

127
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,560
Yeah. Listen to that last one episode.

128
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,520
Yeah. Listen to the last episode. Exactly. That actually covered it pretty well. And

129
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,880
I think that if you're comfortable with the things I discussed there, and I think you

130
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,680
probably would be, like we got an email from a viewer who said, you know, I'm long time...

131
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,040
Actually, I think I have it in the pile here. I'll see if we can get to it. Because I think

132
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,160
I do have an email from... Yeah. We have an email from somebody who's going to touch on

133
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,120
that. So we'll get to that in a minute because I think there's a lot of people who just don't

134
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,400
care about some of the things that get people all riled up. And then there's a lot of advantages

135
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,680
to Ubuntu. There's a lot of advantages to all of them. Try them out, Simon. Keep listening.

136
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,560
Check out our back catalog. I think that'll give you some help. But the big piece I wanted

137
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,960
you to take away from my recommendation is don't straddle yourself with lower end hardware

138
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,520
and then expect to be blown away. You're not going to have a bad time necessarily, especially

139
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:29,840
if you go with something like Popey was saying with XFCE or Solid X. But you probably won't

140
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,520
need the same amount of hardware. But I am somebody who's very sensitive to low performance

141
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:43,160
hardware. And if I had a MacBook Pro with 16 gigabytes of RAM, an SSD, and a high end

142
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,920
video card, and then I switched to something with a spinning drive, maybe an integrated

143
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,840
GPU, and a core to do or something like that, I don't think I would use that machine very

144
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,880
long. And I think I would have a pretty bad time. And I think that would influence my

145
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,040
opinion of that operating system in general. Because it just would feel restrictive.

146
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,520
Well, it's an excellent point. The bigger point of it is, too, is that I don't care

147
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,200
what version of Linux you're using, what distro you happen to go with. If you're using a lot

148
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,400
of resources, such as like a browser with a bunch of tabs open, you're going to care

149
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,360
about the hardware it's running on. Really, you can run lightweight desktops all day long.

150
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,640
I also agree with Ayamakan in the chat room. I'm not a big proponent of putting Linux on

151
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,760
a Mac. You can do it. But there are always compromises. And people who tell you there

152
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,040
aren't compromises haven't been running it long enough.

153
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
Or all.

154
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,360
Yeah, it's just, unfortunately, it is the truth. Like for example, whenever I had tried

155
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,360
it on a Mac, I've always had issues with the webcam. There's a blob that you have to load

156
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,840
up at the time of boot up that you have to... I guess the Mac operating system actually

157
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,840
loads like a firmware onto the webcam every time Mac OS X starts. And you have to replicate

158
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,360
that under Linux. And you have to go extract that firmware out of a Mac, move it over to

159
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,680
your Linux install, and then, you know, follow some sort of guide online to make that work.

160
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,800
There's other things that don't work. Like on more recent, like say, 2012 Retina MacBook

161
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,360
Pro, I'm reading a discussion thread here that was a really good one on Reddit over

162
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,520
the last weekend. Wi-Fi is extremely flaky for this guy. He says he doesn't have any

163
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,280
problem under Mavericks, but when he's under Linux, his Wi-Fi drops out. Reduced battery

164
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:28,440
life. Under Linux, he gets 4.5 hours compared to 8 hours under OS X. Once the video and

165
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,940
video blob loads, he's unable to switch to one of the TTYs, you know, by doing Control

166
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,840
Alt and hitting F1 or F2 or F3. He says the touchpad is extremely quirky. He says I've

167
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,840
ironed it out as well as I can, but I'm still not completely happy with it, particularly

168
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,480
when typing from the web like this one. A little more than just a slightest touch or

169
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,360
reposition of my typing cursor and the position of the mouse cursor. It can be infuriating

170
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,080
at times. He says I've had to reread this exact post three times just to make sure I'm

171
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,680
catching the errors that this one single issue has caused. So don't necessarily load it on

172
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,800
a Mac and expect it to work well. Different Macs have different success rates. Generally

173
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,640
the newer the Mac, the less things that work. So also consider that, Simon. You might want

174
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,840
to consider a dedicated machine that's really, you know, going to give you a better experience.

175
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,400
And if this was Linux Action Show, I'd say go over to check out System76 because they're

176
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,360
going to give you a Mac-like experience as far as hardware compatibility and setup. Something

177
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,120
to consider. I will mention one of Linux Unplug sponsors right here, right now, and that's

178
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,620
my mobile service provider and, by the way, Matt's mobile service provider. That's right.

179
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,640
That is Ting.com. You guys, go check out Ting. Mobile that makes sense. Go to Linux.Ting.com.

180
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,960
Linux.Ting.com. That'll get you started. That landing page will also tag your shopping session

181
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,800
to take $25 off your first device or if you're going to bring your own device, $25 service

182
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,240
credit, which for me paid for my first month. Now what's unique about Ting? I'll tell you.

183
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,400
You only pay for what you use. It's a flat $6 per month plus taxes and then just your

184
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,480
usage. It's really straight. Like you can wrap your brain around that and which is great

185
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,880
because like, hey, guess what? I needed hotspot and tethering over the last few weeks when

186
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,680
I was working out of the studio for a few hours. I just checked the box on my phone

187
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,560
and now all the devices that we had with us were immediately on the internet and I'm getting

188
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,380
14 megabits download at the studio using my Nexus 5. Oh yeah, they support the Nexus 5.

189
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,000
You can go buy the Nexus 5 directly from the Google Play Store, a device that you own outright

190
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,440
that you pay a fair market price, you bring it over to Ting, you activate it, $6 a month,

191
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,500
no contract, no early termination fee. You only pay for what you use. Plus Ting has an

192
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,240
awesome, awesome dashboard. I love this dashboard because I was just setting up Reiki in the

193
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,480
new studio with the HTC One. Oh, it hurt. I gave away the HTC One, Matt. It pained me

194
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,760
so deeply. That was the hardest phone I've ever had to give away. I've given away a lot

195
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,320
of phones and the HTC One, cut deep. That's a great phone. It's available on the Ting

196
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,480
network and what's so nice about it is that Ting dashboard now lets me manage these accounts

197
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,880
so transparently and smoothly. I can let them see where they're at with their usage. I can

198
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,240
set up alerts so if all of a sudden Reiki is using like 10 gigabytes of data on that

199
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,640
phone, I can have Ting send me a push notification to my Android app. I can log into their dashboard

200
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,280
which supports web standards from a mobile device or from your desktop, whatever it is.

201
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,440
I can set up caller IDs options. I can turn off voicemail. I can turn on voicemail. I

202
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,200
can set up where a call forwards. I can activate, deactivate lines, transfer lines, set up account

203
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,200
managers. It's all, it's so awesome and it's so smooth and here's the best part. If you've

204
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,660
been considering switching to Ting and you're stuck in a contract, Ting has an early termination

205
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,240
relief program. You can find out more going to ting.com slash ETF and that early termination

206
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,040
relief program will pay you up to $75 per line you have to have canceled. And the other

207
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,400
thing I like about Ting is I like to be an informed consumer. I like to make sure that

208
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,740
I am voting with my wallet, that the money I am spending is going towards a company that

209
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,400
is promoting something that I believe in. Ting is trying to clean up the wireless industry.

210
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,400
They're trying to shake things up and I think they're doing it successfully. You're seeing

211
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,580
some of the bigger players try to copy what they're doing but it's not genuine. Ting is

212
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,760
genuine and they put it all out there. You can go over to ting.com slash about and you

213
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,280
can get videos from just the top, the CEO, the EVP, the VP, the director right there,

214
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,600
VP of marketing, the CFO. They also have behind the scenes tours with just the service reps,

215
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,440
the people who are on the ground because they have a fantastic customer service program.

216
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,920
When you call them anytime between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. a real person answers the phone.

217
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,920
I don't know of any other cell provider that does that. If you're in a business, if you've

218
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,780
got family or friends or even if you just need to solve a problem yourself, it is so

219
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:38,440
nice to know that when I handed Rekai that HTC One and if we had a problem at any point,

220
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,160
I knew that I would just call up Ting and we'd have it resolved within a few minutes.

221
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,320
It wasn't going to be a big waste of my time. Lately, a lot of people that I've had to deal

222
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,380
with over the phone have been wasting my time. It is so great to know that people that I'm

223
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,640
spending money on every single month for my mobile phone are not wasting my time. Ting

224
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,960
really is changing it up and you can help them do it by becoming a Ting subscriber.

225
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,780
Go over to linux.ting.com. That'll take $25 off your first month or $25 off your first

226
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,360
device if you don't have one and it also lets them know you heard about it here on this

227
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,120
show and you appreciate them supporting Linux Unplugged. So go over to linux.ting.com and

228
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,720
a really big thank you to the really great folks over at Ting for their awesome support

229
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:22,760
of Linux Unplugged. Linux.ting.com. Alright, we've got a couple more emails to get through.

230
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,400
Last week, we asked for folks to send in their AutoCAD replacements because this is something

231
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,720
we hear about all the time. I can't switch to Linux because AutoCAD and it seems to be

232
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,280
a lot of people in this field are interested in Linux but AutoCAD. So Scribbleton writes

233
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,760
in. He says, hello awesome duo. He actually wrote that. So that made it right there. He

234
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,480
tells us about DraftSight. It's a professional grade and free as a beard 2D CAD program made

235
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,640
by the same company that produces SolidWorks. Okay, now SolidWorks I've heard a lot about.

236
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,040
They introduced it as a way for engineers to convert AutoCAD DWG files to DXF files

237
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,840
although I think they're also trying to steal some of AutoCAD's market share. It behaves so

238
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,920
much like AutoCAD it even uses the same command lines that a coworker and I completely switched

239
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,600
over in just a matter of days. It runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux and it can be found

240
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,960
at draftsite.com. He said, I also have a comment after watching Linux Unplugged 31, the Ubuntu

241
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,680
punching bag episode that we just recommended Simon listen to. He says, I'm not a programmer,

242
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,560
a dev, or an IT guy. I'm just an average user that loves to use Linux. Yet I have not

243
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,080
missed an episode of last since I found it in 2011. As a small business owner, I watched

244
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,760
last to keep up with Linux developments and learn about new programs. As you were discussing,

245
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,880
I don't care about the internal battles of Wayland versus mirror system D. I just want

246
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,880
my stuff to run as simply and reliably as possible so I can get my work done. So Ubuntu

247
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,400
has worked just fine for me. Someday I may want to try Antegoros, but only after I find

248
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,240
some spare time. Keep up the good work. I'm really looking forward to the new how to show

249
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,960
so an average guy like me can effectively implement all this great stuff. Scribbleton.

250
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,800
Great comment and I think he echoes a lot of the silent majority there. That's why I

251
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,920
wanted to read it. I think he's definitely onto something. So Esquero Tamero writes in

252
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:16,240
Matt. I don't know how you say it. He's got a whole list for us, Matt. He says, I used

253
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,920
to do drafting for my family's business, civil engineering related, and I tried some of the

254
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,360
solutions a while back while trying to find a cheaper alternative to AutoCAD. I haven't

255
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,400
used all of these solutions, but they're all present for Linux and they're related to CAD.

256
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,200
He says, here's one you could try. FreeCAD. This is an application used to 3D models.

257
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,280
LibreCAD. This is basically a fork of the community edition of QCAD. BLRCAD. Haven't

258
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,720
used this one, but he says it's another option. QCAD. This is a program with a free and paid

259
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,300
version. And then he says there's commercial software like DraftSite, which we just had

260
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,440
recommended to us. VeryCAD, a 2D, 3D CAD program. Eris Commander Edition. This is a compatible

261
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,200
2D, 3D CAD program with a ribbon interface. And BricsCAD. This is probably the most complete

262
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,400
solution for Linux, along with Eris CE, but it's as expensive as AutoCAD. And it seems

263
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,320
to stumble on 64-bit systems, he says.

264
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,880
Hmm. Now that could be a problem. I mean, you would think, okay, I can just go ahead

265
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,720
and switch over to this, but I think so many people are using 64-bit systems. That would

266
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
be kind of a buzzkill.

267
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,480
It also says DWGs are not exactly supported in FOSS software. As far as I know, support

268
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,920
is limited, and there are GPL compliance issues incorporated into other programs.

269
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,280
This is a good list, and I wanted to say thank you for sending this in. It feels a little

270
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,920
bit like the list I get when I ask people for their favorite Linux video editor, and

271
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,960
then I get a list of a lot of really good options with links and names, but then I actually

272
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,040
go sit down and I'm like, oh, well, when you actually use these programs professionally,

273
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,640
you discover a lot of limitations. And I kind of feel like this might be a little bit of

274
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
that.

275
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
I think so.

276
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,920
It's hard to say, so we will link. We'll have a full list in our show notes. You can

277
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,880
go check out. It sounds like the one people are really going on about, though, is DraftSight

278
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,400
from, I guess, the same folks that make SolidWorks. And DraftSight is, technically, it's free,

279
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,020
as in cost, but it is commercial software. It's not open source. And they have it available

280
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,720
for Windows, Mac, and Linux. They have an RPM for Fedora available.

281
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,560
Okay. Well, I think anytime you have something available for Linux, even if it's not perfect,

282
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
at least it's there.

283
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
They have a dev as well. They have a dev.

284
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Okay.

285
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,800
So you got a couple options there. So that's DraftSight. And hopefully, that helps some

286
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,680
folks out there that have been looking for AutoCAD solutions, because it's been a surprisingly

287
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:35,400
popular one. Art of Illusion. What's this? Art of Illusion is a free open source remodeling

288
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,640
and rendering studio.

289
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Oh, okay.

290
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Oh, wow.

291
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,400
Many of its capabilities rival those found in commercial programs. So here's another

292
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,080
one. Art of Illusion. I'll add that to the show notes, too. Thanks, Nexuiz. That's a

293
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
good one.

294
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Yeah.

295
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,000
So, all right. I'm adding that, right? There we go. So thanks for sending those in, guys.

296
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,360
That was a good list. We had a few folks round up. We also got four or five emails on it

297
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,920
as well. And so I just linked to a couple of them, but we got a lot of good feedback

298
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,880
on it. So I really appreciate all of you guys sending that in to us.

299
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,920
Matt, before we get our guests on, I want to thank our second sponsor this week, and

300
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,680
that is DigitalOcean. What is DigitalOcean? Oh, man. You guys have got to check this out.

301
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,800
If you're thinking about learning how to do something on the server, if you have something

302
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,520
you need to deploy in production, you've got to check out DigitalOcean. It's simple cloud

303
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,200
hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive way and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

304
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,240
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds, or less if you're our audience, and pricing

305
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,720
plans are only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, and a terabyte

306
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,320
of transfer. I've got an arch box I've had running up there. Yes, I said arch, running

307
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,520
up there for months now, and it's just constantly doing more and more stuff. And as I am moving

308
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,680
between the current studio and the new studio, and I start thinking about, well, wait a minute,

309
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,880
I need to have shared resources between these two locations. I got to tell you, this $5

310
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,760
DigitalOcean machine, it's just starting to get more and more valuable, because I just

311
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,880
keep thinking of things I can do with it. And by the way, DigitalOcean has data center

312
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,940
locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and now they've even got them in Singapore.

313
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,880
They have a very simple interface, an intuitive control panel, which power users can replicate

314
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,640
on a larger scale with the company's straightforward API. They got KVM on the back end, it's all

315
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,600
running on top of Linux, sitting on these SSDs, in pair with their tier one bandwidth.

316
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,160
And the reason I can say all of this is because I've been a DigitalOcean customer for a long

317
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,280
time now, and I have not had a single outage. I have never, ever been disappointed with

318
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,520
the performance, and I am constantly impressed with the feature sets and the things they're

319
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,920
adding. And DigitalOcean is a company. They are growing like crazy. They're hiring right

320
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,840
now. You can check out their hiring page. They have it linked at the top of the DigitalOcean

321
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,560
website. They just recently got a good round of funding too, so they've got a ton of runway

322
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,480
underneath them. This is a company that is going places, and I'm really excited because

323
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,520
not only is that all great, but it's just a really great service to use. The technology

324
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:58,000
is great, the interface is great, their droplet system is super smooth and straightforward,

325
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,960
and they have an API that if I ever wanted to get fancy, and I ever wanted to do something

326
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,200
like start automating stuff, I know that API is there to make it easy for me. So go over

327
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,000
to DigitalOcean.com and get a $10 credit by using the promo code Linux Unplugged March.

328
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,740
Linux Unplugged March will get you a $10 credit. You can try out that $5 rig for two months.

329
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,760
Try out that $5 rig. Even if you're just using it to explore what you can do on your own

330
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,240
server, why not use this instead of something like VirtualBox? Go up there, deploy this.

331
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,440
You can take snapshots before you break anything. Yes, it actually, in a sense, can have training

332
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,720
wheels. That droplet system can really help you get out of a jam, and it also helps you

333
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,360
deploy a new system immediately. My co-host from Koda Radio, Michael Dominic, uses DigitalOcean

334
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,320
for the backend infrastructure for a lot of the apps he develops for his clients. It's

335
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,760
a super easy system to deploy. He can do it with reliability. He can quantify the cost

336
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,320
for them. They can totally wrap their brains around it, and $5 a month doesn't break the

337
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:57,000
bank. They have a really straightforward pricing system where it goes from $5, $10, $20, $40,

338
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,880
$80, depending on what you need. Each tier brings a whole bunch more stuff, more processor,

339
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,240
more storage, more bandwidth, all of that stuff. If you just want to do some testing,

340
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,760
maybe you've got a web app you want to try out, maybe you've got an app that needs some

341
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,140
backend infrastructure for a little bit, but you don't need it for an entire month, they

342
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,840
even have hourly pricing. DigitalOcean has hourly pricing. Think about that $10 credit

343
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,820
at that point. That $10 credit is going to get you a ways. Go use the promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH

344
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,200
when you check out over at digitalocean.com. Try out that $5 machine. See what we've been

345
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,520
saying, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

346
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,440
That's awesome. What you were saying about the whole virtual machine thing, that really

347
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,160
resonates with me because I don't always have a machine handy that can really support that

348
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,080
as well as I could at virtual, going to a whole other setup.

349
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,840
There's that. There's the resources of it. If you're on a laptop, it makes your laptop

350
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,520
run hot. There's all these reasons, and you don't have the performance drag, plus you're

351
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,880
actually up on the web where you can try some things you might not be comfortable bringing

352
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,800
into your house, and you have that droplet system, so if you mess something up, boop,

353
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,560
Bob's your uncle, you revert right back, just like you would on VirtualBox.

354
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,960
All right. Well, I'm really excited to welcome the co-founders of SolidXK onto the show.

355
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,820
I'm going to try to get this right. We have Shilja and 00. I don't know how well I did

356
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,760
but guys, welcome to the show.

357
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,000
Thank you very much, and happy to be here.

358
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Hello.

359
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,600
Hello, 00. We were pretty impressed by the distro when we checked it out on Sunday, so

360
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,840
I just had a couple of questions after we kicked the tires that I wanted to throw your

361
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,120
guys' way. What I'm going to do is I'll just go in the order, so I'll start with Shilja,

362
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,680
and then we'll ask 00, or you guys can just bounce it around, but let's throw this first

363
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,920
one to Shilja. Could you guys give us a little background? Is SolidXK based on Linux Mint

364
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,440
Debian Edition? Is it just inspired by Linux Mint Debian Edition? We noticed that it uses

365
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,120
the Mint tools, such as the Mint Software Manager and the Mint Updater, but is it actually

366
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,560
like, did you clone the Linux Mint distro repos and build on top of it, or did you start

367
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,240
with a Debian base and just pull in those tools?

368
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,840
We just started from scratch from Debian.

369
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
Okay.

370
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,840
At that time, I wanted an L&D version.

371
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,240
Right, right. Go ahead.

372
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,400
And Kleiner Lefebvre didn't have any plans for that.

373
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,560
So you decided to break off on your own and create one sort of based around the same ideas

374
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,600
of Linux Mint Debian, but with the desktops that you had a passion about?

375
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:44,280
Yes, yes. And at first, we planned to make it an official version of Linux Mint. The

376
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:57,280
Mint team didn't want to support that. My choice was just an edition, or go on my own.

377
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:04,480
ZeroZero was also very in favor of going on our own, so we did.

378
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,400
Very good. And ZeroZero, I wanted to, let me ask you this question. So could you explain

379
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,040
to me the difference between the business and home versions of SolidXK? I know that

380
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,080
the business, for example, says it has a focus on stability and security, but the home version

381
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,720
says it's stable and secure. So what really is the difference between those two?

382
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:34,600
The business edition, it's based on the Debian stable, and the home edition, it's based on

383
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:44,620
Debian testing. That is the main difference. So then we build the business edition based

384
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:58,320
on stable with our tools and with our interface, with our ideas, and we give the home edition

385
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:10,240
with the latest software and more up-to-date software. So they are two different concepts

386
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,760
that we give to the users.

387
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:18,660
So I gather that you guys both have an interest in KDE and XFCE, but we got a couple of questions

388
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:26,000
that came in primarily around the Cinnamon desktop. How does the support look for Cinnamon

389
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,840
desktop on SolidXK? Does it use it? So do you guys have like a repo that you're going

390
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,160
to set that up in? Are you going to just pull it from Debian, or is that something you're

391
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,520
not really even worrying about if the users want to figure it out, they can?

392
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:46,080
We're not planning on supporting Cinnamon on SolidXK. That's because the name SolidXK

393
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,560
does not include C for Cinnamon, so we're going to have a problem with our site.

394
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,560
So I take that as the same answer then for say something like MATE, even if say MATE

395
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,320
really takes off on Debian stable at some point.

396
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:13,960
MATE is to be included very soon in the Debian testing, so our users will update MATE when

397
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
they want.

398
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Gotcha.

399
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:28,840
So Cinnamon was in Debian testing until a few months ago. Then the transition from GTK

400
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:40,560
3.10 broke Cinnamon, and Cinnamon was removed from Debian testing. At the moment, it's not

401
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:50,800
available upstream. There's a few how-tos in the forum, how to get Cinnamon from the

402
00:30:50,800 --> 00:31:04,560
Linux Mint Debian repo, but that's it. We have to focus, that's our main focus, on the

403
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:11,120
two D's that we support and the distributions that we support.

404
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,560
So the tools you ship with SolidX or K, do they have any dependencies on let's say KDE?

405
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:24,840
So for example, if I decided I'm going to have a solid MATE desktop, would I end up

406
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,080
having to pull down a whole bunch of KDE libs or something like that to use some of the

407
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,480
tools like the software manager?

408
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,080
No, those packages don't have any KDE dependencies.

409
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,320
Now here's the other thing we got some questions about, and I decided during the review not

410
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,160
to really tweak the look too much, but some people thought it was pretty surprising to

411
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:54,440
see the oxygen theme under XFCE, and is that just personal preference? You guys like the

412
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,760
oxygen theme, or is it consistency? What's the story there?

413
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:11,160
When we started, we needed to decide on if we wanted to make it look like two totally

414
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:19,400
different distributions, coincidentally maintained by the same people. We would like to have

415
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,400
some consistency between the two, so we chose for the latter.

416
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,960
Okay, so it's a consistency thing.

417
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:34,360
Yes, and the oxygen theme was the only one working on both KDE and XFCE without a problem.

418
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,560
The choice was easy.

419
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:42,800
So now that you're at this stage and you're seeing your community grow, are you guys concerned

420
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,360
about long-term scale? Are you worried about how to hold it all together if more and more

421
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,080
people start using the distribution, and how do you plan to address that?

422
00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:08,960
It's, of course, always a – we're now at a time that we are at a fast growth in our

423
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
user base.

424
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Yeah.

425
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,880
Last year from, well, zero to, what would you say now, more than 1,200 users on the

426
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:31,320
– about, I think, 20 or 30,000 users for our systems. So it's growing very fast. We're

427
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:42,820
still looking for a suitable business model, like a solid scale more.

428
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,360
You are hoping to make a little bit of a profit at doing this. Do you hope to turn it into

429
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
a full-time job?

430
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:57,000
Yes. Realistically, seeing now that it's not possible, it's so much fun. I would like

431
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
to do that.

432
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,760
Yeah. It definitely seems to be something that has challenged many companies and people

433
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,800
to turn a profit out of a desktop distribution.

434
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:12,720
Yes. The business models in open source, especially for Linux distributions, are very difficult.

435
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,880
We're not searching there at the moment. I'm a business consultant by trade.

436
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:24,240
So do you hope that the business edition might lead to some sort of – like a revenue model

437
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,240
of some kind?

438
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:31,080
I don't think that the products are going to bring the revenue we need.

439
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,400
So you think it might be like a service-based thing? People will contact you for support?

440
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:46,680
Services support, maybe some products that we can provide as a service, like cloud solutions

441
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:52,880
or integration solutions on back-end systems.

442
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,720
So that's sort of a long-term thing then, because the distribution has to see quite

443
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,560
a bit of growth before you probably reach a phase where that would turn it off for profit,

444
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,600
right? So it's a long-term thing here.

445
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:12,200
Yes. When you – different phases. So you have to think about what do we do on the short

446
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,560
term, so we could think about sponsorship or something like that. But you also have

447
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,520
to think about what is our vision, and is it clear for the community what that vision

448
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,600
is? And how can we shape that?

449
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,160
Do you believe then that – do you believe that the need is strong enough for a rolling

450
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,960
distribution with this quarterly update pack cycle? Do you think that that is solving a

451
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,200
big enough market need that would obviously then be – the thing you could assume from

452
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,480
that is companies like Red Hat and Ubuntu are leaving this need unfulfilled, and so

453
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,720
there's a space for Solid to come up and say, well, look, we're going to offer you

454
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,840
the advantages of rolling with this safety net, and you think that's a big enough of

455
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,400
a market need that you might be able to carve out some business support for that?

456
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:13,200
Yes, especially for non-profit organizations and governmental institutions.

457
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,920
So when you're pitching somebody – I'll give 00 a chance to jump in. 00, when you're

458
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
pitching somebody –

459
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,080
Business, it's with Joel J.

460
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:29,880
It's his department. It's his department.

461
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,800
I wanted to shift gears and actually change to the rolling release. I would like to get

462
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,680
both of your opinions on why – what do you – what do you convince somebody of a rolling

463
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,640
release? When they say, why do I want rolling, what do you tell them?

464
00:36:43,640 --> 00:37:00,000
Well, first of all, the non-reinstall, again, the non – as you said Sunday, Nuke and Pave,

465
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,680
I think it's the biggest selling point in that pitch.

466
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:13,200
So you don't have to reload. You finally get it all set up, and you're not forced

467
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
to reload.

468
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:21,420
Yeah, yeah. If we can offer, as we are trying to address with the update packs, if we can

469
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:34,280
offer an increased safety, I think it's an extra bonus because with the home edition,

470
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:48,280
we are sitting on top of testing. Testing might not be always stable. So that's why

471
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,800
we opt for this quarterly update packs.

472
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,440
Right. I think it makes sense. It's kind of – it's more – it's rolling with

473
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,000
sort of some safety built in.

474
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:13,360
With a safety net, exactly. So basically this. And we offered as well, because we are with

475
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:23,560
testing, we offered as well, an updated user land and the system and base system. Not necessarily

476
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:36,600
interesting for everybody, but can be interesting for some of our target audience.

477
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,840
Right. Very good. All right. Well, guys, is there anything that we touched on in the review

478
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:49,280
that you wanted to amend or add during Sunday's Linux action show?

479
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,480
No. I think it was a great review. You both were fantastic.

480
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
Oh, thank you.

481
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Oh, jeez.

482
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
We enjoyed it.

483
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
We enjoyed it.

484
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,920
Yeah. Yeah, it was fun to take a look at it.

485
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,720
We saw that you enjoyed it. It was good.

486
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,840
Very good. Well, Mumble Room, as we wrap up, if you guys have any questions, go ahead and

487
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
–

488
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:24,120
Yeah, shoot. Yeah, shoot. Yeah, exactly. A 00 says shoot, if you have any questions.

489
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,080
I just wanted to say one thing. I've been watching that project ever since it was just

490
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,840
kind of getting bowled around in the – on the Linux forum, Linux Mint forums, and I

491
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:39,960
got to say it's been interesting to watch it evolve from an idea about a KDE release

492
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,280
to full-blown distro taking on the XFCE from LMDE, which – so that was pretty good. But

493
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,000
I just want to say kudos to both of you for doing such a good job and adding to the community

494
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
in that way.

495
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,240
Yeah, it's going to be a really interesting distro to watch, and I wish you guys the best

496
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,320
of luck. If you guys want to hang around, we're going to kick around a few topics,

497
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,000
unless anybody else has anything else they want to throw in there. I want to do –

498
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I have one more question.

499
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh, go ahead, Rod.

500
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
One more.

501
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Okay. Yeah, we can do it.

502
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,160
The update packs, they're not for – they're just for the home edition. They're not for

503
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
the –

504
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Yes, only for the home editions.

505
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
Okay.

506
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:28,200
I had one question. How about to secure boot UEFI in the installer?

507
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:39,160
We are testing it right now. Shoji finished the installer UEFI capable last week, two

508
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:50,800
weeks ago, and we are testing it right now. So our next – the next is those during the

509
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:59,120
month of April, second half of April should be UEFI capable.

510
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,160
Very good. Wow.

511
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:10,400
If all the testings go as so far they are, go according to planning.

512
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Right.

513
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,400
I have one more question.

514
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Yeah, sure.

515
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,560
If it's a long-term – like for someone long-term usage, let's say I have someone

516
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,520
who I want to – I'm considering moving to Solid because the whole reinstall thing,

517
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,760
not having to do that, it's very nice. But the issue I have is if they have this one

518
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,760
computer that they would have – they're so far they've been using the same version

519
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,720
distro for two years, maybe three years, and it's kind of got to a point where the updates

520
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,760
on this distro is kind of not working anymore. They're just kind of stalled.

521
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,680
So the Solid solution, if I put them on it and then three years later, would the update

522
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:59,000
packs with the Home Edition still make it – obviously it's not LTS, but would that

523
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
continuously make it – even for that many years?

524
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:14,680
As long as Debian keeps the testing branch open, we'll keep supplying updates packs.

525
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,680
Sounds good.

526
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:22,160
I like that. Hopefully, unless something really bad happens, that's going to continue on.

527
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:29,600
We can't predict the future, but we can hope that Debian keeps the testing branch

528
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:36,480
open for another two, three years. I think it's safe to say that.

529
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,560
Oh, I was going to ask you guys, what do you think about the whole Debian system D thing?

530
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,600
How does that affect Solid?

531
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:52,680
We'll follow upstream when they move. So we've been testing, we've been trying system

532
00:42:52,680 --> 00:43:03,680
D. It's not exactly still completely usable in testing, because system D is still a bit

533
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:13,880
old. You use it, not using. System D is still a bit old, so it's not completely usable.

534
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:20,280
But when Debian moves to system D, we'll move to system D as well.

535
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:28,920
Okay, I got another question. Let's say you have a system that you want to have stable

536
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,760
and you want to have the updates kind of thing. So you want a Home Edition and you want the

537
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,800
updates, but you have it where they don't necessarily have an internet most of the time.

538
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,880
Do you have the updates? Are they possible to do like an offline package update?

539
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:53,120
Not the Solid SK solution, but there are tools in APT for that.

540
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,120
Okay.

541
00:43:54,120 --> 00:44:00,640
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, right. Yeah. Right. You could. Well, guys, great work. Keep it up.

542
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,840
And I hope you can build out a team so that way you don't burn out. That's my big worry.

543
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,840
And I always worry about that with Clem, too.

544
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
Thank you.

545
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,040
And it sounds like, you know, you guys said the one thing that sort of resonated with

546
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:17,880
me that I hope will help you prevent that is focus. You said you know you're focusing.

547
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:28,080
Yeah. That was one of our first decisions. Focus, do less, but try to do it, well, at

548
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,960
least according to what we think would better.

549
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,600
Good on you. I know Q5SIS wants to take us out with the final question. Go ahead, Q5.

550
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:42,280
Yeah, I was just wondering what your guys' plan is for when Debian locks down their updates

551
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,560
because they're going in, you know, getting ready to merge into a new branch. Are you

552
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,760
guys still going to be providing updates or are you guys going to freeze just like Debian

553
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,760
does?

554
00:44:49,760 --> 00:45:05,000
No. On the home edition, we follow upstream. So coming next November, Debian will freeze.

555
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:18,040
So we will, on most of the updates, we will freeze as well. There's a lot of software

556
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:27,880
that will keep updating, Firefox, Thunderbird, our specific software that it's independent

557
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:36,640
from Debian. But most of the, all the rest of the software that comes Debian will follow

558
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:50,480
upstream in there. Unless in the very specific that we find issues during the update packs

559
00:45:50,480 --> 00:46:01,000
and that is, was defined on the, in the beginning, we can pull to solve issues or breakages.

560
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:13,640
We can pull from, for example, Seed to solve a particular situation. So we have some freedom

561
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,840
in that. We are not, we follow testing, we follow upstream, but we are not absolutely

562
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
tied to.

563
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,840
Right. Yeah, I noticed. Go ahead.

564
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,840
Just wanted to say that, is there a service?

565
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,840
No, I was just going to say thank you for clearing that up for me because that was something

566
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:33,360
I was kind of wondering about and there were a couple in the chat room who were curious

567
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,360
too.

568
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:39,600
Yeah. All right. Well, I think that, if you guys haven't checked out a review yet, you

569
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,520
should go watch the Linux action show, but I think they got some serious potential there

570
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,080
and maybe, oh, one other question for you guys. Do you guys, are you guys looking for

571
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,600
folks to get involved with the, or are you guys keeping the team lean right now? What's

572
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,600
the plan there?

573
00:46:50,600 --> 00:47:01,400
We can still use a lot of testers and I would like to find somebody who would like to think

574
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,560
about possible business models for SolidXK.

575
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,640
Okay. So where should they go to get a hold of you?

576
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:17,760
I can do that by going to our site, solidxk.com, as a form, or you can directly mail me at

577
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,640
school year at solidxk.com. There's a lot of possibilities.

578
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,360
Okay. Very good. And we'll have links to their G Plus and Twitter handles and the website

579
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,320
and all that good stuff in the show notes if you guys want to check that out. Before

580
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,280
we run, we don't have time to get into it today because I have to run to a meeting,

581
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,000
but I wanted to pitch a question to the audience. Maybe we can incorporate it into next week's

582
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,600
feedback. This week, Mark Shuttleworth took to his blog and he said the title of it was

583
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:53,600
ACIP, ACPI, Firmware and Your Security. And he made the case and the one that I resonated

584
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,920
with was he said, if you read the catalog of spy tools and digital weaponry provided

585
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,320
by Edward Snowden, you'll see that the firmware on your device is the NSA's best friend. Your

586
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,560
biggest mistake might be to assume the NSA is the only institution abusing this position

587
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,560
of trust though. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that all firmware is a cesspool

588
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:14,140
of insecurity, courtesy of the incompetence of the worst degree from manufacturers, incompetence

589
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:19,200
of the highest degree from a wide range of such agencies. And he goes on to argue that

590
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,640
we need to have a new way of doing firmware. And I'd like to get your guys' take on this.

591
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,560
I've also shared my thoughts in the Linux action show subreddit. I feel like the ship

592
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,280
has already sailed, especially in mobile, but perhaps the opportunity could be opening

593
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,340
up again in ARM in the server room and on future desktops as sort of these big incumbents

594
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:42,080
sort of have less entrenched interest and move into mobile, maybe they'll lessen their

595
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:47,960
grip on the desktop. But I'd like to get your guys' feedback. So go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com,

596
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,080
click on the contact link and choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown. And what do you

597
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,520
think about Mark Shuttleworth's rant against ACPI? I mean, I think nobody here has any

598
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,400
love for ACPI, right, Matt?

599
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,360
You know, I think that he may actually be onto something. I mean, because it's one of

600
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,840
those things no one really ever stops to think about. So I think the fact that he's addressing

601
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,880
it, whether or not it's founded or not, I don't know. I've spent a lot of time. I think

602
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,880
it's important to ask ourselves that question.

603
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,040
Do you think his point's right that we're sort of at a point again where we can re-ask

604
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,960
some of these questions?

605
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:21,600
I think if we're not there yet, we're approaching it like a freight train. I think we are essentially

606
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,600
there. I think we really are.

607
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,600
Yeah.

608
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,840
All right. Well, very good. So send us your thoughts in on that and we'll incorporate

609
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,880
it in the next week's show as well as send us in your thoughts about anything we covered

610
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,920
on this week's episode of Linux Unplugged. We'd love to get your feedback and don't forget

611
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:38,760
that subreddit, LinuxActionShow.reddit.com. Matt, I hope you're washing and brushing off

612
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,400
the monkey suit because someday should be a heck of a show.

613
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,400
Got it all vacuum sealed and ready to go.

614
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,400
Okay. Well, I'll make sure to set aside the bananas so that way we have plenty of entertainment

615
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,900
and I'm looking forward to it. So join us on Sunday for Linux Action Show for the monkey

616
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,880
suit spectacular and the retrospective look at Mir. And don't forget you can join Linux

617
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,280
