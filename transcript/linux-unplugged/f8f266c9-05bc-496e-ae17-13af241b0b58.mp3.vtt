00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
Bad news Wes. I know you were really looking forward to this as a space enthusiast

00:04.680 --> 00:10.820
I know you're really looking forward to this, but Pepsi is dropping its plans to use an orbital billboard

00:11.840 --> 00:14.520
Powered by Linux no more Pepsi in the sky

00:14.520 --> 00:19.520
That was the plan the publication futurism reported on April 13th at Pepsi Co's Russian subsidiary

00:19.920 --> 00:26.080
Was working with a startup there called star rocket to advertise an energy drink called adrenaline rush

00:26.080 --> 00:30.720
Using satellites the whole idea is it goes up, and it makes like a billboard in the sky

00:30.720 --> 00:37.400
So you just look up and there's this annoying advert in the sky filled with cola ads. What could be better?

00:38.800 --> 00:44.520
Spokesperson though for Pepsi Co Russia said that the company had agreed to partner with star rocket on the campaign

00:45.160 --> 00:52.640
They said orbital billboards are the revolution on the market of communications a revolution on the market

00:52.640 --> 00:58.880
There is some confusion though because Pepsi Co in the u.s.. They did confirm that this happened

00:58.880 --> 01:04.680
But they're basically saying this was a one-time exploratory event. We're not really we're not really doing it

01:05.440 --> 01:10.320
Actually star rocket was founded only a year ago and has not deployed any satellites as yet

01:10.320 --> 01:13.560
So some industry experts are a little skeptical like today

01:13.560 --> 01:16.840
Do they actually have the expertise and even the funding to do it there?

01:16.840 --> 01:20.840
They're working to get 25 million in a funding round, but haven't haven't got it yet

01:20.840 --> 01:22.840
What do you think Wes gonna invest?

01:23.280 --> 01:29.600
No cold 25 mil so the other part that's important here is actually in the US federal law prohibits what they call

01:30.200 --> 01:31.920
obtrusive space

01:31.920 --> 01:39.000
Advertising right although it's just a technicality like they can't approve the launch in the US at a federal level

01:39.000 --> 01:43.440
But you could just launch it from say Russia and then park it over us guys sure good

01:43.440 --> 01:48.680
Yeah, and so the the satellites involved in this tech we covered inside bite years ago, and they do actually run Linux

01:48.680 --> 01:52.240
I mean, why else would you want to run it in space? I do not like the direction of this

01:52.600 --> 01:55.800
We got to act fast. We got to be one of the first obviously

01:55.800 --> 02:00.180
You know how big we are about advertising these days here on the podcast Jupiter broadcasting

02:00.180 --> 02:03.040
I mean that that fits in space way better than an energy drink

02:03.680 --> 02:05.680
This is Linux unplugged episode

02:06.240 --> 02:08.240
298 for April 23rd

02:08.240 --> 02:18.240
2019

02:20.440 --> 02:27.720
Well, hello there and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, mr.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.600
Payne good to see you. It is the calm before the storm right now, man

02:31.600 --> 02:34.800
I can't I'm having a hard time even conceptualizing the next couple of days

02:34.800 --> 02:39.660
I know we got to do this show kind of quick today because if we're not careful Alan Jude's gonna show up in studio

02:39.840 --> 02:45.240
He's gonna crash our so show with me flashing everything with free BSD. I know it's gonna just ruin it

02:45.240 --> 02:46.080
So we got it

02:46.080 --> 02:52.400
We got to hurry up because the crowd for Linux fest Northwest is assembling right now Alan Jude's one of the first in but then many

02:52.400 --> 02:59.600
Many more and that is the crazy Linux fest Northwest just after this show pretty much people start arriving like during the show

02:59.600 --> 03:01.640
That's crazy. This is our last moment of peace Wes

03:01.640 --> 03:08.680
Haha, well before we go any further, let's bring in that mumble room time appropriate greetings virtual log. Hello guys

03:11.600 --> 03:19.440
Hello, hello Brent. Hello code. Mr. Badger mini Mac the geek tweets this geek tweets and turf is in there and of course

03:20.160 --> 03:25.040
Coming in on the studio line. We have cheese and L. Hello you two. Hey, hey

03:25.280 --> 03:30.280
So glad to have everybody here today and our inner during our last moments of sanity

03:30.280 --> 03:36.780
I thought let's let's ask about something. I think many of you forgotten about I sure have did you? Oh, yeah

03:37.520 --> 03:43.160
The story is like all right, but it's totally slipped my radar. Okay cheese. I'm gonna put you on the spot right now

03:43.500 --> 03:46.240
Can you tell me what the Atari VCS is?

03:47.400 --> 03:48.960
Yes, it's

03:48.960 --> 03:51.820
Linux based console damn to

03:53.400 --> 03:55.400
Some classic games and I think they also

03:55.400 --> 04:01.800
Don't they have a couple of the devs from some of the original Atari games working for them as well. Yeah

04:01.880 --> 04:04.680
Yeah, I was hoping I was hoping to prove a point

04:04.680 --> 04:08.400
I mean, I think a lot of people that had kind of forgotten about this story

04:08.840 --> 04:12.080
And of course, I'm a backer not because I really think it's gonna be great

04:12.080 --> 04:14.480
But just because I kind of wanted to see if they'd get there

04:14.480 --> 04:16.720
I wanted to have a stake in the game to be honest with you

04:17.680 --> 04:21.760
But it's not looking great. Like we don't have a lot of results. Yeah a little bit of a reality check

04:21.760 --> 04:26.000
There's no prototype. There's no Ubuntu based operating system prototype

04:26.000 --> 04:30.460
And there's not even a convincing demo of any of the games which will run on it

04:30.460 --> 04:30.800
Yeah

04:30.800 --> 04:37.240
The thing that kind of made news this week and Joey over at OMG Ubuntu caught it the estimated shipping date on their Indiegogo

04:37.600 --> 04:41.960
Campaign page has been revised from July of 2019

04:42.440 --> 04:44.440
Which is not too far away

04:44.780 --> 04:48.800
To now December of 2019. Mmm a little bit further away just a bit

04:48.800 --> 04:54.320
I mean you want the extra polish so that you can make a prototype, right? But that hardware is so pretty

04:54.320 --> 04:59.920
I hope it ships just because I can buy one secondhand. Yeah, it would look nice on the shelf for sure

04:59.920 --> 05:03.280
Yeah, I would I mean it would and that's why it's like if they get it, right

05:03.280 --> 05:06.080
I'd really love to see Linux be used for something like that

05:06.080 --> 05:12.540
So I had to throw in but we'll see well speaking of companies that have received their funding via crowdfunding and other mechanisms

05:13.200 --> 05:14.280
purism

05:14.280 --> 05:20.980
Kind of been wondering what is the state of the Liebman fives application stack? Oh, yeah, and how are they getting a lot of those applications?

05:21.200 --> 05:26.740
We got a little peek behind the curtain this week when Christopher Davis blogged about a new contract

05:26.740 --> 05:33.720
He's under to create a fractional scaling UI application for a matrix chat client. Is that right?

05:33.720 --> 05:36.940
Yeah, it's his existing application that is pretty neat

05:37.280 --> 05:42.280
and he writes over the past year or so I've been a regular contributor to fractal a

05:42.280 --> 05:44.280
matrix chat client for gnome

05:44.600 --> 05:50.400
My contributions have allowed me to take on a bigger role in the gnome community including maintainership of a few apps

05:50.400 --> 05:57.080
I'm pleased to announce that over the next week. I'll be working to make fractals UI adaptive for the Liebman fives launch

05:57.240 --> 06:01.880
There's a whole mix of terminology, which I'm kind of machine up here. So fractal is the applications name

06:01.920 --> 06:03.920
which is a matrix chat client and

06:04.440 --> 06:06.680
He is making it an adaptive UI

06:06.680 --> 06:12.800
Which is something that these gnome apps are doing where you can rescale them down from a desktop application to a phone sized application

06:13.000 --> 06:17.720
Much like the convergence apps were on you don't call it convergence. No, it's not it's it's adaptive

06:18.400 --> 06:21.080
And it's really kind of a neat trick

06:21.080 --> 06:26.080
He has videos embedded in his blog where it really is coming down pretty nice and it looks pretty sharp. Yeah, absolutely

06:26.400 --> 06:32.280
He also writes he's just he's just really excited that purism accepted this and he's gonna get to work on it and someday

06:32.280 --> 06:39.520
Hopefully soon actually run fractal on his phone and we might get you to so this is I think the real story and and I

06:39.920 --> 06:42.480
Think this is actually one of the more positive things

06:42.480 --> 06:48.320
I've seen about the Liebman fives development is they are paying the existing maintainer of this application

06:48.720 --> 06:50.720
To make it compatible for their platform

06:50.720 --> 06:50.800
Yeah

06:50.800 --> 06:56.160
Really working with some of the existing community and people that they want to bring into the community and something tells me this is probably

06:56.160 --> 06:58.160
Not the only case

06:58.160 --> 07:04.160
Now if that's how they're gonna get some of these apps onto the phone, I got nothing wrong. I see nothing wrong with I got

07:04.160 --> 07:06.160
no problem that is

07:06.320 --> 07:12.240
That's great. That's taking some of the crowdfunding money and some of the money that they've they've earned from selling their laptops and

07:12.800 --> 07:16.880
Redirecting that into the hands of current existing open source developers now

07:16.880 --> 07:20.200
This Christopher Davis character is gonna be able to maintain the other applications, too

07:20.200 --> 07:24.440
That aren't even related to this just because it's a viable thing for him now. Yeah, this is interesting

07:24.440 --> 07:30.520
Well, it's early days of trying to build in this way and in other communities. We probably wouldn't get to see any of this

07:30.560 --> 07:32.560
Yeah, it's nice to see a little peek behind the curtain

07:33.480 --> 07:39.200
And I haven't seen purism make a big stink about it. They haven't been really clear that they're doing this

07:39.200 --> 07:42.060
I think it's been implied, but I don't think they've been super clear. So it's neat to see this

07:43.040 --> 07:49.600
Okay, so there's there's some interesting news now. Let's talk about something. That's a little kind of sad these things happen

07:49.600 --> 07:55.680
It could result in a black hole ripping through our universe simply because

07:56.000 --> 08:00.360
Now the large hydrogen collider is going to be running an unsupported version of Linux

08:00.360 --> 08:04.000
I mean, there's a possible negative side to this but scientific Linux is

08:05.360 --> 08:08.600
Coming to an end. There'll be security maintenance, I believe

08:09.400 --> 08:10.680
67 right

08:10.680 --> 08:16.960
But as a distribution they're wrapping up scientific Linux which for those of you that don't know is it's essentially like a cent OS

08:16.960 --> 08:22.440
It's a it's a remix of upstream rail with the branding removed focused for the scientific community

08:22.440 --> 08:28.560
Yeah, you know, I haven't I don't use scientific links really but from my read on this

08:28.560 --> 08:32.400
It seemed like it kind of arose from a darker time early on maybe in the early

08:32.480 --> 08:35.200
2000s where like before before redhead had bought

08:35.200 --> 08:41.240
You know merged with sent us and all of that stuff and where like Linux wasn't quite as dominant even in the sciences

08:41.240 --> 08:45.200
And so it was it was hard to assemble a distribution something that had all the right tools

08:45.200 --> 08:52.720
And as anyone doing like machine learning type applications, some of those science frameworks are just ugly to compile and get going

08:52.720 --> 08:57.960
So I think for a long time scientific Linux could fit in that niche and just provide a standard baseline

08:57.960 --> 09:01.360
Especially if you're doing stuff like what Fermilab was doing high-energy physics

09:02.400 --> 09:08.240
Possibly one nice way to view this story is just that you know software availability is better these days

09:08.240 --> 09:10.160
So they can just run on the latest cent OS

09:10.160 --> 09:11.400
I think that's what it is

09:11.400 --> 09:17.480
And that is what they're going to do is they're just gonna migrate to sent us and I think it is exactly that the software

09:17.480 --> 09:24.200
Availability is there now. They don't have to have a boutique specialized distro that requires maintenance flat pack install black hole beautiful

09:24.960 --> 09:26.960
thing for real

09:27.920 --> 09:30.760
No, I thought it was an app that'd be good

09:30.760 --> 09:36.160
I'd be really good like just just large the whole large hydrogen collider tool set just one flat pack away

09:36.360 --> 09:41.320
My point was that their tool sets and tool chains now are available. Yeah other ways. Yep

09:41.320 --> 09:43.320
So hopefully some of the effort they've been just you know

09:43.320 --> 09:49.800
It takes a lot to just maintain the distribution even when it's you know, based on open-source centos red hat packages

09:50.000 --> 09:54.440
Hopefully that can just go into improving all the other applications people are using in science. I think so

09:54.440 --> 09:59.120
You got to be easy on me Alex. I'm my mind is a blur from this whole Linux fest stuff

09:59.120 --> 10:03.540
I was telling Brent earlier today. He's like Brent says how are you doing? And I said well

10:03.540 --> 10:08.320
I don't really know anymore because I've entered the blur phase. I know this happens every year

10:08.320 --> 10:14.200
There's a blur phase where it becomes such a storm of things that are happening concurrently

10:14.200 --> 10:15.840
You can't hold them all in your head

10:15.840 --> 10:16.040
No

10:16.040 --> 10:20.240
just sort of cascade in there they're in there for a minute and then they run away and something else replaces I actually kind of

10:20.240 --> 10:24.040
I kind of collapse a little bit and I like I become less confident. I become less capable

10:24.040 --> 10:26.760
I can do less things like I can only do one or two things and

10:27.160 --> 10:32.200
I really really lose sense of how we're doing but going into the blur zone before it really hit

10:32.200 --> 10:37.280
I knew we were positioned pretty well like we we've been planning for a while. This is the most organized we've ever been

10:37.280 --> 10:41.800
Yeah, right. So I feel felt feel like we were pretty good. But now I've I've lost all perspective

10:41.800 --> 10:47.240
I think that the it is it's very true by far the most organized we've ever been but the flip side of that is we're

10:47.240 --> 10:52.000
Also doing the most we've ever done. Yeah, like way more than the most we've ever done. We've got a booth

10:52.000 --> 10:57.080
We've got a we've got a dedicated room where people are giving talks both days. We've got tons of new swag

10:57.080 --> 11:00.340
We've got the new logo rollouts. We've got the largest crew we've ever had there

11:01.000 --> 11:04.180
We got people we got multiple people flying in from out of country

11:04.180 --> 11:09.840
Which is coordinating several different flights and runs to the airport. It's a hell of a thing. It's a hell of a thing

11:11.360 --> 11:15.160
Cheese and L are gonna be here pretty soon. Oh, that's exciting. It is exciting

11:15.160 --> 11:19.440
I'm looking forward to all that new swag that cheese has been working on. Mmm. Yeah. Oh, yeah

11:19.440 --> 11:23.160
Yeah, the shirts just arrived the shirts just arrived. Nice. So I just had to bring them all

11:23.160 --> 11:27.320
Did you see them stacked outside the studio boxes? Yeah, I'm glad they weren't dropped on us by a drone

11:27.960 --> 11:30.240
Yeah, they were like 30 pounds each I think

11:30.240 --> 11:37.080
I was looking at the tracking. L, what day do you get in? I get in tomorrow. Oh, wow. Is it bad you didn't know?

11:37.720 --> 11:43.460
No, I'm just losing track of everything. I just everybody gets in a different day. So I just asked repeatedly. It's my approach

11:44.080 --> 11:47.600
Need little nametags. Yeah, my name is L and I get on on Wednesday

11:47.600 --> 11:51.900
I wonder if she'll I wonder if Alan will be so Alan's gonna be in studio tomorrow recording BSD now

11:52.440 --> 11:54.880
That should be interesting L shows up and we're doing BSD now

11:54.880 --> 12:01.800
Well, let's update everybody on the Debian project leader election. Remember we first covered like nobody really stepped up

12:01.800 --> 12:03.560
Well that problem was solved

12:03.560 --> 12:07.640
And now we have ourselves a new winner and it looks like

12:08.440 --> 12:13.880
Well, it looks like if if any kind of process to get like this is gonna be run by geeks. They have charts

12:13.880 --> 12:18.400
They have flow diagram like a directed graph of explaining how this all works

12:18.760 --> 12:22.240
Statistics and formulas everywhere. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty impressive

12:22.240 --> 12:26.920
So our our new Debian is it DPL the Debian project leader is

12:27.680 --> 12:31.840
Done. Hold on here. Hold on now. Come on now. We got to do this, right? You ready Wes?

12:33.520 --> 12:37.400
Ladies and gentlemen, the new leader of the Debian project is

12:38.840 --> 12:40.760
Sam Hartman

12:40.760 --> 12:43.120
Congratulations him. It's kind of anticlimactic there, isn't it?

12:44.320 --> 12:46.800
There you go. There you go. Give them that and a little applause

12:46.800 --> 12:52.600
Welcome Sam Sam joined Debian back in 2000 and has been around for a long time

12:52.600 --> 12:54.880
He says when I'm not working on Debian or my day job

12:54.880 --> 13:00.240
I'm writing reading or learning to sale or just trying to live life to its fullest over the past year

13:00.240 --> 13:05.680
I've been learning how to DJ that ended up starting with my writing of my own DJ software because

13:06.120 --> 13:09.560
What's out there is too visual for a blind DJ to use easily?

13:10.040 --> 13:14.840
Interesting. It's not packaged for Debian yet because I need to get one patch upstream and write enough

13:14.840 --> 13:17.320
Documentation that someone would have a chance to actually use it

13:18.440 --> 13:23.120
Like that you can tell he's um intimately familiar with getting things going and packaged in Debian

13:23.640 --> 13:27.280
He also writes that one of my key goals as Debian project lead

13:27.280 --> 13:32.580
We'll be to make sure Debian is a community where we can be heard and where we have the opportunity to reach

13:32.880 --> 13:36.680
Understanding regardless of whether our ideas are chosen

13:36.680 --> 13:43.440
I will do this by personally participating in such mediation and recruiting others to these mediation efforts

13:43.440 --> 13:51.200
Eventually, I hope many of us will get better at seeking to understand and avoiding escalating discussions on our own

13:51.440 --> 13:53.760
You know on that same vein he's writing here

13:53.760 --> 13:58.000
Which I thought was interesting because well, there's been a bit of the hubbub about it and we covered it

13:58.080 --> 14:02.800
Mm-hmm. We've lost a number of developers because they were frustrated with our tools and processes

14:03.840 --> 14:08.000
One of the common complaints I've heard is that the wide variety of Debian workflows

14:08.000 --> 14:11.400
Just gets in the way when you want to contribute to a large number of packages

14:11.400 --> 14:17.360
I know that for myself and I find that our processes make it difficult enough for me to go fix an RC bug in a

14:17.360 --> 14:21.080
Package that I don't maintain that I'm just less likely to do so. Yeah

14:21.800 --> 14:24.520
Yeah, I'm glad he's all I'm glad he's aware of the situation there

14:24.520 --> 14:24.960
Yeah

14:24.960 --> 14:30.480
I mean it seems like he's got a decent read here on on what the Debian community has been talking about and that's a good

14:30.480 --> 14:34.280
Thing for a new lead and and part of his platform post here

14:34.280 --> 14:39.280
He wraps it up with I hope to find ways to reduce the stigma associated with bringing important issues to a wider audience

14:39.280 --> 14:44.080
I think it will always be the case that overriding a specific decision will come with a high price

14:44.880 --> 14:45.840
however

14:45.840 --> 14:48.440
Often when we do face a controversial decision

14:48.440 --> 14:54.180
We realize that there are broader policy questions that could be answered that would inform future decisions

14:55.120 --> 15:00.440
Once we get some distance from the original decision. I think answering these policy questions can be valuable

15:01.040 --> 15:06.040
Sometimes it will be useful to answer policy questions in a form broader than a group making the original decision

15:06.040 --> 15:12.000
Broadening the form like this should not be seen as a lack of trust in any of our teams or decision makers instead

15:12.000 --> 15:16.080
It is working together in a broad community. I like those words

15:16.160 --> 15:16.680
Yeah

15:16.680 --> 15:22.280
I think this is a good reminder to and perhaps why no one initially volunteered that first round in some ways

15:22.280 --> 15:24.680
This is something about thankless business position, right?

15:24.680 --> 15:29.880
I mean, it's a large complicated open source project a lot of people with opinions and here you are trying to herd them all together

15:29.880 --> 15:33.720
I think it's gonna be a little different though than it has in the past because classically when you ask

15:33.720 --> 15:38.560
Well, what does the Debian project leader do a lot of times? Oh, he travels around goes to conferences represents the project

15:38.960 --> 15:41.800
But he writes here in his platform. He's not gonna do as much of that

15:42.400 --> 15:48.200
He might try to outsource some of that to the community and he's gonna be participating directly in conversations

15:48.200 --> 15:50.960
I'm curious to see where Sam takes this or mr

15:50.960 --> 15:52.960
Harmon takes this the new Debian project leader

15:52.960 --> 15:58.040
So welcome and we have links in the show notes to more information about the vote anything in the data

15:58.040 --> 16:01.200
You thought was worth calling out. No, not really just that I like it

16:01.200 --> 16:06.880
I think it's all pretty well presented and interesting and I kind of want to spend more time digging into just how it all

16:06.880 --> 16:10.160
Works, you know, I have thought about doing like a week on Debian

16:10.960 --> 16:13.560
I'm wondering I'm wondering might keep an eye on things

16:14.200 --> 16:18.160
Might might consider that idea right now. I'm right now. I'm uh, I've got a new thing. I'm into

16:20.160 --> 16:26.400
Oh, it's ridiculous. I can't help myself. I feel like I'm slipping into old habits with distro hopping again

16:26.400 --> 16:30.120
I don't know what happened to me. I thought I'd finally fix this issue and yet here I am

16:30.120 --> 16:32.120
We'll talk about that in a moment. But first

16:33.480 --> 16:38.680
How about a little housekeeping? Oh, yeah, there's so many things to talk about so we're gonna go them go through them in

16:39.280 --> 16:41.280
a bit of a chronological order

16:41.600 --> 16:45.760
First off being this Friday this Friday on the live stream

16:46.040 --> 16:50.720
We'll have a very special Friday stream because we'll have a bunch of folks in studio

16:51.120 --> 16:55.320
It'll be in here fighting for mic time hanging out with us and chatting on the live stream. I

16:55.880 --> 16:57.880
Something special we're doing for a little while

16:57.880 --> 17:01.600
May or may not stick around after Linux fest. So come join us

17:02.360 --> 17:08.760
Friday 2 p.m. Pacific you can get that converted to Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar if you like this show

17:09.400 --> 17:13.560
Well the people from this show them and a bunch of the other crew get together and just hang out and chat

17:13.560 --> 17:20.400
But in a flavor all its own. I mean, it's Friday. May I ask where this will be jblive.tv, of course

17:20.400 --> 17:25.360
No, physically, I mean, I'm gonna be in Seattle on Friday. So it'll be at the studio. Yeah, come to the studio on Friday

17:25.360 --> 17:29.760
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that'd be awesome. Yes slip in get on the stream a little bit

17:29.760 --> 17:33.720
This should be a hell of a stream. It'll be quite the mic rotation important question

17:33.720 --> 17:38.680
Will there be any smoked meats smoking those meats? Well, we may have to we may have at this point. Yeah

17:38.680 --> 17:43.200
Yeah, yeah, we should probably Mike makes you hungry. There's gonna be a house full man

17:43.200 --> 17:44.600
It's gonna be a house full of people

17:44.600 --> 17:47.840
Yeah, it is it is Friday is gonna be crazy because then after that we head up to Linux fest

17:47.840 --> 17:53.120
Which is part two of the housekeeping so Linux fest Northwest is finally here

17:53.120 --> 17:58.040
It is this weekend if you're coming to our barbecue. We have over a hundred people now on the meetup what?

17:58.520 --> 18:02.800
You might want to bring a chair if you're local. We're gonna bring some chairs. I should remember to do that

18:02.800 --> 18:08.640
I'm local Emma and crew from system 76 are bringing us bringing some too and they're bringing a ton of meat

18:09.040 --> 18:12.320
We're gonna we're gonna be feeding a lot of people cooking outside the lady jupes

18:13.280 --> 18:14.600
that'll be

18:14.600 --> 18:19.720
Saturday after Linux fest Northwest and if you are looking to carpool or whatnot up from ctac

18:19.720 --> 18:23.320
Jupiter broadcasting comm slash Linux fest as our telegram group

18:23.320 --> 18:25.760
You can go there and coordinate with peeps or if you just want to know what's going on

18:25.760 --> 18:28.280
What's the fest has started? That's where we'll be chatting with people

18:29.240 --> 18:31.240
So go check that out then

18:32.040 --> 18:37.560
After that, it's Red Hat summit May 7th through the 9th in Boston cheese

18:37.960 --> 18:43.240
Wes and myself are going to Red Hat summit. So if you're in the Boston area, you're going to that summit

18:43.240 --> 18:47.720
Let us know tweet us come hang out. Oh, yeah, it'll be fun. I should be really good

18:47.720 --> 18:51.360
We'll just be there for a few days in and out getting all the Red Hat we can handle

18:51.360 --> 18:54.520
Yeah, we're gonna get the low down get the scoop all that kind of stuff

18:54.520 --> 18:58.200
So check out Red Hat summit if you're going we'd love to see you there

18:58.200 --> 19:02.120
But if you're not going to have summit, maybe just maybe you're going to Docker con

19:03.120 --> 19:07.460
Like Wes and L. Look at you. That's just out. I was like Wes is coming. Oh

19:08.080 --> 19:14.460
Kubica's what Wes is going to that's right. Okay. Oh, right, right. This one is in California, isn't it? Oh, San Francisco

19:14.460 --> 19:18.620
There you go. So go say hi to L. If you're going to Docker con in San Francisco

19:19.140 --> 19:21.420
You get maybe she might maybe have some swag. Oh

19:21.980 --> 19:25.700
It's in route. I'll make sure to steal some if I don't bring it down. Yeah

19:26.020 --> 19:31.100
Yeah, we'll send you with some swag either way, but we may have very special swag for doctor extra special

19:31.100 --> 19:36.140
Yeah, hopefully go find out. Yeah, hopefully we'll see we'll see depends if the delivery gods

19:36.940 --> 19:40.580
If they cooperate with us and then last but not least

19:40.580 --> 19:47.400

All right that I believe that's all the housekeeping. Yeah, that's it. Let's do it

20:19.060 --> 20:23.940
All right that way by the way that track there that we're laying down Joe Rez original no way really

20:23.940 --> 20:26.460
Yeah, I was really enjoying it. If he doesn't want people to know that you can cut that out

20:27.420 --> 20:29.420
It's all on you Joe

20:29.740 --> 20:31.980
All right. So I got a confession to make

20:32.700 --> 20:35.260
I've been a real jackass. I I

20:36.180 --> 20:37.900
This year has been a rough one for me

20:37.900 --> 20:41.060
I've had a lot of I've had a lot of eat my hat moments on the show this year

20:41.060 --> 20:45.140
And this is just another one of them, but I got to be honest. I got to come clean

20:50.100 --> 20:52.180
Man I fucking love XFCE I

20:53.300 --> 20:55.060
Love it

20:55.060 --> 20:59.420
Love it. I am I I love it so much

20:59.420 --> 21:02.540
Have you ever experienced something where you're so happy and excited about it?

21:02.540 --> 21:06.780
Like when you go to bed like your mind is just racing you're so excited like you're just thinking about all the possibilities

21:06.780 --> 21:13.020
That was me with like a hard high school crush on XFCE right now straight up straight up XFCE

21:13.020 --> 21:14.100
Are you kidding me?

21:14.100 --> 21:21.860
I'm not kidding and I I have been the biggest naysayer because I have this whole been there done that mentality with

21:22.300 --> 21:29.020
with XFCE and the whole like Windows 2000 kind of desktop paradigm and you moved on you were in the new world of the

21:29.020 --> 21:31.020
Linux desktop. Yeah, and

21:31.520 --> 21:36.660
You know XFC was for Luddites and guys like Joe Joe is listening to this, you know

21:36.660 --> 21:39.540
Oh, he already knows he already knows

21:41.180 --> 21:41.780
You know

21:41.780 --> 21:47.940
I really started it really started when I went back to gnome shell on 1904 and the performance was a lot better

21:48.180 --> 21:54.640
But I was still having issues with my two vertical ASUS 27 inch monitors and my built-in laptop screen

21:54.640 --> 21:58.280
I was trying to find a window windowing environment a desktop environment that

21:59.560 --> 22:04.440
Would work properly with my screens and plasma got pretty close, but it had issues sometimes

22:04.440 --> 22:10.800
Gnome could get one screen but not both screens working and I came across XFCE just in you know

22:10.800 --> 22:15.160
Cuz Joe kept you know, just in the back of my mind, you know kept telling me try it. Try it. Try it. Try it and

22:16.160 --> 22:18.160
I decided to give it a go

22:18.240 --> 22:23.820
It was like getting a brand new computer where it was like taking your own machine that you've had for a long time taking out

22:23.820 --> 22:29.320
a spinning rest drive and putting like an MV and MV and Ian and MV me in and

22:29.320 --> 22:35.480
Or an SSD and and then in doing a fresh install on that SSD and just getting incredible performance

22:36.320 --> 22:37.920
Literally felt like that

22:37.920 --> 22:44.700
And what I did is I I've I've taken I started with taking a couple of my 1804 installs that are running

22:45.520 --> 22:46.880
Kubuntu

22:46.880 --> 22:51.920
And plasma desktop, right? You just switch those over and just install those into desktop meta package

22:51.920 --> 22:54.600
So it was the same install and yet I noticed

22:55.200 --> 22:57.200
significant application load time differences

22:57.200 --> 23:04.620
Windows would move around the screen faster the whole like using the Firefox and Chrome felt

23:05.220 --> 23:10.140
Significantly faster and I'm not alone Jason Evangelo from choose Linux the writer over at Forbes

23:10.820 --> 23:16.140
He's he just please he just posted an article on the 17th. He and I same trajectory recently

23:17.500 --> 23:21.260
Completely completely just connected the common. There is a common factor. Yeah, and

23:21.260 --> 23:27.120
Jason writes. I can't believe I'm writing this Linux article about loving the XFCE desktop environment

23:28.120 --> 23:31.600
And he writes in here every time I looked at screenshots of the XFCE

23:32.000 --> 23:37.560
Even from the official website. It reminded me of something from the days of Windows 2000 gray and blue

23:38.300 --> 23:42.200
Uninteresting which I agree like the project does not put their best foot forward

23:42.200 --> 23:46.320
You know, if you just install the stock stuff, it's pretty dated. It does it does

23:46.320 --> 23:50.600
He says he says when he uses XFCE and drags windows across the screen

23:50.600 --> 23:55.920
It feels like you're using a monitor with AMD FreeSync like it feels like you're using a hundred and twenty Hertz monitor

23:56.280 --> 23:57.600
I

23:57.600 --> 24:03.200
Have I have like grabbed a tab off of Chrome and gone to take it to my third monitor and I have the tab is ripped

24:03.200 --> 24:07.560
Off and moved across the screen so fast that I thought I must have missed grabbed and just grabbed the title bar of the entire

24:07.560 --> 24:09.560
Browser it moved it is it is

24:10.160 --> 24:13.640
Voraciously fast. It is addictingly fast. It is a

24:14.400 --> 24:16.760
Different computer now and so I thought okay

24:16.760 --> 24:23.540
well if this if this is what it feels like when I load sort of a and a good implementation but not with the

24:23.540 --> 24:28.400
Lot of the the youtubers consider peak XFCE if you look around on YouTube

24:28.840 --> 24:30.760
Everybody says it's man jero

24:30.760 --> 24:35.800
You got to use man jero XFCE edition. If you look at Linus link tech tips there in their recent video

24:35.800 --> 24:41.040
They're using man jero for their virtualized Mac machine when you look at the latest video from Wendell

24:41.040 --> 24:43.360
He's talking about Linux gaming man jero

24:43.360 --> 24:49.640
Everybody it's man jero and pop OS right now is what everybody loves in the gaming space and I thought okay

24:49.640 --> 24:54.320
Well, let's give since I since I'm not interested in gnome shell pop OS is fine, but I'm not interested in gnome show

24:54.320 --> 24:55.880
Let's give man jero a kill

24:55.880 --> 25:00.480
so I downloaded man jero XFCE edition and it was

25:01.200 --> 25:07.920
Exactly what I expected in that the installer was a bit of a hot mess crashed on me once really see I was gonna say

25:07.920 --> 25:12.440
I was really impressed with the installer and had a great time not bad. It couldn't partition my disk

25:12.440 --> 25:17.080
So I did love the partitioner and I loved because I was installing it in a weird West way

25:17.080 --> 25:19.840
Uh-huh that let me just easily skip installing a bootloader at all

25:19.840 --> 25:23.380
I thought it was a dream one of the best Linux installation experiences

25:23.380 --> 25:23.960
I've had in a while

25:23.960 --> 25:26.980
So I didn't mind the look of the installer or the functionality of the installer

25:26.980 --> 25:29.320
but I had two issues number one is

25:29.960 --> 25:35.160
I think this is and maybe remember one cause number two when I was doing the disk partitioning

25:35.160 --> 25:36.960
I decided you know what? I want to hibernate

25:36.960 --> 25:42.520
I'm gonna go ahead and have a swap file when I chose swap file the installer crashed just completely dumped out on me

25:42.520 --> 25:48.580
and then after that it couldn't partition the disk and I think because maybe the partition table was thus in use by the

25:48.920 --> 25:54.940
Kernel at that point and so I had to use the command-line installer to go wipe out the partitions

25:55.560 --> 25:59.680
Reboot and then I could use the installer and after that point it was fine

26:00.240 --> 26:03.640
but you're right it is otherwise a good set of features and

26:03.640 --> 26:07.640
Once it loads up the XFCE desktop is nice

26:07.640 --> 26:13.680
It's got a bar at the bottom really good set of the themes nice launcher. Everything's really clean

26:13.680 --> 26:15.120
Yeah, I don't think it's be the style

26:15.120 --> 26:20.440
I would I would settle on or keep for my own personal aesthetic choice, but it felt very consistent even just from the start

26:20.440 --> 26:22.440
They say it's a lightweight desktop

26:23.120 --> 26:29.520
And it is it is remarkably lightweight. And here's what here's what I realized it isn't I ended up

26:30.080 --> 26:32.480
enjoying my stay with mangero, but I just went back to

26:32.480 --> 26:34.280
my

26:34.280 --> 26:36.820
1804 installs with this Ubuntu desktop because

26:38.240 --> 26:44.020
XFCE is XFCE and it's in a way because it's not like gnome shell where

26:44.760 --> 26:50.360
Fedora has a slightly different implementation than Ubuntu does and they have slightly different patch set all these vendor patch sets

26:50.360 --> 26:53.760
But it's very current right and it's like you got to get the latest version of

26:54.000 --> 26:58.400
Fedora or listen to Linux podcast to find out that there's these new changes you might be missing right

26:58.400 --> 27:05.360
But if you get 1804 or 1904 or you get mangero or you use straight arch or whatever

27:05.400 --> 27:08.880
You're kind of just getting the same XFCE that's available for all of them

27:08.880 --> 27:13.960
And what's what I think makes XFCE a better desktop environment for me possibly than plasma

27:13.960 --> 27:19.280
Although plasma still has been great. I'm curious about this because I mean we're running here. It's been fun. It's powerful

27:19.280 --> 27:24.740
Yeah, what I think I prefer about XFCE is they're trying to solve a smaller problem domain

27:24.740 --> 27:28.940
There's they're not trying to make this entire comprehensive

27:29.900 --> 27:33.020
Platform they are making a desktop environment

27:33.020 --> 27:40.540
That is a minimal implementation and the end result is less things break things are faster cleaner

27:41.100 --> 27:48.940
Simpler and more straightforward for the user and I can I can I can conceptualize how the XFCE desktop is put together

27:48.940 --> 27:52.060
I can't really fully wrap my head around though

27:52.060 --> 27:58.580
I spent I'm sure if I spent more time, but I don't really fully understand all of the components the way the KIO slaves

27:58.580 --> 28:02.300
Were whatever if they're even there anymore like I don't know how any of that works really in plasma

28:02.300 --> 28:05.420
but with XFCE I can clearly conceptualize how this works and

28:05.700 --> 28:10.740
I still get to ride the wave of modern GTK apps that are sort of the peak

28:10.740 --> 28:15.100
I think of UI design and features that are shipping for gnome shell and

28:15.500 --> 28:18.980
They still look great at home on my XFCE desktop

28:18.980 --> 28:24.140
Have you not found any compromises because knowing you I mean you also spend some time on other platforms

28:24.140 --> 28:27.940
Let's say that that are known to look nice and be visually polished

28:27.940 --> 28:32.740
And I think you're hitting on something with with plasma and gnome. They're like our there are flagships, right?

28:32.740 --> 28:36.340
There aren't there are philosophies that we're projecting about how Linux can do desktops

28:36.340 --> 28:38.580
I mean there are many of them, but they are the prominent one, right?

28:39.060 --> 28:44.220
And because of that they've you know, they've tried to make themselves look nice. Do you yes

28:44.220 --> 28:46.460
I like I get that you want things to be snappy

28:46.460 --> 28:49.940
But how many times you're really opening an app, you know, like I start my computer

28:49.940 --> 28:53.140
I launch Chrome and a few electron apps. That's it. I don't think about it

28:53.140 --> 28:56.020
so the electron apps I noticed the least difference, but I

28:56.720 --> 29:04.660
Feel consistently like all of the native applications like Chrome and Firefox and the terminal and the file manager. Holy crap the file manager are

29:06.020 --> 29:13.260
Consistently faster like them somehow I the menus open faster the web pages render faster the applications

29:13.260 --> 29:19.780
Launch faster they show up on screen faster. I don't know why maybe maybe because they're not going through some sort of 3d rendering pipeline

29:19.780 --> 29:21.260
I don't know what it is in the way

29:21.260 --> 29:27.620
but so the the the end result is the consistent use of the desktop even once things are loaded still feels faster and

29:27.860 --> 29:33.500
More memories left over for my other things that I want to do. So there's those things but I have had to make

29:34.260 --> 29:36.960
modifications to make the sucker work for me

29:38.180 --> 29:41.740
Number one thing I had to do is I went and got you launcher

29:41.740 --> 29:46.860
Which I think is a very good launcher. If you guys are looking for a nice desktop launcher, check out you launcher

29:47.820 --> 29:52.540
By default control space just brings up a little prompt and you can you can type in

29:52.980 --> 29:59.380
Terminal commands directories or just the name of applications hit enter and they launch. It's got some nice auto film reminds me a lot of spotlight

29:59.380 --> 30:06.700
Yes, or Alfred. Yeah, Alfred or gnome do it's a more modern version of gnome do those things quick silver is another one

30:06.700 --> 30:13.380
I was a little disappointed just running it on plasma and I kind of still like the built-in plasma launcher more

30:13.380 --> 30:17.340
I did a better job of finding the right things that I wanted krunner is better in plasma

30:17.340 --> 30:20.860
but but you launchers nice. Yeah, you launchers great on XFC super quick and

30:21.860 --> 30:25.140
Really easy to get installed. So I once I got a launcher

30:25.140 --> 30:29.420
I like the whisker menu, but I needed a quicker launcher that just was a keystroke away

30:29.420 --> 30:31.420
I had to make that fix

30:31.420 --> 30:38.220
Another way to make XFC II a little more pleasing to me visually was I installed the arc theme and I use the art

30:38.220 --> 30:44.100
I think it just looks great. It just it I I should have brought it down here for you

30:45.260 --> 30:49.340
It looks just I think it looks just as good as the dome shell Wow

30:49.340 --> 30:53.220
I mean it and I've got a nice transparent panel launcher that I think looks really good

30:53.220 --> 30:56.740
I've got all the applets that I want right there in the thing. It's

30:56.740 --> 31:02.140
It's just like yes, I was like I do really like some of the XFCE suite of applications

31:02.140 --> 31:06.340
Do you like you mentioned like thunder? Great. Yeah, great XFCE terminal mouse pads good. Yeah

31:06.940 --> 31:13.420
So I installed the arc dark theme and then I installed the system 76 pop icons. So I'm using pop icons

31:13.420 --> 31:15.420
Which give it a modern?

31:16.360 --> 31:19.220
Trendy look would you say they make it pop? They can make it pop

31:19.220 --> 31:24.240
So and there's you know system 76 makes the pop theme available for free up on their github

31:24.240 --> 31:29.440
So you can just go grab it. So I got that and then then it was sort of like the edge case stuff

31:30.020 --> 31:32.540
And I think maybe this is because I didn't install

31:33.100 --> 31:36.740
Like zubuntu from the ISO. I just did the zubuntu meta package

31:36.740 --> 31:41.780
Yeah, so it's still technically a kaboom to install too. So I got plasma on there still so I could always bail

31:41.780 --> 31:47.740
But what I'm wondering is maybe I didn't get like my notification stuff set up right for the XFCE desktop

31:47.740 --> 31:52.100
I started having this issue where slack would lock up and

31:52.100 --> 31:57.360
And then I just essentially would get bored and kill the process and relaunch slack and the respond to the message

31:57.360 --> 31:59.740
Yeah, then a few more a few minutes later would lock up again

31:59.740 --> 32:02.380
And I'm like looking around trying to figure out what's going on

32:02.380 --> 32:06.180
I did have my machine rendering on a massive project which I'll talk about here in a minute

32:06.180 --> 32:09.860
But I thought maybe that was the cause of it. Maybe I was just running out of resources, right?

32:09.860 --> 32:12.180
I got a ton of RAM. I got a ton of disk. That's not it

32:12.180 --> 32:14.420
Now my desktop doesn't use any memory. So it wasn't that and

32:15.180 --> 32:20.080
It just kept happening for a day. And so this morning I'm looking around I'm looking around. I'm like, you know what it is

32:20.080 --> 32:23.180
It's every time I get a message and a notification

32:24.060 --> 32:26.940
Comes up would come up my application freezes

32:27.620 --> 32:32.640
When I discovered is there wasn't a notification demon running in the background of my XFCE desktop

32:32.640 --> 32:38.580
That was taking these notifications from applications and for whatever reason electron apps just respond by locking up because you know garbage

32:38.900 --> 32:42.440
So I installed dunst d-u-n-s-t. It's a lightweight

32:43.240 --> 32:49.320
Notification Damon which works with most desktop environments. It's very customizable. It's not dependent on any particular tool kit

32:49.320 --> 32:52.300
It takes very little memory and it just now receives

32:52.300 --> 32:57.740
I think it's a debus client or something receives those messages and displays them and now my slack client doesn't lock up

32:57.740 --> 33:02.340
So I saw that problem and it makes me think you're already learning about some of the pieces of the modern death

33:02.340 --> 33:08.300
Yeah, which is good, but I'm curious too. I think we experienced this yesterday troubleshooting a totally different Linux related thing

33:08.780 --> 33:13.360
The flip side of that is it kind of just didn't work right like you had to dive in in plasma

33:13.420 --> 33:17.720
Probably wouldn't been a problem. Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't I've never had that issue

33:17.720 --> 33:22.480
And I'm you know if I'd be surprised if I run into more things like that. It's possible

33:22.480 --> 33:23.320
I suppose yeah

33:23.320 --> 33:27.720
I guess that is that's the point right is is how many one or two for an experienced Linux user who wants a

33:28.120 --> 33:31.000
Optimized desktop not a big deal. I'm also I'm

33:32.360 --> 33:33.400
Unfortunately

33:33.400 --> 33:40.160
Not getting a perfect hit rate on my monitor still so all the monitors light up, which is great

33:40.680 --> 33:41.640
but

33:41.640 --> 33:44.540
Sometimes it like reverses the primary and like it makes

33:44.540 --> 33:50.640
They like I have two verticals and now what I've done is I have two vertical 27s the Asus 27 monitors

33:50.640 --> 33:51.740
Which are 2k monitors?

33:51.740 --> 33:57.400
They're just I think one of the best desktop monitors for Linux because it's that sweet spot of a nice wide

33:57.500 --> 34:00.320
High resolution screen, but it's not high DPI. Okay, right?

34:00.320 --> 34:04.080
Yep, and then I so then I bought a third one and I put that right smack dab in the middle

34:04.080 --> 34:09.760
So now I've got three 27 inch Asus monitors to a vertical. It's great. It's really great

34:09.760 --> 34:14.760
But sometimes it moves my desktop around to like the vertical screen and so everything sideways

34:14.760 --> 34:19.240
And so I don't know if it's the order in which I have them plugged into the video card to the display ports or what?

34:19.240 --> 34:25.440
So anybody in the audience has had that issue where you you wake your XFCE desktop up from sleep and all of the monitors

34:25.440 --> 34:27.980
Have rejumbled themselves like back in the day

34:27.980 --> 34:30.880
I would just go like write a custom XOR config and I think that would solve it

34:30.880 --> 34:33.120
But now I don't even have an XOR file. So I

34:33.840 --> 34:37.360
Had that I had some daisy chain displays for all it also had three screens

34:37.360 --> 34:44.000
Mine was the reverse right to regular and then one rotated and I was always using a R&R. Okay. Yeah

34:44.480 --> 34:50.880
And I'll just generate you some X render sort of commands save a little script. You can make it launch that start

34:50.880 --> 34:55.280
So sometimes it would you know, just have that as I log in it just sets it. Yeah, that's a great idea

34:55.360 --> 34:59.840
Yeah, great great tip Wes. I use it all the time a decent workaround at least

34:59.880 --> 35:03.360
Okay, you throw a link to that in the show notes, you know the cheese

35:03.360 --> 35:10.040
You're also a man Jaro user and you run an XFCE, right? Yep, and on a lot of other distros

35:10.320 --> 35:12.800
Actually, I've had to use the X R&R

35:14.320 --> 35:20.840
For it's a Dell and spirit on I think it's like a 3000 series a little 11.6 inch two-in-one

35:21.720 --> 35:25.800
But yeah, because the screen would be rotated because it's a touchscreen as well

35:25.800 --> 35:28.460
So the screen would be rotated on a lot of distros out of the box

35:28.460 --> 35:35.680
Ah, so but no, I mean man Jaro dude out of the box X XFC has worked no problems

35:36.820 --> 35:42.180
You know if I flip if I flip it into tablet mode keyboard, you know is disconnected

35:42.660 --> 35:46.740
Everything works fine there. So I haven't had any problems with it. Obviously not the best

35:47.300 --> 35:49.300
touch interface, but

35:49.700 --> 35:52.000
You could get some work done with it for sure

35:52.180 --> 35:56.880
What do you think about those tools that manager makes available like the the tool to install different drivers?

35:56.880 --> 36:02.420
Like it's easy to switch between Intel drivers Nvidia drivers or bumblebee. Like have you played around some of that stuff?

36:03.060 --> 36:05.380
Yeah a little bit. I've also played with

36:06.580 --> 36:10.220
Just messing around with Steam because it comes right all out of the box

36:10.220 --> 36:16.080
And so if you're doing that and you're you know working with a little machine like this with integrated graphics

36:16.080 --> 36:19.920
I mean it works flawlessly man. I was able to jump on and pull down

36:19.920 --> 36:22.940
I think it was faster than light and play a little bit of that

36:22.940 --> 36:29.600
No problem was impressed with how different it had been ages since I'd used manager because mostly I just you know

36:30.080 --> 36:35.880
Regular arch gap and how different it feels from regular arch. Yes feels almost like a real stable

36:35.880 --> 36:39.440
It's on this row and the weird part of us just having 1904 out

36:39.920 --> 36:44.800
That that was a newer kernel than what I got when I installed one jar. So it's just like a what's happening here?

36:44.800 --> 36:48.200
Yeah, that is impressive how different it feels, you know, the ISO has all the stuff

36:48.200 --> 36:54.280
It just dumps it right on the disk and it's still like it's still doing those sort of like gray zone thing like you can just

36:54.840 --> 36:59.680
Choose the non-free driver right there at boot and just start right out of the box with the non-free stuff

36:59.680 --> 37:03.880
No problem have at it Haas. They are clearly thinking about you know, it's a it's a cohesive experience

37:04.200 --> 37:06.920
And it's the distro of choice in all of these new

37:07.680 --> 37:10.960
Linux gaming videos from Linus tech tips and

37:11.960 --> 37:14.680
What's the other one Wendell? Yeah them and pop OS

37:14.680 --> 37:18.320
It's like these these two distros are standing out in the gaming community

37:19.560 --> 37:22.600
Solace almost had that really it was for a hot minute

37:23.360 --> 37:27.800
But they it kind of proved it out and then you know, these other ones came along and executed it

37:27.800 --> 37:30.640
Yeah, well, and I'll agree with Wes in that it

37:31.480 --> 37:34.560
Definitely feels it feels more stable

37:35.520 --> 37:38.440
of an arch just based distribution

37:39.000 --> 37:40.160
I don't know

37:40.160 --> 37:46.240
I mean, I've had no problems with any updates breaking anything having to go back and tinker with anything just out of the box

37:46.280 --> 37:48.000
Everything's worked

37:48.000 --> 37:51.600
And and you know, I get the latest and greatest for the most part

37:52.760 --> 38:00.280
to you know, which which isn't really a big deal as far as graphics drivers go for this machine with integrated graphics, but

38:01.360 --> 38:05.120
For for those desktop rigs out there running it. I think they'd find benefit

38:05.120 --> 38:10.760
At just the pace at which it's updated. I will say it was really nice to be an arch again for a bit

38:10.760 --> 38:12.760
I still on the ThinkPad. I left it on

38:12.760 --> 38:16.720
I think I'm gonna run it on the ThinkPad for a while. I just haven't Pac-man right at your fingertips

38:16.720 --> 38:20.200
So fast good. It's so good. It's so good all my other rigs

38:20.200 --> 38:24.120
I'm gonna keep on Ubuntu 1804 and just put Zubuntu desktop packages on them because it's

38:24.960 --> 38:30.700
They're all working fine. Like 1804 is proving out to me to be a really good solid super solid LTS

38:30.700 --> 38:37.220
Mm-hmm, like getting it's getting that machine up there reset up on Zubuntu and going to get some of these things

38:37.220 --> 38:40.380
You know, it's the software is everybody makes a package for it

38:40.660 --> 38:45.060
Everybody there's a package always available and especially when you're on the 1804 LTS

38:45.060 --> 38:49.700
Yeah, it's a PPA or even just an in GitHub right like the build depths. Well, they're the Debian packages

38:49.700 --> 38:53.180
So that 1804 build is is really quite appealing

38:53.180 --> 38:57.860
I've just switched my main server from Debian over to Ubuntu 1804

38:57.860 --> 39:01.660
Simply because it has ZFS compiled in hmm

39:01.660 --> 39:06.500
It's it's better than that DKMS stuff and I'm having a the gnome UI

39:06.700 --> 39:11.560
I can just remote in and use is it's actually kind of nice sometimes

39:13.340 --> 39:15.860
Yeah, so guys aren't ever supposed to admit that though

39:18.900 --> 39:20.580
Yeah, don't worry nobody will hear you

39:20.580 --> 39:21.100
You know

39:21.100 --> 39:25.560
So now that now that Joe has gotten me and now that Joe has gotten Jason

39:25.560 --> 39:31.280
The next target on his list is gonna be L. Oh, you know it. Yeah. Oh, what's your current Linux desktop setup?

39:31.280 --> 39:33.400
I was sitting here thinking that exact same thing

39:33.400 --> 39:38.040
I'm like, I'm gonna blame Joe for this, but I'm running pop OS right now, and I don't want to leave

39:38.040 --> 39:43.360
Oh, that's right. In fact, you have the successful upgrade to 1904 last week. Yeah, everything went so smooth

39:43.360 --> 39:48.800
I haven't had an issue with anything including all of the tools that we use like everything has just worked

39:49.320 --> 39:53.640
Mmm, that is a heart. Well, then I'd say stick with it. I I'd say stick with it

39:53.640 --> 39:59.080
If I was gonna I think right now I would like to try out if a gnome shell if I was gonna try out a gnome

39:59.080 --> 40:04.000
Shell implementation. I think it would probably be pop now. That'd be my next hop. I'd recommend it

40:04.000 --> 40:10.100
I give you three months though before Joe wins you over he got to me eventually. You'll get bored of stability, too

40:12.880 --> 40:15.920
Who wants that I hate to say it but I think he's right

40:15.920 --> 40:22.240
The way you talk about XFCE it sounds almost like a window manager without a desktop environment

40:22.240 --> 40:27.520
But that could be the next logical step. It really does get out of the way. So it's once it's up and going

40:29.000 --> 40:34.280
What's great about it is like Thunar for example is it's everything I love about Nautilus

40:34.280 --> 40:40.120
But faster and for me in my personal experience, it's network browsing works better

40:40.120 --> 40:44.200
So I was like just randomly decided, you know, I need to go back to my old laptop

40:44.200 --> 40:47.760
It's like just randomly decided, you know, I need to grab a file off of the computer down in the studio

40:48.120 --> 40:52.440
Go to the network section boom easy all listed right there. Would you want to SFTP in?

40:52.440 --> 40:57.760
Do you want a Samba in do you what do you want? Have at it? It also doesn't change its UI much nice CP though

40:57.760 --> 40:59.760
No, no, definitely not

40:59.840 --> 41:04.480
Don't get me going on that. Don't get me going people miss the reference. Go listen to Linux action news

41:05.360 --> 41:10.080
Episode 102. I think I was judging a book by its cover for a really long time now. Keep in mind

41:10.080 --> 41:16.160
I had been an XFCE user for many years back in the past because it was great for Linux terminals over project

41:16.960 --> 41:21.720
But I kind of looked at it from that same vantage point from many years ago

41:21.720 --> 41:26.280
I think the math in my head was the project moves slow the screenshots look like ass

41:26.760 --> 41:32.080
Ergo, I mean, I know I've been there done that. I don't need to revisit, you know, but I was wrong

41:32.080 --> 41:34.720
I just think it's a matter of time Chris before you're back home

41:35.320 --> 41:37.320
with name

41:37.320 --> 41:43.400
Do you ever try out some of the the i3s and the sways and the the window managers that don't have a full

41:43.560 --> 41:46.400
Desktop environment and that might be where I go next I suppose

41:46.960 --> 41:50.560
Because I've been doing kind of the same thing with that for a long time

41:51.000 --> 41:56.520
The only reason why I really haven't made that like a jump to like a week in i3 is

41:57.160 --> 42:03.160
I have been using a window desktop environment since the 80s. I've used different

42:03.160 --> 42:09.200
Graphical desktop environments that had multiple windows. And so I I grew up

42:10.600 --> 42:14.440
Like I instinctively when I sit down at a computer I arrange my windows in a stack

42:14.800 --> 42:21.160
I enjoy it and I mentally lay them out very visually the way I the way I the way I'm working and so

42:21.960 --> 42:28.320
For me being able to do that is is an efficiency booster and I feel like I would lose that if I went to something

42:28.320 --> 42:32.040
That arranged my windows for me, but I'd be willing to give it a go for a little while

42:32.040 --> 42:36.240
I tried out i3 for about two weeks six months ago and

42:36.880 --> 42:41.600
it required quite an investment of having a cheat sheet open next to me the whole time and

42:42.120 --> 42:45.200
it's an investment to learn all those commands and stuff, but

42:46.040 --> 42:48.040
It's fast, you know

42:48.040 --> 42:50.280
Like XFC's fastness

42:50.880 --> 42:58.160
i3 is probably up there with it and you might find that you once you've adopted the paradigm and depending it might not be

42:58.160 --> 43:02.200
I three might be a you know, a different tiling window manager that it gives you that control

43:02.800 --> 43:07.900
More so than other desktop because you know, they they acknowledge that people are picky about where their windows go

43:08.000 --> 43:10.760
It's for people who like to mess with computers

43:11.080 --> 43:17.120
Very nice, sir. And there are also static window managers that give you even more control. Okay. All right. All right

43:17.120 --> 43:22.080
I mean you guys you guys gotta let me hang out for a little bit. I could give me whiplash

43:22.080 --> 43:24.880
I'm moving around so much. I I think

43:24.880 --> 43:28.340
what what something about it is touching a

43:29.920 --> 43:31.640
Like a

43:31.640 --> 43:39.440
what what I felt like I unlocked was this sense of relief that I'm gonna be able to just use my computer to work now and

43:41.840 --> 43:45.400
That was so exciting to me like this, I'm not gonna have to screw with this now

43:45.400 --> 43:50.360
I'm just gonna use my computer to work and the fact that XFC you move so slow to me is

43:50.360 --> 43:56.240
Is kind of a nice thing because now I've got kind of a moving fluid base with frequently updated apps

43:56.240 --> 44:01.760
And then a desktop environment that takes quite a few years to really progress in any way

44:01.760 --> 44:05.380
That's gonna alter the way I work. So devil's advocate moment

44:06.120 --> 44:08.120
I've heard you make this pitch

44:08.120 --> 44:10.080
Numerous times over the years

44:10.080 --> 44:17.200
What happened to the iPad Pro or is this just augmenting it? I feel like the iPad pros role is more like communications

44:17.200 --> 44:20.760
I really am NOT crazy satisfied with

44:21.480 --> 44:26.880
Mail applications on Linux because we at Linux Academy use the Google Mail Suite the Google App Suite

44:27.720 --> 44:33.200
And I'm not a big fan of using Thunderbird or Kmail or mail spring for any of that kind of stuff

44:33.200 --> 44:37.320
I've tried them all and so what I'm doing right now is I pretty much do

44:39.000 --> 44:42.680
The majority of like the zoom calls and

44:42.680 --> 44:50.240
Slack meetings and emails on the iPad and the reason why is because I batch those things at certain times of the day when I'm

44:50.240 --> 44:52.000
Not on air anyways

44:52.000 --> 44:57.200
And then I use the desktop for like real work. That is like my more productive work

44:57.200 --> 45:01.920
I do have some of those applications like I have zoom installed on the desktop and I have slack installed on the desktop

45:01.920 --> 45:05.620
But that's like supplemental so that way if I need to open up a link or something on the desktop. I've got it

45:06.720 --> 45:09.180
And the mail is really the weakest spot in my opinion

45:09.180 --> 45:16.340
Because when you have the Google app integration you you really want something that works tightly with calendar invites and can look people up

45:16.340 --> 45:17.660
in the directory and

45:17.660 --> 45:20.060
It works well with doc links and stuff like that

45:20.060 --> 45:23.460
And that's where a lot of the desktop Linux application applications fall down

45:23.460 --> 45:29.700
And so I've either used wave box, which is an application that lets you have a bunch of different cloud accounts in one app

45:30.340 --> 45:36.420
Wimpy's talked about that before or I will use nata fire and I'll just natify Google Calendar and

45:36.980 --> 45:38.260
Google Mail

45:38.260 --> 45:42.060
For Linux Academy, and then I just have those as essentially desktop applications

45:42.060 --> 45:43.860
And it works, you know

45:43.860 --> 45:48.220
And the nice thing is both those apps work really well in a vertical layout so I can put them on

45:48.620 --> 45:55.380
My vertical monitor and then pretty easily see all the information. I need when you're talking about XFC

45:55.380 --> 45:57.380
I would also say that

45:58.280 --> 46:02.900
One of the good things about it is that it like you said earlier it gets out of your way

46:02.900 --> 46:08.900
so whenever you do want to add these other bits and pieces from the Linux ecosystem like a

46:09.260 --> 46:11.660
new launcher a new dock

46:12.900 --> 46:18.940
All the all of it seems to play nice together. Like you never really have an issue where just

46:19.660 --> 46:23.580
the theming is extremely broken on this one thing or

46:24.860 --> 46:31.740
That something won't play nice with XFC and that's I'd say that's one of the best advantages of using XFC

46:31.740 --> 46:37.060
Yeah, and to that point I was able to load up quake and I'm able to use the tilde key

46:37.060 --> 46:39.860
Which is my preferred key to to summon the quake terminal

46:40.460 --> 46:45.920
because nothing else is using that on XFC and control space is available for you launcher because

46:46.220 --> 46:49.360
Nothing else is using that on XFC because there's a again

46:49.360 --> 46:53.540
I think this is what's key about it is they're trying to solve a more limited set of problems

46:53.540 --> 46:57.060
it's a it's a smaller problem domain that XFC is trying to solve and

46:57.060 --> 47:03.220
And therefore what they've limited themselves to they can do really well. It's just simple and consistent. Yeah

47:03.980 --> 47:06.060
It's nice and it's exactly what I want

47:06.060 --> 47:12.900
and I think I'm gonna hang out here for a while and watch where gnome goes because there's the the development rate on gnome is just

47:13.580 --> 47:19.820
It's incredibly impressive and see where plasma shell goes because I think it's got some of the best technology out there in a desktop

47:19.900 --> 47:23.420
Honestly, you do seem a little refreshed though because I mean we have to talk about those things

47:23.420 --> 47:25.880
It's part of what we do here on the show in the network, right?

47:25.880 --> 47:30.680
But you you're off you're off the hype train you get to like just take a little break. You're not on the roller coaster

47:30.680 --> 47:34.440
You're watching it. I'm an observer of the two desktop environments now remove myself

47:34.440 --> 47:39.480
Like if they don't do something right or you know, we had this problem the other day here in the studio

47:39.480 --> 47:40.440
It's not a big deal

47:40.440 --> 47:47.400
But we had this problem the other day where for whatever reason plasma shell was using like 700 megs of RAM when you combine like

47:47.400 --> 47:53.800
All the different components. It was nearly a gig of RAM and we've got a rig here. That's got 64 gigs of RAM in it

47:53.800 --> 47:58.760
64 gigs of RAM and we had to reboot our OBS machine before Coder radio because

47:59.000 --> 48:01.500
100% of the RAM had been used up with the machine just sitting here

48:02.720 --> 48:06.280
That was less than ideal 64 gigs 100% used up

48:06.800 --> 48:11.220
So we had to reboot and you know, we can we can see like actually we're starting to have an issue, too

48:11.220 --> 48:15.320
We've already had 59 X runs. I bet you if I were to look at the memory usage

48:15.320 --> 48:18.080
It's starting to creep up right now. It's not too bad. It's not too bad

48:19.040 --> 48:21.040
Let's see

48:21.040 --> 48:26.100
You know, okay, we're using four gigs right now. That's not too bad. It's a little much but it's not bad and

48:26.820 --> 48:33.620
I guess I'm I'm I'm discovering as we've as we've learned really really how to work with the Linux audio stack

48:33.620 --> 48:38.500
As we've really learned like there's a couple of things that are a little odd about it that we have to compensate for

48:38.980 --> 48:41.420
some applications still use also and

48:41.900 --> 48:48.160
Then the also software will talk to the sound card and the stuff that's using pulse audio will be completely unaware of the changes

48:48.160 --> 48:54.580
the sound card is made say say you go from 48 Hertz to 44 Hertz or from 44 to 48 if you don't tell the

48:54.580 --> 48:56.580
Pulse applications that you've made that change

48:56.940 --> 49:00.780
They sound like Barry White or like a chipmunk depending on which direction it's gone

49:00.780 --> 49:05.060
And then we do too and we have no way of knowing because we haven't changed anything

49:05.060 --> 49:11.340
It's just there's two different audio stacks and one of them has talked to the card and hasn't told the other stack because they're completely unaware

49:11.540 --> 49:16.940
Interpreting the same data stream differently and that just happens and it happens to us frequently

49:16.940 --> 49:20.580
It was happening to us very often. It was a ritual we'd go through on the live stream

49:21.140 --> 49:26.820
and there's other strange things like when the system boots up it enumerates the sound cards and

49:26.820 --> 49:32.220
It assigns them sort of at the order that they were enumerated to the operating system by the motherboard

49:32.580 --> 49:35.440
Not by like a physical ID of the card

49:36.120 --> 49:38.120
So for some strange reason

49:38.340 --> 49:43.060
The motherboard which can happen were to enumerate the sound card devices in a different order

49:43.060 --> 49:48.780
Maybe they're USB devices that boot up in a different order for some reason one day or that whatever even if they're PCI devices

49:49.180 --> 49:55.740
they will get different IDs in the also level in the pulse audio level because it then inherits what also set and

49:56.300 --> 50:01.140
So you can actually have sound cards that are your in-and-out sound cards on a machine change

50:01.900 --> 50:07.600
day to day when you reboot the system because they will get different IDs in the system because they assign ID at the time the

50:07.600 --> 50:11.920
Motherboard enumerates them instead of like reading a device ID and saying okay, this is sound card one

50:11.920 --> 50:13.920
This is sound card two and it'll always shall be

50:14.140 --> 50:18.780
Doesn't do that. It just takes whatever the motherboard gives it. Okay, it's a sign now. Let's go

50:19.380 --> 50:23.860
Good to go and these are crazy weird things that when you add an additional

50:24.460 --> 50:29.700
Complicated desktop environment on top of it like plasma that also has its own audio stack phonon

50:29.700 --> 50:34.540
Which is then sitting on top of pulse which is then sitting on top of also which is then sitting on top of the driver

50:34.540 --> 50:36.540
stack which is then sitting on top of the hardware and

50:36.540 --> 50:40.880
And so with something like XFCE you essentially remove one of those layers

50:41.100 --> 50:43.660
You just have a simpler setup and I mean

50:43.660 --> 50:49.700
I think it's kind of just a turning the question on its head right it some people you might need a fuller richer desktop

50:49.700 --> 50:55.820
I think some of this exploration is just deciding like do I need those features and are they worth worth the cost because eventually if they

50:55.820 --> 50:58.740
Aren't working you're gonna have to debug them. There you go

50:58.740 --> 51:02.740
So I only have one last issue that I haven't solved yet that I would love to get the audience's help with

51:02.900 --> 51:05.340
It's a real it's a real humdinger speaking audio

51:05.340 --> 51:11.540
Everything plays audio just fine except for Firefox. I've got no audio in Firefox

51:12.180 --> 51:15.780
Don't know what it is. It's the strangest thing if VLC Chrome

51:17.140 --> 51:21.980
MPV audio is just fine. It's just in your zip on to install. Yeah coupon to turn

51:22.460 --> 51:30.020
Yeah, thanks. Otherwise working great, but no audio which in some respects is actually nice. Yeah, that's your silent breath

51:30.020 --> 51:32.760
Yeah, it is. It's like I never have to write that silence

51:32.760 --> 51:34.600
But

51:34.600 --> 51:37.280
Other times like I click a link and they're like, oh, yeah, right now

51:37.280 --> 51:41.360
I got good now I got a copy the link go open up Chrome and listen to it

51:41.360 --> 51:45.960
I don't know what the hell that's about speaking of audio issues, but I'm sure I'll solve it eventually

51:45.960 --> 51:50.280
And if anybody knows let me know at Chris la s. Alright, so before we go

51:51.280 --> 51:54.160
Man, that's a lot. I just dropped on you guys. I'd really like to know what you think

51:54.160 --> 51:59.440
I know I feel like I'm hopping again. I feel like I'm distro hopping again, but this one I'm pretty excited about

51:59.440 --> 52:02.520
I'm really still happy like these machines here in the studio

52:02.520 --> 52:06.480
I don't really see us going off of plasma anytime soon. It works fine

52:06.480 --> 52:11.640
I think we would switch out to XFCE if we had a reason to touch these machines and do a bunch of other stuff, right?

52:11.640 --> 52:18.780
So maybe next LTS will reconsider maybe or if we decide like, you know, we're gonna like I don't know spend some time like

52:19.400 --> 52:21.760
Restandardizing or if we were making some other large change

52:21.760 --> 52:25.520
I might consider because it's such an easy transition to go to XFCE

52:25.520 --> 52:31.600
but otherwise all the systems here in the studio, which is a good number of systems right now are all still running plasma shell and

52:31.680 --> 52:33.680
It's it's great. So I

52:33.760 --> 52:40.400
They're all getting pretty good. You know L's happy with pop OS and gnome shell plasma shell works great here. There's tons of great

52:40.400 --> 52:45.960
It's just XFCE is better than I was giving it credit and I feel like if you have been in my camp at all

52:46.200 --> 52:51.120
It's worth giving it a go if you want to see a pretty solid implementation man. Jero does have it

52:51.120 --> 52:55.920
I don't know if you need to run man. Jero though to run XFCE, but it's not a bad place to visit

52:55.920 --> 53:00.080
Might give you a template something to something to base your own. Yeah. Yeah and show you you know

53:00.080 --> 53:03.240
a more modern interpretation of a classic desktop paradigm and

53:04.280 --> 53:07.640
Yeah, I'm just really happy with it so far. I'm gonna stick with it for a bit. All right

53:08.280 --> 53:09.960
Pick times West pick times

53:09.960 --> 53:15.840
I have a disclaimer to make with this pick and I hate to even I hate to even have to have a pick where I

53:15.840 --> 53:17.840
Feel like I need to make a disclaimer

53:17.840 --> 53:21.320
But you could use this I suppose for

53:22.560 --> 53:24.560
nefarious purposes

53:24.640 --> 53:28.560
So don't well, I am a long time like since since

53:29.160 --> 53:35.280
Since forever audible subscriber. I really enjoy listening to audiobooks, especially when I'm driving, you know

53:35.280 --> 53:37.280
I do a lot of road trips and so audiobooks are great

53:37.920 --> 53:39.920
Hadeah my wife and I we share audiobooks

53:40.140 --> 53:44.920
we just love it just my preferred way to consume lots of information when traveling and

53:44.920 --> 53:49.120
It's a nice way to supplement since I don't get to read as much as I'd like

53:49.120 --> 53:52.580
I and I I tend to find certain stories even work better in audio

53:53.240 --> 53:57.520
But the biggest problem with audible books is they're in a proprietary

53:57.840 --> 54:05.240
DRM that is not playable on Linux or other free software devices. That's where open audible comes in. Oh

54:06.440 --> 54:10.480
Open audible org now. I am a longtime subscriber

54:10.480 --> 54:17.160
I own all these books and I will continue to be a subscriber. I'm just going to back up my collection with this legitimately

54:17.160 --> 54:22.680
I know people say that as a euphemism for stealing, but I am honestly using this as a backup. I'm backing them up to my

54:23.280 --> 54:26.920
Server and then just have I will have an awful something offline media

54:26.920 --> 54:30.080
So what open audible does and it is a clunky Java application

54:30.080 --> 54:33.840
I will warn you but god bless it if it isn't performing the Lord's work here

54:33.840 --> 54:40.880
It will download view and convert to mp3s. It will manage all of your audible.com content with their desktop front-end application

54:41.160 --> 54:47.400
It's kind of weird the way it works because you launch the application assuming you've got JVM running

54:48.240 --> 54:50.240
they're set up and

54:51.400 --> 54:56.720
You then go to the menu to browse audible and you log into audible through their like Java

54:57.120 --> 55:02.560
Browser implementation thing and then you sit there and tab through your audible library pages

55:02.560 --> 55:04.560
Which I have like 17

55:06.280 --> 55:09.120
And if you try to like set the sorting to 50 at a time

55:09.120 --> 55:13.160
It'll lock the application up eventually on about page 8 and then you got to start all over again

55:13.240 --> 55:18.080
So you got to keep it at the 20 and then you go through it page by page and as you go through it

55:18.080 --> 55:23.460
The application is basically ingesting the HTML. I ran it. I ran it from the terminal so I could actually watch

55:24.160 --> 55:30.360
It's just taking in the HTML stripping out the links and it is building your library locally in the application

55:30.360 --> 55:32.880
Once you've done this you can export the list

55:32.880 --> 55:36.920
So you don't ever have to do that again and as long as you properly exit the application

55:36.920 --> 55:40.780
It will save the list if the application crashes. It'll lose everything. It's added. So

55:41.640 --> 55:45.840
Avoid crashing as you can tell I had to crash a few times and by default

55:46.440 --> 55:52.360
When you click a title in there and you can also just by default tell to download everything it will download and then convert

55:52.360 --> 55:54.760
The entire audiobook to a high-quality mp3

55:55.240 --> 55:58.280
See that seems nice, right? Then you have that file you can take it with you

55:58.280 --> 56:03.360
Wherever you are plays on all your normal devices. Yeah, and that's it. That's pretty much it in a nutshell

56:03.480 --> 56:06.160
You can there's other various things you can do with it

56:06.400 --> 56:07.360
but for me

56:07.360 --> 56:12.720
It was just a way to get all of my audible books that I've never been able to access on my Linux desktop and I have

56:12.720 --> 56:18.400
Many occasions where I've been listening to an audiobook on the road and I get back to my desk and I just want to finish

56:18.400 --> 56:20.600
It up and I can't play it on my nice desktop speakers

56:21.480 --> 56:23.520
So hopefully this is all yeah, this is interesting

56:23.520 --> 56:27.160
I've kind of stayed away from audible just out of some of those very same concerns

56:27.160 --> 56:30.800
So I might I might have to reconsider now things have come and gone in the past

56:31.640 --> 56:33.720
So grab it while you can and again

56:33.720 --> 56:36.520
Please don't use this to like throw it up on a torrent side or something like that

56:36.520 --> 56:39.120
I I debated not even including this in the show

56:39.160 --> 56:44.320
But I decided since I know as a longtime desktop Linux user

56:44.320 --> 56:46.560
this is something I've struggled with for years and

56:47.200 --> 56:52.640
It was only made a bit better because they have a decent mobile app and that's where I do the majority of my listening

56:52.640 --> 56:58.240
But in the back of my mind have always wanted my own copy somewhere on a file system and so and I wanted to play

56:58.240 --> 57:01.680
Them on my own desktop. Mm-hmm, and I actually first started audible. I

57:02.800 --> 57:05.460
Got my audible subscription then I canceled it and in there

57:05.460 --> 57:11.480
I told them this because they don't support Linux and then when they released the mobile app even like the very early betas for Android

57:12.000 --> 57:16.240
I signed back up and I've been a user ever since so this is really nice to find

57:16.240 --> 57:20.080
I I my library is like 70 gigs of mp3 Wow

57:20.080 --> 57:23.280
It's a lot of books. It's a lot of books

57:24.000 --> 57:32.040
So I'll be I'll be tossing those on the old free NAS and then Wes found what looks like a really nice web UI

57:32.600 --> 57:38.160
For setting up wire guard VPNs a wire guard VPN GUI a West. Mmm. Yes, indeed

57:38.160 --> 57:43.640
I like the name too. Yeah over from the people at portal cloud. Looks like they run their own sort of VPS hosting

57:44.320 --> 57:49.520
Company and if you just want to you know, you're confused about wire guard or you just want to give it a shot

57:49.520 --> 57:55.120
The configs on the command line are admirably simple and easy to understand it as you've seen Chris

57:55.400 --> 58:00.700
But you know, that's not always enough especially as you're scaling, you know, maybe maybe you're supporting a small company

58:00.700 --> 58:03.860
You've got 30 different people that you're all you know trying to manage their stuff now

58:03.860 --> 58:09.460
I haven't used subspace yet. Although I do have it running. I just haven't integrated it into my system. So bear that in mind

58:10.000 --> 58:10.840
subspace

58:10.840 --> 58:15.580
It's nice to see this stuff taking off though because these are exactly the kind of supporting applications

58:15.580 --> 58:20.120
We need if we really want to see why our guard be as successful as I think we all hope it will be

58:20.120 --> 58:20.520
Yeah

58:20.520 --> 58:27.000
And this gives you a simple web UI that almost reminds me of the early UI of bit torrent sync where you go in you add

58:27.000 --> 58:30.640
A device right it does and you see all the different devices there

58:30.640 --> 58:35.600
you can delete and revoke their keys or you can create another one and like this would be perfect for the

58:36.040 --> 58:39.560
Wire guard machine that we have here in the studio to just to add a few of the staff's

58:40.240 --> 58:41.760
Yes

58:41.760 --> 58:48.480
Mm-hmm. And the way it works is it's a Docker image that assumes you have wire guard set up and running locally

58:48.480 --> 58:53.880
They also walk you through if you want to toss this on a VPS like a like a digital ocean droplet to you know

58:53.880 --> 58:58.320
Get a white your own custom wire. The nice thing is it's it should be really easy to test out

58:58.320 --> 58:59.560
Yeah, that's true

58:59.560 --> 59:04.920
Or you just throw if you have a wire guard set up on your own local machine and then you can deploy the Docker image

59:04.920 --> 59:08.440
And you're off to the races. It's pretty nice looking. I

59:08.440 --> 59:12.700
I really think we'll probably get the set up here pretty soon subspace

59:12.700 --> 59:17.120
Which is also just a great name for something like this and more power to wire guard

59:17.160 --> 59:18.880
Yeah, you know it also was neat about it

59:18.880 --> 59:26.020
Does hey it has integration with using let's encrypt right out of the box because of course it does so portal dot cloud is the company

59:26.020 --> 59:28.020
Huh? This is this like another

59:28.860 --> 59:32.420
Commercial wire guard hosted solution. No, I think they do

59:32.420 --> 59:40.940
Next generation open source hosting yeah look at that hmm add great open source cloud applications to your account in seconds I

59:41.740 --> 59:49.600
See yeah, they've got a couple other available open source apps like they got a simple blogging platform web analytics server stuff like that

59:49.600 --> 59:52.940
So I haven't tried any of these before but an interesting development

59:52.940 --> 59:55.580
I gotta say they look you know what guys if you listen get in touch

59:55.660 --> 01:00:02.340
They are they're really stressing data portability they free software is like bullet point number two on their site here

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:06.820
That's not bad. That is not bad. I love to see that kind of stuff anyways

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.940
But that's neither here nor there if you want to check out subspace

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.000
We'll have a link in the show notes

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.720
And you can go deploy your own wire guard gooey and get people added to your wire guard instance nice and easy-sneasy

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:19.660
Get to it all right there you have it now. Oh

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:26.340
Man, oh Alan Jude's gonna be here any minute now. Oh my goodness better prepare ourselves. Oh geez all right

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.340
We better get out of here

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:33.820
Linux fest is nigh if you're gonna be there come say hi meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for that event and future events

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:39.540
Love to see you there join us live next Tuesday for this show and join us live this Friday

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:42.320
If you're listening the week this came out for a hell of a live stream

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:47.740
Love to see you there anything else we need to plug um you know if you're gonna go over to our Jupiter broadcasting meet up

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:50.220
Meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting you should also stay tuned

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:54.660
Oh, I know L has been so hard at work with all kinds of exciting study groups

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:58.540
Yeah, command-line threat hunting very soon definitely do that all right see you back here

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.660
Yeah

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.180
Our next study group

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:40.580
Command-line threat hunting how to figure out if your box has been owned on the command line

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:46.540
How great is Tony right? Oh? He's amazing we have we've had we've had a little sneak peek at the material

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.900
Let's just say and we we know it's gonna be really good

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.740
I'm excited to get to watch the whole finished thing

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:56.340
Mm-hmm yeah, we got a little interview for Tony to run on the show here a little bit, too, so

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.900
Yeah, it's gonna be good all right

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:04.300
So guess what we have a couple of bits of housekeeping to get out of here in the post show to all right

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.560
You want to hear okay number one?

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:11.660
We got to get the title so JB titles calm everybody go boat and then number two something major happened this weekend

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.660
This is a historic event

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:19.900
Probably up there with Skynet as of this weekend April 2019

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.300
The cheese cloud has gone online

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:32.740
Yes, yes, so mr.. Bacon has set himself up a next cloud instance come here over here the cone of science

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:37.220
We don't want to share any details that might get your box bone, so just between you and me

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.740
Would you do did you do this on a droplet you do this?

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.620
root password, please

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:50.740
Mmm, it was a snap setting it up on oh, but on okay, but come on you see what I do

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:56.060
But I want to know setting it up the box is it a is it a droplet is it a physical machine is it a is

01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:59.480
It a raspberry pie. What are we working with here? It is it is a droplet

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:02.740
I just went that route region for years and

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.700
Jeez, I don't know everything

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:13.180
NYC okay all right, so it's an East Coaster I catch yeah, well I've got I've got I've got a couple of droplets

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:16.500
You know because they're just so ridiculously simple to 1804

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.220
Fedora ok 1804 base

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.620
1804 base

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.700
Basically just installed it with the snap

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.240
Setup was ridiculously simple

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:35.100
Went through set up with what is it next next cloud dot HTTPS? Oh? Yeah, so you got a cert on there

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:40.780
Yes, or something like that, so you know just pull down this your automate your let's encrypt cert and everything so it works

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:42.780
flawlessly out of the box

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:49.820
I've got one of the lower end droplets, so I'm running like one one CPU two gigs of RAM

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:55.020
And just like 60 gigs of storage one of the things. I haven't quite figured out yet

01:03:55.620 --> 01:04:01.380
Well, I just haven't really dove into it, but is relocating some of that into block storage

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.060
Which one of the things that I've learned about?

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:09.180
Specifically digital ocean I'm sure a lot of the others are the same

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:13.660
that you can only move that block storage within that Center, so

01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:19.700
Basically I if since I do have a server that's in LA and I do have one that's in NYC

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:26.980
Then I could not move that block storage between those two this geek tweets has been using you're still on 1604

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:31.580
Did I know that yeah? I've been running the next cloud snap on 1604

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.660
Yeah, now, and it's it's you know. It's been absolutely rock-stable

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:39.700
It's on a VM at home back in the UK and used it all over the place

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:45.100
I've got two or three Android phones backing up photos to it in real time, and it's been absolutely flawless

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:51.460
How do you handle your your storage is it hosted on the same local machine, or do you yeah?

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:58.540
It's just one big virtual disk. I probably should sort out gotcha Brent's got a pretty clever title x-ray Fox trot

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.500
Charlie echo for the spelling out of excess that that's I like that's pretty deep Brent

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.780
I'm impressed I had to look it up

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:11.700
Board of stability damn it Joe blame Joe those are good, too

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:18.020
Blame Joe's pretty good, so I think it's between Brent and blame Joe right now, which is Wes's suggestion

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:21.540
JB titles calm not a lot of boats today not a lot of boats

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.860
Come on guys go boat go boat blame Joe is pretty good, but would people get it

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:30.500
No, I mean it wouldn't tell you what at all the episode was about

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:35.180
But it would be a slight callback to a tiny bit in the episode it is so his fault
