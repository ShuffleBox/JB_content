1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
I'm having a rough day, Wes.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,800
I've officially wrecked my uptime

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,600
and I'm struggling with that.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,240
Had to reboot, eh?

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,320
What happened?

6
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,600
Well, had to shut down.

7
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,440
Had to shut down.

8
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,520
Yesterday, we were in the studio

9
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,680
and it started to heat up

10
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,720
and we're looking at the forecast

11
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,880
and it's saying 104, 105 Fahrenheit.

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,640
And I just said, no way.

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,400
We don't have air conditioning in the studio.

14
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,560
The little portable unit that I have running right now

15
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,440
basically becomes worthless after about 90, 95 degrees.

16
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,900
So I just, I shut everything down.

17
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,400
I said, we're shutting the studio down.

18
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,880
We bumped Coder from Monday

19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
and we're gonna record it on Wednesday.

20
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,900
And I turned off the mixer, which we never do.

21
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,800
I turned off the recording systems, which we never do.

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,040
I didn't turn everything off,

23
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,640
but I turned a lot of stuff off.

24
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,480
And I got out of here.

25
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,080
I evacuated, everybody evacuated.

26
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,480
And I kind of had a, I had like a brilliant moment.

27
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,760
You know, sometimes I impress myself, Wes.

28
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760
It's really like a Star Trek scene here, you know,

29
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,340
where you've got to turn down all the power

30
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,560
so we can hide in the nebula.

31
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,200
Although, I don't know if we can really hide from the heat.

32
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,040
Ooh.

33
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,120
Got it all shut down.

34
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,920
Yeah, so I decided to go out and play in the snow.

35
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,160
So the wife and I loaded up in the car with Levi

36
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,320
and we headed out to Mount Baker,

37
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,540
which is about 45, 5,000 feet up in the air.

38
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,720
So it was like mid eighties, which is still pretty warm.

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,840
And you found honest to goodness snow.

40
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,920
Yeah, we had a snowball fight.

41
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,480
So I'm out there having a snowball fight.

42
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,160
And I checked my phone because it was the first time

43
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,040
we were in reception in about two hours

44
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,400
and they have a tower up there.

45
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,480
And I got a message from Daniel Fore.

46
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,080
This last weekend, Wes and I helped them

47
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,600
with their elementary developer weekend.

48
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,440
We ran the stream.

49
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,720
We were like the wizards behind the curtain.

50
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,960
And I had forgotten to upload day two's file before I left.

51
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,760
So I'm up there on the mountain, playing in the snow.

52
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,040
And I see a message from Dan saying,

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,400
hey man, I'm at my desk.

54
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,720
I'm like ready to edit and stuff.

55
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,080
Like, but I don't have the file.

56
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,700
And I feel like such a jerk.

57
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,080
So we had to pack up.

58
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,840
We threw a few more snowballs, but we had to pack up,

59
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,360
get back in the car and drive for two hours

60
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,880
back to the studio.

61
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,760
I pull into the studio.

62
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
I open up the garage.

63
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,040
I pull into the garage, which is also the server room.

64
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,120
But at this point, I had the server off.

65
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,220
And Hadeen and I, kind of at the same time,

66
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,000
we open our doors, we step out

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,880
and we're just hit with this wall of heat.

68
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,400
Like somebody sitting there with a blow dryer in our face.

69
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,240
It was so hot.

70
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,400
We look at each other and all we can do is say,

71
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,840
oh my God, and run for the door.

72
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,800
We get to the door and you know how they tell you

73
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,840
if the doorknob's hot, there might be a fire

74
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,760
on the other side?

75
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,080
The doorknob was hot, Wes.

76
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,440
The whole door was hot.

77
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,400
The whole room, every object was radiating heat.

78
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,160
It might've been like 120 degrees

79
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,720
because probably since about 2 p.m.,

80
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,920
the sun had been directly on the garage front door

81
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,200
and the heat in there had just built and built and built.

82
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
So we bust out of there as fast as possible,

83
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,640
get into the main studio, power up the OBS rig,

84
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,680
get that file uploaded that I promised Dan I'd get to him.

85
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,680
And then I went through the studio

86
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,880
and I did a complete shutdown like I've never done

87
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,160
since we've moved in here.

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,960
Every single device off, Wi-Fi access points powered off,

89
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,460
cable modem unplugged, everything totally turned off

90
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,840
because I didn't want anything to die

91
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,000
because the heat was outrageous, 120 maybe in the garage

92
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,580
and 100 degrees in the main studio itself.

93
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,460
It was horrible.

94
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,120
So I just turned everything off

95
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,240
and then I came in early this morning before the show

96
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,600
and it was like the bad old days of my IT gig

97
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,800
where I would have to go around

98
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,440
and get a client back online after a power outage.

99
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,280
So I start with the edge devices,

100
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,680
you get the cable modem going,

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,240
get the firewall up and running,

102
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
then I get the server booted

103
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,280
so that way all of our network services are available.

104
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,480
Then I go get all the client machines online.

105
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,560
And then last but not least is the studio,

106
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,720
which that has to be booted up in a very particular order.

107
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,680
So I get everything turned on here,

108
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,040
I sit down and now we're doing a show.

109
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,000
So hopefully everything works.

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,740
Yeah, I can't believe you actually made it back online

111
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,800
to the live stream.

112
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,220
We'll see, hopefully I have all the buttons

113
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,060
in the right place.

114
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,920
I have a feeling I forgot something.

115
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

116
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,480
My name is Chris.

117
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,520
My name is Wes.

118
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,320
Hello, Wes, good luck keeping cool during this episode,

119
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,800
which is brought to you by the all new A Cloud Guru,

120
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux,

121
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,000
and other modern tech skills.

122
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,760
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

123
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,680
Get certified, get hired,

124
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,280
get learning at acloudguru.com.

125
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,080
Well, coming up in a very warm edition

126
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,480
of the Linux Unplugged program,

127
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,280
we are setting out to try something

128
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,320
that I think has been sort of rattling around

129
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,320
in the back of our minds for a while now.

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,380
When Fuchsia gets to a certain point,

131
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,200
is it gonna become a threat to Linux?

132
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,080
We got an email into the show

133
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,120
and they asked some really good questions.

134
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,500
So we're setting out to find out.

135
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,520
Wes is gonna try the absolute state of the art

136
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,820
of Fuchsia on the desktop

137
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,360
and try to determine if long-term it's a threat to Linux.

138
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,640
And at the same time,

139
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,240
I'm setting off to test something else.

140
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,600
I wanna try out the latest state-in-the-art

141
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,840
of desktop Linux for new users.

142
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,880
I think there might be one true distro out there

143
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,080
that we should start considering

144
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,240
we recommend to all new Linux users.

145
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,040
And I'll tell you about that in a little bit.

146
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,120
But before we get there,

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,400
we have to say hello to our virtual lug.

148
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,240
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

149
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,080
Hello, hello.

150
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,680
Hello. Hello.

151
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,520
Howdy.

152
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,720
Namaskaram.

153
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,840
Well, hello everyone.

154
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,320
It is great to see all 24 of you in there,

155
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,360
including the mayor, AKA Jack from Alma Linux.

156
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,240
Jack, welcome to the Unplugged program.

157
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,760
Hey guys, how are you?

158
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,600
Great.

159
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,840
And we have lots to talk about today.

160
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,120
So if you wanna chime in at any point,

161
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,280
just tag me in the chat room and I'll try to work you in.

162
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,520
The Mumble Room is open to our community

163
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,920
and we invite people to join us.

164
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,060
You can get details at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble,

165
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,240
and then join us live on Tuesdays.

166
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,820
But let's start with the new goodies

167
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,120
that your future Linux desktop will be getting really soon.

168
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,600
Linux 5.13 was released.

169
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,120
And I think the headline feature here, Wes,

170
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,260
is really the M1 bring up support

171
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,520
that is landed now upstream.

172
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,960
Of course, it's still early days there.

173
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,960
There's no accelerated graphics and a lot more to work out,

174
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,100
but it's in and that should provide a pretty nice base

175
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,320
for development going forward.

176
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,460
There are also new Linux 5.13 security features in the mix,

177
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,960
like a new Landlock Linux security module,

178
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,680
Clang control flow integrity support,

179
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,880
and optionally randomizing the kernel stack offset

180
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,480
at every system call.

181
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,600
There's also some AMD fun this cycle though, don't worry,

182
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,400
around FreeSync HDMI support, nice.

183
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,200
Yes, I love to see the FreeSync support landing.

184
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,960
The Landlock LSM stuff is a really interesting story.

185
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,920
And if that type of thing appeals to you out there

186
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,840
in the audience, let us know.

187
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,460
We would happily do a deep dive.

188
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,260
We just don't know if it's too niche or not,

189
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,600
but let us know at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

190
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,360
Linus says, this is a fairly big one.

191
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,760
It's not like the biggest we've seen,

192
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
but it's one of the bigger five series releases

193
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,000
with over 16,000 commits.

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,440
And if you count, I guess, all of the mergers,

195
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,240
it's more like 17,000.

196
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,920
And 2000 different developers participated

197
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,700
in this release of the Linux kernel.

198
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,720
And it's not slowing down.

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,860
5.14 has some big things in the works,

200
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,520
including dropping its legacy IDE code.

201
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,840
Sorry, Wes, your IDE disks are gonna have to go.

202
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,200
Oh, no, not my legacy NAS.

203
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,440
I thought you'd be worried about your CD-ROM writers.

204
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,860
But Neil says that's not actually true.

205
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,540
We're not losing IDE support.

206
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,200
This is the completion of, gosh,

207
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,800
I think like 20 years of effort to kill this code.

208
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,760
So a long, long, long time ago,

209
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,760
the code around supporting what we call IDE drives,

210
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,760
which formerly I think are called parallel ATA

211
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,560
or PATA drives, was unified with the code

212
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,020
that manages SATA drives.

213
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,620
And so that's all through the same subsystem.

214
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,860
That's why you tend to,

215
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,580
that's why you see SDA for drives,

216
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,120
even on older systems,

217
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,120
like the legacy IDE subsystem uses the older HDA

218
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,320
or HDB or HDC.

219
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,760
We haven't seen those in forever.

220
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,600
And that's what this code controls.

221
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,880
I believe, I'm not totally certain.

222
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,200
I think the only thing that still uses the legacy IDE code

223
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,920
is the M68K port in Linux.

224
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,200
All the rest of it uses the newer stuff.

225
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,880
So the M68K code was ported to the new stuff.

226
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,980
And so the legacy code can go away.

227
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,440
Let me tell you something.

228
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,320
Linux was the best back when we called it HDA.

229
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,800
It's been crap since then.

230
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,080
No, actually, I'm also really excited to see

231
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,280
ButterFS is getting more performance tuning

232
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,520
and other solid improvements in 5.14.

233
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,580
We talked about this one before,

234
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,420
but the Raspberry Pi 400 is getting mainlined.

235
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,760
Dell's been working on privacy screen support

236
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,440
for a long time.

237
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
That's gonna make it into 5.14.

238
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,280
Whoa.

239
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,640
And Intel and AMD CPUs are getting some nice solid features

240
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,080
that are getting added,

241
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,760
including Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4 support.

242
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,520
Plus don't think you have to be a file system hipster

243
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,280
to get some goodies in 5.14.

244
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,520
No, no, XFS improvements for large scale deployments

245
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,040
are coming down the line.

246
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,160
And one thing that really caught my eye,

247
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,040
latency reduction work for USB audio devices.

248
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,880
Hey.

249
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,140
Yeah, that's exciting.

250
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,200
And you combine that with the improvements

251
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,640
we're seeing in PipeWire.

252
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,100
PipeWire is getting really great.

253
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,800
They've done some big improvements

254
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
with their jack stability.

255
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
And you combine that with a low latency kernel

256
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,880
and the improvements that are going into 5.14.

257
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,960
Early, early tests are seeing latency,

258
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,220
audio latencies in numbers

259
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,820
that we've never achieved before in Linux right now.

260
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,280
Hackaday has been experimenting

261
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,720
and they're seeing two milliseconds

262
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,060
in the entire chain right now,

263
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,880
which would be record breaking for Linux.

264
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,520
And that's not even with the 5.14 improvements yet.

265
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,360
Wow.

266
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,300
Yeah, very excited about that.

267
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,220
Did you see the other kind of,

268
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,060
I don't know if this is really a feature of software

269
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,200
so much, but it's gonna make PipeWire

270
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,000
at least more intelligent with Bluetooth devices.

271
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,560
Oh yeah, this is kind of a big deal

272
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,280
they're talking about at least with the release of 0.3.31,

273
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,560
which is a database of quote unquote,

274
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,200
weird Bluetooth hardware.

275
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,100
That way PipeWire can apply specific tweaks

276
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,360
for each of those devices.

277
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,720
It's basically a bunch of stuff

278
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,840
that Android has figured out over the years

279
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,720
that now PipeWire can take advantage of

280
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,680
to hopefully work a little bit better.

281
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,080
And I think it underscores

282
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,960
the one little nice benefit of PipeWire

283
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,960
that I didn't really appreciate or tune into at first

284
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,520
was all this Bluetooth stuff.

285
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,720
It's turning into a really nice implementation

286
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
and a place where all of it can just work

287
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,740
instead of sort of the weird like,

288
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,240
oh, you can't do it in also anymore,

289
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,960
only you have to rely on Pulse.

290
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,120
It was just a mess.

291
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,880
It's such a practical solution,

292
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,800
but yet it's not really been done yet.

293
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,120
And it's, well, we're gonna make a list

294
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,540
and we're gonna make a list of stuff

295
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,720
that just needs tweaks to work right.

296
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,440
And we'll catch probably 80%

297
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,120
of the most popular devices out there.

298
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,200
And what they've done is they've grabbed

299
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,880
the original data set from Android.

300
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,440
So they have a massive data set

301
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,840
of popular headset devices to start with.

302
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,920
So it's just like a ton of well-supported,

303
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,680
well-known headset devices are just gonna work

304
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,640
with these out of the box,

305
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
assuming you can get it connected to your system

306
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,780
in PipeWire 3.3.1, in 0.3.3.1.

307
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,560
That is really great to see.

308
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,000
And the project just continues to crank out

309
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,140
really, really solid releases.

310
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,880
So a big congratulations to them.

311
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,680
We love seeing this kind of stuff.

312
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,080
Keep up the great work.

313
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,400
Linode.com slash unplugged.

314
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,960
Go there to get $100 in credit and you support the show.

315
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,720
Linode is how we spin everything up in the cloud these days.

316
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,920
And when it's crazy hot here

317
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,260
and I had to shut down everything,

318
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,040
I was so glad Linode had my infrastructure

319
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,200
for the listeners covered in their data centers.

320
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,440
They got 11 of them around the world

321
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,160
and they've got air conditioning.

322
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,880
I mean, they've been around since 2003.

323
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
So they've been able to build

324
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,180
like just these ultimate network pipelines

325
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,160
between their data centers.

326
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,860
They've become their own ISP

327
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,600
and they're able to invest in machinery

328
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,200
that is just killer performance.

329
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,920
So these are sort of like the top level reasons

330
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,520
why I love Linode.

331
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,920
But you know, Linode was so receptive to the idea

332
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,340
of the Linode on the road road trip.

333
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,960
The idea kind of was like a baby seed

334
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,400
of like, hey, let's do a meetup.

335
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,320
And then it kind of widened into a conversation

336
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,040
where Linode was like, you know, we've got a few ideas.

337
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
And they have been instrumental

338
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,880
in creating what I think is gonna be

339
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,600
a super important team reunion for the JB crew.

340
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,260
I think it's gonna be just totally critical

341
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,400
because we haven't seen each other really

342
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,320
since the whole transition to going independent

343
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,260
because the pandemic's been going on

344
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,200
and we've all been sort of isolated in our homes

345
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
and we haven't had that human to human connection

346
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,600
that makes working together a lot more possible,

347
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,080
but also I think just sort of regenerates

348
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,520
our creative energy.

349
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,560
Linode's gonna make that trip possible.

350
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,800
And I am so grateful for them

351
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,560
because they're supporting our network,

352
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,740
they're making these shows possible,

353
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,960
they're making this reunion and our meetups possible,

354
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,360
but they've also supported things

355
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,840
like Linux Fest Northwest for years,

356
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,220
the Kubuntu project, there's a list on their website.

357
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,000
There's a lot of projects they've been involved with

358
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
for over the years and that's really how I met them

359
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,440
the first time was at,

360
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
I think it might've been Texas Linux Fest,

361
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,940
it was some event I was at and they had a booth there.

362
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,160
And when some of the other vendors weren't taking the time

363
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,160
to really do all of the things necessary

364
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,380
to have a good booth, Linode was there enjoying it.

365
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,120
They were just enjoying it, you know?

366
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
And that was when I was, that was a couple of years ago.

367
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,720
I was like, yeah, I'm gonna try out Linode.

368
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,120
That experience.

369
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,480
And then it transitioned into kind of a passion

370
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,440
and now here they are supporting our independent work

371
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,400
and making our team reunion possible.

372
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,520
And they just have such a great suite of options

373
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
from object storage to super fast systems

374
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,740
to $5 a month rigs and they're 30 to 50% cheaper

375
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,680
than the major cloud providers like AWS

376
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,160
and they've been around longer than AWS.

377
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,960
They started years before them

378
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,920
and they do everything with Linux.

379
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,400
They are all in, everything they're doing with Linux

380
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,520
and that means you can take it as deep as you want.

381
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,920
If you wanna build it up from scratch

382
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,320
and build the whole stack, you can,

383
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,880
or if you just wanna do the one app click deployment thing,

384
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,040
you can do that as well.

385
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,080
And they support a lot

386
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,440
of your infrastructure management tools

387
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,800
like Terraform and Kubernetes and Ansible.

388
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,680
So you can pop it into your existing infrastructure

389
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,520
with ease.

390
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,520
So go get that $100 credit and support the show.

391
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,280
It's a really nice way to get going

392
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,220
and help your buddies here make a podcast.

393
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,360
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

394
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,420
So Deepin has a release this week

395
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,580
and we actually haven't really discussed Deepin much

396
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,940
but 20.2.2 came out this week

397
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,840
and it introduces a lot of interesting features

398
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,360
that caught my attention.

399
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,380
And I have to be fully transparent with you guys.

400
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,280
One of the reasons I haven't talked about Deepin a lot

401
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,480
on the show is I don't fully understand

402
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,880
the owner model behind Deepin.

403
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,880
I've read their EULA and I've read their privacy policy

404
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,960
and everything seems good there.

405
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
I've monitored the network traffic to a degree.

406
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,320
It's only been like 24 hours

407
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
and I haven't seen anything sketchy

408
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,800
but I don't really totally fully appreciate

409
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,920
and understand that whole relationship there.

410
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,760
And so I've been hesitant just to cover it on air.

411
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,520
But after today, I couldn't hold my tongue anymore.

412
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,440
I mean, I'm gonna make that disclaimer to you

413
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,240
and it's something I'm going to investigate more

414
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,080
and it's something I recommend you investigate.

415
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,600
However, there is clearly some neat stuff happening here.

416
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,060
So what Wes and I did today is we decided to divide

417
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,640
and conquer the work on the show

418
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,480
because we wanna cover both Deepin and Fuchsia.

419
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,620
So Wes went off into Fuchsia town

420
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,640
and I went off into Deepin town

421
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,200
and I thought I'd come back and tell Wes

422
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,800
that it was cutesy and it had a nice little UI

423
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,980
on top of like Plasma or something, but move on.

424
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,200
I thought that's what I was gonna come here.

425
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,040
I really did.

426
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,200
That was my bias towards this.

427
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,760
That's what I'm expecting.

428
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,440
Is that not what you're doing?

429
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,560
I'm gonna start with what I would normally

430
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,400
end the review with.

431
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,080
And that is, I think this is the distribution

432
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,880
with some disclaimers I'm about to make

433
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,600
that people should look at and consider giving

434
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,340
to new users of Linux who are just looking

435
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,440
for a Windows replacement.

436
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,680
They're not necessarily looking to become

437
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,640
a quote unquote Linux user.

438
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,680
And they want something that is fancier

439
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,740
than say Windows 11.

440
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,580
And I mean it.

441
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,880
And what they've done now in Deepin

442
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,320
is a brand new app store that includes

443
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,120
the ability to install Android apps.

444
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,980
So they're right there with Windows 11

445
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,600
on that feature as well.

446
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,500
Now in my version, does not work at the moment.

447
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,880
And I'm gonna continue to play with that.

448
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,080
But that wasn't really why I downloaded this distro.

449
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,220
Deepin is also the first Chinese distribution

450
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,800
to support Secure Boot.

451
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,560
And they've been working with Microsoft

452
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,480
to get that signed.

453
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,320
Interesting.

454
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,600
That adds a layer to your conversation around

455
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,760
trust in some sense.

456
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,600
Yeah.

457
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,360
It's not just you making some assessments about them.

458
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,920
At some level, Microsoft is too.

459
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,320
Whether you trust Microsoft, that's another question.

460
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,160
But it's a point anyway.

461
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,120
And you know what else, Wes,

462
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,440
is it's something we need to kind of start

463
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,600
paying attention to more as Windows 11

464
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,960
is gonna force this issue.

465
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,600
And so Linux distributions are gonna need

466
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,120
to have Secure Boot support for a lot of Windows 11

467
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,040
compatible hardware.

468
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,960
Especially if you're targeting new users, right?

469
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,800
Right.

470
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,360
So Deepin checks that box.

471
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,120
And then they have a nice calendar application,

472
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,920
which God, that's like giving a glass of water

473
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
to a man in the desert when you're on Linux.

474
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,640
They have a really, really clean, clean, consistent UI

475
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,240
across all of their default album, draw, image viewer,

476
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,860
mail applications.

477
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,400
Fact, I took some screenshots of what I thought

478
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,800
were some of its UI highlights,

479
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,940
and I put them in an imager album

480
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,080
that I'll have linked in the show notes

481
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,000
and I've just put in the IRC.

482
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,360
And their desktop, their Deepin desktop,

483
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,840
which is their own thing, is pretty special.

484
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,940
It's pretty unique.

485
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,720
This latest version's pretty great.

486
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,720
And they're really clever and polite

487
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,360
about the way they ask you if you wanna go

488
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,360
into total efficiency mode or would you like eye candy.

489
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,760
And they'll walk you through it in a way

490
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,060
that is totally approachable to either get a system

491
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,740
that has all of the fancy turned up

492
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,680
or is just really kind of lean, mean on the GPU.

493
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,520
And I liked that a lot.

494
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,440
The Deepin menu is clean.

495
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,920
It's very simple.

496
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
The most recently installed applications

497
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,020
are highlighted with a blue dot.

498
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,120
Your most frequently run applications are in a list,

499
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,160
most frequent at the top.

500
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,680
And then of course, things are also sorted by category.

501
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,880
The task bar is the cleanest little system bar

502
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,440
I have ever seen in an operating system, not in Linux,

503
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,160
in a desktop operating system.

504
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,020
They just nail it so hard.

505
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,860
Everybody needs to steal what they're doing.

506
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,320
It's clean, it's simple,

507
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,920
it's easy to see the icons in the system tray.

508
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,720
They've taken the best of what macOS

509
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,400
and what GNOME 40 is attempting to do

510
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,960
with virtual desktop management and multitasking overview,

511
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,000
and they've nailed it.

512
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,200
It's easy and simple to move windows

513
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,460
between virtual desktops.

514
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,880
They use a vertical layout,

515
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,280
but the way the vertical layout works,

516
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,760
you can see all of the applications

517
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,380
and you can move them easily.

518
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,680
The terminal is clean,

519
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,380
it's consistent with the rest of the UI,

520
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,300
and it gives me more functionality and tweaking

521
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,220
than GNOME Shell does,

522
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,760
but not like a crazy amount like console does.

523
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,040
It like just hits that sweet spot.

524
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,280
Happy medium, huh?

525
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,900
And then the system monitor

526
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,080
is one of the best dang looking system monitors

527
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,040
out there, Wes.

528
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,840
Yeah, I'm looking at this right now and sexy.

529
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,680
Yes, I mean, it's really well done.

530
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,920
The whole thing really comes together.

531
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,760
Their appearance,

532
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,680
configuration and personalization is fantastic.

533
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,160
You can choose between light mode, auto,

534
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,000
if you wanted to switch, dark mode.

535
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,240
They support accent colors,

536
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,120
like is coming in elementary six.

537
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,280
They let you dial up and down the transparency

538
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,780
and the window effects with simple controls.

539
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,420
You can even turn off the rounded corners

540
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,940
or make them just slightly less rounded,

541
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,960
but it's all done in a way that's so clean.

542
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,800
It makes the other configurator screens

543
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,480
on other distributions look complicated

544
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,760
while giving you more options.

545
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,480
I mean, I'm telling you, this is so slick

546
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,840
and it's got built in backup options

547
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,540
into the system settings that are crazy easy to use.

548
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,640
The file manager starts really big and clear,

549
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,220
but then can be kind of refined

550
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,700
into a more typical power users file manager.

551
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,100
Again, striking a great balance

552
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,640
between configuration options and not overdoing it

553
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,900
and also making those configuration options easy

554
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,740
and approachable.

555
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,520
And honestly, somehow they lay out in a way

556
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,040
that makes it easier visually to go through the list

557
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,280
and decipher what options are available.

558
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,160
It makes it more approachable that way.

559
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,960
And it's all running on top of Debian

560
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,160
and something else they do that's kind of fun

561
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,400
is they ship it with this,

562
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,080
what they call dual kernel mode.

563
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,440
Dual kernel mode, huh?

564
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,460
Yeah, how about this trick?

565
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,840
Two kernels are installed at the same time.

566
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,520
They by default are using like a more conservative LTS kernel

567
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,160
but in the grub advanced menu,

568
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,560
you can choose a newer kernel

569
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,720
with better newer hardware support.

570
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,480
And it'll just boot that and everything works just great.

571
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,960
And you know, the Deepin package manager,

572
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,720
which is apt with their own repos, keeps it all up to date.

573
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,920
Oh, so it's not like you have to do a one time,

574
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,680
point in time pick, like, I mean, they're going LTS

575
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,360
or, you know, something a little newer.

576
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,080
No, you can choose as per boot if you want.

577
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,360
Yeah, and I tried swapping between them

578
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,080
and I think you need the later one

579
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080
for the Android app support.

580
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,200
So I just went with the later one, cause why not?

581
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,860
And then, you know, I don't know how that's gonna work out

582
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,700
because like I said,

583
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,600
the software center never quite worked right for me.

584
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,520
That's not why I'm using this distro though.

585
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
And there was still parts of the software center

586
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
of the UI that are in Chinese.

587
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,680
When you launch the browser, which is based on Chrome,

588
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,000
the latest version of Chrome, when you launch that,

589
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,640
you get the Baidu search engine,

590
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,880
which gives you results in Chinese.

591
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,320
So you definitely would need to, and this is my disclaimer,

592
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,400
besides just research the back of the company,

593
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,720
but all of that, but you also would need to tweak

594
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,080
some of this stuff for a new and new user.

595
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,720
Cause some of it comes up in Chinese

596
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,280
and you have to maybe switch the search engine

597
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,440
to your preferred search engine, which is obviously Bing,

598
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,440
and then tweak those kinds of things.

599
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,040
But I imagine as every release goes on with Deepin,

600
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,900
these problems become less and less

601
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,920
because I have followed the distro for a while.

602
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,400
I just haven't talked about it a lot.

603
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,480
And these items have slowly been getting corrected

604
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,260
and it's been making it more and more approachable

605
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,120
to a Western audience for a while now.

606
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,060
And it's been trending in that direction.

607
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,440
So you'd have to tweak some of those things

608
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,920
and before a new user could sit down

609
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,360
and really fully use it and have a great experience,

610
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,300
but it truly feels like something different and fresh.

611
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,280
It feels very well thought out.

612
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,880
It is a new experience to the face of Linux

613
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,000
and it installs very fast.

614
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,360
It's probably the fastest Linux distro I've ever installed.

615
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,240
And it's probably the fastest setup time

616
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,360
because I was just on board to experience Deepin

617
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,760
as they have it by default.

618
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,720
I didn't want to tweak it much.

619
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,120
I just turned on dark mode

620
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,960
and then pretty much was happy there.

621
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,400
And then when I'd open up each individual application,

622
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,920
I'd maybe have to make some kind of tweaks,

623
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,800
maybe to the file manager or to the terminal,

624
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,160
but it'd take me about 15 seconds and then I'm done.

625
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,440
And I was up and going in this thing in probably an hour.

626
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,160
Yeah, okay, that's not bad.

627
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,320
It's a fresh take.

628
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,200
And you can absolutely use the Deepin desktop

629
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,520
on other distributions.

630
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,640
I'm not saying you only have to use Deepin Linux

631
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,560
to try out the Deepin desktop.

632
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,600
What are the advantages there?

633
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,480
I'm curious how that experience might differ

634
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,360
to just getting the benefits, the surface level,

635
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,520
sort of DE experience versus something

636
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,720
like that dual kernel stuff,

637
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,680
which I imagine you need the whole system to have.

638
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,200
Yeah, I mean, to me, it's like akin

639
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,240
to running Pantheon on Fedora or Arch.

640
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,000
It's like you get some of the experience,

641
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,120
but it's not quite the full representation

642
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,320
and it's not definitely what they intended.

643
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,720
So I wanted to try their take on it.

644
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,800
I'm kind of, I think, in part of this, Wes,

645
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,400
when I do these tests, I think part of me is hoping

646
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
to just fall in love with a Debian based Linux

647
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,080
that I could just use for a long time.

648
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,360
A base you're comfortable with,

649
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,720
but something that keeps you happy on the surface.

650
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,760
Yeah, but still none of them have quite scratched the itch

651
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,960
like Fedora is recently.

652
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,200
That really seems to be with DNF and toolbox.

653
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,040
And then the concept of just really close to rolling,

654
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,880
but not quite there.

655
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,040
I like their term of leading edge.

656
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,360
That's where for me, as my personal desktop,

657
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,520
I'm gonna, I think stick there

658
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,760
because I like being pretty current.

659
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,160
I think it's overall, it's better

660
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,080
if in the free software ecosystem,

661
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,800
if you're fairly current and you're not lagging behind.

662
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,760
And sometimes Debian does tend to lag behind

663
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,600
in certain areas.

664
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,920
And while Deepin makes up for that in some places,

665
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,680
ultimately it's not quite the workstation recipe I want,

666
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,760
but I wasn't just being obnoxious when I said earlier,

667
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,360
I think this could be the distro for new Linux users.

668
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,920
Right now, if you're recommending Linux Mint to people,

669
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,800
then you're who I'm directly addressing at this moment.

670
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,760
I want you to try Deepin out and take a look at it

671
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,440
and see if maybe you could start recommending this to people.

672
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,720
Now I'm not saying you have to change

673
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,600
and Mint could be working great,

674
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,000
but there's something really special here

675
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,560
because it's a real fresh take on the desktop

676
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,240
that feels more modern

677
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,040
than what Apple or Microsoft are putting out right now.

678
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Even with their Mozarati coming out and the Windows 11,

679
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,960
I think it feels like it's still ahead

680
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,160
of where they're going.

681
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,400
And the team is really putting a lot of thought into it.

682
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,760
And whenever you see a Linux distribution

683
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,920
that's getting that much love and care and thought

684
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,760
put into it,

685
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,840
and they're doing something new and fresh like that,

686
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,520
it's worth anybody's time to check out.

687
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,160
But if you're in right now,

688
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,440
and you're in that area where you're a Mint recommender,

689
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,320
think Deepin has to be on your try list.

690
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,240
Yeah, sounds like maybe there's some ideas over there

691
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,480
that need to be more widely enjoyed and shared

692
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,360
and thought about,

693
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,400
and that injection of some of those fresh ideas

694
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,960
into perhaps an otherwise stale Linux ecosystem.

695
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,840
I'm gonna stick with it for another week,

696
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
even though I think ultimately I'll be back on Fedora.

697
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,320
I have it on my ThinkPad,

698
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,280
and I think I'll probably reload that.

699
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,720
I had Windows 11 on there,

700
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,920
so I'm kind of in this weird area right now.

701
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,840
I was trying out Windows 11 for Coder Radio,

702
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,440
which I'm gonna talk about tomorrow in Coder Radio.

703
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,560
And then I thought,

704
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,080
well, now that I'm done with Windows 11,

705
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,360
I'll try Deepin out.

706
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,240
And that's been really great.

707
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,000
And I think I'm gonna stick with it for another week,

708
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,920
but then I've got to make that decision after that.

709
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,200
Think I'll probably go back to a Fedora distro,

710
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,320
but I don't know if it's gonna be a Plasma Spin

711
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
or the GNOME one.

712
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,080
I just, I'm in this weird phase right now.

713
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,240
So while I let that thought simmer,

714
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,480
I'm gonna enjoy Deepin for just a bit longer.

715
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,600
Now, Wes, we got some cleaning up to do around here.

716
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,440
This is ridiculous.

717
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,880
Ooh, yeah, messy.

718
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,720
Yeah, I stormed out of here and just made a mess.

719
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,960
Like right here, look at this.

720
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
It's just laying on the floor.

721
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,800
This says right here,

722
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,760
hey, meetups, two of them coming up.

723
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,440
One in Denver and one in Salt Lake City.

724
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,880
Details are at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

725
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,720
Let's go see.

726
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,480
Are people signing up?

727
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,640
Let's find out.

728
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,000
I hope so, because, you know,

729
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,240
otherwise, why are we going to Salt Lake City, right?

730
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,120
Look, so far we have 20 that are going to Denver.

731
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,960
Nice.

732
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,320
And nine that are in Salt Lake City.

733
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,800
I think that means those things are happening.

734
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
That's awesome.

735
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,920
Right there.

736
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,760
Very nice.

737
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,880
If you'd like to join us, get accounted.

738
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,640
You know, be accounted for.

739
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,680
Get counted.

740
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,880
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

741
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,480
Our Telegram group's going right now, you know.

742
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,520
That's where the conversation continues.

743
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,680
The show wraps up.

744
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,280
You can always send us an email.

745
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,880
But every now and then, it's just a quick thing.

746
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,720
You might want to grab,

747
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,360
maybe one of us are hanging out in there at that moment.

748
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,320
You want to grab us, something like that.

749
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,240
We got a Telegram group.

750
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,320
You go in there and do that.

751
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,080
Jupiter Broadcasting.com slash Telegram.

752
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
That's over there.

753
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,440
Matrix Info Two is at our website, LinuxUnplugged.com.

754
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,520
And then, of course, those emails

755
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,160
at LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact.

756
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,400
And then the last little bit of housekeeping wisdom

757
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,880
that I will depart with.

758
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,240
Don't steal our wisdom.

759
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,920
Yeah, wouldn't that be great, though?

760
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,760
That'd be my power.

761
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,320
That'd be a great superpower.

762
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,920
So if I had a superpower,

763
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,320
it would be that I would take wisdom

764
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,160
and transmit it to you

765
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,240
that Luplug is going on every Sunday.

766
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,440
And that it is wise to attend the Luplug.

767
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,760
Because hanging out with like-minded Linux users

768
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,320
rejuvenates the soul in a way

769
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,840
that even antisocial, inverted,

770
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,800
like totally don't want to talk to people,

771
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,960
people benefit from.

772
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,800
How do I know that?

773
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,240
Because I've done it and I've benefited from it.

774
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,040
I don't want to get on a thing

775
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,640
and talk to people I don't know on a Sunday.

776
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,480
But you know what?

777
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,320
Every single time I've done it,

778
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,880
I've absolutely enjoyed the experience.

779
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,040
It feeds you.

780
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,920
And it happens every Sunday.

781
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,840
LinuxUplug.com slash mumble, join our virtual log

782
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,680
and hang out.

783
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,440
And then, then you've got that mumble software all set up

784
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,920
and you can join us here in the pod on a Tuesday.

785
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,160
I'm sorry I called it pod.

786
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,000
It's weird housekeeping.

787
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,840
What can I say?

788
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,480
All right, so we've got some fuchsia fears

789
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,800
that I think reflect the thoughts of some of our listeners.

790
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,560
Do you want to take this email from Mr. Light fixture?

791
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Mr. Light fixture wrote in.

792
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,960
Hey, just wanted to write in

793
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,040
because I know you people like to keep up with fuchsia.

794
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,040
Did you know there's already a desktop OS based on fuchsia?

795
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,760
It's called Dahlia OS and they have two additions.

796
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,000
One based on the Zircon kernel

797
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,040
and the other based on Linux.

798
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,480
It's open source, has an eye candy desktop called Pangolin.

799
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,320
And the devs seem to focus on flutter based apps

800
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,880
as the main kind of programs on the system.

801
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,040
If you did check it out,

802
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,640
I'm curious to know your thoughts.

803
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,080
Does it have potential?

804
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,400
What does fuchsia on the desktop mean

805
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,000
for Linux distros as we know them today?

806
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,360
Could fuchsia supplant desktop Linux

807
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,360
or even Chrome OS in the future?

808
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,760
Big questions there, Chris.

809
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,960
That's a good question.

810
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
You and I have been kicking that around a little bit

811
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,800
because we follow the development of fuchsia

812
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,600
pretty closely for Linux action news.

813
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,200
And there's more movement there than in the past.

814
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,080
Google has recently rolled out fuchsia

815
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,080
to the first generation Google Nest hubs.

816
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,080
And they're positioning it very much as a modular OS

817
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,040
that could work for IOT

818
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,560
but eventually make its way up to phones

819
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,680
and yeah, Chromebook style devices.

820
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,920
And one wonders, what would that mean for Linux?

821
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,960
You know, what is truly the concern there?

822
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,440
Would it be necessarily useful in server workloads?

823
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,680
You know, I don't know,

824
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,240
but desktop workloads potentially,

825
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,640
mobile workloads potentially.

826
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,800
And if that's true, the ramifications of that

827
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,000
could be a significant drop-off in kernel developers.

828
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,600
Because when you look at a lot of the source code

829
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,960
and development time coming into the Linux kernel right now

830
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,240
and the things that are driving features

831
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,840
like even having an LTS kernel,

832
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,040
a lot of that comes from mobile right now.

833
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,680
A good portion of that developer time

834
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,680
comes from companies that are bringing up mobile support

835
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,760
or fixing something so it's more efficient on mobile,

836
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,520
which often has great, great effects too on desktop.

837
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,440
You know, we get better power efficiency

838
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,240
or we get something that comes along

839
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,800
as a knock-on effect of that.

840
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,520
And I think if you were successful,

841
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,320
say in the Android marketplace,

842
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,880
devices say five years from now have a fuchsia base

843
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,040
and Chromebooks five years from now have a fuchsia base.

844
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,040
I think the impact would not be directly felt

845
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,320
by Linux users from that,

846
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,200
but it would be a reduction in kernel development

847
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,720
and contributors to the kernel.

848
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,280
A lot of what happens at these huge scale companies

849
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,200
is that kind of like custom development.

850
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,120
We need X, we need a system that meets our needs here.

851
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,880
And in the current times,

852
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,680
that Linux is the easiest way to get that done.

853
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,520
It makes the most sense.

854
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,200
You can kind of leverage what other folks are doing,

855
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,680
but there are also some impediments, right?

856
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,320
Like Linux is an old kernel.

857
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,000
It's got the design decisions it's made

858
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,240
from a long time in computing.

859
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,400
And sometimes you might have to, you know,

860
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,480
go back and forth a little bit,

861
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,280
look at some of the stuff like features

862
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,840
in the Android kernels that have been hotly debated,

863
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,080
whether they should or could be merged up to mainline,

864
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,960
eventually did, some still haven't been.

865
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,240
So there's also some friction there.

866
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,640
And I think maybe some of the worry is that

867
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,200
if fuchsia or something like it gets far enough along,

868
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,760
the value proposition might change

869
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,960
where Google or Facebook

870
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,160
or some of these other big companies decide that,

871
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,400
oh, hey, this OS over here,

872
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,360
it's just easier for us to get what we need here

873
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,080
because we don't need it to support

874
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,120
all the hardware in the world

875
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,760
or every possible type of computing, right?

876
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,360
We have six different product lines.

877
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,400
We need it to support that.

878
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,200
And otherwise we don't care.

879
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,640
Yeah, I think that is very reasonable.

880
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,520
And it's not just maybe as simple as that.

881
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,440
And we're gonna talk about more about this in a moment,

882
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,600
but fuchsia being the modular OS that it is,

883
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,520
it may be very simple to bring up fuchsia support

884
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,280
on older hardware as well for compatibility purposes.

885
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,760
That may be a very straightforward process

886
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,120
with the way that fuchsia is designed.

887
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,600
Maybe this is the context in which we talk about Dahlia OS,

888
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,520
which is trying to kind of bring together

889
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,440
the best of Linux and fuchsia into a desktop experience.

890
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,600
And so we thought let's have Wes try this out

891
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,960
and see how practical and realistic this is,

892
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,200
is maybe a one day Chrome OS replacement

893
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,360
or something like that.

894
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,880
All right, well, right out of the gate,

895
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,240
it's still super early days for fuchsia

896
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,800
and the whole Zircon kernel.

897
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,680
And because of that and because of their goals,

898
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,160
Dahlia OS is looking to provide a fast and stable experience

899
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,720
on nearly every computer, at least so they say,

900
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,640
and including from their little notes here,

901
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,000
including the 2004 desktop tower,

902
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,240
all the way up to the latest generation of mobile notebooks.

903
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,160
So right now they've got a dual kernel approach

904
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,680
so that users with the newer hardware in theory

905
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,240
at some point would be on Zircon,

906
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,600
but to get all that legacy software support,

907
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,840
all those older devices, they plan to use good old Linux.

908
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,040
So it's interesting, maybe it represents

909
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
an approach of the future, a bridge,

910
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,960
but right now the only thing that I could actually get

911
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,880
to boot was the Linux version.

912
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay, and like we were kind of alluding to earlier,

913
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,600
it doesn't seem like that's a weird

914
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,120
kind of stretch for fuchsia.

915
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,480
It seems like you kind of can plug and unplug

916
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,240
these different parts of the fuchsia stack

917
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,840
and plug in a Linux kernel to get access

918
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,520
to device drivers and whatnot.

919
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,080
How does that work exactly?

920
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,920
Well, I mean, I think it depends

921
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,720
on what we're talking about in the fuchsia stack.

922
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,880
So one thing here about Dahlia is, yeah,

923
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,480
a lot of it is targeting Flutter

924
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,760
and Flutter and Dart, of course,

925
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,560
work just fine on Linux, right?

926
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,200
It's got its own render, it's got its own setup.

927
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,120
So that makes that part of the stack flexible.

928
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,920
And then on the Zircon side, it's just so new, right?

929
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,680
Like from the developer perspective,

930
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,920
it's just exciting to see something

931
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,000
where you can make changes,

932
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,280
you can learn from your past mistakes.

933
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,840
And because it has this history of being quite minimal

934
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,960
and leaving a lot of things out of the kernel,

935
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,040
especially with some of its more

936
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,360
asynchronous non-blocking nature,

937
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,680
it seems like if needed, there's a lot of areas

938
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,080
where Zircon could be extended to support stuff

939
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,040
that Linux previously did if it actually needed to.

940
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,880
Yeah.

941
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,240
One aspect here is because of like

942
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,360
the asynchronous non-blocking stuff,

943
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,280
it might make it really easy for system calls

944
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,040
to be serviced on a different core

945
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,720
than say the one making the call.

946
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,200
Just some other sort of like nitty gritty details like that

947
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,640
that make me wonder if Zircon might end up

948
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,320
being a better fit for some of these new architectures

949
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,520
we're seeing with more custom different cores

950
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,120
than say Linux and being targeted at general computing.

951
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,880
I think that is part of the concern

952
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,480
that's gnawing at some of us long timers just a little bit.

953
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,840
Like we know in the back of our mind,

954
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,360
it's a low threat likely on the desktop

955
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,240
and in its current state for sure, sounds like.

956
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,240
However, the thing about Fuchsia is the whole entire thing,

957
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,360
the entire OS stack is being built

958
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,360
with Google's lessons learned with Android and Linux

959
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,920
and all of that.

960
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,340
Like they're taking, oh, this didn't work.

961
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,800
So let's build it this way.

962
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,040
And they're really clever people there at Google.

963
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,440
And so I think we all kind of implicitly know

964
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,960
they've solved some problems

965
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,720
that are gonna be appealing to developers

966
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,560
and Google has the might and the scale

967
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,840
to really push something if they want.

968
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,480
And those things are concerning

969
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,600
because if it's gonna save developers time and money

970
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,840
and if the simplicity means it's quicker

971
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,880
and perhaps a little more secure,

972
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,000
that's gonna be very attractive.

973
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,040
Like for example, the Zircon kernel only supports ARM

974
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,240
and x86 and 64 bit versions of that.

975
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,120
Like they don't have to mess

976
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,360
with all the old legacy architectures that Linux supports.

977
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,520
Like they don't have to play.

978
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,440
That's not in their wheelhouse of targeted devices.

979
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,080
They just, they don't have to do that.

980
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,000
There's a lot of stuff like that in the security world too,

981
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,760
right, where there's just some more flexibility

982
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,080
or compromises that were chosen a different way

983
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,960
in the Linux world that they can choose

984
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,080
a different path on in Zircon.

985
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,680
So when you're using it, Wes, do you get a sense

986
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,280
that they're building it to work as a workstation

987
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,560
because in the screenshots that you have linked

988
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,000
in the show notes, I see that they have like a VM manager

989
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,720
and stuff for virtual machines.

990
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,040
Yes, so again, we should be clear

991
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,840
at what different things we're talking about here.

992
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,600
This is going back to Dahlia OS,

993
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,680
which I think in some sense is a hedge.

994
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,040
So, you know, we're worried about future.

995
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,000
We're worried about Zircon and some of these things.

996
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,520
Part of that worry to my mind is,

997
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,200
I mean, we're not worried that it's not open

998
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,160
because of course it is, you know,

999
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,280
at least it's open source.

1000
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,200
But one thing that's been so amazing about Linux

1001
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,920
is that it's community driven, right?

1002
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,360
Like it's not just, yes, as we mentioned a second ago,

1003
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,520
there are some huge companies

1004
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,080
that have major influences on it.

1005
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,960
But at the end of the day,

1006
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,880
it's the kernel maintainers and it's Linus

1007
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,360
and it's the community of people actively developing it

1008
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,040
that are making those calls.

1009
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,080
Google and Facebook don't get to do whatever they want.

1010
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,080
But Fuchsia has been this weird little skunk work project

1011
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
in the background.

1012
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,280
And of course we've got some kind of bad taste

1013
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,000
left in our mouth from, you know,

1014
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,960
the AOSP sort of just code dumps over the wall.

1015
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,600
I wonder if Dahlia, I mean,

1016
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,000
with their kind of clever different kernel approach

1017
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,320
and building this technology on Flutter

1018
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,600
and in theory to support a future

1019
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,280
more developed Zircon kernel,

1020
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,320
I wonder if this is a hedge against that success,

1021
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
you know, because instead of just Google

1022
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
and some of these more companies building,

1023
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,040
I don't know, you know, smart devices

1024
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,920
or running it on some like container security system

1025
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,040
in the cloud, this might be an area

1026
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,360
where it could be generating a real community

1027
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,280
that we might actually recognize.

1028
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,640
That is a wild thought.

1029
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,200
So this is a hedge.

1030
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,200
If the Fuchsia on the desktop thing ever does take off,

1031
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,800
at least we've got some community driven,

1032
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,320
community built workstation OS.

1033
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,960
And it doesn't look too bad.

1034
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,480
So they've got their custom,

1035
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,680
some desktop environment called Pangolin.

1036
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,080
And it's kind of pretty.

1037
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,160
I mean, it looks like a Flutter app.

1038
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,640
It's got a strong sort of Google design inspired aesthetic.

1039
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,000
And a lot of it is still super early days.

1040
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,440
They've grayed out all of the apps

1041
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,480
that just don't work at all.

1042
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,200
But even in the ones you can open,

1043
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,280
well, not all of them work as nicely as you might think,

1044
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,000
but there's a lot in here to like,

1045
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,800
including a sort of Android style settings menu

1046
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,200
that's very accessible, easy to use.

1047
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,720
And a clever custom process and container monitoring app

1048
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,320
that looks like once it's working a little bit nicer,

1049
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,480
could be pretty great.

1050
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,680
And these are Flutter applications essentially?

1051
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,160
These are, yeah.

1052
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,280
Okay, I mean, it looks very touch friendly,

1053
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,720
but you could still use it with a mouse.

1054
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,920
Yep, and I was using it to virtualize with a mouse,

1055
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,000
no problem, but you're right.

1056
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,440
I think a lot of the elements here,

1057
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,960
they could be touch friendly.

1058
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,120
It's definitely not anything radical,

1059
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,000
if you're familiar with sort of a Chrome OS

1060
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,680
or a material or an Android design,

1061
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,920
yeah, you're gonna know what this looks like.

1062
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,760
Yeah, I'm getting strong Chrome OS material vibes

1063
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,880
from this, which is I guess what you would expect.

1064
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,840
Though having Deepin on the same episode as Dahlia,

1065
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,280
it so is at opposite ends of the spectrum.

1066
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,120
Deepin is this complete, polished,

1067
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,800
fully feature rich desktop environment

1068
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,320
with desktop applications in an app store

1069
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,080
and a Chrome web browser

1070
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,720
and a full Linux Debian based subsystem, right?

1071
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,360
And then Dahlia is this weird fusion of Linux and Fuchsia

1072
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,720
with the Pangolin desktop on top of it all.

1073
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,360
And I have a hard time even keeping it straight, Wes.

1074
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,200
It seems like a whole new hybrid monster to me.

1075
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,760
Yeah, that's what's kind of fascinating too,

1076
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,080
is seeing it all work out in these different ways.

1077
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,400
Like I guess we could have a whole, you know,

1078
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Flutter based desktop running on top of Linux.

1079
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,960
Sure, some folks might wanna run it on Zircon and Fuchsia,

1080
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,440
but maybe it's just fine for us to run it on Linux too.

1081
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,360
I don't know, I'm not saying I'm in love with Flutter

1082
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,520
or the look of this,

1083
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,560
but I do find it really interesting

1084
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,840
to see these ideas sort of built out

1085
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,360
and see more community involvement with it.

1086
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,280
Maybe Flutter could be a really great technology

1087
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,920
for us to build toolkits, you know, and desktop apps,

1088
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,880
just like we use GTK and Qt today.

1089
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,080
And I agree with ByteBitten in the IRC,

1090
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,200
like this could be a compelling environment

1091
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,960
for the Pinebook Pro kind of device.

1092
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,720
Oh yeah, very true.

1093
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,520
You know, a nice ARM64 machine

1094
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,840
with a good desktop environment on it

1095
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,560
that really could have some decent features.

1096
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
I just am still adjusting to the entire concept.

1097
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
And I think I'm part of this

1098
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,120
where I'm kind of having to reassess

1099
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,240
is where I've come down on Flutter to a degree

1100
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,480
because, you know, when Canonical kind of went all in

1101
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,560
and announced their installer was gonna be in Flutter

1102
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,880
and kind of suggested that other developers

1103
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,000
follow them in that direction,

1104
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,760
I thought, ah, I don't think that's it chief.

1105
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,640
I don't think that's quite it.

1106
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,360
I don't think they are, but you know what?

1107
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,800
When I see this and when I play with Flutter

1108
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,200
and I've gotten emails in from people

1109
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,280
who are building Flutter apps,

1110
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,120
I think to myself, maybe I misread Canonical's read.

1111
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,480
Maybe they got it right.

1112
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,520
And then you go through this album

1113
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,840
that you've linked in the show notes

1114
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,080
and a lot of these apps are like 80% there already.

1115
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,560
And it's not like they've been around for years.

1116
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,000
They've been able to catch up

1117
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,400
to what we would consider modern standard features

1118
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,760
in a remarkably short time.

1119
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,720
And that's noteworthy because we really, really could use

1120
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,680
a healthy third-party developer ecosystem.

1121
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,800
And I'm not saying Flutter is necessarily it,

1122
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,600
but I think going through this

1123
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,920
and having you explain this to me, Wes,

1124
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,640
I think it's made me reevaluate

1125
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,440
that I need to be more open-minded to it

1126
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,320
and that if we wanna see an influx of apps

1127
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,720
that are not Electron,

1128
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,240
I think I've gotta consider this

1129
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,120
a little bit more freely than I had before.

1130
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,640
I have to be a little more open to the idea

1131
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,360
of Flutter apps on the Linux desktop.

1132
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,120
I think it's hard to maybe separate its origin

1133
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,520
and who's pushing it and all of that from,

1134
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,480
at the end, the technical merits

1135
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,520
and what sort of interesting stuff do people make with it.

1136
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,600
Unpluggedcore.com, thank you to our core contributors.

1137
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,440
This episode, the last few have been brought to you

1138
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,240
right by, in this spot right here in the show,

1139
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,480
they've been brought to you by our members.

1140
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,440
Just members, people out there making this show possible.

1141
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,640
Thank you everybody who's become

1142
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,600
an Unpluggedcore contributor.

1143
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,720
You, you're my sunshine.

1144
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
I don't know, what else can I say?

1145
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,040
I mean, you make the show possible.

1146
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,200
We've been in a tight spot this month

1147
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,600
and a lot of you stepped up.

1148
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,040
And I'm really, just really very grateful.

1149
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,480
The summertime sale is going on for a little bit longer,

1150
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,560
a $1 off membership for the lifetime

1151
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,640
when you go to unpluggedcore.com

1152
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,680
and you use the promo code SUMMER.

1153
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,680
I could go on such a soapbox

1154
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,480
about how I think member-driven media

1155
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,160
is so critical right now

1156
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,080
and how I just am so grateful for everybody who stepped up

1157
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,080
and provided some support,

1158
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,000
but there are still, still spots.

1159
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,320
We could still use more.

1160
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,520
We're definitely not at the spot

1161
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,600
anywhere close to where it would replace a sponsor yet,

1162
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,920
but maybe one day we'll get there, unpluggedcore.com

1163
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,840
and use the promo code SUMMER for just a little bit longer

1164
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,120
and you can get a dollar off the lifetime of your membership.

1165
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:21,120
John writes in regarding the AUR on Ubuntu.

1166
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,560
This was last episode where we kind of dove into

1167
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,480
just about any approach we thought might work

1168
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,320
to get our favorite AUR hot apps

1169
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,600
on our boring old Ubuntu or Debian desktops.

1170
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,600
John runs LTS Ubuntu 2004 with LXD and LXC and says,

1171
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,880
I can run just about any secondary Linux OS

1172
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,520
in a container, Arch, Fedora, Alma, whatever,

1173
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,040
with pretty much a full system, sans kernel, of course,

1174
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,600
and they run blazingly fast and almost like the real thing.

1175
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,880
I can even run them in a VM if I so choose,

1176
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,320
although that's still a pretty early feature of LXD.

1177
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,720
I know Docker is the future,

1178
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,840
but I find myself using LXD more than I do Docker, frankly.

1179
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,360
Here's how he does it, though.

1180
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,560
By loading an X11 profile

1181
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,200
that automatically displays to my host system

1182
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,040
when I spin up a new instance,

1183
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,760
I can run, e.g. Arch,

1184
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,440
and install anything I want from the AUR,

1185
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,960
displays to my host as if it's native

1186
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,000
and if it's truly running in Arch,

1187
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,440
which seems much simpler to me

1188
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,760
and more stable than some kind of hackery

1189
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,760
running the AUR compiled directly.

1190
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,720
Now, I don't have a full desktop, of course,

1191
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,080
but that isn't what you said you wanted anyway.

1192
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,960
At any rate, with this setup, I've been pretty happy.

1193
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,520
I can run any application I want from almost any distro,

1194
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,200
and it runs as if it's native.

1195
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,960
Takes seconds to spin one up, and it's great.

1196
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,160
Clever setup, that is not bad, John.

1197
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,520
I think that's a perfect use case in that scenario.

1198
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,240
I love using Toolbox right now.

1199
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,560
It sort of solves what I needed from it,

1200
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,880
but I could see you using a setup similar to this, Wes.

1201
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,600
I mean, yeah, you had me at containers,

1202
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,960
and I'm a big LXD fan.

1203
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,600
And I'm sure you could set up something similar

1204
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,280
with Wayland, too, if you had some need

1205
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,040
or just desire for Wayland-specific apps.

1206
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,080
I kind of feel like I'm not feeling Docker is the future

1207
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,480
as much as it once was.

1208
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,600
I think it's going to have a very, very healthy

1209
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,000
long-term future.

1210
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,160
But Podman is getting more and more love,

1211
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,960
and it's getting used just sort of as a back-end tooling

1212
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,920
more and more by orchestration tools.

1213
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,600
And there's LXD.

1214
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,200
I mean, hell, there's still FreeBSD Jails.

1215
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,920
I think what we're going to have is the concept of containers

1216
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,640
and an OCI standard, and we're going to just sort of mix

1217
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,960
and match the runtime depending on the application and use.

1218
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,240
And it's going to be part of our jobs.

1219
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,400
I use that term very loosely.

1220
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,900
But it's going to be part of people

1221
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,960
that are in the industry's jobs to figure out

1222
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,360
which runtime and tools are correct

1223
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,440
for the right application.

1224
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,120
And I think it's less of a default

1225
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,920
that it's Docker more than ever these days.

1226
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,400
Yeah, really.

1227
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,900
I mean, especially if you're getting

1228
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,360
into some kinds of weirder use cases,

1229
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,640
more system-specific or admin-type use cases.

1230
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,400
I think Docker, especially with all the changes

1231
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,600
that happened to that company and their now focus on desktop

1232
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,760
and developer tooling, it seems like they're

1233
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,400
focused very much on that container runs one thing.

1234
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,840
It's meant there to be like running microservices,

1235
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,880
isolating stuff out and deploying it into the cloud

1236
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,920
or onto your container cluster.

1237
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,060
And that's all great.

1238
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,680
And of course, you can do those things

1239
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,000
with Podman and everything else.

1240
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,520
But between systemdnspawn, LXD, or even just the container

1241
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,440
primitives that are being leveraged by stuff like Flatpak,

1242
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,080
I think you're totally right.

1243
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,560
You just need a file system image.

1244
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,800
Maybe you want to build one yourself

1245
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,440
or pull it out of a virtual machine.

1246
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,000
And then at the end of the day, you're

1247
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,120
kind of just assembling a collection of cgroups

1248
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,960
and some namespaces and running a process.

1249
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,400
And I think for a long time for me personally,

1250
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,440
it'll be either Docker or Podman using Docker Compose

1251
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,400
compatibility, because I do really like that.

1252
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,080
But I'm a multi-container gentleman.

1253
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,700
What can I say?

1254
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,320
It's a lifestyle.

1255
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,160
We have another pick, one of our famous picks for you here,

1256
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,360
a classic, a real spinner.

1257
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,080
It's called Mix, M-I-X-X-X.

1258
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,160
And we've talked.

1259
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,360
No, it's not dirty.

1260
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,440
It's like DJ software.

1261
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,640
We've talked about it before on the show.

1262
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,720
You remember, don't you?

1263
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,480
And it lets you be a smooth operator.

1264
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,080
It mixes music together like a pro.

1265
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,240
And it has new looks, new tagging capabilities.

1266
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,560
And it also has new hardware support.

1267
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,320
And very happy to say it now has support for recording

1268
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,480
and streaming in Opus and high quality AAC codecs.

1269
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,440
It can stream from the software itself out to your endpoint.

1270
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,160
Wow.

1271
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,120
Yeah.

1272
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,440
We love Mix.

1273
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,200
I've used Mix a lot on our live streams over the years.

1274
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,820
So that's why I've mentioned it before on the show.

1275
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,960
It's so neat, though.

1276
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,580
If you just want to throw something on your machine

1277
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,940
and just have it mix together music for you,

1278
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,840
if you've got a couple albums or something,

1279
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,640
and if you do that local music thing, it is so cool.

1280
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,980
And the way it displays the music

1281
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,440
and lets you crossfade everything,

1282
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,640
it just is the neatest.

1283
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,440
And it's just a fantastic open source app.

1284
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,720
Or maybe you're just a nerd who's forced to socialize.

1285
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,300
You're having folks over to your party.

1286
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,920
You don't really want to talk to them.

1287
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,080
But you can be there playing with Mix in the background,

1288
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,120
playing great tunes.

1289
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,720
Are we both just introverts?

1290
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,160
Because both of us, it'd have to be a forced thing

1291
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,680
to have people over.

1292
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,920
It's not just something we do.

1293
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,280
But some people do, Wes.

1294
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,200
Some people, some people.

1295
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,800
You could probably also pipe it into your Zoom calls

1296
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,520
using PipeWire.

1297
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,000
Now, there you go.

1298
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,600
Right.

1299
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,400
Thanks to our sponsor, Cloud Guru Sponsor.

1300
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,640
You can find them on social media.

1301
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,160
Pretty much anywhere that's a social media website,

1302
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,080
they're just slash a Cloud Guru.

1303
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:49,920
It's really easy.

1304
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,120
So they're just about everywhere, slash a Cloud Guru.

1305
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,200
We've got that thing, too, that social media thing.

1306
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,760
The show's at Linux Unplugged.

1307
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,200
And the network is at Jupiter Signal.

1308
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,100
And then if you just want a website,

1309
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,360
if you're old school and you just

1310
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,580
want a website in your Mosaic compatible web browser,

1311
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,400
you can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

1312
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,760
And if you are not catching Linux Action News,

1313
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,280
you're missing all the news, the stuff that's

1314
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,320
going on in the industry all the time in open source and Linux.

1315
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,600
We're covering it there.

1316
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,520
There will be a episode next week.

1317
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,000
It'll just be a little bit later,

1318
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,740
because Wes is going to be traveling,

1319
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,240
like the gentleman man about town that he is.

1320
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,520
And like a pro, even after traveling,

1321
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,920
we're going to sit down and we're

1322
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,160
going to record an episode of Linux Action News.

1323
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,440
I mean, the news doesn't stop.

1324
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:36,960
That's right.

1325
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,760
I can't either.

1326
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,080
No, just can't stop.

1327
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,800
Won't stop.

1328
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,600
So go get that at linuxactionnews.com.

1329
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,260
But for us here, we do it live.

1330
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,920
We do it every single Tuesday at noon Pacific.

1331
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,240
See you next week.

1332
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,840
Same bad time, same bad station.

1333
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,400
We'd love to have you join us.

1334
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,340
Participate in our open Mumble Room

1335
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,640
and conversate with us in the real times in the IRC.

1336
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,120
irc.geekshed.net pound Jupiter Broadcasting.

1337
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,480
Yeah, we're still on Geek Shed.

1338
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,560
I've had people asking.

1339
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:10,120
And I feel like we want to support an open IRC ecosystem.

1340
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,280
So come hang out.

1341
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,040
I'm plugging it right now.

1342
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,120
It's been a while.

1343
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,160
It's been years.

1344
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,160
It's been years.

1345
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,280
irc.geekshed.net pound Jupiter Broadcasting.

1346
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,280
I'm hardly in there, but come say hi.

1347
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,880
All right.

1348
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,960
Links at linuxunplug.com slash 412.

1349
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,040
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

1350
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,680
of the Unplugged program.

1351
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,760
And we will see you right back here next Tuesday.

1352
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:15,040
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

1353
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,000
Everybody head over to elementary's YouTube channel.

1354
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I'll put a link in the show notes, actually.

1355
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,640
Their EDW went pretty great.

1356
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,000
Wes and I had a great time hanging out with those guys.

1357
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,040
And they had people talk about accessibility and usability.

1358
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,760
They talked about creating great looking icons on Linux

1359
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,720
and all kinds of topics.

1360
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,280
Dan did a State of the Platform video too.

1361
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,720
It's all on the elementary YouTube channel.

1362
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,680
So I will put a link in the show notes,

1363
00:51:40,680 --> 00:52:10,640
but you can go find it over on YouTube's.
