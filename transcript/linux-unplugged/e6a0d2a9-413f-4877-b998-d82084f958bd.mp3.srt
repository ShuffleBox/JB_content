1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Google box. And it's basically cameras pointing at people in

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,740
the lounge watching the TV. So you watch people watching TV is

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,500
quite entertaining, mindless bullshit TV. But it's, it's the

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,940
characters. It's like people sat around in their lounge watching

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,820
some TV program, and the way they react to it. It's, it's

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,020
crap. But I love it.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,660
John Greenewald People, wait a minute, you're watching people

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,620
watching TV?

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,500
Jason Valee Yeah, they know they're being watched. They're

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,260
they're, they're

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,940
John Greenewald Are they at home? Are they and they have

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,500
like webcams?

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,660
Jason Valee They're in their homes. No, it's proper cameras.

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,420
John Greenewald Where do I see this? Where do I see this?

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,620
Jason Valee You can probably find it on the YouTube.

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,700
John Greenewald Tell me what it's called. Tell me what it's

17
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:36,860
called.

18
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,860
Jason Valee Google, Google.

19
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,900
Jason Valee This thing called the internet, Chris, everything's

20
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,700
on the internet.

21
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,460
Jason Valee Oh my god, it's not it's not that good. You don't

22
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,580
need to go and find it. It's on channel four in the UK.

23
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,540
John Greenewald I feel like I need to find it.

24
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,980
Jason Valee Google box. Yeah. So anyway, um,

25
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,100
John Greenewald Oh my gosh.

26
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,940
Jason Valee You just reminded me that these two old ladies were

27
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,700
sat there. And they were using a Remington fuzz away just last

28
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,580
week to get all the bubbles on a jumper. Thanks. Was was the

29
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,380
innovation, technological technological innovation of 1986

30
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,140
that thing? It was and then one of them was going to get all the

31
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,260
bubbles off. And the other one was like, Oh, in that marvelous

32
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,620
John Greenewald series 11. Episode nine is literally a

33
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,500
couple of old ladies sitting around watching Britain's Got

34
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,540
Talent antique roadshow, the Queen's Green Planet, buy it

35
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,180
now, and Yorkshire vet. And so you're watching these old ladies

36
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,100
watch those shows.

37
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,980
Jason Valee It's not just those two ladies between lots of

38
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,740
different families. There's like big families, there's an Asian

39
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,660
family, there's a group who live up north. And so there's all

40
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,020
different accents in there and different like characters. And

41
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,900
maybe they're there's a there's a woman and her best mate who

42
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,340
live in a caravan like a mobile home somewhere. And those two

43
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,660
sitting next to each other quite is just quite entertaining the

44
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,820
kind of characters.

45
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,700
John Greenewald If anybody ever wondered if there was a market

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,020
for people watching people play video games, this shows you

47
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,180
they're totally if there's people. Can you hear the TV

48
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,700
show? Can you hear what they're watching? Or do you just cut to

49
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,060
they cut to it. So you know what they're watching you get the

50
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,420
clips of whatever it is they're watching and then it cuts to

51
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,900
them. Okay, as if you're cutting to the audience of a TV. So

52
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,900
you're watching the reaction. I see. I can't I can't believe I've

53
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,740
outed myself as watching this program because you'll never

54
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,980
live it down. Not for a day. Brilliant. I love it. My guilty

55
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,060
pleasure. Good. Oh, wow. I can hear the guilt just peeling off

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,620
you. Goggles box. Well, guess what I'm adding to use that I

57
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,020
just I gotta see it. I just gotta see it.

58
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,020
And it's and it's actually current because they record them

59
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,060
like that weekend. And so it's about the programs that you will

60
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,740
have watched the previous week. Oh, that is handy. Yeah. This is

61
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:54,220
Linux Unplugged episode 247 for May 1 2018. Welcome to Linux

62
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,380
Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's still smack dab in

63
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,900
the middle of the Linux fest hangover. My name is Chris. My

64
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,060
name is Wes. Hello, Mr. Payne. Hello there. Are you well fed,

65
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,340
sir? Oh, I am stuffed. Yeah, I I supplied the burgers and West

66
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,980
supplied the caffeine. So this should be a good show coming up

67
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,340
on this week's episode. Not one but two, two major distribution

68
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,020
releases for door 28 is out today. Ubuntu 1804 came out just

69
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,460
the other day. And we're going to give you our initial

70
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,820
impressions on both of them loaded them up kick the tires.

71
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,860
And man is there some cool stuff in both of them. I cannot wait

72
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,300
to tell you about that. So it's a packed distro episode. Plus,

73
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,300
Mr. Daniel foray is here from elementary OS to give us a

74
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,220
little taste of what's just around the corner in Juneau. And

75
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,300
some of those features speak deep to my soul. You guys will

76
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,540
totally understand once we get there. And then later on, did

77
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,460
you hear that Google just forked a popular GTK theme? What?

78
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,540
And you know how NFS tables is the new hotness to replace IP

79
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,500
tables? Yep, that's out something news coming in. And

80
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,340
the one the only Mr. Alan Jude will stop by the show live from

81
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,620
Linux fest Northwest and tell us all about BP F plus a new

82
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,500
release of dark tables out and listener Brent stopping by the

83
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,740
show to give us a walkthrough of that. And then we will do our

84
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,860
Ubuntu 1804 roundup with a look at the flavors, the new features

85
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,260
in Ubuntu itself, our thoughts on some of the server stuff

86
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,940
they're introducing and much, much more. But before I go any

87
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,300
further, before I even get to the virtual log, a special in

88
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,740
studio log member, Mr. Brent, the very, very, we're gonna call

89
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,580
him dark table expert now for the show is actually joining us

90
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,700
right now. Hello, Brent. Hey, how's it going, guys? It's

91
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,500
going good. How are you doing? I'm doing good. Barbecue is

92
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,100
good. A couple of nights on the couch. Good here at the studio

93
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,420
Brent stopped by for Linux fest Northwest took some great

94
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,420
pictures. He's been talking to me about dark table. We've got a

95
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,420
new release of dark table to to sort of button it all up. So

96
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,340
we'll be getting to that a little bit in the show. So stay

97
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,140
tuned for that. And now, without any further ado, we got to

98
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,340
bring in that virtual log time appropriate greetings, Mumble

99
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,420
Room. Hello. I heard that random UbiKon. I heard that. Yeah,

100
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,180
actually, that looked like an amazing venue Wimpy. I saw your

101
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,340
mate roundup of the new features and it looked like you're in a

102
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,100
church of Ubuntu. It was impressive. We were in an

103
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,700
historic building and it was rather wonderful. Yeah. Well, I

104
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,220
would love to chat about that in a moment. So let's get there

105
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,300
too. But why don't we start out with the huge news of the day

106
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,140
just to get things rolling here on the old podcast. And that is

107
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,740
the release of Fedora 28 Fedora 28 landed today as we record and

108
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,820
it's available as an atomic workstation image too. Yes, it

109
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,260
is, which is the first time that's officially happening.

110
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,500
It's not all out. They haven't really talked about it a lot

111
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,300
yet. But if you go on the atomic development list, which I troll

112
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,300
all the time every damn day, and you'll see that they have a

113
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,660
release announcement over there, which is a pretty freaking big

114
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,020
deal. But let's talk about the workstation version. I can't

115
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,660
believe I'm about to tell you this. Let me double check. Is

116
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,540
this? Is this actually fedora? It's real. You sure? Oh, yeah,

117
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,300
100%. Sure. Okay, verified. Well, a new feature,

118
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,340
apparently, I don't believe it a fedora 28 is the inclusion of

119
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,900
popular third party software repositories that you can just

120
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,300
turn on in gnome 328. They include applications. Nvidia

121
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:31,180
proprietary graphics driver, Google Chrome, the steam client.

122
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,620
Yes, and more like a pie charm are now all available with just

123
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,380
a few clicks in gnome software under fedora 28. That's what I

124
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,260
did not think I would see this day. But hey, this is this

125
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,140
isn't anything I just I can't even right now I'm still

126
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,780
processing this. And I think what it's got to be is fedora

127
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,180
trying to appeal to developers who use these tools. That's got

128
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,460
to be what it is. I don't know anybody in the Mamba room want

129
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,820
to before we move on to the other features want to just take

130
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,620
a moment and reflect on the fact that fedora is making it a

131
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,140
couple clicks now to install Google Chrome or the Nvidia

132
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,700
driver. Anybody think that's remarkable besides me? That's I

133
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,540
mean, I think it's definitely a change from you know, the

134
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,620
behavior we've seen in the past, but it's probably can't be the

135
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,420
only one somebody in that mom rooms got to think that's

136
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,340
remarkable. Somebody does they just don't want to say I

137
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,620
understand. It's remarkable. There you go. Isn't this

138
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,260
something that Ubuntu mate has done for a while? Oh, sure.

139
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,460
They're definitely by no means the first. Absolutely. I just

140
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,460
they're doing it would be the very, very last mini Mac. Did

141
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,300
you want to throw something in there? Yeah, I tried to install

142
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,740
Chrome into chromium browser last time and it told me that

143
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,460
it needed 600 megabytes to install all the packages. I was

144
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,180
pretty much surprised. So I kind of test how much the normal

145
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,460
Google Chrome uses. This is going to be something I'll be

146
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,940
testing to. I'll be testing all of this a lot more soon, but I

147
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,660
want to take a spoiler alert. I'm going to round up some of

148
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,860
the new features and new things people are talking about what

149
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,420
initially seems really great to me. I'm not giving you my

150
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,340
review for either Ubuntu 1804 or Fedora 28 yet. I've got

151
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,260
initial impressions. I'm going to share those with you, but I

152
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,700
want to run both of these for a while because I have been

153
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,100
living in Kubuntu so deeply that I just need to take time to

154
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,900
give them a proper quote unquote review, but I'll give you

155
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,180
something else in Fedora 28 that seems initially pretty

156
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,300
appealing to me. They've really sort of tuned down some of the

157
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,380
things that suck battery life with various different hardware

158
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,460
power saving features that they're turning on by default.

159
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,420
Now, these are all things that scripts will turn on or some

160
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,140
people, other distributions turn on automatically, but I think

161
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,220
in totality, this is actually pretty impressive. So we now

162
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,140
have a new default saddling power management policy on all

163
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,700
the Intel mobile chip sets that is way more disk friendly low

164
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,940
power. So like when it's idle, it'll save approximately one to

165
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,380
one and a half watts of power on idle, which when you have like

166
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,660
a 50 watt battery or a 36 watt battery, I will take anything I

167
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,380
can get. Additionally, the Intel in HDA audio codec power saving

168
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,220
is now enabled by default with a one second timeout, which I

169
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,580
think that's pretty pretty good. One second means if there's

170
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,580
nothing going out over the sound card for over a second, if you

171
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,580
think about it, that's a pretty long time in computer land. And

172
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,860
then that saves about point four watts of power on idle. Now

173
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,020
finally, USB auto suspend for USB Bluetooth receivers has been

174
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,020
enabled by default, which saves an additional point four watts

175
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,180
of power. You combine all that together and it's pretty

176
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,020
noteworthy. And again, not the only distro to do it, but I

177
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,420
think it's pretty nice to see Fedora including this stuff by

178
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,940
default. I think everybody would agree with that. And then of

179
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,300
course, the headline feature, the biggest deal is that it's

180
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,780
shipping with GNOME 3.28, which includes the new Thunderbolt

181
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,660
Bolt D support, which is that system daemon for security

182
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,780
connecting for the security of Thunderbolt devices when they

183
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,060
connect and allows gnome shell to interact and alert you about

184
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,100
that. And then finally, for RMS sake, they're including virtual

185
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,700
box guest additions by default now, and they're shipped in the

186
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,940
Fedora workstation install. Any installation of Fedora

187
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,100
workstation as a guest on virtual box will have the guest

188
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,700
edition features working out of the box.

189
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,380
I think that really that just plays to your case that this is

190
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,540
these are the developer aimed improvements, right? But nice.

191
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,820
I mean, really, really, really nice. I will say they have a

192
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,140
little blurb in here about the streamed on installation. I was

193
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,700
skeptical. I've been something of an Anaconda hater in the

194
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,500
past, but it's better. It's getting better. I'm glad to see

195
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
it. Yeah, it's pretty painless.

196
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,860
Yeah, it was I went through an installation on a laptop earlier

197
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,980
today, and I let it do the auto disk partitioning for the first

198
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,740
time. And it you know, it uses LVM and it makes some it makes

199
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,980
some sane judgments. And the other thing I've noticed is I

200
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,140
feel like it's faster now to when it's actually throwing

201
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,620
files on the disk. I agree. Yeah. Did you like it felt like

202
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,100
it was already copying files before? Well, part of it is

203
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,460
because it does like a post install to where it runs you

204
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,820
through creating the wizard for users, and like setting a few

205
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,540
other small details about the system. So it takes that out of

206
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,580
the installation process. So you're really in the

207
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,940
installation, you're setting your disk configuration, you're

208
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,220
adding a user account, and you're setting your time zone.

209
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,140
And then there's final details that'll ask you after the system

210
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,700
boots. And in fact, you don't even have to add a user account

211
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,780
necessarily. Oh, that's perfect. Yeah. And you just get to you

212
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,340
get to blasting files on the system. It's, it's a really,

213
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,740
it's a really good version of Fedora 28. And since Ubuntu is

214
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,020
shipping the same version of Gnome, I'll just say this now.

215
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,700
And maybe if anybody in the Mumble Room wants to chime in

216
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:18,140
with their thoughts. This is by far the best version of Gnome

217
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,780
I've ever used. It is cleaner, simpler, and more efficient than

218
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,980
macOS. I think it is if Apple were to have to hit the reset

219
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,100
button today. If macOS wasn't nearly a 14 year old operating

220
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,620
system, but say it was nine months old. I really think this

221
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,140
is, this is what they would have as a goal. The new system

222
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,220
settings is just it's so good. Like the Adaptia theme now is

223
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,700
good. Ubuntu's theme is, it feels a little old to me. But in

224
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,820
actuality, Gnome still looks great. It still looks good. So

225
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,540
it's such a good version of Gnome. It's not one that's

226
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,940
pulling me back to Gnome. But if you are a Gnome user, Gnome

227
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,020
328 really nails it. And of course Fedora's always got a

228
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,700
great implementation. Does anybody in the Mumble Room have

229
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,180
any thoughts on the Gnome aspect, either for Ubuntu or

230
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,580
Fedora?

231
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,260
So this begs the question, has it crashed for you yet?

232
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,300
Well, I've only used it a little bit. You know, I've only, I

233
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,020
have not, and I'm not using it in production. I don't have any

234
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,780
intention to. So I'll see, you know, in the review after I've

235
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,020
used it for a couple of weeks, we'll see. At least get a week

236
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,180
into it. But if you are a Gnome fan, it definitely feels pretty

237
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,500
fast. You know, it always feels good on a clean install, but it

238
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,380
just is so great. It's definitely worth it.

239
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,340
I really appreciate that. Because you know, when I'm

240
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,540
running Gnome on Arch or something else, I'm really fine

241
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,820
with Gnome defaults. I don't do a ton of tuning to it. They do

242
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,660
a little bit more than even I'm willing to do on most

243
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,420
installations. So it's just pleasant.

244
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,060
Yeah, and Gnome Photos also is now the default in Fedora 28.

245
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,740
That's finally coming along. It's been a long time coming.

246
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,540
Just small things, lots of small things in there. Check it

247
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,020
out. We'll have links in the show notes if you guys would

248
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,860
like. But last chance if you, if you guys out there have any

249
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,660
thoughts before I get to my review, let me know. Go to

250
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,740
linuxunplug.com slash contact and send them in your thoughts

251
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,260
and I'll let or something like should try on Fedora. Because

252
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,460
since it's not my daily driver, love to know. Also, linuxunplug.com

253
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,740
slash contact. Last chance to get in before the review comes.

254
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,700
Because I, you know, always be down for trying something or

255
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,220
your experiences. Also really good. Yeah. I'll share an

256
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,780
experience with you, Wes. How about that?

257
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,420
Please do.

258
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,220
linux.ting.com

259
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,020
Linux.ting.com. It's mobile. It's better than unlimited. If

260
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,180
you just use less, you pay less. You don't have to pay for a

261
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,540
whole bunch of minutes or a ton of SMS messages. I don't, I

262
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,100
don't know if I used a single SMS message last month. I don't

263
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,060
actually think I did. The only thing I might have done to

264
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,980
trigger an SMS message would be to log into a Twitter account

265
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,660
from like a new installation. And then it does like that SMS

266
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,220
verify thing that I hate so much. That might have been it.

267
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,140
And I could, there's other ways to get to that. So why pay for

268
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,740
messages? There's no need. There's no reason. I don't even

269
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,300
need 100 messages, let alone 1000 or whatever. It's not 2001

270
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,140
anymore. Yeah, it's not. It's not. And you've got Wi Fi at

271
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,980
work. So why are you paying for data when you're not using it?

272
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,020
Or if you got Wi Fi at home, it doesn't make any sense. And you

273
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,900
might have better signal on GSM networks in your area or maybe

274
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,860
on CDMA. So why can't you choose? See, that's all just

275
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,500
normal with Ting. You, you pick and choose what works best for

276
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,060
you. There's no contract, there's no determination fee.

277
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,980
It's really mobile the way it should be. If the whole market

278
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,100
had to start over today, this is what they would have to do. I

279
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,220
get messages all the time from people outside the country.

280
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,900
They're like, you know, that's how it kind of works here.

281
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,780
That's how, you know, the way Ting works. That's kind of how

282
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,180
it works here. And I'm like, yeah, that's not how it works

283
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,820
here in the States. And that's what makes Ting so great. It's

284
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,300
pay for what you use, six minutes for the line. And then

285
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,620
just whatever you use, minutes, messages and megabytes, boom,

286
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,660
you're done. You don't want it. You don't want the phone

287
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,580
anymore. You turn it off. You're done. You want to bring over a

288
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,740
new phone, you can activate the whole freaking thing through

289
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,220
their webpage. They got a BYOD page where you can double check

290
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,700
everything. You put in the ESIN or whatever it is through the

291
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,980
website, boom, activate, you're done. You never even had to talk

292
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,660
to a human being. But here's the crazy thing. If you need to,

293
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,500
they've got really nice ones. Friendly support people that

294
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,660
are actually phone geeks. Crazy concept. Control panel to manage

295
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,980
everything and then great support to back it up. You can

296
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,860
buy a device directly. It's not loaded with like the Ting

297
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,900
experience. They're not going to prevent updates because they

298
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,860
need to get their new Ting video store on your phone. They

299
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,420
don't do any of that stuff. You just want to use them for simple

300
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,340
services or you want to use them as your main internet

301
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,620
connection. Ting don't care. And you can get started at

302
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,420
linux.ting.com. Take $25 off a device or get $25 in service

303
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,660
credit if you bring one. That's linux.ting.com. And a big thank

304
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,820
you to Ting for sponsoring this here program, linux.ting.com.

305
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,380
Now, did you hear the story that we covered in Linux Action News

306
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,140
this week? Google has just forked a popular GTK theme. And

307
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,500
what are they doing? What are they doing?

308
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,340
I really want to know.

309
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,780
It's like Adaptia, but it's Googlified, paperized and

310
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,740
blued. And it's a new GTK theme that's got a material design

311
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,980
and it looks pretty good. It's called Cross Adaptia right now

312
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,700
and it's up on Google's Codehub. And commits show that their

313
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,100
designers are already busy making changes and adjustments

314
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,500
to the theme. And it looks like it's something that'll be used

315
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,380
on Chrome OS as part of their new Linux application

316
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,260
containers, which starts to suggest that we're not just

317
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,180
going to be seeing a terminal for SSH, but perhaps the

318
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,260
ability to run things like Eclipse or other GTK

319
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,460
applications inside Chrome OS. And you got to figure Google's

320
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,940
designing this for end users if they're going in to the trouble

321
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,420
of creating their own theme that looks like other Google

322
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:25,620
properties.

323
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,580
This is a lot of specific work for something else, right? It's

324
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,100
not just a whim. There's people being paid to work on this.

325
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,820
So why does Chrome OS have its own theme now, Wes? What do you

326
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
think's going on here? We're gonna start seeing Linux desktop

327
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,700
apps on Chrome OS?

328
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,140
I'm kind of concerned. I'm kind of excited. What does it do to

329
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,740
their, you know, their sort of mantra of these are like simple

330
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,100
machines that you, you know, can't mess up that aren't

331
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,380
complicated for people to use. I know they're implemented, you

332
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,420
know, with containers and other technologies to sort of keep

333
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,380
things isolated and controlled, but it's still, it might seem

334
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,940
like a different sell to, you know, a simple user.

335
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,940
Yeah, yeah, I wonder if it's not just, it could just be about

336
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,180
adding additional value to Chromebooks to make them more

337
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,060
appealing to businesses or system administrators and

338
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,100
developers could totally be all of that. But I do also have some

339
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,140
conspiracy bacon.

340
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,100
Fry it up, fry it up for me.

341
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,260
We do have, we've been eating a lot of meat these last few days

342
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,620
here at the studio. So why not fry up a little bacon and I'll

343
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,660
tell you what I think it is. And I hope I hope I'm wrong. But I

344
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,540
think Fuchsia OS is going to replace the underpinnings of

345
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,060
Android as the core operating system. They're going to boot

346
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,740
Linux out of Android and it could be semi devastating for

347
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,260
Linux. I'm not the only person that thinks this obviously, but

348
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,180
some people I really respect recently have been talking more

349
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,140
and more about it. And it seems like Fuchsia OS could be the

350
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,060
perfect little wedge to get Linux out to take care, to just

351
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,380
get rid of all of that pain in the arse LTS issue, pain in the

352
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,900
arse GPL stuff, have their own OS in there that's been

353
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,100
purpose-built to power mobile devices. And they essentially

354
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,860
would dump Linux for their Android platform. And at the

355
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,300
same time, double down on Linux on the Chrome OS platform. So

356
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,940
Chrome OS will stay Linux, Chrome OS will have the ability

357
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,220
to run Linux applications. Chrome OS will have the ability

358
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,180
to run the terminal. You know, you'll have complete Linux

359
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,460
environments in these containers. They may even go the

360
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,060
direction of Windows 10 and start offering different distro

361
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,820
environments that are similar to like the Windows subsystem

362
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,180
where you can pull down Ubuntu or you can pull down SUSE.

363
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,260
They're going to have probably, you know, the same thing, CentOS,

364
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,300
Ubuntu containers, maybe not initially.

365
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,900
Right. This has reminded me also kind of got like a like a Mac

366
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,820
feel. They've got their separate phone controlled

367
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,380
environment and then maybe something a little more

368
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,020
developer, power user friendly on the desktop.

369
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,860
Yeah. Yeah. You could see how that would be appealing to them,

370
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,740
right? And I don't know about that because I feel like if

371
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,740
Android switched away from Linux, Linux development could

372
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,460
lose quite a bit of momentum. But it does seem like this was

373
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,100
this is where this is going. Anybody in the Mumble Room have

374
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,220
any thoughts on my bacon?

375
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,500
Well, we're just about a week away from Google I know. So we

376
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,300
could hear some stuff next week.

377
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,900
Yep. Yeah, we may have answers sooner than later. I'm planning

378
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,060
to cover bits of IO that are interesting in Tech Talk today.

379
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,820
And I'll probably if there's anything very Linux specific,

380
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,620
I'll cover here in this show. Well, regardless of my bacon

381
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,700
and regardless of Android, I think this is great for Chrome

382
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,260
OS, because it means more desktop Linux apps in way, way

383
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,180
more users hands at a lower point of entry for cost. And in

384
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,580
some cases, like my kids, they get these books via school, the

385
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,580
Chromebooks, they just boom, here you go, here kid, here's a

386
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,180
here's an entire laptop with the Google Chrome browser on it

387
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,820
have at it.

388
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,740
That makes me a lot more excited, right? There's a

389
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,620
terminal there they can actually play with and learn from.

390
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,180
That's great.

391
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,540
I think you are a session everybody now is paying for

392
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,660
laptops that are made to seduce for selling services, not for

393
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,540
you to own them.

394
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,860
That's a fair point. Yeah, their goal here is to get more people

395
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,700
locked into Google services. And they're going to use Linux apps

396
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,700
as the way to sweeten that pot.

397
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,860
That makes me feel horrible now. Not even that, not even not

398
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,820
even just the Google services is the apps will be services.

399
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,580
Yeah, and I see what you're saying too, because in real,

400
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,660
realistically, you may have to have like, certain Google

401
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,700
account to get these things or you may be controlled through

402
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,020
the admin control panel of the community or the industry of

403
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,860
the business administrator. So yeah, okay. Well, I want to

404
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,300
change topics now, because that's really that's the

405
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,820
question. Yeah. We had an interesting chat at Linux fest

406
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,380
Northwest with one Mr. Alan Jude about BPF. Now you may have

407
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,260
heard and there's an article that I'll link to that was

408
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,780
posted just a couple of days ago, why is the kernel

409
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:41,060
community replacing IB tables with BPF? And this is a pretty

410
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,220
complicated little system that will be living inside the

411
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,220
kernel. There's a great talk that just came out recently that

412
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,020
really explains that this is essentially an entire virtual

413
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,300
machine that will be running inside the Linux kernel. Now I

414
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,180
know that sounds like a really bad idea. But there's other

415
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,860
virtual machines that already exist that we just don't really

416
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,860
talk about very much. It's, it's already happened that damage

417
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,260
has been done. This will be one of many and they really on the

418
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,980
right track. They look like they're securing this thing

419
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,660
well. And Jed, Wes and Alan Jude were sitting down at the

420
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,580
booth at Linux fest Northwest. And the topic came up and I

421
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,140
thought it'd be great to get the clarification on what BPF is

422
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,340
right here on the show. Successor to IP tables is NF

423
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,660
tables, right? Okay. So there's a successor to that now too. I

424
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,020
was reading a little bit about that. Yeah. Is that EBF

425
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,500
tables? EBPF is the tracing framework. I think this is just

426
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,420
a BPF based firewall thing. So do you know what BPF stands

427
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,260
for? Berkeley packet filter. So, you know, you're like, oh,

428
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,380
look, if we compile the firewall rules down to a BPF, we can

429
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,980
match them fast. Like TCP dump does. You know what firewalls

430
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:57,980
been doing that for 20 years? Yeah. It turns out there's a

431
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,020
fast way to do a firewall. It's because, oh, look, this machine

432
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,260
language is specifically designed to match packets is

433
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,580
really good at matching packets. Yeah, totally. Well,

434
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:16,980
writing the writing rules can be difficult. Just the syntax

435
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:23,500
between TCP dump and Wireshark, they don't use the same syntax

436
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,420
and I find it continually confusing. I'll jump from one to

437
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:32,060
the other. I have to go back to the web page and look up more

438
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,820
examples because I can't remember them all. Yeah. Back in

439
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,500
school, for our firewall class, we learned three firewalls, IP

440
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:45,300
tables, IPF, which is the predecessor to PF on FreeBSD and

441
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:53,860
OpenBSD, and Cisco PIC. The Cisco we had was literally like a

442
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,620
486 based appliance. Like the old one. Before they made it a

443
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,100
dedicated, it was like a regular 486 with some firewall cards in

444
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,700
it or something. But the Cisco PIC, that's been dead for a

445
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,860
decade. Or it should have been. Yes. So it was pretty much dead

446
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,100
when we were learning it. But the syntax is pretty similar to

447
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,940
what you would get on a newer Cisco like an ASA or whatever.

448
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,860
Even ASAs are out of fashion. In particular, we had one client

449
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,300
who was doing some streaming video. It was TV Ontario had

450
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,620
this system called Homework Help, where after school, they

451
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,740
would pay some teachers to be available via like an internet

452
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,020
chat thing to help you with your math homework. And every

453
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,380
student in like grade 7 through 10 got it for free if they were

454
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,460
enrolled in a public school. But they would have a streaming

455
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,700
video part, too. And they were pushing up to like 600 megabits

456
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,180
out of the network. And their Cisco ASA couldn't handle that.

457
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:59,060
Couldn't keep up. Yeah. So we replaced that with, we turned

458
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,380
their dev server into a PF sense. And now we can push a gigabit

459
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,060
with no problem. Yeah, that's Alan's way of saying it's

460
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,460
because of performance. It's because you can compile it down

461
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,380
to this machine language and the rules can be executed wicked

462
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,820
fast. He goes into some bottleneck troubleshooting that

463
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,580
he did for a 40 gigabit. I think it was actually two. So it was

464
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,500
in total 80 gigabits worth of transfer bottleneck

465
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,100
troubleshooting he did on a free BSD system in this week's

466
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,300
episode of tech snap. Yeah, go check that out. Yeah, tech snap

467
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,060
dot systems. But BPF is coming IP tables is out. And speaking

468
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,100
of other things that are just coming down the pipe, not too

469
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,300
far away is the next version of elementary OS. And I am getting

470
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,620
a little hyped. I got to be honest and not might be because

471
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,900
Mr. Daniel for a keep stopping by and tell me about all the

472
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,580
great stuff. And this one speaks to me, Dan, deeply, deeply

473
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,980
speaks to me. I love this stuff in the new update you guys

474
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,660
posted about notifications. And I didn't realize how much

475
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,860
frickin work you guys have put into it, like the heuristics

476
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,300
that you had in place. But now we're coming out. Can you kind

477
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,500
of recap what's going on here? Yeah, so kind of historically,

478
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,300
what happened was last cycle, we introduced this notifications

479
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,060
indicator, right? So that when an app sends a notification, and

480
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,180
you miss it, the notifications indicator will catch it and you

481
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,940
can review it later, same as you have on like notifications that

482
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,580
are on your phone. The problem is that only some applications

483
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,340
are actually sending their ID with the notification. So some

484
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,780
notifications come through, we didn't really know which app

485
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,140
it's from. So we had this heuristic in place to try to

486
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:37,060
guess. And it sometimes was wrong. And so we get people

487
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,740
saying, hey, you're a notification, notifications

488
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,660
indicators broken, it doesn't work, it, you know, it does it

489
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,020
wrong. And we're saying, well, you know, the problem was that

490
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,740
these applications never sent an ID. And so it was kind of hard

491
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,180
to say, you know, hey, this is not really our fault. While we

492
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,140
still had this heuristic it. So now we're pulling the heuristic

493
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,740
out. And any application that doesn't send its ID is just

494
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,940
going to be categorized as other. But at the same time, we

495
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,620
went and we submitted patches upstream to electron into

496
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,140
Firefox and into lib notify to make sure that application

497
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,860
developers had an easy way to make sure their applications are

498
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,020
reporting their ID correctly and didn't have to use like the raw

499
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,140
D bus API. And I would imagine electron apps are probably the

500
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,420
most frequent offender of this missing ID. Yeah. And the

501
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,940
electron patch has actually been committed upstream as well.

502
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,140
Oh, great. Yeah, that's hopefully that that'll fix it

503
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,820
for all electron apps. And this isn't just specific to

504
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,340
elementary OS and Pantheon. This is actually how I did

505
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,900
notifications identifying gnome shell as well. Oh, that's

506
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,660
awesome. So that'll be great for gnome users. Everybody wins.

507
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,580
Now, what's the lib notify part for time? It sounds like it's

508
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,540
involved with notifications. But what specifically is lib

509
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,420
notify responsible for? So we have a problem because way back

510
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,700
in the day, there was a specification proposed that was

511
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,780
the free desktop notification specification. But it only kind

512
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,820
of lived on the gnome wiki. And it was kind of adopted de facto

513
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,940
by a bunch of different desktops, but it never really

514
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,140
made it into free desktop. And lib notify kind of represents

515
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:24,100
that spec. Well, gnome added G notification to their stack. And

516
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,340
this is kind of a new version of the spec. But it is not really

517
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,700
compatible with the old lib notify version. And all of the

518
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,580
gnome apps use G notification. And so it's like different

519
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,260
libraries that kind of do the same thing, but don't all kind

520
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,460
of respect each other. So there's a bigger story. And

521
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,620
we're trying to work closer with upstreams to make sure that we

522
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,900
all kind of agree, like, what should the spec be? And what

523
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,540
should it support and try to make sure that things work good

524
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,820
across desktops. But this is kind of a first step, right on.

525
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,660
And also just honorable mention here, files is looking so good.

526
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,020
And it sounds like so clean. Yeah, look at that. I mean,

527
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,620
beautiful. We're looking at a picture of it here in the

528
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,260
studio. We'll have a link at linuxonplug.com slash 247. If

529
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,340
you guys want to read dancehall post and see the picture of it.

530
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,780
It is great looking, Dan. And I gotta say, it sounds like a lot

531
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,780
of the back end is sort of getting retooled to match the

532
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,300
more modern development processes on elementary OS.

533
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,740
Yeah, absolutely. I think that some people might know that

534
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,220
files is our oldest app. And we started way back in the very

535
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,620
beginning with a Nautilus fork. And then we eventually kind of

536
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,580
outgrew that and then wrote this file manager Marlin in the

537
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,620
modern day elementary files comes from that background. So

538
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,260
it was a C app. It was before we adopted Vala. So we're kind of

539
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,140
still migrating that code base. And this cycle, we were able to

540
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,260
do way more of that and a lot of cleanup and migrating to better

541
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,420
versions of utilities from upstream libraries like GTK and

542
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,780
GIO instead of using our own internal libraries. So that's,

543
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,420
you know, performance improvements, stability

544
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,540
improvements, more maintainable code, it's just getting way

545
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,380
better all around.

546
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,540
That does sound really good. Well, I will definitely kick the

547
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,540
tires when it comes to any other honorable mentions you want to

548
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,180
toss out from the post before we leave the rest to the listener

549
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,780
at home to read.

550
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,020
One thing actually I'm really excited about is improvements

551
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:23,060
going into elementary code. Oh, yeah. And, and we, so we landed

552
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,820
support for editor config by default in elementary code last

553
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,540
month. And this month, we have it turned on and enabled out of

554
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,380
the box. And now the guys over at elementary code drew a nice

555
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,940
little icon for us somewhere on their homepage. Now,

556
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,980
that looks so good. We're seeing, we're seeing some steady

557
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,940
updates to code this cycle. Like this has gotten a lot of

558
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,460
attention.

559
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,900
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it. We're definitely trying to

560
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,900
get more feedback from developers about the tooling on

561
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,540
our platform and documentation and find out like how we can

562
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,460
meet their needs and make it really easy to write

563
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,620
applications for App Center and elementary OS.

564
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,740
I love the focus, you know, there's so much focus on on

565
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,580
application developers, you're actually curating this really

566
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,380
great environment for people to do that. So all these

567
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,220
improvements, people are just going to be happier to be

568
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,580
there.

569
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,500
That's how we got up to 87 new.

570
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,900
87. That is really good. That's that's gonna be a that'll be a

571
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,220
strong amount in the App Center when Juno releases. That's

572
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,940
really cool. Yeah, how how close are we getting to a beta

573
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,780
release here? Because I know there's just what under 10 bugs

574
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,300
left to get squashed.

575
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,860
We are so super close. So we're kind of we're kind of looking at

576
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,460
like if we can maybe punt a couple of those issues to the

577
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,780
second beta so we can get a public beta out sooner and like

578
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,980
what are the kind of the other release tasks we have to do with

579
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,980
the website and things like that. So I'm trying to get it

580
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,500
pushed out ASAP and I'm working with our teams to make that

581
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,180
happen. But as it stands right now, we just have the seven

582
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,700
issues left on our tracker.

583
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,620
Seven. Okay, I'm excited. That's I like that that's it's not a

584
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,620
date. It's it's when the issues are closed or when the issues

585
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,940
can be at least punted to the next beta. That's great. Well,

586
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,340
Dan, keep us posted because it's it's a fascinating case

587
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,380
study to watch this for the show. And it's it's fun to see

588
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,260
how you guys work the thought you put into all of this how it

589
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,140
all is kind of been coming together over the last year. And

590
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,740
we're so close now that you got to keep us posted because we're

591
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,820
almost to the goal, which is the release. All right. Well, we

592
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,940
have much much more to talk about as the show goes on. I'm

593
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,460
really looking forward to covering some important news and

594
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,420
and and then talking a little dark table because this is I

595
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,620
think going to be one of my new tools in my bag. But before we

596
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,260
get there, I got to mention the tool that I've had for years

597
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,140
now. And that's the tools over DigitalOcean. And you can be one

598
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,820
to do dot co wait, hold on. Let me get that prop out. Sorry,

599
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,580
Russell. There we go. Oh, yeah, it's so fresh. It's not to

600
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,700
really know. I've done a lot of wrestling at do dot co slash

601
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,460
unplug to go there to get a $100 credit when you sign up with

602
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,300
a new account. Yeah, I said $100. Yeah, I know we usually

603
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,820
say $10. I said $100. And with the three cents an hour, my

604
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,340
favorite rig. I mean, you're going to go nuts. Do dot co

605
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,500
slash unplug DigitalOcean is simple infrastructure that you

606
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,620
can deploy and use it in production, use it for testing,

607
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,220
use it for learning in less than 55 seconds. And everything

608
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,100
is SSDs. Every single machine, they have 12 data centers

609
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,740
around the world. They got 40 gigabit connections coming into

610
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,780
those hypervisors. The whole stack runs Linux KVM for the

611
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,140
virtualizer that they put an amazing interface that no one

612
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,380
else in the industry can touch on top of all of it. They call

613
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,620
it the dashboard. It's a dashboard for days. And then to

614
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,180
make things better, they've got an API that's well documented,

615
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,620
clear, easy to read. And I'm pretty sure that dashboard is a

616
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,620
client of that API, because everything the dashboard

617
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,100
supports, you can do in the API. That's great, because that

618
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,860
means there's a ton of open source code that's already

619
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
written that you can take advantage of good to go just

620
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,580
have added Haas or build something yourself from the

621
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,500
ground up do.co slash unplugged, but it gets even

622
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,620
better. Even now, what is 1804 been out, but just just a few

623
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:10,180
days. They are rapidly updating their documentation. I just

624
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,300
today read a guide on how to configure Apache with this with

625
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,900
an SSL cert on 1804 in just a few minutes. Easy to read,

626
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,540
clear documentation. They're updating everything for the new

627
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,260
releases. You can spin up whichever version of Linux you

628
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,540
like, or you can even deploy that free BSD. I know, I know.

629
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,340
And they also recently announced flexible droplets

630
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,900
where you can mix and match the different things that you

631
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,620
need. So maybe you need a lot of CPU for your application,

632
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,860
more CPU. You don't need much disk. Yeah, just put it all in

633
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,260
CPU. Or you want a ton of disk because you're doing some

634
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,060
logging and you don't need a ton of RAM or CPU or whatever

635
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,860
you need, you mix and match flexible droplets $15 a month

636
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,660
with that $100 credit, you can get pretty far. Just go to

637
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,460
do.co.plugged. That's do.co.plugged. And a big

638
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,700
thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged

639
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,180
program. Random excessive paper flopping and oops, just tore a

640
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,660
little more. Look at that. I don't know how much longer

641
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,780
that's holding up. Do.co.plugged. I think once that

642
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,180
paper is ripped, they're going to end the $100 deal. I think

643
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,580
that's because you better go soon. Okay, let's just talk

644
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,980
about a little serious news before we get to the dark table

645
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,460
stuff because this is just a heads up. If you are a void

646
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,820
Linux user, you need to be paying really close attention

647
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,220
to a situation that's been going on for a while and isn't

648
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,700
really moving anywhere and you could end up getting

649
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,180
misinformation. So I want you to just kind of track this in

650
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,140
the show. We'll keep links in the show notes. I may even try

651
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,380
to retroactively update the show notes for 247 down the road

652
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,540
if anything changes. So linuxunplugged.com slash 247 for

653
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:52,660
those, but right now the void Linux maintainers have lost

654
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,180
contact with the guy that used to be the head manager of

655
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,420
void. I don't know how to put this. It's really awkward.

656
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,300
Basically, the project leader has disappeared and they have

657
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,580
no contact with him since the end of January. They've had no

658
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:10,180
meaningful contact really for over a year with him and he's

659
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,460
he's got you know the keys to several things like the GitHub

660
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:18,260
page, the IRCs, the domains. They've tried to contact

661
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,180
GitHub and GitHub told them to go f a duck that they

662
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,580
weren't interested in this dramatic situation. They've

663
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,260
contacted free note support, but they really haven't gotten

664
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,620
very far with that yet and they've gotten partial control

665
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,700
over voidlinux.com, but they don't have control over the one

666
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,380
that people use the most, which is voidlinux.eu, which is the

667
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,860
one they really want and they're in limbo. They say

668
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,020
trying to get back on track and they don't see any possibility

669
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,660
of regaining access to the GitHub organization. So they're

670
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,300
gonna have to move to a new GitHub organization. They feel

671
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,260
like it may be the same for domains and for the IRC

672
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,260
channels, they're still trying to get in contact with free

673
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,780
note. Now this has been going on since January and I didn't

674
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,580
really know what to what to do with this because I thought is

675
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,180
somebody sick is somebody you know are they missing. I didn't

676
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,580
know what was going on with the project leader, but I've heard

677
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,340
from a few folks who say that they just kind of went AWOL and

678
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,020
that it might be like he's fine health wise, but no longer

679
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,620
interested in doing the project or something like that.

680
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:20,100
You know, and isn't this always the concern about these mom

681
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,300
and pop small distros?

682
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,460
Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, and if you're going to

683
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,340
make it, if you're going to involve the community and you're

684
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,260
going to have other people that feel responsible for the

685
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,580
project, then it's probably essential to set up some sort

686
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,860
of minimal governance process or at least, you know, make it

687
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,420
so that one one bus accident can't take out the whole

688
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:36,820
project.

689
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,620
Yeah, and you don't want to undermine the Linux community's

690
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,300
faith in small distros because if nobody's going to be willing

691
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,660
to give a small distro a try, they'll never become a big

692
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,060
distro. And then we have a chicken and the egg problem.

693
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,740
And the only solution I really see for this is something

694
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,540
similar to Canonical's Ubuntu Flavors, where, you know, you

695
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,820
kind of you kind of graduate into an official member of the

696
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,860
Ubuntu community.

697
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,180
And, you know, there's some governance.

698
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,220
I believe you have to hear, too.

699
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,940
Obviously, Wimpy or Popi could speak much more coherently to

700
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,100
this.

701
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,780
And, you know, there's at least some assurance of a structure

702
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,740
as an end user.

703
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,940
Like, it feels like some some test must have been passed.

704
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,300
Maybe, Wimpy, why don't you start with you have so much

705
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,100
experience with MATE.

706
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,900
Is my read on that right?

707
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,740
Like, is that is there some sort of assurance?

708
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,860
If it's becoming of an official flavor that it's not just going

709
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,900
to go away one day?

710
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,020
Yeah.

711
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,860
So the first thing is, in order to become an official flavor

712
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,540
of Ubuntu, you have to demonstrate that you have some

713
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:48,580
sort of long term maintainership of the packages that are

714
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,060
specific to the flavor that you want to create.

715
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:56,020
So in the case of Ubuntu MATE, back in the day, I had to

716
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,900
demonstrate that I had been maintaining those packages in

717
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,860
Debian for six months before we were granted flavor status.

718
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,540
And that's for the flavor itself.

719
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,180
Following that, then you can become an Ubuntu member, which

720
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,260
also is a demonstration of a long term commitment to the

721
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,380
Ubuntu project.

722
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,140
And that buys you some additional rights within the

723
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,180
Ubuntu project, such as voting powers for the councils and

724
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:22,820
what have you.

725
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,140
So there is some process there to ensure that people coming

726
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,820
into the project have already got a track record of being

727
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,900
long term contributors to the thing that they want to work

728
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,220
on.

729
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:35,940
OK, that makes sense.

730
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,620
So I want to bounce around here a bit.

731
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,300
I want to go to Dan.

732
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,460
He has a point about open governance, and then I want to

733
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,180
go to Eric after that.

734
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,420
So Dan, why don't you bring up your point about open

735
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,740
governance, and not just even for open source, but just

736
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,460
in general?

737
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,500
Yeah, there's a point that was made earlier about bus factor,

738
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:50,820
right?

739
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,180
And so it's not just necessarily if someone

740
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,660
voluntarily steps down, but you never know what's going to

741
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,540
happen in their life.

742
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,340
But I remember there's a thing in the canonical code of

743
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,100
conduct or Ubuntu code of conduct about gracefully

744
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,060
stepping down, right?

745
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,020
And I think everybody should kind of have this idea built

746
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,820
into their governance of what happens when someone needs

747
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,540
to step down.

748
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,300
Yeah, OK.

749
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,380
And Eric, you've had some familiar you've had some

750
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,020
experience with this with Ubuntu Studio recently.

751
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,660
That's correct.

752
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,060
It's been a whirlwind.

753
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,940
Basically, what's happened is set Hallstrom.

754
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,980
He's the project leader for Ubuntu Studio.

755
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:35,220
He just completely ran out of physical time in his life to be

756
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,660
able to be dedicated to the project.

757
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,140
So about six months ago, they were kicking around the idea of

758
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,620
making an Ubuntu Studio Council.

759
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,820
Well, there were a handful of people that got into it, but

760
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,660
nothing really ever came of it.

761
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:54,980
So in February, they reassessed and said, hey, we want to try

762
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,180
to make this go forward.

763
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,700
But nobody was really stepping up.

764
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,100
So I finally like, hey, I'll step up.

765
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,140
I'll join the council.

766
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,660
I'll help to lead this thing.

767
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,020
I became the council chair since I was the one running

768
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,220
the meetings already.

769
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,700
And then Ross Gammon, who is the release manager, he had to

770
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,620
step out due to timing reasons as well.

771
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,900
So then I stepped in to be the release manager.

772
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,740
So it's been a real whirlwind.

773
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,900
But this is one of those things where if you can open it up

774
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,180
to like a council type idea where you have a bunch of

775
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,420
people helping to lead the project, the bus factor gets

776
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,020
significantly lower.

777
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,900
I believe there's another better strategy that nobody

778
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,100
really mentioned.

779
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,500
Go ahead.

780
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,020
Money.

781
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,300
You know, if you buy something, there's a contract there.

782
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,660
And if you're actually willing to pay for the development of

783
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,020
the distro you use, you incentivize the person.

784
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,820
And if something else fails, like you lost control of the

785
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,580
well, the person just disappeared.

786
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
There's no control of the website.

787
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,540
You can actually prove legal ties to that project.

788
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,460
You can actually, as a collective ownership, get that.

789
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,740
And that actually is a better, I believe, better business

790
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,580
model for the creator to have an incentive to stay for the

791
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,340
people using the software to have actually demonstration of

792
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,940
possession of the product.

793
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,540
And ultimately, that should simplify the whole thing.

794
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,340
And why does Canonical Flavors work?

795
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,860
Because Canonical has money to maintain it.

796
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,060
No, no, it's not about money.

797
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,820
The project when it first started off, it's about people.

798
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,700
It's about community.

799
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,700
It's about the fact that there are people willing to step up

800
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,540
and look after things.

801
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:47,300
And as Dan said, the community came together and made a code

802
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,180
of conduct that said, look, if you can't do this anymore,

803
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,140
everyone has real life.

804
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,620
People have children, get married, take a sabbatical,

805
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,660
change direction, buy a Mac, whatever it is, it might move

806
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,140
away from your open source project.

807
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,580
And if they do, as long as they hand over gracefully,

808
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,300
then it's fine.

809
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,980
And one of the things we've done in Ubuntu, which I know a

810
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,580
lot of other projects do as well, is when you create

811
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,780
something, you create it in a way that it's not just you

812
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,580
that looks after it.

813
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:20,580
So for example, if you create an IRC channel on Freenode,

814
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,740
just as a simple example, if you create an official Ubuntu

815
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,660
channel, so that means it starts with hash Ubuntu dash

816
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,460
something, right?

817
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,220
So you create a new IRC channel, we recommend that you give

818
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,020
rights to that channel to the Ubuntu IRC council.

819
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,700
So that in the event that you got hit by a bus or your IRC

820
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,860
account was compromised, or you had a baby or bought a Mac

821
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,540
or whatever it is, someone else could take over and then

822
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,940
hand that on to the next person.

823
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,780
It's not that you're a bad person for moving on.

824
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,300
It's not that any money changed hands in any way, shape or

825
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,460
form.

826
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,060
There was nothing about money.

827
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,340
It's just about people and process and having a simple

828
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,220
process in place which allows things to move from one person

829
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,460
to the next person down the line.

830
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:12,740
I do kind of agree about if you have this as your primary

831
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,260
form of income, though there is kind of more of an obligation,

832
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:16,580
right?

833
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,860
Like if you depend on this open source project to put food

834
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,740
on your table, you're much less likely to buy a Mac.

835
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,100
Yeah, and not only that, actually, there's the other

836
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,540
part, which is when you are stepping down, I'm talking

837
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,580
about, let's say you get hit by a bus and you really wanted

838
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,940
to control things on your own.

839
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,180
You didn't really trust anybody at the time you started

840
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,660
the project because this counseling thing is very pretty,

841
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,860
but it requires trust.

842
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,220
Like you're talking to other people that you may have seen

843
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:43,620
or not.

844
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,740
And this takes time to build that trust.

845
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,620
Until then, you're really not assigning things you paid for

846
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:53,060
where your name lies on to other people.

847
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,220
So ultimately, it's a process.

848
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,180
And until that time, if the monetary incentive is there,

849
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,460
it facilitates the number one, you being incentivized to

850
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,140
actually be responsible to the stuff you're putting out.

851
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,180
And secondly, there's legal ways for people to get to you

852
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,380
if you're not putting it out, if there's a commitment to it.

853
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,540
And ultimately, even if you disappear, it is easier to

854
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,140
prove because there's transaction records and to get

855
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,260
something done.

856
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,660
While if nothing exists, you really don't.

857
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,740
That might be true, but that's not how it worked in Ubuntu.

858
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,580
Now, this is also really kind of a benefit of an organization

859
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,660
like the Software Freedom Conservancy.

860
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,220
Now, you don't really see a lot of distributions underneath

861
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,420
it, although I don't know if that's entirely true, but you

862
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,660
do see a lot of large projects underneath it.

863
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:44,820
And the Conservancy provides a infrastructure to open source

864
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,300
and free software to focus on what they do.

865
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,060
They do the code and they do all of the legal stuff and the

866
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,820
operational stuff and take care of the getting, make sure your

867
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,380
donations are legal and stuff and documentation for certain

868
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,260
aspects of the business.

869
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,500
And that's sort of what some of the services that the

870
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,460
Conservancy offers.

871
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,660
And I don't know, maybe one day the Conservancy would extend

872
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,340
that to more and more distros.

873
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:06,820
I don't know.

874
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,940
I don't think the solution is really easily attainable for

875
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,820
how to make sure these small distros don't go away because

876
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,020
you're still dealing with, you know, perhaps potentially tens

877
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,860
of thousands of end users that just kind of get caught in

878
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,260
whatever drama is going on behind the scenes.

879
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,900
But additionally, I think it does an untold amount of damage

880
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,980
to the reputation of Linux, of open source development, and

881
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,180
I heard a term the other day that I just really got me mad.

882
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:40,420
And it was a derogatory term for the reliability of open

883
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,300
source developers.

884
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,420
And the podcaster said, well, you know, he's just really

885
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,220
open sourcey.

886
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,140
He's just open sourcey.

887
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,500
I don't like the sounds of that.

888
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,700
And I'm like, what does that mean?

889
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,540
You know, like, he just doesn't do a good job.

890
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,420
He just sort of flaked out.

891
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,300
He's open sourcey.

892
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,900
I was like, I don't know.

893
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,020
It really got me upset.

894
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,940
Were you going to say something wimpy?

895
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,820
I was about to.

896
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,180
I was saying what open sourcey like Linus Torvalds, who's

897
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,060
been doing what he's doing for 26 years.

898
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:09,540
Yeah.

899
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,140
Oh, I'm actually angry right now.

900
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,180
My heart rate is up.

901
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,900
Just even remembering, recalling it, I got so upset by it.

902
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,180
So, all right.

903
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,900
Let's change gears to something that makes me happy.

904
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,180
There is a new release of Darktable this week.

905
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,340
Version 2.4.3 comes out and it's perfect timing because I'm

906
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,820
just kind of getting my Darktable on.

907
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,900
And Brent, your timing was really good.

908
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,140
Brent is a professional photographer by trade.

909
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,540
We're going to have some of his photos linked in the show notes.

910
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,020
And you've been using Darktable for how long?

911
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,340
I've been using Darktable since about, I believe it's 2012,

912
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,300
maybe even 2011.

913
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,980
So you've been watching the development for a while.

914
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,380
Yeah.

915
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,060
And you use it for a professional workflow, like you

916
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,380
were working here today at the studio and you were touching

917
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,300
up photos all day in Darktable.

918
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,220
I would say for me professionally, it's 80%, maybe

919
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,820
even 90% of where I do all my work.

920
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,780
Really?

921
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,100
Okay.

922
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,660
Well, see, this makes me pretty excited because I always

923
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,020
thought Darktable was for only individuals like yourself,

924
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,660
but Brent stopped by the booth at Linux Fest Northwest.

925
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,380
That's where we met him.

926
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,980
And he told me an anecdote that made me realize that even

927
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,260
I could probably figure out Darktable.

928
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,740
Maybe I think it was about actually a week ago, I was

929
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,420
invited to do a workshop at a Makers Fest, which was a first

930
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,780
thing for me and really great.

931
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,420
And I thought, okay, how do I introduce some sort of Linux

932
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,540
or open source into this?

933
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,940
Because I actually didn't see very much of that in there.

934
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:31,780
So I thought, okay, I'm going to do a workshop based on

935
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,020
using Darktable because people get easily attracted to

936
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,860
photography and that's my specialty.

937
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,940
But I'm going to introduce it in a way that applies to

938
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,820
any user.

939
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:46,420
So I ended up with a class full of people that were ranging

940
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,220
from enthusiasts all the way to kids.

941
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,460
And actually the kids were the ones that picked up on it

942
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,020
the fastest.

943
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,380
And so there's the beauty about Darktable, I think, is that

944
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,820
it can be extremely powerful and extremely flexible, but it

945
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,500
can also be very, very simple.

946
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,500
So if you just determine a workflow that is one, two, three

947
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,700
steps, then your adjustments and your cropping is just

948
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,340
slider bars.

949
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,140
So that's the way to go.

950
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,180
It's super simple.

951
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:10,660
Start like that.

952
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,140
Oh, yeah.

953
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,580
Ignore like Photoshop and GIMPs and stuff like that for

954
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,700
regular, everyday stuff.

955
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,100
What would you say are three things that you should touch on

956
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,220
every photo you take?

957
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,500
So I can tell you that easily.

958
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,820
So every single photo, I would say, A, cropping in camera.

959
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,300
You know, sometimes you don't always do it well, or you get

960
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,220
a different idea once you see it on the large screen.

961
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,660
So cropping is number one.

962
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,220
And in a cropping tool in Darktable, there's some like

963
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,460
skewing of angles, which kind of comes into play as well.

964
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,740
And they make it super, super easy.

965
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,740
You just right click and go, this should be straight.

966
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,180
And it fixes everything for you.

967
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,220
So that's one.

968
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,540
Two would be exposure.

969
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,420
They have an exposure slide bar with blacks level.

970
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,500
And so that can get you pretty darn far.

971
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,300
And then color is the third one, I would say.

972
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,340
Boost it a bit or what?

973
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,780
Like, what do you mean when you say color?

974
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,140
Like white balance kind of a thing.

975
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:57,380
Right.

976
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,580
So if you shot in various environments, sometimes your

977
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,460
camera can't, it's not as good as our eyes at adjusting to

978
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,500
color differences, right?

979
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:10,100
So anyone who starts to be able to learn to see color can then

980
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,340
determine that, oh, wait, this photo would actually be a lot

981
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,220
more dynamic if the colors were actually corrected to true.

982
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,860
So for instance, behind you, you have this crazy green light

983
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,740
that keeps changing.

984
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,780
I noticed.

985
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,020
Yeah, it makes it impossible to set our camera.

986
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:22,340
Right.

987
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,140
So then necessarily, and that's the beauty of raw is that you

988
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,820
can adjust that later on.

989
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,460
So every 30 seconds, you have a different color going on and

990
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,660
you can just correct that later.

991
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,700
Yeah, that would be nice.

992
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:33,940
Yeah.

993
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,500
All right.

994
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,300
You did.

995
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,340
You convinced me to try it.

996
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,100
So I'll install.

997
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,100
Actually, we installed it on one of the machines here in the

998
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,620
studio already to give it a go.

999
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,860
And Chris, tell me how easy it was to do that.

1000
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,140
We were talking about that.

1001
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,780
That actually, I think, was a big takeaway for me when I was

1002
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,500
looking at it.

1003
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,540
And it must be something you appreciate, too, is we didn't

1004
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:56,020
have to go log into some proprietary vendor's website

1005
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,580
and authorize anything.

1006
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,020
Find your license key.

1007
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:00,500
Yeah.

1008
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,340
Brent was like, before I go, I could just take care of these

1009
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,380
right here.

1010
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,740
Do you want me to just do that now?

1011
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,540
And I'm like, OK.

1012
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,900
Apt install darktable.

1013
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,180
And he was off and working.

1014
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,420
But then you have an extra step that you take.

1015
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,620
Do you want to share that secret?

1016
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,180
Absolutely.

1017
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,620
So yeah, I'm not even using the same distribution as you.

1018
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:16,340
I'm on Arch.

1019
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,180
But that doesn't seem to be a problem anywhere.

1020
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,860
It seems to be a little bit everywhere.

1021
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:24,340
But what I've done for myself, because I was thinking

1022
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,980
something like this may happen in the future, and just

1023
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,340
for my own, to make things easier in my own system, I

1024
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,420
actually keep my favorite darktable, like a settings

1025
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:34,900
database.

1026
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,820
It's like a whole profile?

1027
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,860
Yeah, the entire profile that you find under.config.

1028
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,460
And that includes your common colors that you change things

1029
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,380
to, like your common presets for photo editing?

1030
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,420
Yeah, I've got a bunch of presets.

1031
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,580
So every single module in darktable can have its own

1032
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,900
presets or multiple presets.

1033
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,300
And you can also define defaults for when you import

1034
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,420
images, what gets applied.

1035
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,060
So I was able to, despite never having used the laptop that I

1036
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,060
was on, in five minutes, I had my own home

1037
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,580
environment right there.

1038
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,460
That is slick.

1039
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,420
It's so great.

1040
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,140
It's so great.

1041
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,460
And it kind of means you're not married to anything.

1042
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,140
You're not married to any one hardware vendor.

1043
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,620
You're not married to any one particular OS or even

1044
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,140
distribution.

1045
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,500
And darktable's free software.

1046
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,140
So you don't even, that's great.

1047
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:22,020
And they just recently had an update to GIMP that we covered

1048
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:22,980
in Linux Action News.

1049
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:23,540
Oh gosh, yeah.

1050
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,580
And GIMP is now working with darktable, so you can send

1051
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,340
from darktable to GIMP, and they're going to understand

1052
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:28,900
each other.

1053
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,060
And it's like a big kumbaya now between the two.

1054
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,820
And it's a new version of GIMP that looks pretty great.

1055
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,780
It does look really nice.

1056
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,380
First big update in six years.

1057
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,020
You can't see that, but I have this giant smile on my face.

1058
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:38,580
Oh yeah?

1059
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,540
You like it?

1060
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,140
Are you a GIMP fan?

1061
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,700
So the other 20% is I'm doing in GIMP.

1062
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,220
And I haven't quite launched into credit yet.

1063
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,380
But GIMP, for me, for many, many years,

1064
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,900
has been doing the simple, offering the simple features

1065
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,540
that I really need when I need that extra 20% of doing some

1066
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:01,460
really specialty photography-specific adjustments that

1067
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,980
need to be done that darktable just isn't designed for

1068
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,220
and I don't think should include anyways.

1069
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:12,740
We have a bunch of great photos that have been tweaked by,

1070
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,100
and taken, too, by Brent in darktable from Linux Fest

1071
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,420
Northwest, 158 of them.

1072
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,980
And they're great.

1073
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,900
And the cutest pictures of Levi ever.

1074
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,460
Yeah, ever.

1075
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,860
So cute in there.

1076
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,540
It's ridiculous.

1077
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,860
If you like puppies, you've got to go check out the link

1078
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,380
in linuxunplugged.com slash 247.

1079
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,820
I'll drop a link to the album in the IRC, too,

1080
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,900
if you're watching live.

1081
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,220
Some really great photos of our party at Lady Joops

1082
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,620
that we had out in the parking lot.

1083
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:42,380
So Saturday evening of Linux Fest Northwest,

1084
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,820
we decided to have a tailgate-style party.

1085
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:49,300
System76 brought a ton of meat.

1086
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,980
I brought two barbecues, and a table, and some camping chairs.

1087
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,380
I stuffed them all into the bays of Lady Joops.

1088
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,980
The advantages of having a class A

1089
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,980
is you have some big storage bays.

1090
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,620
And brought two bags of charcoal and a chimney starter.

1091
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:07,860
And we put the awning out and started cooking.

1092
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,820
And we cooked for hours in the parking lot.

1093
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,180
And Brent was there snapping photos the whole time.

1094
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,380
It was a lot of fun.

1095
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,380
We were flying drones and geeking out

1096
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,300
in the parking lot.

1097
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,100
And oh, geez, some good pictures right there.

1098
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,860
And there's a good time.

1099
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,660
Yeah, we had a really good time.

1100
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,260
And I just thought that was maybe

1101
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,660
the highlight of the whole thing.

1102
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,620
So thanks for taking those pictures.

1103
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,540
And thanks for making them available to the whole audience

1104
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,100
to check them out, too.

1105
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,060
That's really nice of you.

1106
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:34,900
Yeah, I'm happy to.

1107
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,380
And give people a little info maybe

1108
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,820
if they want to know more about your photography services

1109
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,300
and whatnot.

1110
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,580
Because I got to tell you, I'd like to bring you

1111
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,500
out to future events.

1112
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,380
Absolutely.

1113
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,740
Especially keep taking these cute pictures of Levi.

1114
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,820
Where should they find you?

1115
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,140
Levi's an easy win, right?

1116
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,780
So website BrentGervais.com.

1117
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:57,300
So I'll spell that out, B-R-E-N-T-G-E-R-V-A-I-S.com.

1118
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,380
That's just where you can see a little bit of my work.

1119
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,960
And I'm not super active on social,

1120
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,900
but you can find me on Twitter, Brent, at Brent Gervais.

1121
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,100
And I guess around the network.

1122
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:07,700
Cool.

1123
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,060
Yeah, you may hear from him some more in the future.

1124
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,420
And check out the link in the show notes

1125
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,460
if you want to see the cutest puppy pictures ever.

1126
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,780
I mean, that's just indisputable.

1127
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,300
It's just a fact.

1128
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,620
Yeah, it is not even my bias.

1129
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,920
It's just purely indisputable.

1130
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,540
All right.

1131
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:24,580
Well, we do have a roundup to get to of Ubuntu 18.04,

1132
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,740
the flavors, the new features, the server stuff,

1133
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:33,100
and maybe even a pretty cool feature

1134
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:37,940
that I didn't even think about until I heard about it from Ian at System76.

1135
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,660
And I went, why is nobody else doing that?

1136
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,140
So we'll play a clip from Ian from System76 about something that Pop!

1137
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:49,260
OS is adding that blew my mind, really made me just really impressed.

1138
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,100
So we'll get there, but let's talk about Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com.

1139
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,380
That's where you go to sign up for a free seven-day trial.

1140
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:00,780
And coincidentally, just surprise, surprise, support this show.

1141
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,060
Yeah, keep us on the air, maybe even get us to 300 freaking episodes.

1142
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:08,860
Linux, maybe this show will have even more episodes than last.

1143
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,220
That would be amazing.

1144
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,940
Well, people go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

1145
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,220
They'll help us get there, and you'll get a free seven-day trial.

1146
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,900
It's a platform to learn more about Linux, a full-featured training library

1147
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:24,220
with everything you want to get new skills and advance your career.

1148
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,300
Now, I love the self-paced video courses.

1149
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,900
This is the sweet stuff.

1150
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,180
And Linux Academy, I happen to have first-hand experience,

1151
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,820
is investing in great recording hardware.

1152
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,660
They've really put a lot of effort into this.

1153
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,860
They also offer hands-on scenario-based labs.

1154
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,420
They spin up the system on whatever infrastructure you need.

1155
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:45,660
So if it's AWSs, or if it's an OpenStack system, or if it's just a Debian box.

1156
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,500
They spin that up for you, you log in over SSH, you get to work,

1157
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,460
you get a real scenario, something you can take and do in production.

1158
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,260
And if you ever get stuck, they have full-time human instructors that are happy

1159
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,260
to help and answer your questions.

1160
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:01,220
So you get actual hands-on experience, and you got the humans.

1161
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,380
That's pretty much as good as it's gonna get, because that's all they do is Linux.

1162
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:08,940
So they build features in that help you get there, like Learning Pass,

1163
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,300
which are a series of content and courses planned for instructors that get you into

1164
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,700
specific career tracks.

1165
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,340
Or if you're ready to take some big tests,

1166
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,980
they have courses created specifically to prepare you for certifications.

1167
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,580
And practice exams too, which I gotta tell you, if you don't practice,

1168
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,300
you probably won't pass, so that's a great feature.

1169
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,700
And they have a community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members who are

1170
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,460
surprisingly supportive.

1171
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:34,340
It's ridiculous, it's like an educational support group.

1172
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,660
And they do it all on their own, they're just great people.

1173
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,100
Try it out, seven days for free, linuxacademy.com.

1174
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:45,100
Oh, and a big thank you, Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com.

1175
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,700
So this 1804 release is big, I think it's gonna be a big release.

1176
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,420
I don't know if you've heard about Ubuntu, but

1177
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:54,020
it's a pretty big distribution, and they got all kinds of different flavors.

1178
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,700
We never talked about it before on the show, so

1179
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,580
I can understand if you'd be unfamiliar with this, but there's a bunch of them.

1180
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:03,580
And let's talk about some of the main changes that are coming in Ubuntu 1804

1181
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,100
itself, cuz we're gonna talk about the flavors here, but

1182
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,260
you're gonna get Linux kernel 4.15, it's pretty nice.

1183
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,100
You're gonna get five years of support, of course,

1184
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,380
this is also the first LTS to support and ship GNOME.

1185
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:19,420
Where you get X11, you get the new minimal installation feature,

1186
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:22,460
which is a little different across the flavors, but

1187
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,460
it is the best thing that has come to Ubuntu in a really long time.

1188
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,420
And Ubuntu's live kernel patch service,

1189
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:33,420
which I don't think is getting enough play in this release, is now front and center.

1190
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,220
It's part of the welcome screen when you log in for the first time,

1191
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:42,060
there's a GUI to turn it on, live kernel patching is here, it's available.

1192
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:46,580
And I think it's kind of a big deal, and the fact that they've now wrapped

1193
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,620
a GUI around the whole thing to make it accessible to workstations,

1194
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,700
I think deserves a little more credit than it's getting.

1195
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,780
Files is getting a revamped user, or has now,

1196
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,660
a revamped user interface as well that looks really compact.

1197
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,380
There's also other things that are just nice to have,

1198
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,460
because it just makes it back to normal.

1199
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:09,100
Close, minimize, and maximize buttons are back on the right side of the window.

1200
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,660
And I do prefer GDM over LightDM, and

1201
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:16,700
1804 has shipped GDM as the display manager.

1202
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:21,540
It's big, it's bulky, it's weird, but I just happen to like it better than LightDM.

1203
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,540
It does work.

1204
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,460
Well, I just, I find it to be smoother.

1205
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,060
I don't know what it is, it's like my lock screen and all of it.

1206
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:31,220
I just, I find LightDM to be clunky, and I find GDM to, I don't know,

1207
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,820
just suits my needs better.

1208
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:38,260
So those are some of the core big things that are coming in Ubuntu 1804.

1209
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,780
And that's what I would look forward to.

1210
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,620
Also, you've got the other things like the Thunderbolt 3 support.

1211
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,340
You've got Gnome 328.

1212
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,380
There's other really nice things.

1213
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:50,140
LibreOffice 6.0 is in there, but that's the main things I'd be looking for.

1214
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:54,460
And then you have a brand new LTS flavor.

1215
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,300
For the first time, Ubuntu Budgie 1804 LTS.

1216
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,980
This is the first LTS,

1217
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,500
first official time they've been a flavor during an LTS release.

1218
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,660
It's gonna be supported until April 2021.

1219
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:10,060
And it ships with the latest Budgie desktop, 10.4 Irish Summer.

1220
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,260
And it's accompanied with the Gnome 328 application.

1221
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,260
So that's kind of a big deal for them.

1222
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,700
Kind of a big deal, yeah.

1223
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,700
Congratulations.

1224
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,540
It's real now, that's awesome.

1225
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,940
Friend of the show, Dustin, and teamwork on that.

1226
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:23,380
And then, of course, you've got all of the flavors that are available for

1227
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:30,460
download, Zubuntu, Kobuntu, Ubuntu Mate, Ubuntu Proper itself, Kylin.

1228
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:34,420
And the flavors come in at three years of support instead of the five years that

1229
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,780
the main line gets.

1230
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:41,220
Kobuntu, as I've mentioned many times, is shipping Plasma 512 LTS.

1231
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,300
So you've got a whole LTS stack there.

1232
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:48,460
Producer Michael has contributed several tweaks like Plasma Dark by default,

1233
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,820
or I'm sorry, Breeze Dark.

1234
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,420
Nice.

1235
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,100
Yeah, it's actually really, really well done.

1236
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,660
VLC is the default video player, which I know a lot of people like.

1237
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:59,700
Latte Dock is in the archives and KDE Connect is pre-installed.

1238
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,780
Excellent.

1239
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,380
Yeah, also one of the other things it does is double click is the default

1240
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,180
behavior to open files and stuff.

1241
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:08,940
So Ubuntu 18.04 comes out now with a mostly high DPI support theme,

1242
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,260
which is good for them.

1243
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:15,020
And Studio has an 18.04 release, but it's only gonna be supported for nine months.

1244
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,380
But they do have a new release.

1245
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,140
It's there.

1246
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,020
It's just not an LTS at this time.

1247
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:22,860
And then look at that Ubuntu Kylin release coming in at three years,

1248
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,780
ideal for Chinese users.

1249
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,020
But damn, if that doesn't look like Windows 7.

1250
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:27,900
It sure does.

1251
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,060
I'd say anybody that just prefers the Windows 7 UI and layout,

1252
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,940
you might just check out Kylin or Chillin.

1253
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:34,980
Wonderful Ubuntu user.

1254
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,060
Is it Chillin Wimpy or is it Kylin?

1255
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:41,220
It's Chillin and it's based on Mate.

1256
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,020
Yeah, yeah, it really, it looks, what do you think of this?

1257
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,420
Is this, this is...

1258
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,980
Well, it's delightful, right?

1259
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:52,220
Because it's really nice to see what we're making being used elsewhere

1260
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,620
in a very different way.

1261
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:58,500
I mean, they've layered their own tools and utilities on top of it

1262
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,140
to give it a very distinctive look.

1263
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:07,940
And yeah, well, they're making what their users want and it's good to see.

1264
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,740
It does look pretty sharp.

1265
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,820
Do they share the size of the user base?

1266
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:16,580
Do we have, I mean, they must be large enough to have gotten flavor status.

1267
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:20,420
I have no idea how big their user penetration is.

1268
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,900
I think it's considerable.

1269
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,700
Yeah, I imagine.

1270
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,860
Be interesting to talk to someone.

1271
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:25,860
Yeah, that would be.

1272
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:31,100
And then, of course, our friends over at Mate, Ubuntu Mate 1804,

1273
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,100
which ships Mate Desktop 120.

1274
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,820
It's got that new keyboard-friendly HUD.

1275
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,980
Global menu if you want that mutiny desktop layout.

1276
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:45,460
High DPI support that we know Wimpy's been working towards for about two years now.

1277
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,780
Hardware acceleration in Marco.

1278
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,500
Just like Wes always wants, color emoji support.

1279
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,220
Heck yes.

1280
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,540
Got the brisk menu in there.

1281
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:58,420
You got the improved Mate tweak tool, the new software boutique updates.

1282
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:02,900
I mean, I might be a little biased here, but this is one of the strongest flavors by far.

1283
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:06,900
1804 Ubuntu Mate looks like some of your best work, Wimpy.

1284
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:07,380
Thank you.

1285
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,900
That's very kind of you to say so.

1286
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:16,340
And my own assessment is it's the best release we've put out by some margin.

1287
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,980
I was really pleased with 1710.

1288
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:25,220
And when we released that, I felt like that was good enough to be the 1804 LTS.

1289
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:29,620
But it's amazing how much we've got done in the six months.

1290
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:33,700
Because in 1710, there was no high DPI, and there is now.

1291
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:38,980
So it just goes to show how much of a hustle we've had on in those last six months

1292
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:45,420
to really, really make this LTS something for the next three years.

1293
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,500
It is really impressive.

1294
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,180
It's fantastic.

1295
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:51,780
I think a congratulations to the whole team is in order for that, because it's really nice.

1296
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:56,740
I want to also talk about, in Ubuntu proper, the new welcome screen.

1297
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:01,140
Because I might be wrong, I haven't dug deep into this.

1298
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,780
But when you're all kind of done with the new walkthrough,

1299
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:09,780
it brings up a new screen that says, install some new apps.

1300
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,980
And you got Spotify on there.

1301
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:17,220
You got a lot of really well-known apps like Skype and Slack and more.

1302
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:21,180
So is this, maybe you should answer this.

1303
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:21,820
I don't know.

1304
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,060
Is this a Snap screen?

1305
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:24,900
Are these all Snaps?

1306
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,820
Are these all Snap apps if I click one of those?

1307
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,300
They are.

1308
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,380
Every single one of them is a Snap.

1309
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:34,340
They're a selection of applications that we thought

1310
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:40,220
people who are coming from other platforms might like the familiarity of.

1311
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:44,900
So people who are coming from Windows or Mac or anywhere else

1312
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,460
might like to see, oh, I can get Spotify on here.

1313
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,340
I can get Slack.

1314
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:50,580
Or I could chat to my friends on Discord.

1315
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,460
Or my kids can play Minecraft on here.

1316
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,380
Or if I'm a developer, I can easily get Android Studio.

1317
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:59,700
So there's a whole set of applications, plus your favorite open source

1318
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:03,260
things like Brave Browser and GIMP and all kinds of other stuff in there.

1319
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,740
Well, I just noticed that I recently seemed

1320
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:11,060
to be able to tell the installation spread across the different versions

1321
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:11,940
of Ubuntu.

1322
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,220
I don't know if that's something that's recently

1323
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,220
being published in the Snap Store.

1324
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:18,620
All of a sudden, I'm seeing comparatively how many 1804 users over 1604.

1325
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,020
And it seems like this must be having subtraction

1326
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:24,420
because the 1804 numbers are skyrocketing right now.

1327
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,740
The view you're seeing there in the Snap Store

1328
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:34,700
is a logarithmic scale of which platform those Snaps are being installed on.

1329
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:38,340
And it's to represent that you can install these Snaps in lots

1330
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,260
of different places.

1331
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:42,500
And here are some of the places that you might find users

1332
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,100
who are using those things.

1333
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:44,860
OK.

1334
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:45,980
That's a nice stat to have.

1335
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,500
I really do appreciate having that.

1336
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,420
And when I saw the 1804 numbers, I mean,

1337
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,860
it's already like the number one on some of those Snaps.

1338
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:53,380
It's really.

1339
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:54,220
Oh, it's gone mad.

1340
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,740
Yes.

1341
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:58,620
I think it's all, if it hasn't already, it's

1342
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,580
probably close to overtaking the 1710 numbers already.

1343
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,060
Yeah.

1344
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,900
Yeah, I looked a couple of hours ago.

1345
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,540
And yeah, it's just nudging the 1710 numbers.

1346
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:11,180
Yeah, I'm looking at VLC right now and exactly, exactly that.

1347
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:16,180
And then after that, it'll be on to 1604, which is remarkable.

1348
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:19,540
And it tells you that I think that welcome screen is a great idea.

1349
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:20,700
I'm glad that was added.

1350
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,260
I think we'll see those numbers move a bit more soon

1351
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:27,260
because we haven't turned on the prompts for 1710 users

1352
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:30,060
to get the prompt to upgrade to 1804.

1353
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,660
So that will be later this week.

1354
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:35,220
And then, of course, around June, July time,

1355
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:39,900
the 1604 users will get the prompt when we release 1804.1.

1356
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,860
So the ramp up of 1804 at the moment

1357
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:45,580
is all people clean installing or deliberately

1358
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,460
choosing to do the upgrade.

1359
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,420
So we'll see that rock on a bit more

1360
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,780
as the upgrade prompts kick in.

1361
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:56,460
I wonder, does anybody have a guess?

1362
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,420
If you take out 1804, 1710, and 1604,

1363
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:04,500
the next top distro is not an Ubuntu distro for the Slack snap.

1364
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,340
Does anybody have a guess what distro it is?

1365
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,620
It's not an Ubuntu distro.

1366
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,460
Arch Linux.

1367
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:11,740
That's a good guess.

1368
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,180
I see Neon on here.

1369
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:15,380
I see Linux, Mint, Zorin.

1370
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,100
Arch is a little bit further down the road.

1371
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:23,460
No, elementary 0.41 is the next distro after Ubuntu 1804

1372
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,060
right now for the Slack snap.

1373
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:27,740
Those elementary users, they love their Slack.

1374
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:29,140
Yeah, they certainly do.

1375
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,420
They're getting their work done.

1376
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:33,420
That's why they need to get their notifications done right.

1377
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,420
It's a good thing you're getting that done, Dan.

1378
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,420
That's pretty cool.

1379
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,700
It's pretty neat to see that.

1380
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,260
Debian 9's doing pretty good.

1381
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,860
Neon 1604 is doing good.

1382
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,820
Fedora 27 on the list.

1383
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:45,900
Pretty cool.

1384
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,540
I like that you guys are releasing that.

1385
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,460
I'm going to keep an eye on that from now on.

1386
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:52,980
It's interesting to compare the different apps

1387
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,100
and see what different distros shake out.

1388
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,100
Same with MailSpring.

1389
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,420
It's the same kind of spread on MailSpring.

1390
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,460
Yeah, people on elementary OS are just

1391
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:01,540
getting some damn work done, apparently.

1392
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:02,860
What it's there for.

1393
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:06,180
Now, we can't really have an 1804 release discussion

1394
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,020
without getting to some of the cloud stuff,

1395
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:10,700
because that's just a huge part of what Ubuntu does now.

1396
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,580
But I know that Wimpy might have a story that someone

1397
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,420
like myself could appreciate.

1398
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,700
Yeah, so we've inherited a couple of features

1399
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,900
from Debian's current developments

1400
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,020
that I think might be up your alley.

1401
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,900
The first is if you install FFmpeg

1402
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,340
and you've got an NVIDIA card, when

1403
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,860
you install the NVIDIA proprietary drivers,

1404
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:38,140
that will automatically enable NVENC capability

1405
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,580
on the FFmpeg on the host.

1406
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:43,860
And also, if you install OBS, that

1407
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,580
will automatically pick up the fact

1408
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,860
that you have NVENC-enabled FFmpeg

1409
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,780
and turn on the hardware acceleration for you.

1410
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,540
Wow, I was literally just talking to Wes

1411
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,420
about this before the show, about how we were reviewing

1412
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,340
if we really needed to have the NVIDIA card

1413
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,780
during this last Linux fast rebuild.

1414
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,380
And we landed on firmly, yep, we still

1415
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:02,340
have to have the NVIDIA card.

1416
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,580
We still got to have that acceleration.

1417
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,940
So that is so great that you just made that easier.

1418
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,740
Yeah, so no more building from source.

1419
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:12,100
Just install those two things, and you're off to the races.

1420
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,740
Yeah, boy, it's getting good there.

1421
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,180
Because this new GIMP release I just mentioned earlier,

1422
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,700
one of the things they're including now

1423
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,060
is GPU acceleration, too.

1424
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:23,060
So having a good working GPU setup on an Ubuntu desktop,

1425
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,420
I think, is going to become more and more important.

1426
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:26,580
And I don't need to tell you guys that,

1427
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,620
because I'm sure machine learning and all kinds

1428
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,020
of workloads like that are a big part of why

1429
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,140
that's been done, right?

1430
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,740
Yeah, yeah.

1431
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:35,780
I mean, these contributions come from being

1432
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,380
based on top of Ubuntu, but Canonical

1433
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,740
have done a heap of work with NVIDIA

1434
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:45,060
to unlock compute performance for deep learning and AI

1435
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,260
and all that sort of stuff.

1436
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:48,340
Oh, right, you said it came from Debian, right.

1437
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:52,060
So let's talk about the new multi-cloud reality

1438
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,340
that Canonical finds themselves in.

1439
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:56,100
And this seems to be a point that Mark

1440
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,900
wants to hit in his interviews about Ubuntu 18.04.

1441
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:02,060
He says that they've done boot time and performance

1442
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:06,460
optimized images of Ubuntu 18.04 on every major public cloud.

1443
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:08,840
And they made sure to be the fastest and most efficient

1444
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,420
OS for cloud computing.

1445
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,460
I would hope he thinks that way.

1446
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:15,500
He says, having an OS tuned for far advanced workloads,

1447
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,060
such as AI and machine learning, is

1448
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,100
critical to a high velocity team.

1449
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,580
And that's from, actually, the product manager

1450
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:24,220
at Cloud at Google, who says that they're looking forward

1451
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:27,260
to deploying 18.04 on the Google Cloud infrastructure.

1452
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,580
And Microsoft came in with their quote saying,

1453
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:32,540
this was Craig, their program manager, says,

1454
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:34,500
we're going to have Hyper-V optimized images

1455
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,340
that we've developed in collaboration with Canonical.

1456
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,620
These will be enhanced experiences

1457
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,980
of Ubuntu and Windows.

1458
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,980
In our upcoming release this spring,

1459
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:45,300
Hyper-V's Quick Create VM Gallery

1460
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:48,620
will now include an image for the latest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

1461
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:51,820
release, officially stamped straight from Canonical.

1462
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:56,060
And I read this because it kind of underscores a theme I'm

1463
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:59,780
noticing in this 18.04 release is Canonical

1464
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:04,200
is working with AWS and other large partners,

1465
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,620
like Microsoft, with Azure and Microsoft Hyper-V,

1466
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,180
and I presume many others, to say,

1467
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,540
well, what do you need us to custom build into these images

1468
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:13,060
for you?

1469
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,380
And it's something that they seem

1470
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:17,180
to be taking to a much larger scale with this release.

1471
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,020
I mean, that matters a lot, right?

1472
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,100
Not every shop and everyone doing this has time

1473
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,420
or even makes sense for them to do that sort of tuning.

1474
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,740
So if you can get that out of the box,

1475
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,620
it makes Ubuntu a natural choice.

1476
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,060
Yeah, it's definitely an incentive.

1477
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:33,460
So in Ubuntu podcast, season 11, episode 8,

1478
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:37,100
we interviewed David Britton, who's

1479
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,260
the lead for the Ubuntu server team.

1480
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,620
And he talked about the customizations and performance

1481
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:49,140
optimizations that Canonical do for the major cloud providers.

1482
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,460
So for each of their clouds, they

1483
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:54,140
get tailored images that are Ubuntu,

1484
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,100
but specific to their environment

1485
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,820
and their boot processes and their hardware.

1486
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:00,060
Which episode again?

1487
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,180
As we're recording this, the current episode.

1488
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,300
So it's season 11, episode 8.

1489
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:05,700
Oh, very good.

1490
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,180
I look forward to listening to that.

1491
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,900
Now, that seems like all of that is all good and fine,

1492
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,100
but we haven't talked about Pop!

1493
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:16,180
OS, which isn't a flavor, not an official flavor,

1494
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:18,540
but it is one of the more well-known Ubuntu

1495
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,340
derivatives at this point.

1496
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,780
And Ian sat down with us at the Linux Fest Northwest booth,

1497
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,300
and he told me about a feature they're adding in there

1498
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,860
that I think is pretty clever.

1499
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:29,360
And I wonder if we're going to see it

1500
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,780
in other places pretty soon.

1501
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:34,180
The new installer sets up a recovery partition.

1502
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:34,780
Oh, OK.

1503
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:38,060
So that's something new that I haven't seen in Linux.

1504
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,220
I might have missed it.

1505
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,940
I was just thinking about that today, actually.

1506
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:44,040
Yeah, so basically there's an extra partition on the drive.

1507
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,820
It's about 4 gigabytes, enough to hold two ISOs conveniently.

1508
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,300
And it basically just holds the latest ISO

1509
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:54,780
so that you have media to reinstall your OS,

1510
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,780
even if you don't have a flash drive or a CD drive available.

1511
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:58,260
Wow.

1512
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:58,980
Love that.

1513
01:11:58,980 --> 01:11:59,740
Yeah.

1514
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:03,100
So can you do a fresh install, configure install,

1515
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,480
or does it give you a, when you install a machine,

1516
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,580
does it come, does Pop!

1517
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:10,140
OS itself come pre-configured with all of the System76

1518
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:13,060
repositories, assuming that you're using System76 hardware?

1519
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,940
Or is it come just as like a stock distro,

1520
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,820
and then you further customize Pop! OS?

1521
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:19,260
You have to add like a PPA later and stuff like that.

1522
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:19,260
Right.

1523
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,700
For the hardware that's specific to System76.

1524
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:21,580
How does that work?

1525
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:25,380
So the new installer should be automatically installing

1526
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:31,060
the System76 package for all of the hardware support stuff.

1527
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:33,580
That's in the main Pop! OS repository now,

1528
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:36,980
in addition to being in the System76 repository

1529
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:37,900
for other OSs.

1530
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:38,400
OK.

1531
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,140
So it should be installing that.

1532
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,640
That may not be set up yet, though.

1533
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,020
I'd have to double check on that.

1534
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,340
But I can message Jeremy on Slack at some point

1535
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,100
and figure that out.

1536
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,140
Yeah, because we are talking like down the road here.

1537
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:49,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1538
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,660
But yeah, it's pretty well set up.

1539
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:56,140
And it's a whole entire distro.

1540
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:58,820
And it will be doing the hardware integration

1541
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:02,380
for System76, but it will work great on everything.

1542
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:05,060
It doesn't require a System76 computer.

1543
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:07,820
It's not lost on me that when you say the installer,

1544
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:11,180
that is something that most System76 customers won't even

1545
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:12,860
see.

1546
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:15,100
Actually, no, because another thing the installer does

1547
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,340
is full disk encryption.

1548
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:16,820
Oh.

1549
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:17,780
And so now.

1550
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:19,520
There's like a user interaction process.

1551
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,020
Right.

1552
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:23,500
So the first run for a new System76 computer,

1553
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,260
it's actually going to run the installer.

1554
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:26,980
And it's going to do a couple steps in the installer.

1555
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:28,260
And it's going to ask you if you want to encrypt.

1556
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:30,140
And if you choose you don't want to encrypt,

1557
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:33,620
it'll just say, cool, we're done, and it'll.

1558
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,260
Now, it'll say you're done, and then it

1559
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:36,140
goes to the user creation.

1560
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,180
I got cut there because there's a lot of noise

1561
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,420
in the background, and somebody jumped on the mic.

1562
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,500
Because there were people having a really good time

1563
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:43,180
at Linux Fest.

1564
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,740
They sure were.

1565
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:46,820
But, Pobie, you were noting in the chat room

1566
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:48,780
that there's other ways this can happen, maybe

1567
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:49,900
other companies that do this.

1568
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,900
Yeah, Dell have been doing this for a few years.

1569
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,540
They ship their systems with a little Dell utility

1570
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:58,940
that when you first install it, it

1571
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:01,420
says, do you want to create recovery media, basically?

1572
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:03,060
Stick a USB key in, and it'll make that.

1573
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,980
But if you don't, that's OK.

1574
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,820
Because they've done the same kind of thing,

1575
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:10,940
where they've got a recovery area, a partition,

1576
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:14,900
and you can just reboot and make it nuke the system back

1577
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,060
to clean.

1578
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:21,140
And when I reviewed the Dell laptop that they sent us,

1579
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:24,220
I just did that and reverted it back to factory defaults,

1580
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:26,420
and then put it back in the box and sent it back to them.

1581
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,140
Right.

1582
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,060
That is really nice.

1583
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:31,220
I think I've always traditionally just nuke

1584
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:33,700
and paved the entire drive when I get a new machine.

1585
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,860
And I've always kind of regretted it in the end,

1586
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,540
because it's a nice convenience.

1587
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,140
So I like that they're essentially bringing that

1588
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,180
to everybody with Pop!

1589
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:42,660
OS.

1590
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:44,060
Yeah, more people should do this.

1591
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:48,140
And I wish we could do that more easily in Ubuntu,

1592
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:53,060
so that the default Ubuntu install had a recovery

1593
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:55,940
partition and could do all of this magic voodoo.

1594
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:58,540
But we'd get a bit of pushback, I think, from some people.

1595
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,740
It's a lot of work to do.

1596
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:04,460
And it's easier for System76 to bake this in,

1597
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,460
and for Dell to bake this in at the factory

1598
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,540
when they're putting the images on the hard drives.

1599
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:11,460
It's a little less easier for us to do it as a USB stick.

1600
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:12,500
But it could be done.

1601
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,140
But it's a lot of engineering work.

1602
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:14,540
Yeah, right.

1603
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,080
And you know in that case that it's

1604
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,460
going on a laptop, whereas Ubuntu goes lots of places.

1605
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,540
So I've been pretty impressed.

1606
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,900
My initial impressions, this is all they are at this point

1607
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:28,340
with 1804, is that it's shipping just such a great version

1608
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:28,980
of Gnome.

1609
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:32,220
And it iterated on top of 1710 in a lot of great ways.

1610
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:35,140
The choice to go with X11, I think, was a safe one.

1611
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:39,500
And I can see where maybe a few things are going.

1612
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,020
I can see perhaps a new theme that I think it's called.

1613
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,140
People have talked about it.

1614
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:44,560
It might be coming on the horizon.

1615
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,900
But I could also see interesting directions

1616
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,940
that new Ubuntu welcome screen goes, perhaps more

1617
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:53,100
in the direction of Ubuntu MATE's welcome.

1618
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,620
That could be really interesting.

1619
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:57,600
I would love to see that develop more in 1810.

1620
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,700
And I would like to see just more of what they're doing.

1621
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,480
So far, my initial impressions have been pretty solid.

1622
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,500
We'll see what the stability story is.

1623
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:10,100
We'll see what third party application integration

1624
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:10,900
and support is.

1625
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,780
But right now, I can see where things are going.

1626
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:14,540
And I'm liking it.

1627
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:17,720
It seems like 1710, they pulled it off.

1628
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:21,740
And the 1804, they would have had to really blown it

1629
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:22,980
to mess up 1804.

1630
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:23,600
And they didn't.

1631
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,220
They didn't blow it.

1632
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,060
They just iterated on top of it.

1633
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:29,540
So both Fedora 28 and Ubuntu 1804

1634
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,220
might be, so far, my initial impression,

1635
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:35,820
some of their best releases I've ever seen out of either group.

1636
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:38,720
It's a super exciting time to be a Linux user.

1637
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,300
I mean, there's so much going on.

1638
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,520
And 1604, I felt like it really shook up the landscape.

1639
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,540
It was kind of a monumental release.

1640
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:49,140
And 1804, it's like, now we're on that first just strictly

1641
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:51,300
better polish LTS.

1642
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,340
I'm so excited.

1643
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:57,020
Yeah, and I'm really, I guess, I can't even

1644
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,580
remember how long it's been since I've

1645
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:02,020
been tracking an Ubuntu release and a Fedora release

1646
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:03,420
around the same time, where they're

1647
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,220
shipping at the same time.

1648
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:07,100
And they're both shipping the latest and greatest GNOME.

1649
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,940
And so we're back to, well, who kind of has the cooler GNOME

1650
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:10,940
implementation?

1651
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:13,620
It's been a long time since we've been there.

1652
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:16,660
And it feels kind of nostalgic.

1653
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:17,180
I love it.

1654
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:19,300
I'm really excited about the whole release cycle.

1655
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,420
So I think just a couple of solid releases.

1656
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,420
I got Fedora 28 on the machine.

1657
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:26,740
I got Ubuntu 1804 proper on a machine.

1658
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:31,660
And then I have a mess of systems on Kubuntu 1804.

1659
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:37,780
And I would be negligent if I didn't just say, hot damn.

1660
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:40,460
We put it in the belly of the beast,

1661
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:43,460
a trial by the greatest fire.

1662
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:47,100
There is one thing we can do at Jupyter Broadcasting

1663
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,660
to break a machine every single year.

1664
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:51,100
Every year, we've broken a machine.

1665
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,940
And we sometimes had to run out and grab parts

1666
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:56,260
in the middle of the fest and rebuild our system right there

1667
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,260
on the table at our booth.

1668
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,180
We've had to reload operating systems,

1669
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,300
reinstall OBS, set up NVIDIA drivers,

1670
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,260
reimport all of our scenes.

1671
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:13,060
This year, we decided if Kubuntu 1804 could survive Linux

1672
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,620
Fest Northwest without crashing, it

1673
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,500
would become our de facto production operating

1674
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,740
system at Jupyter Broadcasting.

1675
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,780
Because there is literally no better way to break a system.

1676
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,620
And we built one really great OBS system.

1677
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,580
We Frankensteined a couple of systems together.

1678
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,620
But they're all really solid parts.

1679
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:33,820
Six cores really fast, 32 gigs of RAM, MV&E drives,

1680
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:37,860
multiple MV&E drives, brand new fresh power supply,

1681
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,300
cleaned it all out, everything.

1682
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,900
It's just a gorgeous system.

1683
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:43,580
And we installed Kubuntu 1804 Minimal Install on it.

1684
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,940
Minimal Install is so perfect for the studio.

1685
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:47,100
It's so perfect.

1686
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,220
Nothing's missing.

1687
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:49,980
Nothing's missing.

1688
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:50,900
Nothing extra.

1689
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:51,460
They nailed it.

1690
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,340
It's so great.

1691
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:57,660
And so we loaded that on this new OBS Frankenstein machine.

1692
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,420
And Noah and I sat around for hours.

1693
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:01,260
Because last year didn't go so well.

1694
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:02,260
We had a lot of crashes.

1695
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:05,020
Every episode of Linux Unplugged would suffer a crash.

1696
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,300
And both Noah and I just felt super bad about that.

1697
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,380
And he's like, Polar Bear, I don't

1698
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:12,060
want to leave and have that thing crash on you the next day.

1699
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:15,580
And I said, Brown Bear, I don't want to have to go buy a Mac.

1700
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:17,900
So we've got to make sure this works.

1701
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,420
We're getting real talk here.

1702
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,460
If this fails on us, what am I going to do?

1703
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,180
Because I'm at a point where I've tried Unity.

1704
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,180
I've tried Arch.

1705
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:24,940
I've tried Gnome.

1706
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:25,740
I've tried Zubuntu.

1707
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:27,820
We tried Zubuntu during this whole transition.

1708
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:28,700
I've tried it all.

1709
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,460
Fuchsia, that's probably it.

1710
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:32,140
Like, what am I going to do?

1711
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,260
So we have to know this works.

1712
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:37,620
We have to be 100% solid on this.

1713
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:38,140
We'll build it.

1714
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:38,780
We'll set it up.

1715
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:39,700
We'll do some testing.

1716
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,620
We'll run through every single show.

1717
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,940
And we had Alan by this time.

1718
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:43,780
Alan had joined us.

1719
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:47,180
So it's me, Noah, and Alan all working this problem.

1720
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,860
And then we got the new Kubuntu rig set up.

1721
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,260
We went through every single show.

1722
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:54,300
We did a mock version of every show on the network, the three

1723
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:54,620
of us.

1724
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:55,620
It was a lot of fun.

1725
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,100
That's amazing.

1726
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,380
And we were able to be ridiculous because we

1727
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:58,420
weren't streaming any of it.

1728
01:19:58,420 --> 01:19:59,220
So we didn't.

1729
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:00,340
I hope you recorded this.

1730
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,300
No.

1731
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:01,940
I mean, I did.

1732
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:04,580
But I don't know if I kept the files.

1733
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:05,380
We did an unfilter.

1734
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:06,340
We did a Linux unplug.

1735
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,180
We did a BSD now.

1736
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:08,300
We did all of them.

1737
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:10,020
And made sure everything worked.

1738
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,220
We certified it as good and said, OK, now we're going to

1739
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,180
take it up to Linux Fest.

1740
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,740
If it survives that weekend, we'll put it back in the

1741
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:17,980
studio, and we'll lock everything

1742
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,420
down to Kubuntu 18.04.

1743
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:24,840
And it performed so well that Chase Nunes, who was running

1744
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,380
the board, ended up loading up a pinball application on his

1745
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:31,180
laptop and playing pinball while the machine just ran and

1746
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:32,340
did its thing.

1747
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:33,380
Just ran and did its thing.

1748
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:34,460
That says so much.

1749
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:35,100
He played pinball.

1750
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,700
And afterwards, he went up to Angela and said, this was the

1751
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,820
smoothest, easiest year we've ever had.

1752
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,100
It's never ran better.

1753
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:43,660
Did not crash once on us.

1754
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:44,220
Beautiful.

1755
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:45,740
Did not have a single issue.

1756
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:49,140
Now we've recorded three shows through it since we've been

1757
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,700
back from Linux Fest running Kubuntu.

1758
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:55,060
We have it installed on five systems in the immediate room

1759
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:56,380
that we're sitting in right now.

1760
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,260
It's on another system outside.

1761
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:01,500
And it's just been rock solid.

1762
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,980
So I really can't say enough good things

1763
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,660
about Kubuntu 18.04.

1764
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,420
And I've really started to just take to plasma.

1765
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:10,860
I tweak my defaults.

1766
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:14,260
Takes me about a day of just sort of putzing here and

1767
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,900
there, like the first time I open up Dolphin, I change a

1768
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:18,020
few settings.

1769
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:20,860
The first time I log in, I open up settings, and I change

1770
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:22,300
a few things.

1771
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:26,100
But after the first day or two of just doing that on and off,

1772
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:26,820
I'm pretty much done.

1773
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:27,420
And it's set.

1774
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:28,460
You've got it dialed in now.

1775
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:28,900
Yeah.

1776
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:29,900
And loving it.

1777
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:32,900
The performance overhead is less than it was on some of

1778
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:35,060
the other desktop environments.

1779
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:37,620
And I was surprised every time I saw that.

1780
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:39,820
We have an active monitor right here as I'm watching.

1781
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:41,900
I'm still watching the system.

1782
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:46,260
CPU and memory usage is lower by quite a bit than it was on

1783
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:47,580
some GTK desktops.

1784
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,780
You were mentioning earlier, it feels like a professional

1785
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:51,300
workstation.

1786
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,300
Yeah.

1787
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,580
I was teetering on what am I going to do.

1788
01:21:55,580 --> 01:22:00,740
I need a professional grade workstation environment that I

1789
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:03,940
can put on powerful hardware that feels like it's designed

1790
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:05,220
for people to get worked on as professional.

1791
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,700
And that's how Plasma feels for me.

1792
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,060
It just feels professional grade.

1793
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,940
It's just really well done.

1794
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,460
Kubuntu is a really great release.

1795
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,820
I wasn't the biggest fan of the one that was

1796
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,500
based on Plasma 5.5.

1797
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,420
This one, they nailed it.

1798
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:21,780
So my most experience, because I've been installing it on

1799
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:24,900
systems for two weeks now, is with Kubuntu 18.04.

1800
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,780
God knows I've tried it in every which way, different

1801
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:28,020
configuration.

1802
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:31,580
And I even got to see how it performed with failing

1803
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,540
hardware, which was pretty entertaining.

1804
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,780
It was, we had a disk that was going bad in a system, and

1805
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:38,420
KWin disappeared.

1806
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:39,020
Goodbye.

1807
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,980
Just completely disappeared from the system.

1808
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:43,580
And then after we got that fixed, VLC disappeared, just

1809
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,620
completely gone.

1810
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,140
I closed the window, and it was gone.

1811
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:46,820
The entire application.

1812
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:47,740
Never to be seen again.

1813
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:49,780
So it was funny to see how Plasma handled it.

1814
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:53,820
And we telegrammed producer Michael, and we're like,

1815
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:56,300
Rotten, is there any way that KWin could disappear while

1816
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,300
we're using the system?

1817
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,820
No, that's impossible, he writes back.

1818
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:01,220
We're like, um.

1819
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:01,940
It just happened.

1820
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,860
That's when we knew we had some trouble.

1821
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:05,100
But it even did fine there.

1822
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:06,940
You almost wouldn't have even known, except for KWin

1823
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,820
disappeared, and then VLC disappeared.

1824
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:11,300
But it actually did pretty well for quite a while.

1825
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,740
I've been really, really thrilled with it.

1826
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:18,740
I think it's maybe my favorite Linux release maybe ever.

1827
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:19,580
Maybe.

1828
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:20,220
We'll see.

1829
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,180
I mean, we'll see.

1830
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:23,380
Maybe a blow up in my face, and I'll change my tune.

1831
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:23,780
But right now.

1832
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:24,500
I mean, it's early days, right?

1833
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,460
But that's the most exciting part, is you have so much more

1834
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,420
to go, and it'll be with you for a long time, I expect.

1835
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,340
Yeah, it is one of those releases where I'm excited

1836
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,460
again to spread the word.

1837
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:35,380
I got it installed on Hedia's computer.

1838
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:37,980
I'm excited to play with it.

1839
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:40,340
But I'm not getting distracted by tweaking it too much.

1840
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:41,700
It's just, it's so good.

1841
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:42,260
It's so good.

1842
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,060
And there's little things it does, like remembering the

1843
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,500
right spots for my windows to open up.

1844
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,260
So when we're in the studio and we have to launch things

1845
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:48,780
really quickly, they all go in the right place.

1846
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:51,420
And little things like that that make it efficient to use

1847
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,260
that I just really super appreciate.

1848
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,260
And I still got Neon on a couple of systems.

1849
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:55,860
Still pretty great.

1850
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:58,260
I'm really enjoying KDE Neon on my workstation upstairs.

1851
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,420
And I have it on a laptop.

1852
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:01,060
But everything else is KWin2H04.

1853
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:02,300
It just matches my production systems.

1854
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,300
And then on both, you're still in Ubuntu, right?

1855
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,060
It's mostly the same.

1856
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:06,500
Just a little difference on the skin.

1857
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,700
Yeah, I was tempted by Arch a little bit over Linux Fest,

1858
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,300
just because I love that AUR.

1859
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,500
I'm Brent's an Arch user, so I know he understands.

1860
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:21,100
But that idea of the whole stack, the whole stack being

1861
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:24,500
LTS, and my machines just become appliance-like as close

1862
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:25,740
as possible.

1863
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:27,260
And then you've got Livepatch in there too.

1864
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:29,820
So I can even reduce having to reboot there.

1865
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,620
It seems like it's just the right time for you

1866
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:33,540
to have this be stable.

1867
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:35,380
Yeah, because it's really come to a point

1868
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:38,220
where we were considering, do we hire an IT person?

1869
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,720
Because we've got a lot of systems.

1870
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,220
Rekai used to help pick some of that up.

1871
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:43,460
But we've decided, if we can just get these systems

1872
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,940
manageable to a point where I can manage them,

1873
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:47,700
and folks can help me out here and there

1874
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,740
when they're at the studio, that's perfect.

1875
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:53,780
And that's where we kind of moved away from Arch.

1876
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:56,540
We'd look at something getting 300 packages behind on updates

1877
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:57,460
before we could get to it.

1878
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:58,700
And that's where you start rolling the dice,

1879
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:00,460
with Arch, in a pretty big way.

1880
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,620
Arch will run great as long as you stay on top of it.

1881
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:04,760
But when you spread that across six systems,

1882
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:07,220
and those six systems are there to serve

1883
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:09,740
the purpose of doing work, not to do anything else,

1884
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:12,420
it's hard to stay on top of that.

1885
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:13,060
So we'll see.

1886
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:13,940
Very happy with it.

1887
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,460
Very, very happy with Kubuntu 18.04.

1888
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:17,540
I really recommend people give it a try.

1889
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,860
But go get more of our friends over at the Ubuntu podcast.

1890
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:21,940
Sounds like they have a doozy that just came out.

1891
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:23,820
I'm looking forward to hearing that.

1892
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,360
And our friends over at Late Night Linux

1893
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,620
just did their review of 18.04 as well.

1894
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:29,940
And I thought that was pretty great.

1895
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:31,660
So you can go catch out more of that.

1896
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:34,460
And also, you may have heard recently

1897
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:39,940
that Ubuntu 18.04 got loaded on the Nintendo Switch, which

1898
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:41,020
is pretty cool.

1899
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,820
The touch screen works.

1900
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:46,220
Well, Wes and I did a technical breakdown

1901
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:49,380
of how that's done at a hardware level, the exploit,

1902
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:52,140
some of the ways that people are going to make it easier,

1903
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:55,460
and the software in the Tegra that was actually vulnerable.

1904
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:57,660
All that's covered in our TechSnap program,

1905
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:59,180
TechSnap.systems, that would be it.

1906
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:00,060
It's 365.

1907
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:00,700
Thank you, sir.

1908
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:05,340
Episode 365, which, how can you forget that?

1909
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,640
Now, if you're watching live, which is, I mean, come on,

1910
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,140
right?

1911
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:09,740
You should join.

1912
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:10,260
It's too much fun.

1913
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:10,820
Everybody's doing that, right?

1914
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:11,940
It's so obvious.

1915
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:14,220
Well, then you stick around, because the Ask Noah program's

1916
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:14,620
coming up.

1917
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,940
And you've got your Linux sandwich.

1918
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:17,280
You start out with the unplugged program.

1919
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,700
We've got our live show.

1920
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,220
That's where things really start.

1921
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:21,020
Then you've got the main show.

1922
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:22,220
We've got our post show.

1923
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:24,300
And then that Noah Choliah guy comes in.

1924
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,300
Messes everything up.

1925
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:26,340
Takes a whole other round.

1926
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:26,840
Woo.

1927
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:27,380
Woo.

1928
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:30,060
Yeah, I was on his program just a couple of episodes ago.

1929
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,900
And we talked about encryption and how

1930
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,280
some of the different laws that could affect encryption

1931
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,220
could affect open source.

1932
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:36,420
I thought it was a pretty good chat.

1933
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:37,220
So look for that.

1934
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:38,580
But we'll be back here pretty soon.

1935
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:41,820
Thank you so much, Linux Unplugged, slash 247 for links.

1936
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,980
See you next Tuesday.

1937
01:26:43,980 --> 01:27:09,380
See ya.

1938
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:21,580
So many good distro choices this week.

1939
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:24,880
This is really, it's a good week to be a Linux user.

1940
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,480
It's almost like it's the year of the Linux desktop, isn't it?

1941
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,480
It's feeling like it.

1942
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,240
It is in a lot of ways.

1943
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,800
Not as we foresaw it, but...

1944
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,240
You mean because it's Chromebooks?

1945
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:37,240
You look at Chromebooks adding Linux application support, you look at Microsoft adding the

1946
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:44,060
Linux subsystem to Windows, you look at these really solid releases from Ubuntu and Fedora,

1947
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,780
and we've never been in better shape.

1948
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:47,780
It is looking really good.

1949
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:48,780
Although the doubters are still going to doubt.

1950
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:49,780
Yeah.

1951
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:50,780
Well, yeah.

1952
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:51,780
Yeah.

1953
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:52,780
That's true.

1954
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:53,780
Yeah.

1955
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:54,780
But what do they know, right?

1956
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:55,780
All right.

1957
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:56,780
We got to name this thing before we get out of here.

1958
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:57,780
Yeah.

1959
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:58,780
Banks and Jess.

1960
01:27:58,780 --> 01:27:59,780
JBtitles.com.

1961
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:00,780
JBtitles.

1962
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:01,780
Oh, God.

1963
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:02,780
Did you guys see this?

1964
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:03,780
Facebook dating was announced just recently.

1965
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:04,780
Yeah.

1966
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,780
Oh my God.

1967
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,780
Just for you, Dan.

1968
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,780
Yeah.

1969
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:08,780
Yeah.

1970
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:09,780
I'm off Facebook these days.

1971
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:10,780
Oh.

1972
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:12,580
I've been thinking about it a lot.

1973
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:13,580
Yeah.

1974
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:17,340
I saw that and I nearly included it as a news item for the Ubuntu podcast.

1975
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:18,340
Smooth.

1976
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:23,060
I've been thinking about doing the Facebook account delete thing.

1977
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:24,060
I'm not sure.

1978
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,060
It's just a few family members that I would lose touch with.

1979
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:27,060
No.

1980
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:31,780
I just unfriended all of the randos that I'd collected.

1981
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:33,900
OCD shone through.

1982
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:39,060
And it was like, where are all of the people I knew when I was at primary school and connected

1983
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:42,260
with people that I haven't seen since I was 10.

1984
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:46,580
And then some years later, I realized I'd got hundreds of friends that I didn't really

1985
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:47,580
know.

1986
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:53,160
And I just unfriended all the randoms and just coalesced around the people that I actually

1987
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,160
know.

1988
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,160
So Facebook is just me now.

1989
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,160
I actually know.

1990
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,420
It's basically you and my wife, Poppy.

1991
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:58,420
Yeah.

1992
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:01,780
Are you not worried about the data tracking aspects of it, the monitoring you on other

1993
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:04,220
sites via the Facebook like buttons and whatnot?

1994
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:13,300
I am, but if I am not on Facebook and like everything my wife posts within a maximum

1995
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:17,180
of a 37 minute time frame, then she thinks you're mad at her or something.

1996
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:18,180
Yeah, exactly.

1997
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:24,100
So I have to be on Facebook to sort of, you know, have a harmonious, you know, marriage.

1998
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,100
So that's why I'm on Facebook.

1999
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,100
Yeah, I do for family.

2000
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:31,420
I need I need to create a bot that every time Louise posts something, it likes what she's

2001
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:33,420
posted within 37 minutes.

2002
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:37,260
And if I could do that, then I wouldn't have to be saying, yeah, that's worth every cost.

2003
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:38,380
Do you have a Facebook brand?

2004
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:39,380
Do you have a Facebook?

2005
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,380
I do.

2006
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:41,780
And I've been having this exact conversation.

2007
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:45,300
It's like you're repeating what has been happening in my mind wondering if it's time.

2008
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:46,300
Well, yeah.

2009
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:50,460
And I've, you know, maybe one of the solutions to some of these problems is that new Firefox

2010
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,740
plug in that came out to isolate the containers.

2011
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:53,740
Yeah.

2012
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:54,740
Oh, here we go.

2013
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:56,900
I can I can w w up on this.

2014
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,460
So I'm using the Facebook.

2015
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:03,660
Well, I'm using Firefox containers generally, but I use the Facebook one.

2016
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:08,360
Now on my phone, I've removed all of the actual Facebook app.

2017
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:11,540
So I've removed Facebook Messenger and Facebook itself.

2018
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:12,540
Yes.

2019
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:16,440
And and the pages administrator, whatever it's called.

2020
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:21,900
And I have installed there's a there's an application called I forget the exact name.

2021
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:26,820
I think it's just called notifications or notifications FB or something, but it's called

2022
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:27,820
notifications.

2023
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:29,700
I can't find the exact name in a moment.

2024
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:35,900
I have that installed, which polls the web service to see if you've been sent a message

2025
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:39,220
or if somebody's liked something or whatever.

2026
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:47,060
And then I have another app installed called Slim Social, which is a web wrapper around

2027
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:54,860
the Facebook website and the notifications thingy integrates with the Slim Social.

2028
01:30:54,860 --> 01:31:01,180
So now everything on my phone to do with Facebook is constrained to this web app that is in

2029
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:03,860
its own little sandbox.

2030
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:09,740
So I I still get the notifications so I can still like everything Louise posts within

2031
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:15,560
37 minutes, but I don't get all of that invasive shit that the Facebook applications have hooked

2032
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,180
up to the rest of your system.

2033
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,180
Wow.

2034
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,180
I'm going to totally look into that.

2035
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,500
That is so neat.

2036
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,460
I just installed the sorry, go ahead.

2037
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:26,820
I was just I was going to say I'll get the actual names of those apps that are available

2038
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:30,380
in F-Droid and they're also available in the Android app store.

2039
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:31,380
Neat.

2040
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:32,380
What were you going to say Brent?

2041
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,540
I'm just going to give a thumbs up there.

2042
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:38,980
I just installed Slim Social for Linux Fest Northwest to get my Twitter up and going,

2043
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:43,620
but I'm kind of anti or trying to be anti Google store.

2044
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:46,500
So yeah, F-Droid it's in there and it actually works really well.

2045
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,500
Super responsive.

2046
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,500
Double plug.

2047
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,500
Hey Dan.

2048
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,500
Hey.

2049
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:56,140
So what's going to be the recommended retail price for the next version of elementary?

2050
01:31:56,140 --> 01:32:01,660
Are you going to like, you know, what would you say would be a reasonable amount for someone

2051
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:04,020
to pay when they download the ISO?

2052
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:06,340
The default is currently at $10.

2053
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:10,500
Are you going to keep that or change that or what are you going to do?

2054
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,820
I don't think we're going to change it.

2055
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:15,860
We always talk about, oh, we should, you know, run some kind of A-B test or some crap or

2056
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:16,860
whatever.

2057
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:17,860
Right.

2058
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:20,860
Make it $10 equals Alan, then make it $50 or something.

2059
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:21,860
There you go.

2060
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:22,860
That's a good idea.

2061
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:24,660
Actually, that'd be a good feature.

2062
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:31,260
I mean, really what it is, is it's like what you can afford is the appropriate price to

2063
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:32,260
pay.

2064
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:38,140
So if you're, you know, destitute, like don't pay, but if you're Bill Gates, like pay a

2065
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:39,140
lot.

2066
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:40,140
Pay a lot.

2067
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,140
Yeah.

2068
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:42,140
That'd be nice actually.

2069
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,140
I look forward to that.

2070
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:44,140
Well, Brent, thank you for being on the show, man.

2071
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,140
Yes.

2072
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,140
Yeah, this is awesome.

2073
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:47,140
A lot of fun.

2074
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:49,780
How long, how many hours you guesstimate for that drive back?

2075
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:53,780
Well, I have luckily planned ahead, so I've cut it up.

2076
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:54,780
Oh yeah.

2077
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:55,780
Good.

2078
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:00,740
So I'm meeting a friend almost halfway, so taking a ferry going to Victoria for a little

2079
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:01,740
bit.

2080
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:02,740
Good for you.

2081
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:03,940
That's a great ferry ride.

2082
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:04,940
I've never taken it.

2083
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:05,940
Yeah.

2084
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:07,220
Are you doing a walk on or are you going to drive on?

2085
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:08,220
I'm going to walk on.

2086
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:09,220
That's the way to go.

2087
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:10,220
The price is just.

2088
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,220
That's the way to go.

2089
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:12,220
Good for you.

2090
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:14,880
And then I'm hitting up my brother in BC as well.

2091
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,980
And then are you flying from BC to Ontario?

2092
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:17,980
Yeah.

2093
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:18,980
Good.

2094
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:19,980
That's not too bad.

2095
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:20,980
Good for you.

2096
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:21,980
That's a good way to do it.

2097
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:22,980
Well, thank you for being here today.

2098
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:23,980
Thanks for having me this week.

2099
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:24,980
It's been awesome.

2100
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:25,980
Yeah, trekking to our side of the world.
