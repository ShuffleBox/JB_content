00:00.000 --> 00:03.780
This is my Geiger counter project I've been working on for about the past year

00:03.780 --> 00:11.000
I decided to build this project as I discovered these cheaply available radiation motor boards on Amazon or Aliexpress and

00:11.920 --> 00:17.780
Although they like as they stand they give you a nice clicking sound like the recognizable sound you hear on movies and TV

00:17.960 --> 00:19.440
They don't really do an awful lot

00:19.440 --> 00:24.040
So I decided to up the ante a bit by connecting this board to a Raspberry Pi

00:24.520 --> 00:29.720
Feeding the data into influx DB and showing it with Grafana, but then of course it needed a fancy case

00:29.720 --> 00:33.740
So I set up on this expedition to build a steampunk style

00:34.320 --> 00:35.840
Geiger counter case

00:35.840 --> 00:37.160
including

00:37.160 --> 00:43.360
Like custom machine brass parts LEDs and nixie tubes. Yeah, it is a beautiful case

00:43.840 --> 00:47.720
The input to the project is of course generated by the radiation detector

00:47.720 --> 00:55.160
this board generates a pulse for every count which is then fed into custom circuitry to drive the LED displays and

00:55.160 --> 01:03.240
Simultaneously into the Raspberry Pi which as he mentioned not only allows the nixie tubes to update which look

01:03.720 --> 01:07.680
Incredible, but that's also how the data gets into the influx database

01:07.680 --> 01:14.720
And it's kind of a neat little trick because the Raspberry Pi is locked inside this wooden box behind

01:15.360 --> 01:16.800
screws and

01:16.800 --> 01:20.440
Adhesives so there's no getting physically to the pie anymore

01:20.440 --> 01:28.000
Thankfully, you know and this is a show-and-tell over on balena.io so of course the author here is using Balena cloud

01:28.360 --> 01:34.560
To handle all the updates they've got a neat sort of framework where it's all still powered on Docker containers now

01:34.560 --> 01:40.920
They've got their own forked version from from the upstream Moby so that it works well for you know iot embedded use cases

01:41.160 --> 01:46.120
but basically means you can just go you know push some updates to your code push a container to a repository and

01:46.120 --> 01:52.160
Then the pie just pulls those updates runs the new container and you don't have to worry about having to go take all the screws

01:52.160 --> 01:56.680
Out pull your thing out to replace the SD card with your updated less broken software

01:57.080 --> 02:02.600
Plus it's all connected with a VPN connection to a public URL so you can get to the dashboard from anywhere

02:02.760 --> 02:08.200
That's my favorite part they might be known for etcher, but they come up with some pretty cool solutions

02:08.200 --> 02:21.480
It's worth checking out the link in the show notes

02:21.640 --> 02:28.320
Hello friends and welcome into 361 of your weekly Linux talk show my name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Mr.

02:28.320 --> 02:29.160
Payne

02:29.160 --> 02:36.720
361 is packed full of community news our look at the new openSUSE elite 15 to that has been in the works and

02:36.720 --> 02:42.840
Crazy drew got his crazy pebble running rebel, and we'll tell you about that experience

02:43.560 --> 02:49.080
We have an app pick and a lot more so before we go any further. Let's say a hearty

02:49.880 --> 02:56.400
Time-appropriate greetings to cheese and drew hello gentlemen hello internet. I'm not crazy. I'm eccentric

02:57.600 --> 03:04.000
Fair enough, and I agree in a good way in a good way drew because now we get to hear about your experiences with rebel

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
which as a former

03:06.000 --> 03:09.360
Pebble watch owner which has been a while now

03:09.480 --> 03:15.200
I'm really curious to hear how these old devices which I loved mine had the L cars theme on there curious to hear how it

03:15.200 --> 03:16.680
Holds up and also

03:16.680 --> 03:22.200
We have a duty right here at the top of the show a big shout out to our virtual lug time appropriate greetings

03:22.200 --> 03:24.200
mobile room

03:26.680 --> 03:33.480
The force is strong in the mumble room some good voices familiar voices new voices. It's great

03:33.480 --> 03:37.680
It's great, and if I'm not mistaken. I think one of those voices is

03:38.120 --> 03:42.400
Jeff who is joining us from an undisclosed location

03:42.400 --> 03:44.000
I'll say because I actually don't know what it is

03:44.000 --> 03:48.840
And he has a new project announcement this week Jeff welcome to the show or a big update at least yeah

03:48.840 --> 03:54.160
Thank you for having me. I could say I'm from a bunker in New Zealand, but that wouldn't be the truth I

03:54.960 --> 03:57.640
Like it though. I like it a lot, so Jeff

03:57.640 --> 04:00.440
I grabbed a clip or two of you from a video today

04:00.440 --> 04:05.920
But I guess I didn't need to because you're here, and you have a big release

04:06.000 --> 04:10.080
This is an app that I think a lot of us could use it's getting things gnome

04:10.520 --> 04:17.200
Version 0.4 came out today as we're recording just a little bit ago, and it's a big update

04:17.200 --> 04:22.560
It's if I'm not mistaken the first update in a long time with 630 new changes

04:23.120 --> 04:26.640
Hundreds of bug fixes it seems like kind of a big milestone

04:26.640 --> 04:33.700
Yeah, it is and it's an application that I've been using using since what 2009 so it's been a while

04:34.240 --> 04:36.860
I've just decided to not let this application

04:37.760 --> 04:43.880
Go the way of the dodo because it has gone unmaintained for a while, so I just thought this application is too good

04:43.920 --> 04:45.920
it's worth saving and

04:46.160 --> 04:52.320
Now I it's basically the last six and a half years of development packed into one release

04:52.320 --> 04:59.080
So pretty significant seems like there's a lot of focus here on improving the contributor experience

04:59.080 --> 05:02.200
You know with some new methodologies some new structure around how the project is gonna

05:02.200 --> 05:06.240
Go so making you hopeful that the next release won't be in another six years

05:06.360 --> 05:10.200
Yeah, because I'm not gonna try to fix everything under the Sun

05:10.200 --> 05:11.800
I mean that part of the

05:11.800 --> 05:18.080
Part of the way you get to release early and often is to try not to fix everything and just fix the most important things

05:18.080 --> 05:20.080
And then leave all the rest

05:20.080 --> 05:26.480
The that what I call the low-hanging fruit to newcomers to tackle now getting things done

05:26.720 --> 05:32.400
Apps are very popular for those of you that aren't familiar with the getting things done methodology

05:32.400 --> 05:34.720
it's a it's a personal task management system and

05:35.760 --> 05:37.640
I've seen

05:37.640 --> 05:41.120
Hundreds on iOS and Android there's websites dedicated to this

05:41.120 --> 05:46.840
There's entire services and companies like todoist where this is all they do and I'm curious Jeff

05:46.840 --> 05:52.600
What motivates you to make this because it doesn't seem like we're lacking options for commercial offerings

05:52.800 --> 05:54.800
But maybe we are lacking

05:55.680 --> 06:02.520
Really nice well designed beautifully designed. I should say to do apps for Linux. What's your motivation here?

06:02.920 --> 06:06.080
Obviously, I'm biased. I've been using this thing for over a decade

06:06.560 --> 06:15.080
but I do think that getting things gnome has no equivalent on Linux or even arguably on some other platforms and

06:15.080 --> 06:20.240
It's really the I mean, there's maybe one or two other apps including Emacs

06:20.960 --> 06:25.760
That you can use to do GDD on Linux, but it's not the same user experience

06:25.760 --> 06:30.520
It's not, you know built to be not as beautiful as in eye candy

06:30.520 --> 06:34.200
But beautiful in terms of efficiency and terms of workflow

06:34.200 --> 06:42.760
So it has a bunch of little details, you know attention to detail that make it a wholly different thing from your regular to-do list

06:42.760 --> 06:48.480
And someone might say why are you obsessing about something? That's basically a to-do list. But that thing is

06:48.960 --> 06:50.960
You know, it's really easy to make

06:51.640 --> 06:58.680
Grocery shopping list to-do list application. That's basically computer science 101. You hack that in two hours

06:59.560 --> 07:07.000
But making something that is really well integrated and smart and that has all the crazy features that you need to

07:07.000 --> 07:12.600
Do something as advanced as to getting things done methodology or some of the other

07:13.160 --> 07:16.600
Methodologies out there is quite a different ballpark

07:16.920 --> 07:24.840
Yes, it is and you touched on something there that I think is really important for a personal life management app like this

07:25.080 --> 07:27.800
And you said I've been using this for 10 years

07:28.440 --> 07:33.480
Can you talk a little bit about how an app like this needs to be around for a very long time?

07:33.480 --> 07:38.360
And that's why it's kind of risky to go with something like to-do list or a commercial application in this regard

07:38.680 --> 07:43.640
That's part of the reason why I've stubbornly refused to let this app go

07:44.600 --> 07:46.760
completely on maintains is I

07:47.240 --> 07:50.540
Basically invested my life and my my productivity

07:51.160 --> 07:53.960
And I centered everything around this app. Wow

07:54.520 --> 08:00.040
And so you don't really migrate that easily to another app for one thing

08:00.040 --> 08:03.400
You would need other apps to understand the file format and that sort of thing

08:03.960 --> 08:11.480
Those apps usually aren't built to interoperate, you know, especially in the commercial world. Well, they don't really care to

08:12.020 --> 08:15.480
Interoperate I I refuse the notion of

08:16.200 --> 08:18.200
just going out there and paying like a

08:18.520 --> 08:23.880
30 bucks to buy a proprietary application that I I'm not sure will still exist in five years

08:23.880 --> 08:30.920
Whenever the company gets bought out by another company or when they change their terms and condition or they decide to

08:31.400 --> 08:36.280
Stop supporting my platform. That's one of the risks you have with proprietary software

08:37.000 --> 08:41.320
Especially software that you really depend on for your daily life work and play

08:42.040 --> 08:47.640
Is to depend on a system that might not exist next year. Yes. Well put

08:47.720 --> 08:51.720
Yeah, and of course if you switch, I mean all the time spent switching is time wasted

08:51.720 --> 08:55.400
All the time spent switching is time spent not getting things done

08:56.360 --> 09:02.840
Arguably that's also a disease that many gtd practitioners have we have this shiny widget syndrome thing where we

09:03.320 --> 09:05.320
Want to try yet another tool

09:05.400 --> 09:11.560
Um and yet another to do app. Oh and this one promises to be just as more amazing than the previous one

09:12.120 --> 09:13.720
And you spend more time

09:13.720 --> 09:18.840
Playing with the tools than actually using them and this tool. Well, I mean it's good enough it works

09:18.840 --> 09:22.760
So I haven't changed it and I don't want to change it. I just wanted to improve it

09:22.920 --> 09:25.400
I'm curious about the experience of bringing it up to a modern

09:25.960 --> 09:29.880
Gnome application because it it kind of almost looks like an example modern

09:30.360 --> 09:31.640
Gnome desktop app

09:31.640 --> 09:35.800
It's got a lot of the bells and whistles that you see in there and i'm curious

09:36.040 --> 09:40.680
What that process was like to just modernize it. I can't speak for isidor and the other people

09:41.160 --> 09:45.960
Who spent a couple years burning out doing the actual port to gtk 3?

09:45.960 --> 09:53.320
Uh, I just came in and finished the job kind of um by just kind of focusing the project towards a singular goal

09:53.320 --> 09:55.320
or getting the release out and

09:55.320 --> 09:57.160
managing the project properly

09:57.160 --> 10:02.520
But it's more of a technological problem and a problem of risking burnout

10:03.240 --> 10:05.320
Than a design problem

10:05.960 --> 10:12.200
It's kind of special in the way that getting things gnome was kind of so well designed from the get-go

10:12.200 --> 10:18.680
That it was almost a gnome 3 app already in terms of how the ui behaved and everything

10:19.560 --> 10:27.880
Of course, you need to change the code base port to python 3 from python 2 and to integrate things like the gtk header bar widget

10:28.680 --> 10:34.200
To have a nice cleaner ui that is now possible. It was not possible 10 years ago

10:35.320 --> 10:39.720
but the whole design processing that was not the hardest thing the hardest thing is

10:39.720 --> 10:41.720
Getting things gnome done

10:42.200 --> 10:45.800
And getting it out of the door and like so many free software projects

10:45.800 --> 10:51.880
It stands on the work of those who came before you to get some of that work done to get moved over to gtk3

10:51.880 --> 10:55.000
Well, congratulations on the new release

10:55.000 --> 11:00.440
We'll have a link to uh the project page and also the flat hub entry if people want to get the flat pack of it

11:00.680 --> 11:03.720
If you're out there looking for a native local

11:04.360 --> 11:07.880
Task management application either for a beginner or somebody who's fairly advanced

11:07.880 --> 11:12.600
I give this a big hearty recommendation jeff. Thanks for making it on the show and telling us a little bit about it

11:12.600 --> 11:14.600
My pleasure. Thanks for having me

11:16.280 --> 11:20.360
Let's talk about the crazy cats over at fedora now who are just

11:20.920 --> 11:25.720
Working up a whole bunch of stuff for fedora 33 including the end of mod php

11:26.440 --> 11:27.960
and perhaps

11:27.960 --> 11:29.160
more

11:29.160 --> 11:36.840
Interesting to us is no more swap partition fedora normally installs itself with a modest swap partition to take some pressure off

11:36.840 --> 11:44.040
Memory if needed, but a new proposal says to do away with the swap file and instead use a virtual swap device using

11:44.360 --> 11:51.080
Zram the zram device works by compressing memory contents and then storing them back in memory when needed and then retrieving them and

11:51.400 --> 11:57.960
Obviously decompressing when you're compressing and decompressing the ram it's super fast and swapping the zram can

11:58.600 --> 12:03.160
Potentially free up considerable space from a swap file or a swap partition if it's not needed

12:03.160 --> 12:08.360
Yeah, and surprisingly maybe zram is often faster than swapping to a storage device

12:08.680 --> 12:14.520
Even though the cpu has to do the work of compression and decompression, but that's just really fast with modern cpus

12:14.840 --> 12:16.760
Yeah, that'd be interesting to see if that takes off

12:16.760 --> 12:21.560
I could see it especially since I think fedora workstation is really targeted at a lot of laptop users with

12:22.040 --> 12:26.600
Limited ssds. There's also some stuff being considered at the lower levels of fedora

12:26.600 --> 12:32.600
Yeah, some interesting potential changes on compiler policies now long-standing fedora policies are

12:32.600 --> 12:37.260
Fedora policy as it is now says that the entire distribution has to be built with gcc

12:37.880 --> 12:45.160
With exceptions only for packages that cannot be built with gcc, but the plan for fedora 33 is to get rid of that requirement

12:45.720 --> 12:50.120
Instead the compiler used for any given package would be the one preferred by upstream

12:50.280 --> 12:53.480
Well, assuming that upstream has expressed a preference, of course

12:53.960 --> 12:57.640
That would open the way for building a number of llvm preferring packages

12:57.640 --> 13:03.560
Without maintainers having to struggle to get a working build with gcc and that seems pretty great if you want to you know

13:03.560 --> 13:07.880
Maintain good relationships with upstream, especially if you've already been building with llvm and here you go

13:07.880 --> 13:11.720
Just some downstream, you know distro says oh no if you want your package here

13:12.120 --> 13:14.120
You got to use an entirely different tool chain

13:14.280 --> 13:19.320
Yeah, I hadn't really thought about that problem before lwn.net has some great coverage of the reactions, too

13:19.640 --> 13:22.200
Which we'll have linked in the show notes if you'd like to grab that

13:22.200 --> 13:29.500
Jeff law is driving this change and he said using the upstream preferred compiler would make life easier for fedora package maintainers

13:30.040 --> 13:32.540
Some of these proposals have strong reactions

13:32.920 --> 13:40.120
But the one that I think has probably gotten the most strongest reaction is that crazy cat neil who's in the mumble room right now

13:40.200 --> 13:46.360
Has proposed that fedora change the default file system for fedora workstation to butter fs

13:47.160 --> 13:50.360
And i'd say it's seen the whole gamut of responses neil

13:50.360 --> 13:53.880
Ha ha ha you're here. Yeah. Yes. Yes

13:55.480 --> 13:59.560
You sound tired you sound tired it showed up on devil on a friday

14:00.040 --> 14:06.540
And thank goodness. I I had the day off that friday. And so that friday saturday sunday

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
monday and tuesday

14:09.000 --> 14:15.800
I was responding to things basically almost every other email and pouring over it and trying to figure out

14:15.800 --> 14:22.840
You know what's going on and the feedback the good news is that it's generally been very balanced. It was very the the fedora community

14:23.560 --> 14:27.400
Took it seriously and responded with really useful feedback that helped us

14:28.120 --> 14:33.960
Tune and refine the the proposal and also I want to point out that this is not just workstation

14:34.360 --> 14:38.120
Every fedora desktop flavor is switching

14:38.920 --> 14:43.880
The only variants not switching right now are fedora server and fedora cloud

14:43.880 --> 14:47.560
Those two variants are remaining with their current setup, which is for cloud

14:47.880 --> 14:54.440
I think it's just a single big x4 volume and for server. It's xfs on lvm

14:54.920 --> 14:57.080
And fedora core os also has its like

14:57.640 --> 14:58.840
Strange

14:58.840 --> 15:06.360
X4 based thing, but yeah, that's the change that's just because it reflects the intentions of rel not to make a switch to butter fs

15:06.680 --> 15:09.000
Yeah, it's it's that but also um

15:09.000 --> 15:14.120
One of the primary motivating factors for changing to butter fs is that there's this space contention thing

15:14.120 --> 15:17.320
I know you talked about this on air a few weeks ago

15:18.040 --> 15:21.880
The space contention thing is essentially the biggest driver for this

15:22.440 --> 15:25.960
the next driver for using butter fs over alternatives is that

15:26.680 --> 15:29.000
Anaconda the red hat fedora installer

15:29.640 --> 15:34.860
Has special behavior when it comes to butter fs sub volumes if you wish to reinstall

15:34.860 --> 15:41.980
And you have home as a separate sub volume. It will not make you blow it away because it will just make a new

15:42.620 --> 15:49.900
root sub volume or erase the existing one and then remount the new one that you make and you can reuse the existing roots of

15:50.220 --> 15:55.580
Home sub volume and that lets you preserve your data as you reinstall so you get to have your cake and eat it too

15:55.980 --> 16:02.300
Access to all the space while also being able to reliably preserve data across reinstalls, which can happen

16:02.300 --> 16:06.880
There are for various reasons people may want to reinstall. Maybe they want to switch desktop environments

16:07.100 --> 16:10.220
They want to change some settings or whatever

16:10.460 --> 16:16.780
So like this is about making sure that that's still possible because every other alternative blocks that now on the other hand

16:16.780 --> 16:20.480
There has been some pushback and I think there's also a lot of folks still who are uncomfortable

16:21.020 --> 16:26.380
Around the idea of butter fs. They consider it unsafe, but I remember a time

16:26.380 --> 16:31.740
When the newer versions of the extended file system like three and four were considered a mess

16:31.820 --> 16:34.860
I remember a time when riser fs was a mess

16:34.860 --> 16:40.540
I remember a time when a lot of file systems were rough and they got better as development continued

16:40.780 --> 16:44.060
The file systems that didn't get better just didn't have active development

16:44.460 --> 16:50.140
And I think the big difference back then was is we didn't have all of these platforms to amplify the problems

16:50.140 --> 16:54.380
You didn't have social media reddit and podcasts and youtube videos that were

16:54.380 --> 17:01.420
Just amplifying the issues you were just a person in a data center dealing with data loss by yourself

17:01.740 --> 17:06.220
Maybe bitching on a form or a bbs and it was essentially contained

17:06.220 --> 17:11.260
But now there's an amplification chamber where people who don't really know the cause of the problems

17:11.260 --> 17:17.420
I it seems like if you go by the data a lot of file system issues that butter fs run into today

17:17.740 --> 17:20.780
Are actually caused by crappy firmware on disks

17:20.780 --> 17:24.060
And this is something that's bared out at facebook as well about

17:24.860 --> 17:26.860
five six years ago

17:26.940 --> 17:31.500
Facebook started seriously ramping up towards the next generation storage architecture

17:31.820 --> 17:36.700
And they hired on developers to work on butter fs as their select as their choice for this

17:37.100 --> 17:39.100
And they've discovered over time

17:39.340 --> 17:43.500
That basically things that people expected it to be butter fs's fault

17:43.500 --> 17:50.540
Wound up being stupid things like the storage controller just can't handle massive. Io load and started rejecting drives

17:51.180 --> 17:55.660
Or the ssd just like chokes out because like it just does the wrong thing

17:55.980 --> 17:59.980
And the problem is that butter fs is sensitive to those things other file systems are not

18:00.620 --> 18:07.180
And you know people do things like well, let's intentionally punch holes through the file system and see if butter fs can recover

18:07.580 --> 18:11.100
The problem with that strategy when you compare it against the old system

18:11.100 --> 18:17.980
The problem with that strategy when you compare it against xfs and x4 is that when you do that?

18:18.620 --> 18:23.180
The way that fisk works is that it attempts to repair the mountability of the file system

18:23.180 --> 18:25.740
It tries to restore the integrity of the metadata at all costs

18:26.460 --> 18:29.340
This means that you could entirely have the possibility

18:30.460 --> 18:34.700
Of restoring an x4 xfs file system where the links to the data

18:35.820 --> 18:40.540
Are fine, but the data itself is bad, right? And it just continues on as if nothing's wrong

18:40.540 --> 18:42.220
Exactly and in butter fs's case

18:42.220 --> 18:48.380
And of course you and I both are aware like we've talked about zfs before zfs also does this if you repair the file system

18:48.780 --> 18:53.020
And it does a validation of the data as part of relinking the metadata to the data

18:53.420 --> 19:00.460
And it it discovers that the data is broken. It will loudly tell you so and it will say you've lost data

19:00.860 --> 19:02.700
Good luck. Have fun

19:02.700 --> 19:09.900
My final thoughts on this because I know we've talked about it a lot is essentially in the ven diagram of when to adopt

19:09.900 --> 19:14.860
Open source or free software. I think butter fs is now sitting in the sweet middle

19:15.100 --> 19:16.860
It needs more deployments

19:16.860 --> 19:23.580
But it has now been tested not only in scale with lots of nas products that ship with butter fs

19:23.900 --> 19:29.820
And obviously at facebook that gets mentioned all the time, but also as the default file system on opensusa for years

19:29.980 --> 19:37.100
So we've had a lot of production testing and now we could bring it to even more masses and the reality is fedora and redhat

19:37.100 --> 19:42.220
They're never going to ship zfs as the default file system, but they need a competitive product

19:42.460 --> 19:45.760
They need something that competes with modern ntfs and apfs

19:46.460 --> 19:50.380
Things like snapshot based backups and windows shadow copies

19:50.860 --> 19:55.260
Have been commonplace in the commercial operating systems for a while now

19:55.500 --> 20:01.580
And we will never even get to the point of starting to build those features into things like our desktop environments and our file managers

20:01.580 --> 20:07.740
Or even user land tools until it's shipped developers need the code shipping to use it and there's things

20:07.740 --> 20:12.700
We need to work out too on how to properly ship all the updates and all of that that will only happen

20:12.940 --> 20:14.940
When we start to do it at scale

20:14.940 --> 20:21.180
And it seems to me that if you were to review the landscape of possible linux distributions that this could happen in

20:21.740 --> 20:23.740
Fedora is an obvious case

20:24.220 --> 20:30.060
My old butt remembers a time when fedora was so cutting edge that they adopted pulse audio before everybody else

20:30.060 --> 20:35.260
And they shipped a volume applet in the gnome menu bar that didn't actually change the volume

20:35.500 --> 20:38.380
But they plan to make that work in the next release

20:38.940 --> 20:43.760
And it was important to get pulse audio out in front of end users and make it reliable

20:44.140 --> 20:48.220
and fedora could bring butterfs to a whole new scale of users and

20:48.620 --> 20:55.900
The ideal fedora user from a project standpoint is a sysadmin devops developer type person who's using a laptop

20:55.900 --> 21:02.400
With an ssd in it. That's probably 512 gigs or less and that is such a perfect use case for butterfs

21:03.100 --> 21:04.380
additionally

21:04.380 --> 21:10.460
features like encryption are coming down the pipeline that already use the same mature data pipeline that

21:10.860 --> 21:16.860
Compression uses on butterfs which means it's going to be a solid crypto using a solid proven data pathway

21:17.180 --> 21:23.020
To make it happen and you'll be able to encrypt a single file a single folder or encrypt an existing

21:23.020 --> 21:28.220
Mount point without having to wipe the data and set it up again and that

21:28.780 --> 21:36.380
Single limitation that exists now in linux has forced vendors like system 76 to create installer

21:36.920 --> 21:40.780
Methodologies that wipe and reload your system after you receive it

21:41.100 --> 21:46.380
Which if you think about it is mental that they have to do that because it just enters so many

21:46.520 --> 21:50.540
Possibility of mistakes and errors where it could leave the user with an unusable system

21:50.540 --> 21:52.780
So they have to test the hell out of it

21:53.420 --> 21:58.220
To just work around this problem where they can't encrypt a mount point or a home folder that already exists

21:58.460 --> 22:00.700
So they can't ship you a system that's set up and ready to go

22:00.940 --> 22:03.420
They have to do that work and that's crazy

22:03.660 --> 22:09.260
And it seems like something from the 90s and linux should be a bastion of technical excellence

22:09.500 --> 22:14.300
And we have a file system here. That is gpl. It's free software

22:14.540 --> 22:18.380
It's completely cool and okay to link it to the kernel

22:18.380 --> 22:22.620
And we're just sitting on our hands going. I don't know. I've heard some bad stuff about it

22:22.860 --> 22:25.740
Meanwhile, people are putting in production going actually it's gotten a lot better

22:26.380 --> 22:30.140
Last but not least even though I said, I know it was almost done. But now i'm going on a roll

22:30.940 --> 22:37.740
I was a big critic. I said it was junk and I was willing to revisit that and try it in production again

22:38.140 --> 22:43.020
I even was willing to revisit it after I blew away data because I realized it wasn't butterfess's fault

22:43.020 --> 22:45.020
It was my fault. I screwed it up

22:45.020 --> 22:48.140
I even I will now eat my words and say, you know what? It's gotten better

22:48.140 --> 22:51.180
Maybe it was crap when I tried it and my systems wouldn't boot in the past

22:51.420 --> 22:54.940
But now here I am using it and it's been working fantastic for me

22:55.260 --> 23:01.340
And I just have to implore people to just give it another look because the reality about free software

23:01.340 --> 23:04.940
And this is something that's great is that as long as development continues

23:04.940 --> 23:10.140
It's always improving and if you haven't checked in lately, then maybe your opinion's out of date and

23:10.620 --> 23:12.620
I'm not saying it's forever use case

23:12.620 --> 23:19.340
But the developer workstation with a 256 gigabyte ssd in their laptop. I think it's probably the ideal case

23:20.140 --> 23:26.940
End of soapbox, but I would love to see it happen in fedora 33 and i'm curious neil in your personal opinion

23:27.740 --> 23:29.740
How close is that actually to happening?

23:29.740 --> 23:33.420
I mean is this is this getting dangled in front of me and it's going to be yanked away

23:33.660 --> 23:39.580
I sure hope not. I mean like man i've been working on this personally for a little over three years

23:39.580 --> 23:44.940
Like I i've been doing integration at almost every layer of the stack for a few years now, and it's just

23:45.660 --> 23:50.460
Nobody more than me would be sad if I had to feet from the jaws of victory here

23:51.260 --> 23:57.020
I have no reason to expect it to not be approved and that we would not start going forward with this

23:57.340 --> 23:59.340
Within the next day or so

23:59.900 --> 24:04.540
Basically once it's approved formally by fesco fedora engineering steering committee

24:05.020 --> 24:08.380
Then uh, we will go forward with starting to implement all this

24:08.380 --> 24:15.820
and like I have in my mind a mental road map of ideas of things that we can do to start leveraging these things as we

24:16.120 --> 24:23.680
Validate and test these features and integrate them into our user experience. I'm going through this actually fairly conservatively

24:24.220 --> 24:29.980
There are many things that I am personally using that i'm not even including in this change proposal because I want to make sure

24:30.540 --> 24:35.340
That we have this rock solid as we go forward and adopt features. That makes sense

24:35.340 --> 24:38.700
It's no fun to be the guy who has to say well, i'm sorry

24:38.780 --> 24:42.460
Like your data's gone because like you messed up here. It's neil's fault

24:42.460 --> 24:46.460
He got everybody to use butter fs and you lost your data because of neil. Yeah, no, no

24:47.980 --> 24:49.980
The reason why i'm excited for it is

24:50.780 --> 24:52.780
I like to see this stuff happen

24:52.780 --> 24:58.780
I like to be on the front lines and watch it and then hopefully see developers begin to integrate it and that just won't happen

24:59.340 --> 25:03.740
Because today I could install fedora and I could choose butter fs or xfs and I have

25:03.740 --> 25:08.940
And it's fine, but it's basically as functional as any other file system. There's nothing

25:09.500 --> 25:15.580
Integrated with the operating system. There's no real advantage to it. Um, it's just disconnected

25:15.580 --> 25:18.700
It's disjointed and we can begin to bring that together

25:19.100 --> 25:24.460
If we start to deploy this default and still leave all the other file systems available for people to select you could oh you could

25:24.780 --> 25:26.780
You could put extended 2 on there for all I care

25:27.340 --> 25:31.340
So i'll keep an eye on it neil. Hopefully we'll see it developed now. We are going to be off next week

25:31.340 --> 25:36.460
So if it does happen, uh, I mean we're pre-recorded is what I should say because we never really take a week off

25:37.020 --> 25:41.020
It's the steady beat of lup, but uh, if it does happen, we'll have to cover it in two weeks

25:41.900 --> 25:43.420
Should be interesting

25:43.420 --> 25:48.220
Um, and then actually you know what if it does happen, uh, we'll be talking about it in the lup lug

25:48.220 --> 25:52.240
So why don't we right here? This is probably the best time to do a little housekeeping

25:55.180 --> 25:59.340
So the lup lug happens every sunday at new york time

25:59.340 --> 26:04.700
It happens every sunday at noon pacific the regular broadcast time in our mumble room up in the lobby

26:04.700 --> 26:09.260
I encourage you to join it now. I mention the mumble all the time and I want to let you know how to find it

26:09.660 --> 26:12.460
I should probably put it on the main linux unplugged website

26:13.340 --> 26:15.900
Never crossed my mind wouldn't that be an idea?

26:16.380 --> 26:18.620
You know, I guess we just been around a long time west

26:18.620 --> 26:23.180
We never thought about it because the traditional way is you just go google search jupiter colony mumble

26:23.580 --> 26:26.780
And the setup guide is there you can follow that and

26:26.780 --> 26:30.940
And get it set up in a few minutes, but I think we probably should have something on the main site

26:30.940 --> 26:35.740
So we'll probably do that eventually go google search mumble jupiter colony and you'll find it in there

26:35.740 --> 26:38.220
You'll find the guide get it all set up and then join us on a sunday

26:38.620 --> 26:42.380
And chat with us and be part of a lug. We have 30 folks in here right now

26:42.940 --> 26:48.300
If you think about that in terms of people showing up for a lug meeting, that's a really great attendance

26:48.620 --> 26:50.620
Usually on sundays we usually have around 20

26:50.940 --> 26:52.940
And we're just chatting about all kinds of stuff

26:52.940 --> 26:58.460
So yeah, like I mentioned, we won't be live next tuesday, but the lug lug continues every single sunday

26:58.780 --> 27:01.820
And then the live show will be back on the 21st of july

27:02.360 --> 27:07.760
2020 obviously if you're listening to this in the future i'm going on a little family trip to montana

27:08.380 --> 27:10.540
And then linux headlines will also be off

27:11.020 --> 27:17.500
Back on the 20th because drew's taking a little time off too. That's great. Huh? It's about time. We're finally letting him

27:17.500 --> 27:22.540
Finally, I mean i'm gonna make him set up cameras and wear a tracker obviously

27:23.260 --> 27:26.860
But we're gonna let him take a little time off and then you can always check the calendar

27:28.460 --> 27:32.380
Yeah, put that put that tracker back on drew this ankle monitor is giving me a rash dude

27:33.580 --> 27:38.880
Yeah, yeah, that's what my kids and wife complain about too. Uh, you can know when we're live at jupiter broadcasting.com

27:39.500 --> 27:43.180
Calendar, hopefully we just keep that updated and it's all over there and then you don't have to worry about it

27:43.180 --> 27:47.280
So there you have it. That's it. That's all I got for you in the housekeeping

27:50.460 --> 27:56.620
Nice and tidy around here west doesn't take very long. This is my last uh, my last podcast

27:57.660 --> 28:03.980
Total into from texas. You sound a little sentimental about that. I am i've i've liked my i've enjoyed my time down here

28:04.460 --> 28:06.460
It's so much nicer to drive down here

28:06.460 --> 28:10.860
They've got like side highways west that go along the main highway and then they've got frontage roads

28:10.860 --> 28:16.540
And then they've got toll roads and uh, so you can just zip around here. You just zip. I mean i'm in

28:17.100 --> 28:19.100
austin and it's still

28:19.500 --> 28:23.500
Better traffic than you get 50 miles north of seattle. So I will miss that

28:23.820 --> 28:29.660
I won't miss the heat though. The feels like temperature is 108 degrees fahrenheit today. So I won't I won't miss that

28:30.540 --> 28:33.020
Um, all right. Well, let's talk about open susa leap

28:33.640 --> 28:36.780
15.2 a new leap is upon us

28:36.780 --> 28:43.100
Speaking of uh butter fs based systems. I have not tried out susa in about

28:43.720 --> 28:50.940
275 years so I thought why not give it a go and immediately install the server version which i'll talk about

28:51.420 --> 28:53.660
in a little bit, but uh sus has

28:54.380 --> 28:55.580
leaped again

28:55.580 --> 28:59.740
I don't really know what to say about sus because to me it's this linux distribution

29:00.220 --> 29:05.580
that I try for a little bit and then I end up usually going back to other distros just because

29:05.580 --> 29:09.820
I've never really just gotten in the groove but 15.2 contains a lot of nice stuff

29:09.820 --> 29:15.020
The shipping sway for wayland, which as you know is a drop-in replacement for the i3 window manager

29:15.980 --> 29:20.300
they're also including a real-time kernel for some folks that need that like uh

29:20.940 --> 29:26.300
Embedded devices or audio pros or if you're capturing a lot of data real-time can be

29:26.860 --> 29:30.220
Very important. It's just nice to see this going in another distribution

29:30.220 --> 29:36.140
Of course yas has gotten some improvements as always and the other thing that's interesting about leap is they're

29:36.780 --> 29:41.100
Continuing to support a migration strategy to go from open susa leap

29:41.660 --> 29:44.860
To susa linux enterprise their commercial product

29:45.580 --> 29:50.060
Which I suppose probably happens. Well, right. I mean, you know, you maybe you're testing it out

29:50.060 --> 29:55.340
Maybe you're considering switching or you just you know, you build out your prototype down the road your business does well and you realize

29:55.340 --> 29:58.540
Oh, you know, we we really we can afford support now. We need support now

29:58.540 --> 30:01.740
And you don't have to re-architect stuff. You should just you know, switch on over. Yeah

30:01.740 --> 30:05.660
It's just all those people are using ubuntu. Well, there is that but maybe you're in germany

30:05.740 --> 30:11.820
Yeah, I suppose it's just you know in the ubuntu model and I don't mean to to to to harsh on susa's vibe here

30:11.820 --> 30:15.660
But in the ubuntu model, it's just one ubuntu. You just go get the lts

30:16.460 --> 30:23.180
There's no silly different versions. It feels like a windows thing to do this. Yeah, or I mean it is definitely an older style

30:23.180 --> 30:24.460
I guess right

30:24.460 --> 30:29.820
Not as not a hyper converged, which is okay. I mean that still works for a lot of people. But yeah, I could see it

30:29.980 --> 30:32.940
I could see it being a possibility of try before you buy sort of thing

30:33.660 --> 30:38.700
So let's go around the horn and see what you all thought cheesy. Let's start with you. Why don't we do a

30:39.260 --> 30:44.140
You know the old say what you didn't like and then end on what you did like and so i'm gonna look at this as kind

30:44.140 --> 30:50.560
Of a new user perspective this perspective. I generally like to give someone that that hasn't used a lot of linux distributions

30:50.560 --> 30:55.920
And susa's one of those that's kind of like you said kind of on the outskirts a little bit that a lot of people may not have

30:56.960 --> 30:58.880
Um yas

30:58.880 --> 31:00.880
While cool is still yas

31:01.120 --> 31:08.080
Um and feels a little nostalgic to me. The the installation was a little awkward. I didn't get you know, um,

31:08.640 --> 31:10.640
Like a simple partitioning

31:11.180 --> 31:15.040
Method, uh, it did select the disk that was empty by default

31:15.040 --> 31:20.560
So it was smart enough to know that this disc didn't have any other file systems on it. Um, use that disk

31:20.880 --> 31:27.120
There were also some other little features in the installer which kind of annoyed me. They had uh green buttons with gray text on them

31:27.840 --> 31:29.840
Why would you ever do that? It's a horrible idea

31:29.920 --> 31:34.320
Please don't because I didn't know when to click next was it done? Was it supposed to light up?

31:34.560 --> 31:39.440
You know black over the green button whenever it was done. I didn't know so that was a little awkward

31:39.440 --> 31:42.400
But I mean installation was pretty straightforward. No big deal there

31:42.400 --> 31:48.720
The default installation and version of grub recognized my popos install on another disc

31:49.280 --> 31:52.000
And was fine. I was able to you know switch into either one

31:52.560 --> 31:54.560
however, after I

31:54.640 --> 31:59.040
Updated it for the first time it removed that entry from grub

31:59.760 --> 32:04.240
So, you know not a big deal something I can get through but you know

32:04.240 --> 32:09.360
If you are a user that's trying out multiple distributions on a system with multiple hard drives that might be

32:09.360 --> 32:14.480
Something you come across and then after the first update as well auto login was turned on by default

32:14.560 --> 32:19.520
Yeah, I think it is in the installer too. I think during the installation. Why would you that's no

32:20.080 --> 32:22.080
Well, you know, I I think there are

32:22.320 --> 32:27.040
By far and large my use case is you know the system i'm setting up at home where yeah

32:27.040 --> 32:28.640
I never turned that on but

32:28.640 --> 32:33.200
I imagine for a lot of people it doesn't make sense to have to log in if you have one compute user on the account

32:33.200 --> 32:35.200
And you keep your computer in your house

32:35.200 --> 32:41.120
Especially right now. That's true. But I mean, I I think it's always good practice to have a login

32:41.280 --> 32:45.040
The thing that's annoying about that is then you just have to unlock the keychain anyways, you know

32:45.040 --> 32:50.320
Like kd wallet or gnome keychain still has to be unlocked when you auto log in and so you end up just having to put your

32:50.400 --> 32:55.360
Password in anyways, right? Right. They also use a little bit older version of gnome

32:56.160 --> 33:02.560
Which was good because the the problem I'd had with folders in gnome 3.6 is that you have to have a keychain

33:02.560 --> 33:07.040
I'd had with folders in gnome 3.6 isn't there because they're using gnome 3.4

33:07.520 --> 33:09.520
That does use the 5.3 kernel

33:10.000 --> 33:14.400
And then another thing that was just really kind of awkward to me. I've seen other distributions do this

33:15.520 --> 33:17.520
There were two terminal applications

33:18.240 --> 33:22.000
There were two mail applications by default. So there seemed like a lot of

33:22.880 --> 33:26.240
Stuff they could have cleaned up. Yeah, it's just an old way of doing it, huh?

33:26.640 --> 33:31.520
Yeah, well and it's you know, they just auto populate the the menus and and that's what you get, right?

33:31.520 --> 33:34.480
So, I mean, I I like that it's

33:35.440 --> 33:41.360
Installed by default like having mutt there is cool. But if you're going to do that does mutt really need

33:42.080 --> 33:47.280
An icon in your application menu if you're just going to open up the terminal and open mutt that way

33:47.680 --> 33:50.560
So it seems a little weird in that regard

33:51.360 --> 33:58.080
You know, I would have personally cleaned up a few of the apps and made that selection a little a little better for the end user

33:58.080 --> 34:03.360
But on the good side, I mean it did seem pretty snappy. I know i'm the only person in the world

34:03.440 --> 34:07.280
That's a fan of hot corners, but they were turned on by default, which I thought was cool

34:08.000 --> 34:11.360
The offline installer was super cool. Yeah, I do like that

34:11.600 --> 34:18.960
It threw me back into a little bit of nostalgia right with yas an offline installer. Everything's there on you know, the 4.6 gigabyte

34:19.440 --> 34:22.320
Uh iso reading the release notes as files install

34:23.360 --> 34:25.360
Right, you know, so I mean it was cool. It was cool

34:25.360 --> 34:29.920
And then the the overall selection of default apps were pretty solid apps

34:29.920 --> 34:32.960
I mean they weren't bad, but there were some redundant apps, which is kind of weird but

34:33.520 --> 34:36.640
Overall, I mean, I think it's a good distro. Is it something that i'm going to use

34:37.440 --> 34:41.040
On the day-to-day, you know, probably not at least not right now

34:41.760 --> 34:45.520
But I will review it again in the future as I mean it was the very first

34:46.240 --> 34:51.600
User-friendly distro that I ever ever used. I think I pretty much am right in line with your observations there

34:51.600 --> 34:58.320
It feels almost like a a different branch where there were trying things out and some things have stuck that didn't stick in

34:58.880 --> 35:04.080
The other branch of linux and some things should be adopted that haven't been adopted by the other branch of linux

35:04.560 --> 35:09.120
Wes i'm curious your thoughts on this guy. Um, I think in my opinion

35:09.680 --> 35:14.800
The installer manages to strike that balance of easy to use for the most part

35:14.800 --> 35:21.280
But gives power users a lot of options and perhaps I think it gets there a little better than anaconda does for fedora

35:21.600 --> 35:27.600
You know, honestly, I was really impressed with the installer. It's been ages since i've installed open susa

35:28.080 --> 35:31.520
And yeah, you know, um parts especially during the actual installation

35:31.600 --> 35:34.080
It was a little bit slow for me now full disclosure

35:34.080 --> 35:38.720
I was installing in a virtual machine and then rebooted, you know into the real os afterwards

35:39.120 --> 35:43.760
That might have just been my own internet or you know, whatever mirrors I happened to be using at the time

35:43.760 --> 35:49.280
But the rest of the installation experience really I couldn't have been happier with and I was really impressed at the end

35:49.360 --> 35:53.040
Especially you just got this really detailed rundown of all the options

35:53.040 --> 35:56.560
You've configured and then little clickable links if you need to go adjust that

35:56.960 --> 36:00.000
One that really stood out to me was let's say you want to change, you know

36:00.000 --> 36:03.840
If you're enabling or disabling specter mitigations, you just click on that

36:04.400 --> 36:08.960
Pops you up to where you can go make adjustments to whatever grub parameters are going to get set for your kernel command line

36:09.360 --> 36:12.720
Right there in the installer and I don't see that hardly anywhere else

36:12.720 --> 36:15.520
Yeah, it really felt like it was at home in the enterprise

36:15.840 --> 36:19.760
But it didn't make you go through those things if you're just a normal user and you know

36:19.840 --> 36:21.280
You don't even know what that means

36:21.280 --> 36:27.840
I do agree with you that anything to do with package management feels like your soul dies a little bit

36:28.480 --> 36:34.080
I I just wince when I click on the online updates and it does like the four or five

36:34.700 --> 36:40.160
Prerequisite things that it has to do before it can even execute the very task that i've asked for and it's just

36:40.160 --> 36:47.040
Compared to every other package manager on the entire planet that just immediately gets to work when you tell it to do an update

36:47.280 --> 36:52.800
I find that just soul crushing the transactional server option was interesting

36:52.960 --> 36:59.280
So this is an installer mode you can now select and one of the key features is a read-only root file system

36:59.520 --> 37:02.640
You kind of need that if you're going to go with the whole transactional style, right?

37:02.640 --> 37:07.520
And we've all had especially thinking of upgrades over in the debian world with apt where

37:07.520 --> 37:11.600
Something breaks or maybe it's on arch and suddenly you just you can't change your packages

37:11.600 --> 37:16.640
You don't know what to do and you just wish you could roll that back and try it again later, right?

37:16.640 --> 37:20.320
And if you enable this transactional server support, that's what it does

37:20.800 --> 37:22.400
It comes with a read-only file system

37:22.400 --> 37:29.600
And then when you install stuff it all goes in a brand new snapshot and only if that installation to the snapshot volume goes well

37:29.760 --> 37:32.400
Do you actually go reboot into the new system?

37:32.400 --> 37:37.040
One thing that's different too, you know compared to things like um, like os tree or some of the core os style

37:37.040 --> 37:41.040
You know, there's been a lot of different takes on this idea, but in the open suse land

37:41.200 --> 37:43.920
It's all powered by the same zipper and butter fs

37:43.920 --> 37:49.760
So you don't have to rebuild your packages to support this new transactional style. You just basically get it for free

37:49.920 --> 37:54.240
There's a good example of a distribution that is starting to leverage

37:54.640 --> 37:59.360
The built-in capabilities of butter fs instead of having to create that code themselves from scratch

37:59.360 --> 38:02.720
And it's just an aspect of maturity of shipping butter fs for a while

38:03.040 --> 38:07.040
These things are just now commonly available to them and they can integrate them more and more

38:07.360 --> 38:13.600
And I I think that was a key point I was trying to make earlier with the fedora adoption is they have to adopt it

38:14.080 --> 38:19.120
Now in order for features like this to come along down the road. This is pretty neat stuff here

38:19.200 --> 38:23.440
Yeah, the other stuff I thought was really kind of neat is um, there's a transactional shell feature

38:23.600 --> 38:26.720
So if you'd like after that installation installs into this new snapshot

38:26.720 --> 38:29.360
You can get a shell, you know, basically a cheroot into that environment

38:29.360 --> 38:34.240
If you want to go test some things out make sure your package is installed correctly tweak any of the configuration before you reboot

38:34.720 --> 38:39.360
And I think another sign of maturity. There's a built-in health checker framework

38:39.360 --> 38:44.080
So after you've rebooted into the new server the health checker runs and verifies the state of the system

38:44.080 --> 38:48.320
So you make sure that all the services you need are running make sure that the database you installed starts up

38:48.320 --> 38:50.640
Okay, and it's just a bunch of shell scripts

38:50.640 --> 38:54.560
So it's easy to extend if you know, you're using this to build your own custom application

38:54.560 --> 38:58.000
You can include your own logic there to make sure that your custom app starts up

38:58.000 --> 39:03.600
Okay, and if not, the system automatically rolls back to the previous snapshots and reboots, so you're done

39:04.320 --> 39:05.840
that is

39:05.840 --> 39:07.840
So what i'm talking about

39:08.080 --> 39:14.080
That is really a really nice setup and like you said it just seems like a mature way to do it

39:14.560 --> 39:18.000
It's enterprise grade. Exactly. So check out leap

39:18.000 --> 39:22.240
It's a pretty solid option. And if you're not an old grump like me

39:22.240 --> 39:24.240
Who's stuck in his ways?

39:24.320 --> 39:29.760
It may be a great opportunity to try something that has a lot of unique features and capabilities to it

39:30.160 --> 39:34.880
I think it's something kind of special in the linux world and we don't talk about a lot because none of us are susa users

39:35.360 --> 39:37.680
But i'd love to hear your experiences with it

39:37.680 --> 39:43.200
If you have tried out 15.2 go to linux unplugged dot com slash contact

39:43.520 --> 39:48.320
And write in and let me know how it's gone for you. I think it's uh, it's an opportunity to kind of

39:49.360 --> 39:50.880
Crowdsource

39:50.880 --> 39:55.680
People's results, you know, it is kind of it's been something of a blind spot for us, I guess

39:55.680 --> 39:59.360
Um, and there's really a lot of interesting stuff there. That's that's happening

39:59.360 --> 40:01.920
Especially around yast and the butter fs adoptions

40:02.240 --> 40:06.640
A lot of good ideas and I think we could do a little better job of highlighting that and that's something the audience could

40:06.640 --> 40:11.300
Really help us with linux unplugged dot com slash contact. Okay, so on december 7th

40:12.300 --> 40:18.580
2016 it feels like it was just yesterday pebble announced they were ceasing operations

40:18.580 --> 40:21.620
Two days later on december 9th 2016

40:22.420 --> 40:28.740
The rebel site went live and our very own rebel. Mr. Drew has brought his pebble back to life

40:29.300 --> 40:33.860
Such a rude. Tell me about this process and this experience. It's something i've always wanted to try

40:34.420 --> 40:36.660
Were you still actively using the pebble?

40:36.660 --> 40:42.820
Did you have to dig it out of the drawer and it just happened to still work the very first step was remembering which

40:43.380 --> 40:46.980
Bucket I had put it in and finding out that it was working

40:46.980 --> 40:48.980
Put it in and finding it

40:49.380 --> 40:51.940
The second step was finding the charging cable

40:52.180 --> 40:59.380
Which was not right there with it because I just am terrible at sorting old junk that i've tossed in a drawer

40:59.700 --> 41:03.540
And it's got a weird charger too. Yeah, it's got the little pogo pins and all that

41:03.620 --> 41:06.980
but once I found it it charged right up and

41:07.780 --> 41:13.060
The process to install is a little involved, but it's not terrible

41:13.060 --> 41:20.180
The instructions on the rebel website are pretty clear and they're separated out for if you're on ios or android

41:20.980 --> 41:27.460
And me being on android the number one thing that you have to do is you have to go and get the old pebble app

41:27.860 --> 41:31.860
Which is not on the play store anymore. You've got to download it from apk mirror

41:32.260 --> 41:35.460
And once you do that and kind of get everything connected

41:36.180 --> 41:40.260
Then it's really simple. You just have to go to two websites

41:40.260 --> 41:44.900
two websites and in the back end the pebble app will switch

41:45.300 --> 41:51.780
From the pebble web services over to the rebel web services and you're off and running. How does that switch happen?

41:52.260 --> 41:56.820
You literally just go to auth dot rebel dot i o in a browser

41:57.380 --> 41:59.380
and sign in

41:59.380 --> 42:03.940
And then after that you go to boot dot rebel dot i o it'll reopen the pebble app

42:04.500 --> 42:09.700
And you'll be greeted with the rebel login screen instead of the pebble login screen. That's it

42:09.700 --> 42:14.660
Wow, is it using some sort of software update function to do that? That's pretty simple. That's nice

42:15.060 --> 42:19.300
I don't know how it works in the back end because when I was reading the instructions

42:19.380 --> 42:24.180
It's like clearly there has to be something more to this than just clicking two links

42:25.460 --> 42:27.940
This doesn't make sense to me to my my little brain

42:28.660 --> 42:32.580
how does it um, you know make that switch within the app itself, but

42:33.460 --> 42:35.460
it does and

42:35.460 --> 42:41.220
Once you're in you can download old and new watch faces and old and new apps

42:41.540 --> 42:47.940
Pretty simple pretty slick and it works just the way that you remember back when it was the official pebble stuff. That's pretty great now

42:48.740 --> 42:53.780
Simpler than you were expecting it sounds like oh, yeah much much much simpler than I expected

42:53.780 --> 42:55.780
I thought I was gonna have to be like

42:56.180 --> 43:02.020
Doing some adb stuff or something along those lines. No, not at all. Are they hosting these services?

43:02.020 --> 43:06.580
Yeah, they are and the rebel web services are basically a drop-in replacement

43:06.740 --> 43:13.940
It's all hosted on their end and they do have a premium tier where you can pay 33 bucks a year or three bucks a month

43:14.500 --> 43:17.300
And that'll give you dictation and weather services

43:18.020 --> 43:24.100
But other than that the main reason to do it is just to support the rebel project so that they can keep their servers online

43:24.500 --> 43:27.460
So once you got this thing up and going were you able to do anything cool?

43:27.460 --> 43:32.900
I did try to get the old home assistant app up and running now that i'm a home assistant user

43:32.980 --> 43:37.780
but unfortunately the app was not authenticating properly for me, but

43:38.420 --> 43:43.880
I found another app called HTTP push that allows me to put in custom HTTP

43:44.660 --> 43:46.580
you know get or

43:46.580 --> 43:48.100
push requests

43:48.100 --> 43:55.540
And I set up some webhook automations in my home assistant. And so now on my watch I can launch services

43:55.540 --> 43:57.540
I can toggle lights

43:57.620 --> 44:02.020
I can even set it up so that it will broadcast to my google homes

44:02.660 --> 44:06.900
And let my wife know that i'm on my way home if i'm out picking something up neat

44:08.260 --> 44:11.540
Very modern and all the old health features and everything still work

44:12.180 --> 44:17.140
You know, it still even ties into google fit which I really like and I think my number one feature

44:17.220 --> 44:19.860
The thing that I missed most of all is the smart alarm

44:20.500 --> 44:24.900
Where it will track my sleep and figure out when i'm not in REM sleep

44:24.900 --> 44:31.300
And that's when it starts vibrating on my wrist to wake me up. That makes all the difference. Oh, I missed it so much

44:31.300 --> 44:37.300
It was so good. Yeah, you know, I just did this yesterday and I used that smart alarm feature last night

44:37.380 --> 44:41.380
And I woke up feeling better than I had in quite a while

44:41.620 --> 44:47.620
Is the integration pretty good with your phone OS like music controls or podcast controls work? Okay and stuff. Oh, yeah, totally

44:48.740 --> 44:51.220
Huh, I gave my pebble to my dad

44:51.220 --> 44:54.580
Uh, and he still uses it and I don't know if he did this or not

44:55.140 --> 44:59.700
He may have he's he's just technical enough and it sounds like the process wouldn't be too difficult

45:00.020 --> 45:04.100
Does it integrate in with calendar services and stuff like that as well? Absolutely

45:04.180 --> 45:06.500
And they show up on your timeline just like they used to

45:07.060 --> 45:14.260
And the rebel people recently set it up so that you can push other things to a separate timeline and it'll come down to your watch

45:14.900 --> 45:19.220
So you can do things like set up, um, you know if this and that integrations to

45:19.220 --> 45:22.260
Have like rss feeds and things pop up in your timeline

45:22.580 --> 45:29.700
Which you couldn't do before because that was tied in with the old pebble service, but now they've uh, stripped it out and uh,

45:30.340 --> 45:36.660
Polished it up and made it fresh again. So you're gonna keep using it. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, really? Yeah, totally

45:36.740 --> 45:40.660
Oh cool. How's the battery? Is it still hanging in there? Yeah, it's doing great

45:40.660 --> 45:46.900
It's as good as I remember it being you know, like eight days of battery life on the model that I have and it's

45:46.900 --> 45:50.260
you know, it's only been a day, but it's uh sitting at

45:51.060 --> 45:56.260
Like 90 to 100 percent. So oh man. I wish something would have come from this

45:56.820 --> 46:01.540
Line of technology because it just makes so much sense to use an e-ink display

46:02.420 --> 46:05.620
On a watch and when you say eight days of battery life

46:06.420 --> 46:10.820
My mouth drops open because i've you know, i've had several newer watches

46:10.820 --> 46:17.620
Digital watches and they get a day maybe two days if i'm lucky. I'm curious drew if you're now going to uh,

46:18.500 --> 46:23.700
Look around at the the old round and the steel and the other series because you should be able to get those for

46:24.420 --> 46:27.300
A ridiculous amount of money nowadays. I mean, they should be pretty cheap

46:28.180 --> 46:32.820
I loaded rebel a long time ago probably in 2016 or something like that on my old pebble, but

46:33.380 --> 46:37.780
I've since put it away and it was okay then but it sounds like it's worth a revision

46:37.780 --> 46:42.660
Yeah, I remember they were really cheap right when the service had just you know

46:42.660 --> 46:44.660
Been announced that it was going away

46:44.900 --> 46:50.260
And they were getting rid of like the old stock and the used market is not as cheap as you would think

46:51.060 --> 46:57.300
I was looking at some time rounds to replace my wife's her old one. She loved it, but her battery exploded

46:57.940 --> 46:58.900
and uh

46:58.900 --> 47:01.380
Haven't been able to you know, get that going again

47:01.380 --> 47:04.100
So now I either have to get a new battery and do some soldering

47:04.100 --> 47:09.220
Try and find one, but they're like 120 bucks on ebay. Oh, wow. Mm-hmm

47:09.220 --> 47:11.620
Well, they're not making any more of them. So I could see why

47:12.180 --> 47:16.260
You hold on to it as long as you can drew. It'll be it's I mean it already kind of is a collector's item

47:16.260 --> 47:22.900
Isn't it? Yeah, totally. Well, thanks for uh, taking one for the team and uh, totally making me miss my my old pebble watch

47:22.900 --> 47:27.860
That sounds pretty cool and sounds like a hearty recommendation if anybody has one rolling around in a drawer out there

47:28.100 --> 47:31.860
Yeah, absolutely. And if anybody has one in their drawer, you know, it's a good idea to have one

47:31.860 --> 47:37.300
In a drawer out there. Yeah, absolutely. And if anybody has an old uh time round that they want to sell to me for cheap

47:37.540 --> 47:39.540
I will take it

47:39.620 --> 47:42.980
There you go at drew of doom on the twitters. That's right

47:44.180 --> 47:46.180
slide into those dms

47:48.980 --> 47:52.580
All right, let's uh, let's do a pick really quick, uh west pane you found

47:53.060 --> 47:59.860
A markdown editor for the 21st century and you know me whenever there's a markdown editor. I want to talk about it

47:59.860 --> 48:05.460
This is a local native application, right? I think well it is electron. Okay, okay

48:06.180 --> 48:11.540
But you've got fedora and debian packages and app images. So, you know almost native

48:11.780 --> 48:16.340
They're making a good concerted effort to at least publish it to the linux desktop. I'll say this

48:16.900 --> 48:20.420
It looks really great. It looks like a solid app and

48:20.980 --> 48:25.700
One of the things it has that seems kind of appealing like a differentiator to the other markdown editors

48:25.700 --> 48:31.460
Is it has a pretty sophisticated research mode? They have a video that explains it and it's just a couple of seconds

48:31.540 --> 48:36.180
I grabbed a clip that talks just about the research mode if you're a professional author or researcher

48:36.500 --> 48:39.460
Settler has all the tools you need to write efficiently

48:40.260 --> 48:45.220
Simply group everything together using the project feature and arrange all your chapters neatly

48:46.580 --> 48:51.460
A mighty citation engine sits at the heart of the app letting you cite your sources with ease

48:51.460 --> 48:55.540
Pull in your literature and choose from over 9000 citation styles

48:56.340 --> 49:01.860
You can even use templates to directly export your paper using the format desired by the journal

49:02.500 --> 49:08.580
The other thing that's kind of neat is it supports exporting to latex as well as other formats and it supports importing

49:09.060 --> 49:14.580
A bunch of formats it has a code highlighting for different languages besides markdown as well

49:14.820 --> 49:19.460
And of course best of all it's free and open source. No. No best of all

49:19.460 --> 49:22.260
No, no best of all it's got dark mode support

49:23.700 --> 49:26.900
But seriously, you know, there's a ton of really great markdown apps out there

49:26.900 --> 49:31.380
But a lot of them kind of just stick to doing markdown and that's good

49:31.460 --> 49:35.460
You know, but there's a whole world beyond markdown and a lot of times, you know

49:35.460 --> 49:38.340
You might use markdown just for some casual notes or a simple document

49:38.980 --> 49:44.900
Settler really lets you take it to the next level and make serious publications do research integrate with citations integrate with latex

49:44.900 --> 49:46.500
It has pandoc integration as well

49:46.500 --> 49:50.100
So if you know you need to pull in sources from word documents or render out to them

49:50.580 --> 49:53.140
It's all built right in it really seems like too

49:53.140 --> 49:59.140
they've taken a focus on helping people collect research either journalists or everybody like anybody that's trying to just

49:59.460 --> 50:02.100
Pull together a bunch of stuff and then cite sources

50:02.740 --> 50:05.060
With a reference manager on sitting on top of it

50:05.140 --> 50:13.300
It seems like that component along with the ui and the import export options do kind of make it stand apart and I

50:13.300 --> 50:17.060
I have now taken it just I write everything in markdown

50:17.140 --> 50:22.900
I just text editor if i'm even just taking notes for something I write it in markdown if i'm making a to-do list

50:22.980 --> 50:26.340
I do it in markdown. So this kind of stuff I find to be pretty appealing

50:26.820 --> 50:29.700
I for the most part just stick with plain text editors

50:30.020 --> 50:35.860
But I absolutely could see busting out settler for a research project or trying to pull something together

50:35.940 --> 50:38.420
Say we're going to do a history of an open source project special

50:38.420 --> 50:44.440
I absolutely could see using it for that kind of stuff and then it keeps it all organized for you in a really easy to

50:44.520 --> 50:48.840
Browse way and you can combine everything into a project. So it's all kind of in one spot

50:49.080 --> 50:52.920
Even if there's multiple files and of course on the back end, it's all just plain text

50:53.000 --> 50:58.120
So, you know if you want to stop using it one day no bigs. I like that too pretty good fine there wess

50:58.520 --> 51:02.600
Pretty pretty good fine. Where can people find links to that and everything else we talked about today

51:02.600 --> 51:10.120
Well in our show notes, of course linux unplugged dot com slash three six one and that does bring us to the end of this week's

51:10.200 --> 51:16.760
Linux unplugged the show is at linux unplugged on twitter where you can get news announcements about the show live stream announcements releases

51:17.000 --> 51:22.280
At linux unplugged the whole network that's at jupiter signal, but if you don't use the twitters, I don't blame you

51:22.440 --> 51:26.680
We'd still like to hear from you though. Go to linux unplugged dot com slash contact

51:26.760 --> 51:31.800
I'd like to start featuring more of your feedback in every episode right around this point in the show

51:31.800 --> 51:36.840
I'd like to be reading your emails and the only way that's going to happen is if you send them in linux unplugged

51:37.320 --> 51:41.800
Dot com slash contact i'm at chris las he's at wess pain

51:42.200 --> 51:45.560
Thank you so much for joining us on this week's episode of the unplugged program

51:45.560 --> 52:01.980
We appreciate you and we'll see you right back here next tuesday

52:15.560 --> 52:17.560
So

52:25.000 --> 52:31.720
Thank you everybody for joining us, uh, it's time for me to head out hit the road i'm gonna i'll be on the road early tomorrow

52:32.520 --> 52:36.840
So that way I can get a solid. I don't know hundred miles in before work

52:37.640 --> 52:40.920
Starts and then i'll work and then as soon as work wraps up

52:41.000 --> 52:43.880
I'm jumping on the road and i'll probably be driving until nearly midnight

52:43.880 --> 52:47.240
But that's not so bad because it's so dang hot down here

52:47.720 --> 52:53.720
That that that kind of works you drive then you park somewhere with a air conditioning you work for a little bit and then

52:54.040 --> 52:59.240
The evening around 8 p.m. It's it becomes nice out again, and then you just drive and drive and drive

52:59.240 --> 53:14.360
So so you've switched to being a night driver. Well, just while i'm in texas. It's because it's a lot neil
