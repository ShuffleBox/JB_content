WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
Oh, I'm glad I'm glad you're comfortable poppy. I'm glad you're comfortable shall we relay his best wishes so Barton

00:07.760 --> 00:09.760
Popey says hello

00:13.440 --> 00:15.760
True supporter and I and I appreciate that

00:17.600 --> 00:20.320
Just not enough to get off his butt and join us

00:20.320 --> 00:28.240
This is Linux Unplugged episode 179 for January 10th, 2017

00:39.440 --> 00:46.800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's looking at some new rigs and thinking I could spend some Bitcoin on that

00:46.800 --> 00:49.840
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes

00:49.840 --> 00:54.320
Are y'all warmed up for today's episode? I think so. It's just a wonderful day filled with podcasting

00:54.320 --> 00:58.240
It's it's on it's very unusual that I'm sitting at the mic with

00:58.960 --> 01:03.680
Co-host who's already recorded one more show than I have for the day. So you're ahead of me right now

01:03.680 --> 01:06.120
You're gonna beat me today. You're gonna let me even well, that's right

01:06.120 --> 01:11.480
Yeah, cuz that you never saw coming doing a double but that's not we're here to talk about today coming up on this week's episode of

01:11.600 --> 01:16.800
The unplugged program you may be familiar with a name out there Barton George

01:16.800 --> 01:22.560
Perhaps that rings a bell he comes from Dell and he's specifically in the Sputnik project and they have some new hard world

01:22.560 --> 01:27.160
We'll be chatting with him very soon about some of the new things coming up and yeah

01:27.320 --> 01:30.200
Yeah, we're gonna get our drool on and then later on in the show

01:30.800 --> 01:36.280
Raspberry Pi wants to be your new Linux distro. Yeah, I mean the Raspberry Pi folks. They have a distro

01:36.280 --> 01:40.120
They want you to run me on your PC not your high your desktop

01:40.120 --> 01:45.120
Well, we'll tell you about that plus the new Linux ransomware that not only is insanely expensive

01:45.120 --> 01:47.840
But then apparently it's just deleting your data anyways

01:49.080 --> 01:51.080
Everybody's freaking out about kill disk

01:51.160 --> 01:56.500
So we'll see the grill disk is a big issue and then because the universe likes to reward me

01:57.000 --> 02:03.460
Not one but two predictions of 2017 are already gonna get checked off that I made on Sunday's Linux action show later on the show

02:03.460 --> 02:07.600
We're gonna talk more about Mac exodus. Yes. I know that terms obnoxious and

02:08.280 --> 02:14.040
Some market details that bode very very very well for Linux

02:14.040 --> 02:21.020
Before we go any further though. We can't really start the show without bringing in our mumble room time appropriate greetings mumble room

02:26.680 --> 02:28.680
Doesn't it just fill your heart

02:28.680 --> 02:34.680
I feel like we can still officially say happy new year to the mobile room. Happy new year. Happy new year again

02:34.680 --> 02:36.680
Well, let's start off right

02:36.920 --> 02:41.760
Thank you. Let's start right off the top by welcoming Barton to the show Barton. Welcome to Linux unplug

02:41.760 --> 02:44.880
Thanks so much for having me now Barton

02:44.880 --> 02:50.120
You work down there at this company that some folks may have heard of before called Dell and there is love

02:50.120 --> 02:58.580
There's the skunkworks operation down there where these crazy kids are doing Linux machines and it's it's really developed into quite a

02:58.880 --> 03:01.480
Well what now appears to be an ecosystem of hardware?

03:01.480 --> 03:07.380
So Barton I am I am really really excited because this is the big story of the week in my estimation

03:07.380 --> 03:14.660
Today Dell is announcing some machines that are coming soon or recently has announced machines that are coming soon and a new workstation

03:14.660 --> 03:17.420
I think it's like a mobile workstation like a big old laptop or something

03:17.420 --> 03:22.140
Tell me all about the new hardware and what you're excited about Barton. Well, thank you very much

03:22.700 --> 03:28.100
So anyway, this is Barton George from Dell as you said, it's really great to be here. I know back on

03:28.740 --> 03:32.460
Episode 136 you talked about some of the previous generations

03:32.460 --> 03:39.360
so it's great to actually be here to talk about on myself and so the news you're talking about now is the

03:40.680 --> 03:48.200
Announcement of the precision lineup and those are our mobile workstations and it's actually the second generation of those that have been

03:49.120 --> 03:50.640
enabled with

03:50.640 --> 03:52.640
Ubuntu and the other the

03:52.640 --> 03:56.840
The thing that we're adding to the pie this time is the all-in-one

03:56.840 --> 04:02.960
So that's something that we had not had before the 5720 for those of you who are keeping count

04:04.360 --> 04:06.720
And so that will be that's new

04:07.000 --> 04:13.020
and then just to if I just take us a trip down memory lane to begin with as you

04:13.200 --> 04:19.000
You alluded to this is a skunkworks project that started about four and a half years ago

04:19.760 --> 04:21.760
and what this was

04:21.760 --> 04:26.880
There was an incubation fund in the company trying to get

04:27.640 --> 04:30.120
Wacky ideas out of people's heads. So

04:31.120 --> 04:37.680
What I did was I said, hey someone had this idea of let's do a Linux laptop. I thought originally great idea

04:37.680 --> 04:41.240
It'll never fly in Dell given the the low volumes relative

04:41.360 --> 04:47.800
What sort of precipice there is there Linux users within Dell that just was sort of side loading Linux on to Dell hardware and thought boy

04:47.800 --> 04:53.960
We could make this great. So there was some enthusiasm the company what what kicked that off? No, it was really if any

04:53.960 --> 04:55.960
You know Steven O'Grady from Red Monk

04:56.360 --> 05:01.480
he was the one we were chatting with him about hey, how can Dell do a better job of

05:02.680 --> 05:06.720
Reaching out to the developer audience because that's one of the we had done well in

05:07.240 --> 05:13.780
From a server point of view outfitting the all the big companies that you're familiar with with servers

05:13.780 --> 05:21.120
but as servers become commoditized how else might we look to to add value and and the idea there was let's let's appeal to

05:21.300 --> 05:26.500
Developers and so that's where the idea came about. Well, why don't we try and do?

05:28.020 --> 05:30.020
Linux based laptop

05:30.060 --> 05:34.740
And and so is when Steven mentioned it. I thought you know great idea. It'll never happen

05:35.460 --> 05:37.460
twofold one is because

05:37.460 --> 05:42.660
That the volume they're gonna ask it for is gonna say hey

05:42.660 --> 05:47.100
That's what we do and you know in Belgium on Tuesday between three and four in the afternoon, right?

05:47.540 --> 05:51.940
And that's not really how how we're geared as a company to do

05:52.300 --> 05:55.300
The other thing is we didn't have very good-looking hardware at that point

05:55.300 --> 05:59.820
So I didn't know if that would be something that the developers would would cotton to so

06:00.300 --> 06:04.500
As I've mentioned there was this incubation program. I came and

06:04.500 --> 06:09.980
Presented to them said here's this idea of let's doing a do a Linux laptop. And in the meantime

06:10.500 --> 06:16.100
Also, we started with the new real good-looking XPS 13s. So the two of them together

06:16.900 --> 06:22.580
I got the the green green light and was given a tiny pot of money and six months

06:22.820 --> 06:27.460
To see with this thing fly would anyone be interested in in getting one of these?

06:27.700 --> 06:31.460
So the the idea from the beginning too was let's do this all out in the open

06:31.460 --> 06:38.140
And so made the initial announcement of our our plan on my blog saying hey, you know what?

06:38.140 --> 06:40.140
We don't even know if this will ever become

06:40.780 --> 06:42.380
a real product

06:42.380 --> 06:46.540
But if you tell us what you want and maybe if we get enough positive feedback

06:46.860 --> 06:53.700
It really will become a real boy. And that's that's how we we went about it. And then we got so much positive feedback

06:53.700 --> 06:59.660
We ended up turning this into a real product and we launched first with the XPS 13

07:00.540 --> 07:02.540
developer edition

07:03.940 --> 07:06.980
It was now four years ago back in November

07:07.500 --> 07:13.500
So the timing on that the timing on that seems to be extremely fortuitous because it's position Dell

07:13.820 --> 07:16.940
In a way where you've been able to iterate on this thing for four years

07:17.500 --> 07:19.980
Expand out the range of what you're doing and what you're doing

07:19.980 --> 07:26.140
We've been able to iterate on this thing for four years expand out the range of hardware and it's sort of all coming to it

07:26.140 --> 07:28.660
At least to me it feels like it's all kind of coming together

07:29.100 --> 07:36.740
When there are certain other market condition factors that are making people look for this type of hardware more than ever and if Dell

07:36.740 --> 07:42.340
Was starting this endeavor today you would be too far behind the ball to be ready for the customers

07:42.340 --> 07:49.740
They're looking for a replacement and it if this wasn't necessarily going to this there was no real clear indicators of these market conditions

07:49.740 --> 07:50.340
ie

07:50.340 --> 07:55.220
The total lackluster updates to Macbooks there was no real clear indication that this was gonna happen

07:55.420 --> 08:01.140
Like these things seem like they were really nailing what developers wanted for a long time. Maybe I'll be a little expensive

08:02.380 --> 08:07.220
So Dell really really got I mean in some ways it seems very lucky that they play it's right time

08:07.220 --> 08:09.940
Yeah, and now now I wonder Barton

08:09.940 --> 08:16.040
Are you experiencing a different set of customers than you originally anticipated is it pretty much exactly what you guys?

08:16.040 --> 08:21.400
It thought it's sustainable. How can you give me a sense of what that looks like?

08:22.440 --> 08:28.640
Well, I think what the the main thing here is is that we're pretty much a grassroots organization

08:28.640 --> 08:30.640
So we don't have a huge marketing

08:31.320 --> 08:32.520
budget

08:32.520 --> 08:37.760
Basically, it's my blog and then doing things like this, which is one of the reasons why I'm so excited to be doing this

08:37.920 --> 08:39.920
but lots of folks

08:40.080 --> 08:42.560
Learn about this after we've been around for a few years

08:42.560 --> 08:47.560
and so it's I would just say it's more of the types of customers that

08:49.200 --> 08:55.200
We've been seeing from the beginning and I think one of the neat things here is we've actually built up some credibility

08:56.160 --> 08:59.760
In the beginning, of course, you can imagine people thinking. Yeah, you guys are just

09:00.520 --> 09:04.280
Dilettante you're gonna dabble in this and then you're gonna kill it after a generation or two

09:04.920 --> 09:10.560
and then we've stuck with it and you know, they told two friends and they told two friends and so now we've

09:10.560 --> 09:13.960
We've got a much bigger group that were that were

09:14.600 --> 09:19.280
Targeting or who are aware of it. I should say. Yeah, I would say too that the hardware has

09:19.920 --> 09:23.560
Has has proven itself West. How old is your Sputnik right there that you have?

09:24.160 --> 09:29.660
Well, this has got to be one of the first or second. Yeah, and I have the first XPS 13 that had the

09:30.480 --> 09:32.480
touchscreen for display

09:32.600 --> 09:36.880
So these I mean the hardware itself has proven to be very sturdy and reliable

09:36.880 --> 09:42.240
So that's had it's had a time to develop a track record. I I guess what are one of the things I kind of curious

09:42.240 --> 09:44.240
I always like to try to

09:44.280 --> 09:49.800
Try to ask the OEMs these these kinds of questions because I feel like a lot of our audience the first thing they want to

09:49.800 --> 09:56.460
Do when they buy a machine is they want to format it install whatever and so I'm sure you must get constant requests for

09:57.080 --> 10:00.520
XYZ distro from everything from things we've heard of two ones

10:00.520 --> 10:06.520
We've never heard of how how important is it when developing a product like this to focus on a single distro?

10:06.520 --> 10:08.520
Or could Dell foresee?

10:09.200 --> 10:14.500
Multiple distros or maybe you personally foresee testing multiple distros because I to me my sense is

10:15.280 --> 10:19.740
The scope of work is much smaller. If you just choose to optimize for Ubuntu

10:20.520 --> 10:26.200
But I'm could you kind of give us a better understanding from somebody who's actually working in this field how critical that is or isn't

10:27.280 --> 10:33.600
Sure, and I think that's the the beauty of open source in the community because as you're saying given our resources

10:33.600 --> 10:38.200
We're gonna we're gonna focus on Ubuntu and and qualify on that

10:38.680 --> 10:44.960
but there was an article that just came out about the review of the XPS 13 and ours technica and

10:45.620 --> 10:48.320
He ran also fedora on and he also ran

10:48.880 --> 10:52.640
Arch on it. So while we ourselves are only installing

10:53.560 --> 10:59.640
Ubuntu as you say lots of folks first thing they're gonna do is is wipe it and put their distro of choice

10:59.640 --> 11:05.200
So when we try and we work with we write drivers

11:05.200 --> 11:10.240
The whole idea is then to push these upstream into the kernel so that people who who are not

11:11.600 --> 11:16.880
Working with a boon to or that's not what their first choice is that they can they can benefit from that as well

11:17.200 --> 11:21.760
So you've got this new Dell precision five or 5720 all-in-one

11:21.760 --> 11:24.920
and one of the things I noticed about it is it's gonna come with a

11:25.680 --> 11:27.680
4k optional display and

11:27.680 --> 11:33.600
My XPS 13 has a 4k display. It also has things like Thunderbolt 3

11:34.680 --> 11:38.440
Are you are you guys running up against any rough edges is okay

11:38.440 --> 11:41.920
Can you could you kind of tell me a little bit the the process of going from?

11:42.320 --> 11:49.300
Developing for focusing on laptops or I guess I shouldn't say developing but really getting getting the whole product ready with laptops is the main

11:49.300 --> 11:53.800
focus and then transitioning over to desktop where their new challenges or is it pretty much business as usual and

11:53.800 --> 11:59.980
Can you give us a little bit of like what it is like to work with with maybe canonical if there are challenges you run

11:59.980 --> 12:01.360
into

12:01.360 --> 12:04.720
Sure, so a bunch of questions there. I'll try and tackle them

12:04.720 --> 12:13.040
I think in reality the the desktop one really isn't that much different than what we've been working on with the mobile workstations, right?

12:13.040 --> 12:19.200
so the the precision line is the mobile workstation and then the okay the all the all-in-one is that is the desktop version of

12:19.200 --> 12:22.480
It obviously but it really isn't that much different

12:22.480 --> 12:28.680
And I then when you start talking about working with canonical the the other leg of the stool

12:28.680 --> 12:34.320
It's it's Dell canonical and then it's whatever third party device driver. I'm sorry

12:35.680 --> 12:43.160
Who's making things like touchpads, etc. And so the three have to work together then to actually get these things written

12:43.760 --> 12:47.280
So it's it's rather than a what shall I say a duo?

12:47.280 --> 12:54.260
It's a trio in in trying to get this stuff done. And that's that's where where it really separates

12:54.800 --> 13:00.480
The the Ubuntu versions from the other ones obviously is you got to write the device drivers and actually make sure it works. So

13:01.400 --> 13:04.640
that feels like that's always been sort of the

13:06.200 --> 13:09.320
challenge to developing a Linux based product that

13:09.560 --> 13:15.000
For the desktop or for the laptop is you're constantly you want to push the edge to meet market demands and you want to get

13:15.000 --> 13:18.720
Like better trackpads in there or better Wi-Fi chips in there, etc, etc

13:18.720 --> 13:23.840
And so there's always seems like there's always just writes out right outside our grasp

13:24.640 --> 13:32.280
This totally open system that doesn't have to have a distro with this specific driver or this proprietary blob to work

13:32.280 --> 13:37.140
It feels like we're always just outside of that because the market itself is always pushing so far forward

13:37.520 --> 13:40.580
when when Dell works on these kinds of things how

13:40.580 --> 13:46.180
How much of a priority is it to build a system one day where it doesn't matter if?

13:46.740 --> 13:52.860
Which distro I load or which if I or I never will need to load a proprietary driver or a proprietary blob

13:52.860 --> 13:58.940
How close do you think Dell could get a system to that ideal state that a lot of Linux users fantasize about?

14:00.660 --> 14:06.220
And I think that's something we would we would push for but we don't have I would love to say we've got an army

14:06.220 --> 14:11.500
Of folks working on that and we do have a fair amount of people working on Linux distros

14:11.500 --> 14:14.460
So we will keep trying to get closer and closer to that

14:15.860 --> 14:19.100
But it still would be a while. Do you feel Barton though?

14:19.100 --> 14:21.060
Like the customers you're targeting right now

14:21.060 --> 14:25.700
Is that a high concern for them or is if you what's your sense of that with the current customer base?

14:26.340 --> 14:31.400
you know, I think is that there was and this is if I take a step back to my

14:31.400 --> 14:38.720
Initial blog that that launched that announced this there was such a pent-up desire for anything like this

14:39.320 --> 14:40.880
that

14:40.880 --> 14:44.640
There was people were just doing what we're doing now

14:44.640 --> 14:50.520
It's got people sort of over the moon not that it can't be done a lot better, but I think the existing

14:51.120 --> 14:56.080
What was out there at that point was was lacking and I think that's where

14:56.080 --> 15:01.040
People have just been so excited with having something that that just works

15:01.040 --> 15:06.000
I think that was if you if you look at Mac they didn't set out to target developers

15:06.000 --> 15:09.120
the reason why they developers picked it up is because

15:09.640 --> 15:12.960
a it just work and be you had a Unix slash

15:13.480 --> 15:14.520
Linux

15:14.520 --> 15:15.560
underpinners

15:15.560 --> 15:22.320
Those two together that's a for a lot of people even the the free software crowd. We're willing to

15:23.200 --> 15:25.080
Put aside their

15:25.080 --> 15:28.280
What shall I say some of their values and and go for mm-hmm?

15:28.280 --> 15:30.560
I would say traditionally Apple to has been sort of

15:30.880 --> 15:35.800
Developer hostile with the exception of unless you're developing for iOS or the Mac and you need access to Xcode

15:35.800 --> 15:43.880
yeah, the whereas these Dell's is positioning these as tools for developers and to kind of play off what you just said Barton I

15:44.480 --> 15:46.480
I'm wondering and I know

15:46.760 --> 15:48.520
Wimpy is wondering

15:48.520 --> 15:50.520
Wimpy do you want to ask the question?

15:50.520 --> 15:55.800
Because it's a it's a really plays off of Barton was just saying so my question is is if the poor

15:56.000 --> 15:59.880
Reception of the recent MacBooks was considered when adding the high-end

16:00.760 --> 16:05.600
Configuration options to the new lineup of right? I mean I'm seeing 32 gigs of RAM here

16:05.600 --> 16:10.040
I'm seeing even Xeon processors available as an option. I mean that seems like a beast. I

16:11.160 --> 16:17.320
Think in general when we talk about our client group is they're basically looking at what is what are the customers gonna want?

16:17.320 --> 16:19.320
And what are they gonna want next?

16:19.320 --> 16:26.040
and I've been at Dell for seven years now and it's just amazing how much better-looking and

16:26.320 --> 16:30.560
All the awards were winning for our systems now that you know

16:30.560 --> 16:36.200
We first started out when I looked at this. I said had the original idea put to me. We had a very

16:36.800 --> 16:38.360
utilitarian

16:38.360 --> 16:44.440
Laptop that did the job at a decent price, but it wasn't gonna win any beauty contest

16:44.440 --> 16:50.880
And so now you've got things that we ourselves we're not looking to follow what what Apple's doing, but we're trying to figure out

16:50.880 --> 16:52.360
how might we

16:52.360 --> 16:57.080
We get ahead and and read what what is going to be next and needed in the market. I

16:57.840 --> 17:03.000
think I think definitely for developers that are looking for a platform that

17:03.800 --> 17:10.400
Matches what they run in production or doesn't necessarily get drug around by market strategy and and things like that

17:10.400 --> 17:12.400
I think it's it's a very compelling option. I

17:12.400 --> 17:18.280
I guess I I guess I would sort of I have just one last question and then I'll open up the mumble room if they

17:18.280 --> 17:22.320
Have questions for you Barton, but I like to do this. It's it's the beginning of the new year

17:23.120 --> 17:26.160
and I would be really curious to know if if

17:26.480 --> 17:33.000
Barton could write one blog post and all of a sudden everything would change in open source that he was concerned about what would that one?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
But if you could change one thing to improve

17:35.440 --> 17:40.320
Maybe Linux on on the type of hardware that Dell ships or something in the open source community

17:40.320 --> 17:42.880
Do you think that would help make it this more approachable?

17:42.880 --> 17:48.600
I would love to know your thoughts on if by the end of 2017 something could change that would make Barton's life better

17:49.520 --> 17:52.120
What would it be? What would that wave of the wand be? I?

17:53.320 --> 17:59.320
Think what it would be and this is I started mentioning it before but it's it's the people beyond ourselves

17:59.480 --> 18:07.160
And the canonical who are working to to support things like the touchpad drivers people who do that at different

18:07.160 --> 18:12.960
Places that need to have drivers written if we can get more people to more seriously consider

18:12.960 --> 18:19.120
Linux as as one of their their top targets and obviously with the volumes that Windows

18:20.120 --> 18:24.400
Delivers, it's not going to be something that they're gonna put on exactly equal footing

18:24.400 --> 18:28.320
But the more that we can get people to prioritize that and make it

18:29.360 --> 18:33.240
Make a good show out of it. The the easier it is for for all of us

18:33.240 --> 18:36.560
Barton, what do you suppose? What is your sense of?

18:37.800 --> 18:41.480
How long this effort may continue? Do you have a sense that this has got good momentum?

18:42.480 --> 18:44.480
You're talking about the Sputnik. Yes, sir. I

18:45.600 --> 18:51.320
Think what I'm trying to do is is keep expanding it and not just on

18:52.200 --> 18:53.360
the

18:53.360 --> 18:55.520
client side as we call the the lap the

18:56.320 --> 18:59.840
laptops and the desktops but tying it to other

18:59.840 --> 19:05.840
things that Dell provides and when I say Dell now, I should switch Dell is what we call the the client

19:06.680 --> 19:10.120
Side of the business Dell EMC is the broader company

19:10.120 --> 19:14.960
Okay, and so and so that the more that we can tie it to things like

19:15.480 --> 19:19.000
Cloud Foundry if you're aware, so one of the things I'm getting a system out

19:19.800 --> 19:24.680
Tomorrow if I get if I can do it to someone who's going to see if they can get PCF dev

19:24.680 --> 19:26.680
Which is the pivotal Cloud Foundry

19:26.680 --> 19:33.840
Working natively on a Sputnik. So the more that we can get things tied to it then the the more that this

19:34.360 --> 19:35.600
program

19:35.600 --> 19:38.280
Continues to go on integrates with the rest of the strategy

19:38.840 --> 19:47.040
Exactly. And so and I think in general I've just been extremely excited how we started with one config and now we've got

19:47.840 --> 19:53.120
One config one system. We've now got multiple configs of the XPS 13. We've now got five

19:53.120 --> 19:56.920
Systems in the precision side and because precision is configured to order

19:57.800 --> 20:01.440
Unlimited permutations of of what's offered there. That's great

20:01.440 --> 20:08.200
So so I'm very excited and I think the other thing too is we keep getting more visibility within the company

20:08.840 --> 20:13.000
The fact that Linus Torvalds picked the XPS 13 as his laptop

20:13.480 --> 20:19.400
Was actually something that went over pretty big within within that a lot of people were excited about

20:19.400 --> 20:25.840
That even though we do a ton of stuff on Windows people understand the the value of somebody like Linus

20:26.880 --> 20:28.080
and so

20:28.080 --> 20:30.080
We're getting more

20:30.080 --> 20:34.840
As I said within the company we're getting more visibility as well and that that helps quite a bit

20:34.840 --> 20:38.920
That's great. And you know, I think if if the Sputnik project can stick around

20:41.560 --> 20:45.280
You really are positioned to take advantage of some really great market conditions

20:45.280 --> 20:52.080
They're gonna that they're not only just what was going on with Apple but also just as computing in general moves more towards

20:52.080 --> 20:56.160
Cloud and the web blah blah blah and the general computing device you're using to access

20:56.160 --> 20:58.160
It doesn't need to run a specific operating system

20:58.680 --> 21:00.200
companies that sell

21:00.200 --> 21:06.960
Specific expensive operating systems are going to be doing less less business and a company like Dell that could be positioned to already know

21:07.040 --> 21:10.440
How to interact with the upstream community the individual vendors?

21:10.440 --> 21:14.760
That's a that's a huge advantage potentially Wimpy's reading my mind though

21:14.760 --> 21:17.960
And I wanted to give him a chance to jump in about the XPS. Go ahead movie

21:18.520 --> 21:24.440
So Barton, do you know if there are any plans to introduce an XPS 15 developer edition at some point?

21:25.600 --> 21:28.120
Yes, I just got that on Twitter before I got on the

21:28.800 --> 21:35.200
On the call we get that every so often. So mr. Shuttleworth himself does the uses the XPS. He does

21:35.200 --> 21:39.640
15 that being said at this point. We don't have any plans

21:39.640 --> 21:44.400
But if you get enough positive customer input we do

21:44.400 --> 21:48.920
so for example, the whole way we got into the precision line was because

21:49.720 --> 21:57.000
Customers were saying we need a bigger beefier system. Hmm. We launched on the XPS 13 and we just all of a sudden

21:58.160 --> 22:01.800
People kept saying hey, we need some more XPS. We need a better XPS system

22:01.800 --> 22:05.680
All of a sudden people kept saying hey, we need something bigger

22:05.680 --> 22:10.400
We need something more powerful and then just a quick trip through memory let memory Lane

22:10.680 --> 22:16.920
That's where Jared Dominguez who's on the call and part of the Sputnik team went and just got it running

22:17.400 --> 22:25.000
Ubuntu running on the the M 3800 which is the precision system at the time and he put those that information out for folks

22:25.000 --> 22:29.120
And then that got so much positive feedback that the year after that

22:29.120 --> 22:33.080
We made it a real boy and we had that was once again started with the M

22:33.280 --> 22:37.400
3800 that year then we went to the four and now we're doing the four plus

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
plus the five so

22:41.400 --> 22:43.400
All that being said to the XPS

22:44.120 --> 22:46.700
15 is very similar to the

22:47.320 --> 22:50.300
fifth not 57 to in the 55 20

22:51.280 --> 22:56.760
So that's for for the right now. That's where we would we would steer people

22:56.760 --> 23:02.440
but as they say just like many times we get enough positive customer feedback and we actually

23:04.200 --> 23:08.300
Just like the program itself it becomes a we can productize it

23:08.300 --> 23:11.780
It's hardening to hear that there's that kind of internal flexibility in the you know

23:11.780 --> 23:14.080
There's you've built that trust up over the years to do that

23:14.200 --> 23:20.520
so we will have a link to Barton's blog if you're curious Barton George dot IO is where you go if you want to visit directly and

23:20.620 --> 23:24.860
We have the post linked where he talks about all the new hardware because for me

23:24.860 --> 23:30.240
I just got really excited about the new all-in-one and the new laptops, but the names matter

23:30.240 --> 23:35.160
So if you want to make sure you get the names, right like a precision versus things that are not laptops

23:35.520 --> 23:38.440
Check all of that out in Barton's blog where he's outlined at Barton

23:38.440 --> 23:40.720
Is there anything else you want to add before I would let you run?

23:42.760 --> 23:45.540
We're gonna update it soon but Dell comm

23:46.040 --> 23:52.520
Sputnik or Dell comm slash developers will have the the list of all the systems. That's work in progress

23:52.520 --> 23:55.760
so if you go today, you'll you'll see the new the

23:58.000 --> 24:00.560
3520 which is available now, but that that'll have more information

24:00.560 --> 24:06.100
we'll have links as as we go forward, but you know other than that, I'd just like to say thank you so much and

24:06.920 --> 24:10.760
The great thing about this and it can only happen with something like this

24:10.760 --> 24:18.000
Is that the whole fact is that this is open source and this is community driven and that's been since day one

24:18.000 --> 24:23.080
What has made this which a lot of people at at Dell looked at skeptically?

24:23.840 --> 24:27.240
Viable that people actually said no this we really do want this

24:27.760 --> 24:33.880
And we want to pay for a nice system as opposed to what Dell had before which is let's put a free

24:34.000 --> 24:39.480
Operating system like canonical on a low-end system and we get a low-end price point

24:39.640 --> 24:46.760
This is the idea here was let's put it on a really good system. So people have a quality system

24:46.760 --> 24:52.000
So anyway, I love that once again. Thanks so much. Thank you Barton. Thank you for making it work

24:52.000 --> 24:54.280
We appreciate it that keep up the great work

24:54.280 --> 25:00.640
we keep advocating Linux there at Dell and feel free to drop us a line whenever something interesting is going on because

25:01.440 --> 25:06.400
2017 I it's funny Barton yesterday on the Linux action show I had I

25:06.680 --> 25:07.880
This is crazy day

25:07.880 --> 25:12.440
I had no idea you and I'd be having this conversation today or I guess it was two days ago on the Linux action show

25:12.440 --> 25:18.080
I predicted the 2017 would be the year that Dell really steps up with Linux and I start taking them seriously and I think two

25:18.080 --> 25:23.680
Days into 2017 s prediction. It's coming true already. I'm gonna be watching this closely for the rest of the year. So

25:24.160 --> 25:26.380
Thanks for once again proving me right Barton

25:30.400 --> 25:36.280
Yeah, thanks for all the great hard work and we will we'll definitely be following with interest and like I said chat room if you

25:36.280 --> 25:42.080
Guys want to see that post you can find the link in the show notes to Barton's blog now before we go

25:42.080 --> 25:44.360
Any further and get into the rest of the updates of the week?

25:44.360 --> 25:50.000
I want to thank ting for sponsoring this episode of the unplugged program best URL in the business

25:50.360 --> 25:52.360
Linux dot ting dot-com

25:52.680 --> 25:58.760
Linux dot ting dot-com is where you go to save $25 off your first ting device or if you bring a device and you just

25:58.760 --> 26:02.560
Might be able to do that because they got CDMA and the GSM's

26:03.480 --> 26:06.240
What does the GSM stand for global?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Come on chat room global

26:09.000 --> 26:13.280
Systems muckery as I think yeah. Yeah, it's a technical term

26:13.280 --> 26:17.640
Yeah, I don't even give me started on CDMA, but they got both of them cuz ting be crazy like that

26:17.640 --> 26:24.880
Here's what I love. There's no contract nor the termination fee and you only pay for what you use you only pay for what you use

26:25.440 --> 26:30.600
How brilliant is that? That's impossible. It's how it works. It's six dollars for the line and then you pay for what you use

26:30.720 --> 26:35.800
Crazy ting is crazy. I know and I love it because I get to choose whichever network works better

26:35.800 --> 26:40.560
I only pay for what I use I use Wi-Fi like a boost and then to top it all off you get to speak to

26:40.560 --> 26:42.320
a real human when you need customer service

26:42.320 --> 26:48.120
And they have a fantastic dashboard to choose from you can bring your own cheapo phone or they'll sell you one with no

26:48.280 --> 26:52.120
Contract no get in the way of updates. No termination fees

26:52.800 --> 26:58.120
Man, everybody ought to do it like this and they just might one day if you vote with your wallet at Linux dot ting

26:58.480 --> 26:59.680
dot-com

26:59.680 --> 27:07.020
And I've had a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program Linux dot ting dot-com also. Hey the rest of the industry

27:07.480 --> 27:11.080
Go learn how to do a dashboard. It's only gonna cost you six dollars a month

27:11.320 --> 27:15.920
Go create a ting account and just learn how to make a good dashboard. It's

27:16.420 --> 27:23.640
2017 already linux dot ting dot-com big thanks to ting for sponsoring the unplugged shenanigans all right, Wes, so I

27:24.400 --> 27:27.240
Don't know what to make of this. I really don't know what to make of this

27:27.240 --> 27:29.240
I

27:29.760 --> 27:35.440
Feel like the Raspberry Pi folks some of them want us to run pixel on all of the things

27:35.440 --> 27:38.320
Oh, yeah, and this is a step too far. I can't take it

27:38.320 --> 27:43.840
I can't take it at all, but they have made the pixel linux desktop environment available for x86 PCs

27:43.840 --> 27:46.200
You can download an ISO with it all ready to go

27:47.000 --> 27:53.920
That's a by the way pixel is their backronym for PI improved xwindows environment lightweight. Yeah, just kind of shake me

27:53.920 --> 28:01.560
I'm just confused. It's a jacked up version of LXD. I mean a modified version of LXDE for the x11 desktop environment

28:01.560 --> 28:06.340
That's the new cool desktop environment x11 desktop environment. That's that that's what says it right there

28:06.340 --> 28:09.880
New hot says it right there the x11 a desktop environment

28:09.880 --> 28:15.280
And you know that's the good hotness because it's not transparency Chris is that they're not talking about a display server

28:15.280 --> 28:20.240
No, no, they're talking about an excellent anyways moving on it was originally released in September for the Raspberry Pi

28:20.240 --> 28:26.120
We covered it back then but now it's been packaged up for your x86 PC. They say pixel

28:26.120 --> 28:33.520
This is a ebbin says pixel is our best guess our best guess as to what the majority of Linux users are looking for in a

28:33.520 --> 28:39.480
Desktop environment put simply it's the GNU slash Linux. We would want to use they say

28:39.480 --> 28:50.920
It's clean has a modern user interface curated suite of productivity software and programming tools and by curated. They made 1.3 gigabytes

28:50.920 --> 28:53.840
I wonder what their definition of curated mean

28:53.840 --> 28:59.960
yeah, so it's Debbie and Jesse with a pixel on top and you can burn it to a DVD they say if you like or

29:00.360 --> 29:02.600
Write it to a to a thumb drive

29:05.400 --> 29:07.980
Optional persistence West is this a shot at

29:07.980 --> 29:14.700
The standard Linux distribution desktop environments like I I feel like this

29:14.700 --> 29:18.540
I I feel like I I would say this if wimpy wasn't here

29:18.540 --> 29:19.740
So I'm just gonna say it anyways

29:19.740 --> 29:25.140
I feel like this is a shot at a buntum ate because a buntum ate is kicking a ton of ass on the Raspberry Pis

29:25.140 --> 29:31.380
It makes it makes the Raspberry Pi a completely usable real computer with a no compromises traditional desktop environment

29:31.380 --> 29:36.020
And I think the Raspberry Pi folks are seeing that going. Oh crap. There's this other distribution

29:36.020 --> 29:39.340
That's getting more dominance on our own platform than our own software

29:40.300 --> 29:47.060
Why are they successful? Oh, well, it must be because you can run on x86 PCs ergo. We will make we'll reverse it

29:47.300 --> 29:55.380
We'll flip the script and we'll release our desktop environment in distro for x86 and that will stop the problem

29:55.380 --> 29:57.380
We'll stop the bleeding

29:57.540 --> 29:59.540
What do you think?

29:59.540 --> 30:02.740
You know, I was really confused when we saw this we put it in the show notes. I

30:02.740 --> 30:05.860
I guess to me it feels like they're going there

30:05.860 --> 30:12.020
It's like a like an attempted dominance play where I don't know cuz it's kind of it feels weird from our perspective

30:12.020 --> 30:17.260
Like I'm not interested in this, you know, we have a wonderful community here of like longtime Linux users some new people

30:17.260 --> 30:21.020
But anyway people who are of experience you can shop around I can't imagine installing this

30:21.020 --> 30:24.980
But I wonder if it's something that with the fact that it comes with a pi store icon on the desktop

30:24.980 --> 30:28.420
I wonder if that has anything to do it might but I could see that like, you know

30:28.420 --> 30:29.060
You're new to the pie

30:29.060 --> 30:33.700
Maybe you get into Linux using high software if this is the default if this is what you're comfortable with it could be

30:33.700 --> 30:36.860
You know an easy way to extend it like okay now we can run it on my desktop

30:36.860 --> 30:41.100
I guess I mean at least is Debian wimpy. I have to ask you what you think of this

30:42.540 --> 30:46.500
Well, I'll tell you what I've got two I've got two things to say about this the first is

30:47.260 --> 30:51.240
You know my thoughts about this pixel initiative and if you want them

30:51.900 --> 30:53.900
reinforcing then

30:53.900 --> 31:00.120
Listen to episode 1 of late-night Linux where Aiki Doherty is now a

31:00.620 --> 31:06.340
Presenter on a podcast you just see now you're totally spoiling my end of show plug. Oh, I'm

31:07.500 --> 31:10.620
Do it now now, I don't know what I'm gonna do it the end of the show, but it's fine

31:11.020 --> 31:15.460
Aiki launched a new show. I think it's brilliant called late-night Linux is episode 1

31:15.460 --> 31:18.260
We'll have it linked in the show notes. You guys got to go check it out. It sounds like

31:18.860 --> 31:21.220
Something irrelevant or interest is on there continue

31:21.220 --> 31:22.940
Okay

31:22.940 --> 31:29.440
So you want to listen to Aiki's little spiel about the Raspberry Pi pixel?

31:30.020 --> 31:37.020
Desktop environment his thoughts and my thoughts are completely aligned now to your point about

31:37.980 --> 31:39.980
Did the Raspberry Pi Foundation?

31:40.940 --> 31:46.540
Respond to Ubuntu Marte on the Raspberry Pi. I believe it's the insurgency of Ubuntu

31:46.540 --> 31:51.220
Yeah, whatever you want to call it if if the only thing

31:51.880 --> 31:57.880
Ubuntu Marte achieved is to make a better default operating system for the Raspberry Pi

31:58.320 --> 32:01.600
Then that's a fine legacy as far as I'm concerned

32:01.600 --> 32:07.140
Wow, I couldn't I couldn't have written a better response if I had an hour to come up with it with you

32:07.140 --> 32:10.600
That is some smooth as butter response right there. I love it

32:10.760 --> 32:15.800
Well, I suppose that's one brilliant and wonderful way that leaves my heart feeling warm to look at it

32:15.800 --> 32:20.800
So I choose to move on and not ask further questions. Do you have a thought? Okay, so

32:21.720 --> 32:27.820
Let's go from that heartwarming story to kill disk ransomware that's targeting Linux machines demands

32:28.520 --> 32:34.120
250,000 u.s. Greenbacks ones converted from Bitcoin depending on the rate and then doesn't decrypt your files

32:34.980 --> 32:36.980
after you give it the

32:37.520 --> 32:39.520
$250,000 greenbacks

32:39.520 --> 32:41.640
That is the lowest of the low crazy

32:41.640 --> 32:47.240
You're undermining the whole ransomware industry when you do this because people are gonna stop paying if this becomes a trend a whole trust

32:47.240 --> 32:48.560
Thing here. I mean no one liked it

32:48.560 --> 32:54.200
But yeah, at least you can get your phone that you're really gonna you're gonna undermine the industry when you do this ransomware authors

32:54.200 --> 32:58.360
I'm telling you I don't really know how big of a deal is I'm having this really weird

32:58.360 --> 33:00.240
I mean, it's not unusual

33:00.240 --> 33:04.360
but it's extremely strong with this one a lot of hype logs a

33:04.440 --> 33:07.560
Lot of like end of the world that the sky is falling

33:07.560 --> 33:13.800
All your files will be destroyed and and no good really technical analysis of what this thing is

33:14.440 --> 33:18.580
but it it I don't really cuz you mean like I would love to know a

33:19.120 --> 33:23.280
Great example of how it's getting on people's machines how they're executing it

33:23.280 --> 33:26.960
Has anybody the mumble room come across the story that covers it on that sense?

33:28.920 --> 33:34.720
Yeah, I'm taking that science to me know that I haven't seen it either and I've been I've been looking people are too scared killed

33:34.720 --> 33:39.560
There's been anything though two hundred twenty two bitcoins really I know that's pretty

33:40.440 --> 33:45.840
Yeah, that that is a lot, but doesn't like some businesses have been paying them. I mean yeah, I yeah

33:45.840 --> 33:47.600
Yeah, that's how we found out well

33:47.600 --> 33:49.680
No, we found out because someone reversed

33:49.680 --> 33:53.920
He said did a random key he said did the research on this thing?

33:53.920 --> 33:57.880
So he said went in and did the research on it on December 6th

33:58.320 --> 34:00.640
And they say there's even variants out in the wild too

34:00.640 --> 34:05.520
They say things like we are so sorry, but the encryption of your data has been successfully completed

34:05.600 --> 34:07.600
so you could lose your data or

34:07.920 --> 34:12.040
Pay two hundred and twenty two BTC like people even know what BTC is

34:12.120 --> 34:16.520
Like you imagine if you got that and you don't have any you don't you're just starting from like wow

34:16.520 --> 34:21.120
That's rough, then they put the address on there. You know what we could do if anybody in the chat room wants to screenshot this

34:22.180 --> 34:27.520
Screenshot that and then go look up and see if any bitcoins were sent to that address. That's publicly available

34:27.520 --> 34:30.960
Yeah, so that's how William. That's how we could find out if anybody paid it

34:31.520 --> 34:35.440
Cuz are you true, so I'll leave that up there on the screen for a moment while we do this

34:35.440 --> 34:37.800
So I guess there's only one address oh

34:38.560 --> 34:42.600
Right because there's variants too. Yeah, I don't know necessarily

34:42.600 --> 34:46.480
That's the only address, but you could at least look at that one and see if anyone paid to that one

34:46.480 --> 34:49.040
I don't know if it changes not getting as much attention

34:49.040 --> 34:55.240
But there's also a version for Windows called win 32 kill disk, so it's not just a platform everyone

34:55.240 --> 34:59.000
Yeah, all your favorite side at least they're sorry about it. Yeah

34:59.920 --> 35:03.840
They're so sorry actually we are so sorry, but the encryption

35:03.840 --> 35:05.780
I like the cadence of it, too

35:05.780 --> 35:10.800
We are so sorry comma, but the encryption of your data has been successfully completed comma

35:10.960 --> 35:16.280
So you can lose your data or pay, and there's no commas or periods right there

35:16.280 --> 35:20.320
It's all just like mixed messaging of sorry, but successful also

35:20.320 --> 35:24.860
It's also nice that they have a contact email on maybe if we email them we can ask if anyone's paid

35:28.560 --> 35:32.720
It's interesting look at this and then in grub on the lid on the on Linux

35:33.960 --> 35:41.760
They rewrite grub so that the menu entries in grub are the error message so frustrating look at that. That's it so right there

35:41.760 --> 35:42.640
It's in grub

35:42.640 --> 35:43.320
We are so sorry

35:43.320 --> 35:47.360
But the encryption of your data has been successfully completed so you can lose your data or pay and then it goes on

35:47.360 --> 35:51.800
In and each line of the sentence is a grub menu entry for boot

35:55.200 --> 35:57.740
That is that's a whole kind of awful

35:58.080 --> 36:02.280
That's a kind of they have the they do have a technical analysis on the ESET blog

36:03.080 --> 36:08.000
And it doesn't really go into though how they how they launch it though. What's kind of areas

36:08.000 --> 36:10.300
Is that the one they do they reference the the telebot?

36:11.840 --> 36:13.840
Infection that they reference in the

36:14.320 --> 36:15.880
description of this one

36:15.880 --> 36:18.480
There's an infection vector listed there

36:18.520 --> 36:22.600
But the one that they're now talking about getting a lot of press for knowing no vector

36:22.600 --> 36:28.640
Yeah, I mean I would assume under Linux you are somehow getting this on the machine now

36:28.640 --> 36:31.200
Maybe it's getting put on there remotely through another vulnerability

36:31.200 --> 36:36.000
But it would seem like more like a phishing attempt or something downloading it and then getting the user to execute it

36:36.280 --> 36:40.520
Which for better or for worse is not as easy it is on Windows right? No, it's not

36:40.520 --> 36:47.320
I mean, where are you because you would also likely have to market as executable because what what are you downloading from your browser?

36:47.320 --> 36:53.840
Doesn't automatically mark things as executable. So are you getting people to plus X these things as well? How is this working exactly idea?

36:53.840 --> 36:55.840
Yeah, you've got it's got to be

36:56.240 --> 37:01.600
Distribute what I find interesting is they're seeding the key based on the time of the system and that's it

37:01.600 --> 37:06.640
And so I wonder if based on the modification type of the file you couldn't like and guess what the key might be

37:06.640 --> 37:12.360
Oh, yeah, so Rekai looked it up on blockchain. They've received one transaction

37:12.360 --> 37:17.800
It looks like a test transaction because it's just zero point zero zero zero one BTC

37:19.120 --> 37:21.560
Well, let's hope so they don't get any either

37:21.560 --> 37:24.800
They haven't gotten any money that or they have lots of addresses or something

37:24.800 --> 37:28.520
But yeah, so no one's paid that one at least which is the one that's all over news articles

37:28.880 --> 37:34.000
So don't get tricked audience. Do not send your BTC. It's funny somebody sent it on December 30th

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I

37:36.280 --> 37:39.760
Might be might just be I wonder if you could trace this back if it was someone trolling them

37:39.880 --> 37:45.240
What would be really funny is if you could trace that transaction back and then figure out who it is based on blockchain

37:46.840 --> 37:49.640
So I don't really think anybody actually has to worry about this

37:49.680 --> 37:54.520
But what really struck me was the amount of panic is at a whole new level

37:55.360 --> 38:00.960
All kinds of all kinds of blogs about it. Like there was I don't know three or four

38:00.960 --> 38:07.800
different articles by this weekend and now there's like a dozen articles written by today and none of them have any real substance and I

38:07.800 --> 38:10.160
Don't know if anyone that's actually been affected in the wild

38:10.160 --> 38:14.920
I mean it sounds the article implies like somebody was infected in the wild and their screenshots of it

38:14.920 --> 38:19.220
So it's likely been run in testing, but I don't know. I don't know right? It's like there's no

38:19.920 --> 38:24.800
Qualifications or evidence is to like is this any you know dramatically more popular than any of the other

38:24.800 --> 38:28.440
I wonder if they found the Linux variant by first getting the Windows variant

38:28.440 --> 38:31.080
Like I wonder if there's some connection that makes it easy to find the Linux one

38:31.520 --> 38:33.360
After having the Windows one as a sample

38:33.360 --> 38:37.840
Do you guys know I used to work in an antivirus company and they had a yeah

38:37.840 --> 38:42.220
They had a whole isolated research division where they were trying to get infections and stuff all the time

38:42.720 --> 38:47.040
Yeah, it was pretty cool. It was a real scam of an antivirus company, but

38:47.680 --> 38:48.920
It was a bad one

38:48.920 --> 38:52.920
It was I didn't really know at the time because like what did I know about Windows antivirus back then?

38:52.920 --> 38:56.720
but I was in the IT department they ran all Linux and they ran asterix for their phone and

38:56.720 --> 39:00.120
It's where I learned to use bacula. Oh, that's awesome

39:00.120 --> 39:04.560
And I there's a wire I also learned a very I had a very quick crash course in network

39:05.120 --> 39:09.880
Segmentation because they had like this they had this cool setup like they were off in this

39:10.720 --> 39:16.240
Second half of the building where they didn't have their overhead lights on and they had lamps at their deaths

39:16.240 --> 39:20.280
And and and they have their own network with its own internet connection. It was like this

39:20.320 --> 39:25.160
It was like this truly cool and squadrant. Yeah. Yeah, very much. Oh, yeah

39:25.160 --> 39:29.640
So that was my first experience with that kind of thing and it's that's how they do it right they get systems

39:29.640 --> 39:35.120
I have lots of VMs and they would get infections and then they would go track that back. They would reverse the path and

39:36.000 --> 39:40.540
Like William says a lot of times they'd start with a with a Windows one and they'd find that there's a Linux variant just by

39:40.880 --> 39:45.400
Beginning the research of it not because it's necessarily getting actively excellent

39:46.520 --> 39:50.240
It's very it feels like a million years ago

39:50.240 --> 39:56.600
And I would have killed for a resource like Linux Academy back then Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

39:56.600 --> 40:01.280
Go there to support the show and sign up for a seven-day free trial. That's madness

40:01.280 --> 40:06.880
You could really just dive in and you really get it really get a sense of it engage with some of the live instructors

40:06.880 --> 40:09.720
Enjoy the community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members

40:09.880 --> 40:17.960
Have yourselves a little hands-on scenario based lab or an in-depth video or maybe use the core scheduler to match your busy schedule

40:17.960 --> 40:20.560
We get lots of emails about certs

40:21.120 --> 40:25.120
Lots of emails and they have courses created specifically to prepare you for exams

40:25.120 --> 40:30.240
And they have this public profile section that I think is ideal for those of us that need to either

40:30.520 --> 40:33.600
Prove to an employer that you're using your education time

40:33.600 --> 40:41.080
Like I I for a long time worked at companies that gave me a budget every year to for education and this boom again

40:41.480 --> 40:44.880
Perfect for that and you can use the public profiles to demonstrate the work

40:44.880 --> 40:48.760
You've done also great to help clients understand what you're capable of or just to prove to yourself

40:48.760 --> 40:53.520
I also appreciate the fact that they understand you don't always have hours and hours and hours to commit to this stuff

40:53.520 --> 40:56.640
They give you the study tools you can download and take with you. That's awesome

40:56.640 --> 40:59.720
They have mobile apps that you can take advantage of when you're on the go

40:59.720 --> 41:04.000
They have nuggets with a little tiny bits of sparkly wisdom. Just a deep dive into a single topic

41:04.080 --> 41:08.200
They have the learning paths and course schedulers to help work around your busy schedule

41:08.240 --> 41:11.520
No cards to help you study up really quick. It is incredible

41:11.520 --> 41:16.720
Incredible and to top it all off. They have that instructor mentoring and they're constantly adding new content

41:16.720 --> 41:22.580
I just got an email from Anthony yesterday about a whole new slew of stuff going into Linux Academy

41:22.580 --> 41:24.580
Check it out at Linux Academy comm

41:25.360 --> 41:33.060
Slash unplugged Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and a big. Thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring this unplugged program

41:34.740 --> 41:38.720
Talking about hardware. I mean Barton's really got me thinking about it. All right, and

41:38.720 --> 41:40.720
I

41:41.600 --> 41:43.720
Have this I have this sort of

41:44.920 --> 41:46.920
kind of kind of

41:47.040 --> 41:50.800
Casual eye on where Intel is going with these really small

41:51.360 --> 41:55.040
x86 PCs and they've tried they keep trying to dip their toe in here

41:55.040 --> 41:59.680
They've totally missed the boat on the mobile stuff and they keep trying to dip their toe in here kind of compete with the Raspberry

41:59.680 --> 42:06.040
Pi and I think they might have something kind of interesting now this came up at CES and it's Intel's compute card

42:06.040 --> 42:11.520
It's a PC that can fit in your wallet. It's intended to be a more versatile replacement for the compute stick

42:11.520 --> 42:13.520
That hasn't really gotten a lot of traction

42:14.280 --> 42:17.240
And I was I was kind of interested in the compute stick

42:17.240 --> 42:19.400
But it really was a bear to put Linux on in fact

42:19.400 --> 42:25.200
I think we bought one and tried and couldn't even get I can't remember but we don't have the specifics on the specs yet

42:25.480 --> 42:31.000
But Intel reps say that it will have the performance of high-end fanless laptops like some MacBooks

42:31.000 --> 42:35.640
The processors have a TDP of up to six watts, which could fit in these things, which is pretty nice

42:35.640 --> 42:41.600
That's like a low-powered atom or even the M and Y series core i5 and i7 CPUs

42:43.240 --> 42:46.960
So that's actually an i5 in my pocket. Yeah, they're gonna enough this

42:46.960 --> 42:50.240
I'm not so sure of I guess this would have to take off but because it's Intel

42:50.240 --> 42:52.640
They could probably just rev it into a chipset

42:53.560 --> 42:58.160
Intel says that the card uses a variant of the USB C port called

42:59.080 --> 43:01.080
USB C plus extension

43:01.080 --> 43:07.920
Oh, it allows you to connect the system right in so you connect this to like say another PC

43:07.920 --> 43:14.840
It allows you to connect right into the PCIe bus as well as the HDMI and DisplayPort video outputs

43:15.760 --> 43:20.120
so they feel like it could be like a like a way to like really juice it up and

43:21.600 --> 43:27.900
They estimate the compute stick will drop off their roadmap in 2018. Okay, and this will be what replaces it

43:27.900 --> 43:32.120
It's an x86 based PC. It'll be available to run something called Windows

43:32.300 --> 43:35.480
That sounds like something you put in your house and then also Linux

43:35.980 --> 43:42.280
Basically any operating system you kind of put on the low-end PC in mid 2017 the Intel compute stick

43:42.340 --> 43:47.220
It's interesting that they felt limited by the the connections available on the compute stick

43:47.220 --> 43:51.940
I think that was one of their motivations to to move to this weird new USB. There's a new USB C era

43:51.940 --> 43:59.020
I wonder if that hopefully it seems like they'll need that. They're a USB C plus extension to be compatible with other things

43:59.020 --> 44:00.700
Because I could see it working if like, you know

44:00.700 --> 44:05.260
The dong we really do start living in the dongle universe where there's dongles and docks and USB C things everywhere

44:05.260 --> 44:05.740
Then yeah, sure

44:05.740 --> 44:08.860
If you've got this thing in your wallet, then you show up and you plug in your one cord

44:08.860 --> 44:10.460
Maybe this is the conversions device

44:10.460 --> 44:11.260
Yeah

44:11.260 --> 44:17.100
Anybody in the mummer room have thoughts on this particular type of form factor before we jump from this one's really cool as like a

44:17.100 --> 44:18.980
smart card type thing

44:18.980 --> 44:23.180
You could be your smart card was like your identity type information and like core information

44:23.180 --> 44:27.740
You want to carry around your smart card could be your entire PC on that. Yeah. Well, not so much

44:27.740 --> 44:32.540
But why not? It's not powerful enough for me. Yeah, I mean, I think some people could live with this

44:32.540 --> 44:35.500
Yeah, I think that's a very small market right now. I think this is up to get more powerful

44:35.740 --> 44:42.260
Yeah before most people can live with it. I agree. Yeah, it's still worse performing than even like the ARM Chromebooks

44:42.260 --> 44:47.000
yeah, and I so I I I think I I think I'm like

44:47.000 --> 44:49.180
I think I need at least a four core I

44:49.860 --> 44:50.940
seven

44:50.940 --> 44:53.860
As a minimum like 50 watt TDP process

44:56.060 --> 44:59.880
Like a 50 watt TDP GPU, yeah, I look at those two core ones

44:59.880 --> 45:06.500
I'm like, you know, you know Chris you could probably slum it and get away with an i5. Yeah, I maybe maybe I don't know

45:06.500 --> 45:12.300
I don't know. I'm back to that precision line then one of the big trends out of CES this year is these

45:13.300 --> 45:15.100
huge

45:15.100 --> 45:21.380
Laptops, have you seen some of these? Yeah. Yeah, they're meant to be fancy crazy. Yeah with like dual power supplies and

45:22.020 --> 45:26.980
22 inch curved screens in some cases and they're just that seems like a lot to look around

45:26.980 --> 45:33.860
I feel like almost like 1820 pounds, which is ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is there a market like a briefcase?

45:34.900 --> 45:43.100
Well, is this is this a huge is this a huge response to is this like a big backlash to?

45:43.100 --> 45:45.100
the MacBook thing I

45:46.020 --> 45:51.580
Know that you know, this was sort of in the making for years. That's what I feel like too. Yeah push this in any way

45:51.980 --> 45:54.540
But they're not making these things as a folly, right?

45:54.540 --> 45:59.900
They must they must believe that there is a customer base out there for these things. I'm thinking maybe

46:00.340 --> 46:07.500
You know on set editing machines for you know, big productions and what have you could have er I know wimpy

46:07.500 --> 46:08.940
You probably would doubt this

46:08.940 --> 46:13.500
It's not gonna not gonna be for VR is it? I mean you blundering around

46:14.580 --> 46:15.700
blinkered

46:15.700 --> 46:17.700
wearing your nose bag

46:18.060 --> 46:20.060
possibly running into

46:21.660 --> 46:26.860
It's just not gonna happen but now I'm thinking I'm thinking, you know high-end editing machines

46:27.540 --> 46:30.780
3d video creation tools that sort of stuff

46:30.780 --> 46:34.940
I think with gaming GPUs being possible to integrate into laptops now

46:34.940 --> 46:42.000
It's becoming more prevalent like your 1080s and your 1070s the desktop variants can be directly integrated into laptops and even water cooled

46:42.000 --> 46:43.300
And that's yeah, I know so it's a crazy

46:43.300 --> 46:43.500
Yeah

46:43.500 --> 46:43.620
well

46:43.620 --> 46:49.180
The 1080 series with the CPU slowing down and being fast enough and the GPUs sort of catching up in the mobile segment

46:49.580 --> 46:54.940
Gamers are really interested in these devices and Asus makes one where you can dock it and it's water-cooled

46:54.980 --> 46:59.360
So like the GPUs and everything are hooked up to water blocks and there are two outlets on the back

46:59.420 --> 47:03.220
That hook up into a dock to give you more cooling when you're docked at your desk. Yeah

47:03.220 --> 47:09.780
That is are you are you saying that there's a potential market there for pro gamers for these? Absolutely. Yeah

47:09.780 --> 47:12.900
Wow, well, there you go. See at least that's a merging as a market

47:12.900 --> 47:15.980
It may be that of course becoming a thing, of course

47:15.980 --> 47:20.420
You're gonna be taking your rig anyway, and you know that that you know, and I've recently

47:21.060 --> 47:23.060
I've recently been working with

47:23.340 --> 47:27.900
4k footage that is it's it's compressed but it's a hundred megabits and

47:28.620 --> 47:30.620
It makes my machine

47:30.860 --> 47:31.740
chug

47:31.740 --> 47:33.540
Just crying and as I'm you know

47:33.540 --> 47:40.100
My my SSD gets like it's like eight nine hundred megabytes a second read and it's still when I'm skimming in the editor

47:40.460 --> 47:43.940
100 megs a second. It can't keep up when I'm really jumping around

47:44.940 --> 47:48.900
And then of course rendering that and all of that. It's becoming a it's big

47:48.900 --> 47:50.980
I'm pushing that I'm pushing the limits of it and I could

47:51.580 --> 47:57.020
Honestly, I don't need portability in my main editing machine other than I need to be able to edit

47:57.020 --> 48:03.060
somewhere wherever I'm at right and I will you know, I can set up and I can plug in and I don't need hours of

48:03.060 --> 48:08.300
Battery life, but I need unlimited disk and CPU and it doesn't make sense to have like a big desktop in the rig

48:08.300 --> 48:10.860
Or anything that you could just have this and then still take it to this video

48:10.860 --> 48:15.740
The other problem is when you're dealing with files like this is a day's worth of shooting now is 70 80 gigs

48:15.740 --> 48:19.820
You probably need your fastest and then like a second disk at least with I'm every night

48:19.820 --> 48:22.740
I have to offload to the NAS to make room for the next day's editing

48:22.740 --> 48:28.180
Oh Chris a minute. Take a look at those laptops with the curved screens. Come on

48:28.180 --> 48:32.480
I think that would be kind of cool Chris. Take a look at the link I son in the where's

48:33.140 --> 48:39.020
Gx800 or the YouTube video. That's some that I gotta go go linked. Oh, jeez. I know yeah

48:39.020 --> 48:43.120
That's what I was thinking about from Linus. Yeah, I don't I think they probably have a content

48:43.120 --> 48:46.020
I did so yeah, they've actually had a similar model out in the past

48:46.020 --> 48:48.140
There was a previous iteration that is very similar

48:48.140 --> 48:57.060
I hope they don't content ID this but I think he actually says right here has to put it down because it's too heavy to

48:57.060 --> 48:59.060
Hold yeah, it's super heavy

49:03.060 --> 49:05.060
My arms tired yeah, it's

49:05.740 --> 49:10.060
It has been funny watching that too bad. They all run Windows. Yeah, Bart needs to go talk to all those people

49:10.060 --> 49:14.060
Tell them what's up?

49:14.700 --> 49:19.700
To get one of these and then integrate Linux into it. Yeah, yeah, maybe I wonder if they would do

49:19.700 --> 49:23.600
I wonder if they'd be up for something like I think these are from a clevo line like I think they could actually

49:23.860 --> 49:30.940
Take these and fix them up these feel like this is a pretty bit like this feels like unless I'm misunderstanding

49:30.940 --> 49:37.740
I understand professional gamers is a huge growing area which kind of blows my mind in its own right, but could they I just seems nuts

49:37.740 --> 49:40.380
Okay, I guess just here's what I'm trying to go with this

49:40.380 --> 49:47.340
Could there really be enough of a market that this many vendors are building machines this extreme and that there's like a gamble

49:47.340 --> 49:53.300
I really don't think so. I think what Dale needs to make is really the thing that Razer is doing with a three monitor laptop

49:55.540 --> 49:59.060
Days where you'd like to slide out monitors. Yeah, that's what I thought of when I saw that

49:59.660 --> 50:04.140
Yep, although I don't think razor has any intention of actually ever shipping that at the moment

50:04.140 --> 50:09.860
Oh, I have to get him bad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's nine thousand dollars for some of those machines

50:10.460 --> 50:12.460
Uni you want to jump in go ahead

50:13.860 --> 50:21.100
Uni go on once are you muted uni? Sorry? Sorry? Oh, there you go. No, you're it's okay. Go ahead. Go ahead

50:22.780 --> 50:26.220
All right, so I got Mario grip over on telegram here

50:26.220 --> 50:30.560
He just wanted to let everyone know that no Ubuntu touch is not dead

50:30.560 --> 50:34.280
Oh, yeah, the guy that runs you be ports. Yeah, we covered that on last

50:34.280 --> 50:38.240
I don't know if anybody in here hint hint has any comments on it

50:38.240 --> 50:41.220
But yeah, essentially it sounds like it's hiatus why we transition from or they

50:41.840 --> 50:46.520
Transition from click packages to snap packages and then integrate it with the rest of the overall strategy fair

50:48.000 --> 50:53.100
Fair I think I've said that before right? Yeah, it just makes sense to and it feels like the right time to do it

50:53.100 --> 51:00.300
Yes, I was I almost made a prediction that canonical will drop mirror in

51:00.940 --> 51:03.700
2017 but then I just decide now they're too far. They're too far

51:04.540 --> 51:09.420
But wouldn't that wouldn't that make everybody's mouth drop if they just said I you know what?

51:09.420 --> 51:13.400
We think we can get what we need to weigh land for us. Yeah, that would be a great news week for us

51:16.780 --> 51:18.820
Yeah, I almost made that prediction but yeah

51:18.820 --> 51:24.860
I know that a lot of people are reacting about Ubuntu phone a lot of what I'm seeing is hope saw that common

51:24.860 --> 51:31.380
you know real armchair kind of stuff, but I think it's extremely practical at this stage and

51:31.780 --> 51:37.940
It it would be it would be awkward to have this division with click packages and snap packages

51:38.460 --> 51:41.500
Especially with so much momentum in the company behind snap packages

51:41.500 --> 51:45.180
And if you wanted to make the case for like Linux users to move over

51:45.180 --> 51:47.700
Here's the whole little bit different of an ecosystem that you have to learn

51:47.700 --> 51:50.940
Sorry, it's not just a bunch of on your phone that you're used to. Yeah, it's

51:51.620 --> 51:54.540
It is it's too bad that it hasn't gotten more traction

51:55.100 --> 51:59.940
I would have liked to have seen a few solid US options. I I

52:00.700 --> 52:06.740
really, you know, I've I've I've exhausted myself talking about about about mobile at this point, but I think

52:07.420 --> 52:12.380
long-term it just seems to make the most sense anyways, like if if you're not afraid to be a little embarrassed in the short term and

52:12.380 --> 52:14.220
you have the

52:14.220 --> 52:18.220
Fortitude to stick with it over the long term seems like the better route to go. Yeah, just my

52:19.420 --> 52:23.940
Estimation. All right, Wes. Well, I want to talk about a couple of things

52:23.940 --> 52:26.660
I said I was gonna I said I said I would confirm two predictions

52:26.660 --> 52:30.180
I've only confirmed one prediction this one more to go. I got one more to I know I know

52:30.180 --> 52:34.740
So before we get into that, I want to thank digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program

52:34.740 --> 52:39.620
Did you know that digital ocean is a thing and it's a thing that will change your life

52:40.500 --> 52:42.500
That's true. Yeah unplugged

52:42.500 --> 52:47.860
Do unplug it a $10 credit it go create the account then you apply it do unplugged

52:47.860 --> 52:54.140
It is it is really something I guess I probably if you've heard these spots and you've never gone and actually pulled the trigger

52:54.140 --> 53:00.220
I don't really need to tell you something you haven't heard before you probably are aware that it's a simple easy way to get started

53:00.220 --> 53:06.740
To create a Linux rig up in the cloud and their data centers all over the world all SSD based super fast great UI

53:07.540 --> 53:09.540
super nice API

53:09.540 --> 53:15.020
Solid set of documentation some of the best on the web really straightforward pricing and our release available

53:15.020 --> 53:19.820
That's oh and basically any distro you'd ever want to choose from and if they don't have the one you'd want

53:19.820 --> 53:21.820
You know, which one I'm talking about

53:22.300 --> 53:25.540
There's a little birdie that tells me with that HTML 5 console you can make it happen

53:25.540 --> 53:27.700
I'm not saying that and I'm definitely not putting that in the spot

53:27.700 --> 53:31.920
So cut all that out, but I'm just saying there's a thing you can do. They have an HTML 5 console

53:31.920 --> 53:37.140
It's a powerful thing from post to boot check it out at digital ocean comm use the promo code deal and plug now

53:37.140 --> 53:43.100
You know where you know, you know how you can use digital ocean if there is any tasks you can do

53:43.100 --> 53:47.220
That doesn't require a GUI if there's anything you can do on the command line

53:47.220 --> 53:49.460
You could use a digital ocean droplet for it pretty much

53:49.460 --> 53:52.140
You got something you need to download in the background. You want to host some torrents?

53:52.140 --> 53:54.380
I mean I'm talking simple stuff for average everyday users

53:54.380 --> 53:55.700
Digital ocean works for you

53:55.700 --> 54:01.060
If you want to build the back end infrastructure for your business or in our case for your live streaming infrastructure to send it off

54:01.060 --> 54:06.380
To scale engine and YouTube and you stream and bippity bops and records here's and maybe a Twitter account

54:06.380 --> 54:09.260
Maybe a twitch channel one day you gotta use, you know

54:09.260 --> 54:14.280
I could assure I guess I could have a big old rack that I'm running hardware out of all the time like an animal

54:14.280 --> 54:20.680
Or I take advantage of their entire Linux infrastructure using KVM for the virtualizer SSDs for the storage

54:20.680 --> 54:26.940
Oh, and did I mention 40 gigabit e connections right into them hyper visors? They're doing it, right? I

54:27.620 --> 54:33.260
Mean, yeah, I guess I could spend all of my time building that and get like one per not even 1% of what they got

54:33.260 --> 54:37.540
I mean, it's really come on. It's a as the Borg would say it is a futile maneuver

54:37.620 --> 54:42.220
Go over to digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplugged. It's one word

54:42.220 --> 54:46.140
it's lowercase smack your leg when you're saying it apply it to your account and

54:46.740 --> 54:50.740
Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program. I

54:51.580 --> 54:54.100
Am not proclaiming that the Mac is dead

54:54.100 --> 55:00.540
I'm not proclaiming that Linux is going to become the champion of 2017. I am simply saying

55:00.540 --> 55:05.060
That a lot of long time Mac users developers

55:05.660 --> 55:08.460
technical workers are abandoning the platform and

55:09.100 --> 55:13.860
We have yet another blog this week. And these are one of many examples

55:13.860 --> 55:17.580
we have one last week to the title is from OS 10 to Ubuntu and

55:18.220 --> 55:21.500
It's a fascinating read. It's good. If you're looking to switch yourself

55:21.500 --> 55:23.500
I won't go through all of it

55:23.500 --> 55:28.100
But I did highlight a couple of the interesting bits and then I want to talk a little bit more about some of the data

55:28.100 --> 55:32.380
We have so he says I was a Linux user ten years ago, but moved to a Mac one

55:33.140 --> 55:36.820
Mainly because I was tired of maintaining an often broken system looking at X org

55:37.820 --> 55:38.660
Yeah, man

55:38.660 --> 55:46.780
And all Apple had a quite appealing offer at the time a well-maintained Unix platform with beautiful hardware good UX and access to editor

55:46.780 --> 55:48.700
apps I like like Photoshop and

55:48.700 --> 55:49.420
office

55:49.420 --> 55:54.820
The trigger was pulled when Apple though for him to switch when Apple announced the 2015 MacBook line with strange

55:54.820 --> 55:58.940
Connectivity decisions like having unique ports for everything and using strange dongles

55:58.940 --> 56:01.900
You know if they're if their top-notch hardware started to turn weird

56:01.900 --> 56:06.780
It was probably time to look elsewhere and now I've seen the latest MacBook Pro line escape key was removed

56:06.780 --> 56:08.660
I'm kind of comforted in my decision

56:08.660 --> 56:14.060
He's also recently joined Mozilla at the storage team and saw lots of colleagues happily using Linux

56:14.060 --> 56:21.380
They weren't struggling with anything in particular oddly enough. It seemed like they were capable working efficiently both at work and for their personal stuff

56:21.380 --> 56:26.420
so in this case our author buys a Lenovo x1 carbon and

56:26.780 --> 56:33.940
Started transitioning over to Linux chose Ubuntu right away because previously that's what the developer used and stuck with the unity desktop

56:35.260 --> 56:37.140
Everything worked right away

56:37.140 --> 56:42.540
Nothing really needed to be messed with including Bluetooth and external display unity is going fine

56:43.220 --> 56:47.540
The last batch of OS 10 apps are that he really liked are not available on Linux

56:47.540 --> 56:49.820
But so far most equivalents have been found

56:49.820 --> 56:54.620
For the most part the web is your app store. That was an interesting observation

56:54.620 --> 56:59.260
I mean, I think we've talked about that before but he's he's definitely right that ten years ago today

56:59.260 --> 57:02.020
There's a lot more that you can do online. You just don't have to worry about on Linux

57:02.020 --> 57:02.440
Yeah

57:02.440 --> 57:07.420
And this is there's still some web apps than error that don't you know don't live up to the app and up to snuff and so

57:07.420 --> 57:11.580
There's some type of specific tasks and native apps that are still more efficient or better integrated than what the web has

57:12.260 --> 57:14.860
finds a unity launcher to be sufficient and

57:14.860 --> 57:21.100
Has looked at to Albert and synapse file managers talk, you know talks about all that

57:21.100 --> 57:25.600
but I guess I'll end it with the conclusion because you can read the rest talks in here about using

57:26.500 --> 57:32.680
Dark table and and all of that gaming music. It's a really fantastic video editing password management

57:32.680 --> 57:34.260
It's a fantastic

57:34.260 --> 57:37.420
Post but so is Linux ready for the desktop for me?

57:37.420 --> 57:42.100
The answer is yes, the author concludes and will be sticking with Linux

57:42.100 --> 57:45.060
And Nicola's I believe is how you say his first name

57:48.580 --> 57:52.180
This is like I guess we could I am I won't I won't keep doing this

57:52.180 --> 57:56.140
I won't keep reading all of these blog posts every year or I mean every week as these come out

57:56.140 --> 58:00.620
But I wanted to read it this week because it goes in combination with another report that's come out

58:01.260 --> 58:07.100
Greg over at computer world is reporting on this that according to net applications who constantly reports on this stuff all the time

58:07.740 --> 58:09.740
Apple's mac OS is

58:09.740 --> 58:16.360
Is beginning to decline from seven percent actually actually peaked at nine point six percent

58:16.360 --> 58:19.120
But now it's down to six point one percent

58:19.720 --> 58:24.580
Yeah, so I guess it was down seven percent from a year ago. That's actually a decent drop-off

58:24.800 --> 58:28.120
Now you're wondering about Linux Linux user share is at two point two percent

58:28.680 --> 58:32.740
It peaked at two point three percent in November in those new MacBooks came out

58:32.740 --> 58:39.380
And a Linux first cracked the two percent barrier back in June of 2016 and now we're sitting at two point two percent

58:39.380 --> 58:43.460
So nice little growth curve for little there Linux. So um, I

58:45.140 --> 58:48.940
Present you a case West in my am I looking for evidence of

58:49.420 --> 58:54.660
upset in the Mac community and then coming to Linux or do you think we are witnessing the

58:55.300 --> 59:02.260
Slow new trickle of Mac exodus users coming over Linux. Am I right or am I looking for trouble?

59:02.260 --> 59:02.980
No, I think you're right

59:02.980 --> 59:08.540
I mean if anything I think you've been a little bit cautious in that there are always those people who are doing that switch

59:08.540 --> 59:11.460
There's always you know, and there's a lot of for a lot of people who it's kind of easy to be like well

59:11.460 --> 59:18.440
Yeah, it works for me. I think what's unique now is that we're seeing people who had a lot of them were previously unit Linux users

59:18.440 --> 59:19.300
They've dabbled in it

59:19.300 --> 59:23.540
Some of them have tried over the years to switch or you know have one Linux system and then have to use

59:23.700 --> 59:28.400
Their OS X so I think what the difference is we're seeing people who you know, this is like their main workstation

59:28.400 --> 59:30.060
This is their main work laptop that kind of thing

59:30.060 --> 59:35.920
And now the kind of folks Barton is targeting exactly and it does feel like there's like a a zeitgeist changed where now

59:36.460 --> 59:38.560
Linux is a real option for in their minds again

59:39.620 --> 59:47.420
Yeah, and I think it there's there's also sort of this sort of belay setting in over the situation with some of the previous vendors

59:47.420 --> 59:53.540
Mm-hmm. I think it's a whole interesting storm. All right, that's it. I'm done. I'm just saying I think this is a good trend

59:53.540 --> 59:58.060
For Linux in general. I think maybe I've beaten this horse now. We'll check back in in some months. Yeah

59:58.060 --> 01:00:04.500
Yeah, simmer and exactly exactly because for all I know in a couple of weeks. They'll all realize they hate Linux

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:04.700
Yeah

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.100
They all can start writing post Linux is the worst

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:12.780
How I tried to switch to Linux and it blew up in my face and I came rounding back to the Mac like that could be

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:14.900
The post and they all end up buying Mac Pro trash cans

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:23.140
We'll really eat our words. Yeah, that's right. Ww you want to jump in go ahead. Yeah, I'm thinking that maybe

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:30.020
Professionals and the people who really use those big machines that are tired and they're they're moving away from it

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.220
They're moving away from it because as work

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.260
workloads get you know bigger like

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:41.660
Video professionals and photography professionals are gonna be dealing with higher and higher images

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:47.640
They need something that's cutting edge that can do the work that they need to do it

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:52.180
No work on two-year three-year old hardware. That's last generation

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.460
and

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:58.740
That could be pushing them to move to you know, besides openness of Linux, which is yeah much better

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:04.220
I I so I think too when it comes to business, you know, they specifically like predictability to a degree as well

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.700
I mean, there's there's there's obviously constraints on that

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:12.860
but you know as a business you you you sometimes build a workflow around certain hardware features and

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:20.180
For a lot of professionals the loss of the SD card reader, even though the thing doesn't doesn't it's not required

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:24.780
It's not necessitated by thickness requirements because the reader is tiny and then it's as thin as an SD card

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:31.700
it is but that's that one thing is a major blow to the digital video workflow because

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:41.180
essentially a lot of like the the Canon cameras and even Sony cameras and Nikon cameras have standardized on SD, right so when you're shooting it with

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:46.140
Photography or shooting video on these cameras and then you go to sit down and import it

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:50.580
You always have SD cards you need to work with and you don't want one more dongle that you're dragging around

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:54.060
You already have the giant camera bag and the laptop this seems like a small example

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.980
but this on this unknown quantity with when it comes to Apple hardware where

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:06.260
One one line of one line has this feature and then the next iteration on it all of a sudden removes it and now that's

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:11.540
in a dongle it's this unpredictability of when it's gonna get updated and how much that's gonna cost and

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:16.700
There's also just the fact that businesses are looking at these things and going well, what am I getting from my purchase here?

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.860
This is an $8,000 computer when I when I build it. What am I getting out of this?

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.860
I think all of those things add up

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:29.060
All right, anything else from the mumble room before we officially consider this closed top unless something interesting develops

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:32.740
We're gonna consider this topic closed for the unplugged program going once

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:41.020
Going twice and poppy. I secretly use Arch Linux. Thank you on a macbook though, so it's fine. Yeah, ha ha ha ha

01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:45.020
He doesn't actually, he secretly uses Ubuntu Mate, but we'll just call it that

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:48.060
Yeah, it's not so secret anymore

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:54.220
Alright, that'll bring us to the end of this week's unplugged. We're gonna get out here a little early this week

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.020
because once this show ends we redress the set and

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:04.500
And the next episode of tech snaps getting recorded check out Wes on the new tech snap what?

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:07.540
Yeah, also recording on Tuesdays after unplugged at least for now

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:13.700
So you can show up listen to the unplugged program live hang out stick around and catch a live tech snap

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:15.820
How about that for a double ender?

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:17.740
