WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
Hey, Popeye, do you have cupcakes ready? Are you celebrating the 10th birthday or the 11th birthday?

00:05.360 --> 00:11.040
It's the 11th birthday of Ubuntu over at OMG Ubuntu. They have a picture of Ubuntu cupcakes up.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.400
They look pretty good.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.200
They say it's been 11 years and 22 releases of Ubuntu since Mark Sutter sat down

00:17.200 --> 00:20.080
and typed the first ever Ubuntu announcement. Of course, in there

00:20.960 --> 00:24.400
he says, an extraordinary breadth of Debian with a fast and easy install,

00:24.400 --> 00:27.680
regular releases every six months, a tight selection of excellent packages installed by

00:27.680 --> 00:32.080
default, and a commitment to security updates with 18 months of security and technical support

00:32.080 --> 00:37.840
for every release. And the first version I think I ever tried was Ubuntu 4.10.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.280
And I remember very, very, very, very much embarrassingly one of the very,

00:43.840 --> 00:48.160
very first big pieces of feedback we ever got on the Linux action show, one of my first nice

00:48.160 --> 00:55.440
public screw ups was about Ubuntu. First of all, the name Ubuntu, Ubuntu. But the other one was,

00:55.440 --> 01:00.480
and I just was a total brain fart, is we couldn't figure out what the versioning system meant. We're

01:00.480 --> 01:05.440
like, 4.10? What is that about? And then like, we were looking at the, we just couldn't get it.

01:05.440 --> 01:10.720
We were too dumb. And then we had to get, we had to get a whole bunch of emails are like,

01:10.720 --> 01:15.760
it's based on the date, October, 2010. We're like, oh, right.

01:16.720 --> 01:21.120
And that's really bizarre because the US are the king of making stupid date formats.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.320
Yeah, that's like our thing.

01:22.320 --> 01:26.320
I know, I know. I just, it totally escaped me. And I was like, I don't get it. I don't,

01:26.320 --> 01:30.480
is it based on the Debian version? Like, I just couldn't, I just was not thinking dates

01:30.480 --> 01:31.520
for some stupid reason.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.520
Also, there's all that brown.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:35.040 --> 01:38.160
Look back on those screenshots. There's a whole hell of a lot of brown.

01:38.160 --> 01:43.680
But you know, when this ship, this is when I started running Gnome as, this is when I switched

01:43.680 --> 01:48.240
from my first time switching from KDE as a KDE user, because when I first started using Linux,

01:48.240 --> 01:52.560
I came with Frontman Drake, which was a KDE desktop. And then I went to SUSE, which was a KDE

01:52.560 --> 01:57.200
desktop. And so when I went to Ubuntu, it was also really going to Gnome 2 for the first time

01:57.200 --> 02:02.160
and finding and discovering the likey Gnome 2, which then afterwards I went away from. But I

02:02.160 --> 02:05.360
just thought that was kind of interesting too, is it's been a long time since I switched to Gnome

02:05.360 --> 02:07.280
and then went back to KDE and I'm back on Gnome.

02:08.080 --> 02:13.600
I did the same. I was on Xfce on Debian. And then when I discovered Ubuntu, I just switched

02:13.600 --> 02:16.160
to Gnome and I stayed on that until Unity came along.

02:16.160 --> 02:20.480
Yeah, I think a big part of it was what Mark says there is the selection of apps.

02:21.040 --> 02:21.520
Yep.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.080
It wasn't that uncommon back then when you installed like, you know, different. One of the

02:26.080 --> 02:29.280
things that was nice about SUSE is it was a good collection, a selection of apps. One of the nice

02:29.280 --> 02:32.800
things about Mandrake, again, a good selection of apps, but there were some distros you'd install

02:32.800 --> 02:37.280
them and they'd have like two mail clients and three web browsers and all this stuff. And Ubuntu

02:37.280 --> 02:42.880
was like one web browser, one mail client, one editor, one terminal application.

02:42.880 --> 02:43.920
Made it very stored.

02:43.920 --> 02:48.160
Distros today, though, that have multiple apps doing the same thing.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.120
Hope you guys should bring back the brown.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.040
Yeah, do a retro edition. We'll spin for it.

02:57.040 --> 03:02.960
There's a niche for some people who want an ISO image or a DVD image or, you know, a gigantic USB

03:02.960 --> 03:07.840
stick image that has everything installed. There are certainly some people who want that. But I

03:07.840 --> 03:11.920
think we, Mark, figured out early on that not everyone wanted that. People wanted it.

03:11.920 --> 03:17.280
Someone else to make an opinionated decision to say, this is the best browser, this is the best

03:17.280 --> 03:22.640
email client, this is the best text editor. Take those and then provide some way of installing

03:22.640 --> 03:27.600
other ones if you want something different. It's not like it's mandated. It's not like Chrome OS,

03:27.600 --> 03:33.840
where there is one browser and that is it. There's one browser on the ISO, but feel free to go and

03:33.840 --> 03:34.640
change it to something else.

03:34.640 --> 03:43.600
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 115, for October 20th, 2015.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is broadcasting on Back to the Future Day Eve.

03:46.000 --> 03:56.000
Man, that's heavy. My name is Chris, and I'm here to talk to you about the future of Linux Unplugged.

03:56.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm here to talk to you about the future of Linux Unplugged.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is broadcasting on Back to the Future Day Eve.

04:01.520 --> 04:05.360
Man, that's heavy. My name is Chris, and I'm here to talk to you about the future of Linux Unplugged.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.240
My name is Wes, and I'm here to talk to you about the future of Linux Unplugged.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.720
Wes, Back to the Future Eve Day is legit, right?

04:08.720 --> 04:10.000
Oh yeah, 100% legit.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.600
Okay, thank you, yeah. Everybody knows that tomorrow's the big day, but we couldn't move

04:13.600 --> 04:14.400
the show just for that.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.680
A little, you know, it's a solemn day tomorrow, but today we can be a little excited.

04:17.680 --> 04:23.600
It's a solemn day. Yeah, no, today, on Back to the Future Eve Day, we're really pumped up because

04:23.600 --> 04:27.920
we're going to do something that is a lot of fun on this particular show. We're going to have a

04:27.920 --> 04:33.280
little Lug session right here in the show for you. So think about this. If you were going to a Lug,

04:33.280 --> 04:37.440
like a good Linux user, every now and then they would have talks on how to do something,

04:37.440 --> 04:42.400
how to accomplish something under Linux. Well, today our Lug is meeting together to discuss

04:42.960 --> 04:46.640
how to do great podcasting with the Kubuntu podcast. They're five episodes into their new

04:46.640 --> 04:50.800
podcast. They've showed up here. They're going to get real wisdom advice from Poppy and Wimpy,

04:50.800 --> 04:53.520
and then Wes and I are going to throw in a few things here and there.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.400
You probably shouldn't listen, but...

04:54.400 --> 04:57.440
Mostly about the way they look. That's mostly what we're going to focus on because

04:57.440 --> 04:59.360
that's how we roll. The important stuff.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.440
Later in the show today, we're going to give a lot of love to an open source project.

05:03.440 --> 05:07.520
OpenStreetMaps is amazing, and some of the data they have is incredible,

05:07.520 --> 05:11.840
and some of the projects being built on top of that data are astounding. All of those things

05:11.840 --> 05:16.160
are true, and we're going to tell you why, point you at some tools to use that makes it even cooler,

05:16.160 --> 05:19.760
and how you can make the data even more relevant. And I'm going to tell you about the new open

05:19.760 --> 05:25.280
source project that is launching today, or actually I think this week, to really,

05:25.280 --> 05:29.840
really challenge Google Maps, and Google Maps' routing and directions and that kind of stuff.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.000
You know, the really nice stuff that you get from Google.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.200
And then at the end of the show, we got two boxes right here in studio.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.160
Ooh, special boxes.

05:38.160 --> 05:43.600
Very, very excited to say in studio with us today, we have the Steam Link and the Steam

05:43.600 --> 05:49.360
Controller, both of which I have been keeping in the box, despite my little boy inside me that

05:49.360 --> 05:50.560
wants to rip it open and play with it.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.440
That is very impressive.

05:51.440 --> 05:55.600
We're going to unbox the Steam Controller live on the show and see if we can hook it up

05:55.600 --> 06:00.720
to my rig and play Race the Sun with it. Steam Controller, Steam Link,

06:00.720 --> 06:04.320
happening up in this business right now. Very exciting. We'll be doing that.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.920
You have to stick around just for that.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.760
It's going to be a live demo fail on air, and those are always worth watching.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.600
Yeah, 90% chance it just won't work.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.360
Totally, because I've got a kernel that doesn't have support for it built in,

06:15.360 --> 06:18.480
so we're doing it live. But before we get into that,

06:18.480 --> 06:21.600
I want to do a little follow-up from this week's Linux Action Show.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.280
It was a big show. It was over a two-hour show.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.040
Ridiculous.

06:27.040 --> 06:31.280
And it was an oversized show, but we had to talk about replacing LastPass.

06:31.280 --> 06:36.160
That LastPass and getting bought out by LogMeIn basically meant it was time to find something

06:36.160 --> 06:42.080
to replace it. So we covered all these different solutions.

06:42.080 --> 06:46.640
And one story that we covered, I think it was in the feedback segment of the show,

06:46.640 --> 06:50.000
that I wanted to bring a little more attention to in this episode,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.040
is an open-foss training Indiegogo campaign.

06:53.040 --> 06:57.120
And it's pretty neat. And the guy that's working on it right now has joined us in the Mumble Room.

06:57.120 --> 07:01.440
And one of the reasons I want to bring attention to this is because actually the money is going

07:01.440 --> 07:04.240
to a good cause. So, Matthew, are you in the Mumble Room right now?

07:05.760 --> 07:06.800
Yes, I am, Chris.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.680
So tell us a little bit about why you launched an Indiegogo campaign

07:09.680 --> 07:16.880
and where the money is going towards and sort of what the end goal is here.

07:16.880 --> 07:24.000
Well, it all comes down to I want to try to improve documentation for the new user out there.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.200
I remember back in my early days and kind of running face-first into the RTFM brigade and

07:29.920 --> 07:34.640
want to make it an easier time for people who are new than what I had when I first came in.

07:34.640 --> 07:43.200
And the money is going towards building the production system I need to improve the videos

07:43.200 --> 07:53.600
I'm producing now. And kind of the big reason I'm doing the Indiegogo is a lot of people who

07:53.600 --> 08:00.560
know me through social media and the Linux ecosystem know that I've been fighting cancer

08:00.560 --> 08:08.240
for the last year and a half, two years. And so it's just my personal funds are really tight to

08:08.240 --> 08:15.040
be able to afford to pay for that. So the title is Open FOSS Training,

08:15.040 --> 08:21.840
and it's on Indiegogo, open-foss-training, and 33 days left. And $1,000 has been raised,

08:21.840 --> 08:26.800
44% funding. And I love the idea of targeting new users for this specifically kind of thing,

08:26.800 --> 08:31.920
and the money sounds like it's going to a good spot. So I will have a link in the show notes

08:31.920 --> 08:34.240
if you guys want to check it out. Yeah, definitely check it out.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.520
It's a good cause. We could definitely use more high-quality training like this.

08:37.520 --> 08:41.040
Yeah, absolutely. So good luck, sir. And thank you for letting us know about it.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.600
And stick around too, because if you're going to be doing production, today's episode is going to

08:45.600 --> 08:51.680
give you some great tips and tricks for doing that production under Linux. We're going to have an

08:51.680 --> 08:57.040
interesting discussion around that. And it's something that you guys know we have struggled with

08:57.040 --> 09:01.120
over the years, and we've done it in different approaches. We've done production under Linux,

09:01.120 --> 09:05.680
where we've gone on location and done production under Linux. We've done it where we'll work

09:06.240 --> 09:10.640
offline and do something that's post-edited and put together and produced under Linux.

09:10.640 --> 09:15.840
And each time, there is lessons we've learned, little tools that we've picked up along the way,

09:15.840 --> 09:20.240
and little things that now looking back at it, we realize, oh, we had to at least try it this way to

09:20.240 --> 09:25.360
see what worked or didn't work. And so when the guys from the Kubuntu podcast came along and they

09:25.360 --> 09:30.320
said, look, we're five episodes in, and we want to get your tips and tricks on how to produce it

09:30.320 --> 09:34.880
even better using free software, but also just some other production elements and things like that.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.680
And I thought the reason why this might be an interesting topic that's more applicable

09:39.680 --> 09:46.160
to everybody is because there is a certain set of categories of software and functionality

09:46.160 --> 09:49.200
that Linux gets a really bad rap for.

09:49.200 --> 09:49.760
Yeah, it does.

09:51.920 --> 09:57.600
And this is definitely one of them. And the truth of the matter is I actually think the state of

09:57.600 --> 10:02.320
things is better than most people think. I think over the last few years, the tools out there,

10:02.320 --> 10:06.160
some of which are not free software, but work under Linux, and some of which that are free

10:06.160 --> 10:10.720
software and work under Linux, have gotten a lot better. And I think so much so that if you knew

10:10.720 --> 10:16.000
how close they were, you might consider trying to do things differently. I'm seeing a lot of podcasts

10:16.000 --> 10:21.360
that are launching right now, especially ones that try to produce under Linux that are using tools

10:21.360 --> 10:26.800
that in my estimation are easy to use under Linux, but they do not provide a very good listening

10:26.800 --> 10:30.240
experience for the user, for the listener. Might work at first, but it's not something

10:30.240 --> 10:32.800
you want to invest in for the long haul. Yeah. And I think it's just because people

10:32.800 --> 10:36.960
are not aware of how good the state of some of these tools are and what some of the options are.

10:36.960 --> 10:41.200
So I want to talk about that a little bit today. And then I'm hoping that those of you who are

10:41.200 --> 10:44.240
maybe not interested in actually producing your own podcast or something like that,

10:44.240 --> 10:48.720
will walk away from the conversation, walk away from the discussion with a pretty good idea of

10:48.720 --> 10:52.400
the state of this for your favorite platform, because this is a pretty good measuring stick on

10:52.400 --> 10:56.720
how your platform is doing. And I'm hoping that you'll walk away with a bit of an idea

10:56.720 --> 11:01.120
of what that's like. So that's sort of my goal today when we're talking with the Ubuntu UK podcast

11:01.120 --> 11:07.600
guys and our Ubuntu Kubuntu podcast. Geez, now I'm all getting all mixed up. Wes, that's what happens

11:07.600 --> 11:10.960
because there's so many different podcasts these days. But some of them are all making the same

11:10.960 --> 11:14.880
mistake. Some of them aren't. I don't know. I don't know, Wes. It's not that we're experts on

11:14.880 --> 11:18.880
the topic, but people ask. Stay tuned. So we'll share. Chris has opinions, everyone. Turns out.

11:18.880 --> 11:23.680
And I just think like if this was a real lug, if we were really, if we were really like...

11:23.680 --> 11:27.360
We are a real lug. I know. There you go. Thank you. Come on. I don't need this attitude. Thank you,

11:27.360 --> 11:32.240
sir. Because, OK, what I meant to say is if we were meeting in a place like a building and we

11:32.240 --> 11:37.120
were doing like on a Tuesday night once a month, this would come up. This would be something. Also,

11:37.120 --> 11:40.560
there's other things like workflow things we could talk about. So I think this is an interesting

11:40.560 --> 11:44.320
idea. The more practical side. Bring something into the lug and we'll talk about it. We could

11:44.320 --> 11:48.960
do this every now and then. That's a great idea. Now we have our lug sessions on Tuesdays,

11:48.960 --> 11:52.320
every single Tuesday, but maybe once a month we could do something like this. Yeah. It's

11:52.320 --> 11:55.760
a possibility. It's an idea to play with. I'm just putting it out there. I'm an idea guy.

11:55.760 --> 11:59.680
All right. Let me tell you about another idea. DigitalOcean. Go over to digitalocean.com and use

11:59.680 --> 12:04.320
our promo code DOUNPLUGGED to get a $10 credit. DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider

12:04.320 --> 12:08.320
dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up an awesome Linux rig. And

12:08.320 --> 12:13.200
Wes, I don't care if they have FreeBSD. I don't want you looking at it. That's hard to stop.

12:13.200 --> 12:18.640
Listen, here's what I did. I went over to DigitalOcean. I deployed in like less than 55 seconds

12:18.640 --> 12:23.360
an Ubuntu droplet, a run and sync thing for me. I've got a run and sync thing and a couple other

12:23.360 --> 12:26.320
things that are doing my password management. I'm not telling you about these other things,

12:26.320 --> 12:29.680
Wes. I'm going to say it's GPG and stuff like that, but you knock it off. Stop pressing me

12:29.680 --> 12:33.840
for information. Chris, what kind of connectivity do you have on there? Oh my God, it's so fast.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.360
I'm glad you asked. That's just the great kind of question there, Wes, because I'll tell you what,

12:37.360 --> 12:41.200
I put it in San Francisco, but they got data centers in New York, Singapore, Amsterdam,

12:41.200 --> 12:47.040
London, Toronto. Yeah, I got 512 megabytes of RAM. It's a brand new one in Toronto, 20 gigabyte SSD,

12:48.160 --> 12:54.640
one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer. A terabyte of transfer. And I tell you what, I tell you what,

12:54.640 --> 12:58.880
I have never hit test ceiling. I tried to use it. It's hard to hit. Yeah, and they got a great

12:58.880 --> 13:02.720
interface too. It makes it really easy to manage all of this, but yet extremely powerful and a

13:02.720 --> 13:06.160
straightforward API. Check them out. And when you just need to go roll your own solution for

13:06.160 --> 13:10.320
something, testing, hosting, production, use back-end infrastructure, digitalocean.com,

13:10.320 --> 13:14.800
use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, and then you go deploy yourself a Linux rig up in the cloud.

13:14.800 --> 13:19.760
It's crazy fast. I love it. digitalocean.com, DOUNPLUGGED, support this show and get yourself

13:19.760 --> 13:26.080
a $10 credit. Okay, so to reset, here's how it went down. We got an email that came into the

13:26.080 --> 13:30.240
show. It says, hello, I'm one of the hosts of the Kabuntu podcast, big fan of your shows.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.840
Currently, we publish our shows only on YouTube, and it links us to that. We'll check that out in

13:33.840 --> 13:39.120
a second. It says, and sometimes audio only using Google Drive. Since we're big fans of

13:39.120 --> 13:43.280
Jupyter broadcasting, we look to you guys as mentors on how to organize our podcasts. However,

13:43.280 --> 13:47.200
there are many things we don't know or unsure how to do better. Currently, we use Google Hangouts

13:47.200 --> 13:51.280
to record our podcasts, but we're looking into OBS. Could you give us some feedback and tell us

13:51.280 --> 13:55.040
how to organize your, how you organize your podcast? Maybe a video call to discuss things

13:55.040 --> 13:59.120
in more detail. And so we talked about it, obviously off air, and we're like, yeah, we could

13:59.120 --> 14:03.920
do a video call with these guys, or we could do this in the show and just sort of share the

14:03.920 --> 14:08.000
information with everybody. And that seemed like maybe a better way to go because there's probably

14:08.000 --> 14:11.200
a lot of other people that'd be interested in this. And like I said earlier, it's sort of a

14:11.200 --> 14:17.360
state of affairs of where Linux is at. So it's the Kabuntu podcast, and I'll pull up just a couple

14:17.360 --> 14:24.880
of seconds of episode five. Glad you can join us. My name is Rick Timmis. I'm Ovidio Florin.

14:24.880 --> 14:29.680
Aaron Honeycutt.

14:29.680 --> 14:36.160
And Aaron is joining us as well. Aaron Honeycutt. Okay, so I'm just grabbing that cup of coffee

14:36.160 --> 14:39.440
there and having a quick look at the show notes. So we've got a few things coming up for you. We've

14:39.440 --> 14:43.520
got a special guest coming up on the show a little bit later, so do stay with us.

14:43.520 --> 14:48.080
And they had a guest on which you said was from the Kabuntu project, correct? Or was that right?

14:48.080 --> 14:49.440
I believe it was a KDE dev.

14:49.440 --> 14:53.680
Oh, KDE dev. That's right. Yes. So it's an interesting idea. And it's obviously an area

14:53.680 --> 14:57.840
that could definitely have its own podcast when you're a KDE fan. That's really cool.

14:57.840 --> 15:02.320
So we have two gentlemen on from the show. Guys, welcome to Linux Unplugged. It's good

15:02.320 --> 15:02.960
to have you here.

15:04.080 --> 15:04.480
Thank you.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.520
Absolutely, absolutely. And what are your names?

15:08.640 --> 15:12.640
I'm Ovidio, but my full first name is Ovidio Florin.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.880
And we have also...

15:16.640 --> 15:17.520
I'm Aaron.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.080
Hello, Aaron.

15:18.080 --> 15:18.640
Greetings.

15:18.640 --> 15:24.480
So, guys, a couple of things. First of all, thanks for emailing in and reaching out. And

15:24.480 --> 15:28.000
it's cool that you guys are starting a new show. And so both Wes and I checked you out

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
before you came on today. And I know some of your general questions were around actual

15:34.000 --> 15:38.160
organizing the podcast itself. And I wanted to start there, but I also want to start talking

15:38.160 --> 15:42.400
about some of the software and tools you guys use. And anybody's welcome to jump in from

15:42.400 --> 15:48.720
the Mumble Room and go along. But I'll jump in. I want to say, you know, congrats for

15:48.720 --> 15:50.160
just getting off the ground and doing it.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.160
Yeah, definitely. That's the hardest step right there.

15:52.160 --> 15:57.440
It really is. And the fact that you did it five times in a row is exceptionally harder

15:57.440 --> 16:02.400
than you'd think it would be to get several people together at the same time five times

16:02.400 --> 16:08.640
in a row. So congrats on that. You probably got from my intro that I teased earlier. I'm

16:08.640 --> 16:16.560
not a huge fan of podcasts that are using Google Hangouts. And some of my favorite podcasters,

16:16.560 --> 16:24.480
unfortunately, and they make plenty of money, use Google Hangouts. I just happen to think

16:24.480 --> 16:28.640
it sounds horrible. And so I'm just going to start right there. Actually, here's the

16:28.640 --> 16:31.600
bigger picture that I wanted to bring to you guys. So you're thinking about where to organize

16:31.600 --> 16:34.320
the podcast. One of the first things that came up when we started talking about your

16:34.320 --> 16:39.680
podcast in the pre-show with the guys in the Mumble Room, where do I find an MP3 for download?

16:39.680 --> 16:44.580
And so your show here is an hour and five minutes long. And so the number one question

16:44.580 --> 16:51.080
I would ask you is who is the target audience? Is it people on YouTube or is it actually

16:51.080 --> 16:55.320
people that maybe would be commuting that are more likely to listen to longer form content?

16:55.320 --> 16:58.400
The answer is probably somewhere in between. There's some on YouTube, but there's probably

16:58.400 --> 17:03.360
a lot more for a show that's an hour long that are probably more likely to listen. So

17:03.360 --> 17:10.120
in my estimation, there is a bit of a mismatch because the people that are likely to consume

17:10.120 --> 17:13.600
your type of content are more likely not to be staring at the screen for that long.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.600
They're probably working on something else. They need background.

17:15.600 --> 17:20.200
Yeah. For example, like Wes wanted to listen on his drive up here today. And how did you

17:20.200 --> 17:21.200
pull that off?

17:21.200 --> 17:25.320
Well, since you guys have it on YouTube, I was able to use YouTube DL, download it and

17:25.320 --> 17:32.160
extract the MP3. But I'm in the whatever 2% of people who know how to do that. And I enjoyed

17:32.160 --> 17:33.160
listening to it.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.480
And how did you get it on your phone?

17:34.480 --> 17:36.840
And then I, well, I use Netcat, but that's another story.

17:36.840 --> 17:37.840
There you go.

17:37.840 --> 17:43.720
Right, right. But if there's an easy download link, then that could go a long way for discoverability.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.400
So there's a couple of things that jump out at me. I don't think the Google Hangouts audio

17:46.400 --> 17:50.920
quality is very good. I think it's worse than Skype and worse than Mumble.

17:50.920 --> 17:55.280
I think it's also seemingly exceptionally bad with connection problems. Other platforms

17:55.280 --> 17:57.280
seem to do a little bit better with spotty connections.

17:57.280 --> 18:02.440
Yeah, for sure. So just from that very beginning standpoint, that would be sort of the first

18:02.440 --> 18:07.400
thing that jumps out at me. Now, if your audience is YouTube, then I would say stick with it

18:07.400 --> 18:10.400
and just keep refining it a bit.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.480
And then the other thing is, is there's other solutions that maybe would have less latency

18:13.480 --> 18:18.320
too, depending on your connections. So that would be sort of my first impressions. And

18:18.320 --> 18:22.680
then the second impression walking away from that would be, if possible, and this might

18:22.680 --> 18:28.280
take maybe another dozen episodes or so where it's worth the investment, if possible, it

18:28.280 --> 18:33.000
would also be really nice if everybody had the same microphone as I smack Wes's microphone,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.800
which is identical to my microphone, but I just smacked it. Because one of the things

18:35.800 --> 18:38.920
that's damaged now, one of the things that jumps out at me is there's quite a bit of

18:38.920 --> 18:41.200
difference in the different persons presented.

18:41.200 --> 18:48.160
This is the Kubuntu podcast. Glad you can join us. My name is Rick Timmis.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.000
I'm Ovidiu Florin.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.560
Aaron Honeyfoot.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.860
And Aaron is joining us as well. Aaron.

18:56.860 --> 19:02.320
So it's not bad, but there is a noticeable difference between the mics. So that was,

19:02.320 --> 19:06.740
so I guess my question to you would be consider that and you don't have to answer me right

19:06.740 --> 19:12.080
now, but it's just something to think about is if you want people maybe listening on the

19:12.080 --> 19:15.640
road more or people on YouTube and then target it towards that.

19:15.640 --> 19:19.920
There's also the problem of the environment. For example, right there, I was in Berlin

19:19.920 --> 19:26.800
with the KD sprint, so my feedback was way off.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.000
You could tell that you were in a larger echo-y room.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Yeah.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.400
Rick has his home studio. I also have some kind of setup at home, but still we need to

19:34.400 --> 19:35.800
work on that and improve it.

19:35.800 --> 19:40.040
Yeah, that's kind of stuff that you just work out over time. You know, you guys will refine

19:40.040 --> 19:43.760
that over time. That's pretty normal when you start out figuring out what sounds good

19:43.760 --> 19:47.080
and what works good. And you know, you get surprised about what it'll throw off a webcam

19:47.080 --> 19:52.120
or throw off a mic. But the reason why I brought it up now is because you're early enough in,

19:52.120 --> 19:56.800
you could decide to double down on the audio quality or you could decide to double down

19:56.800 --> 20:00.880
on the video production, but you kind of have a couple, you're kind of at a fork in the

20:00.880 --> 20:05.280
road. So it'd be a good time to think about how you consume podcasts and how the target

20:05.280 --> 20:10.960
audience that you, how they might consume podcasts, and then deliver it to them that

20:10.960 --> 20:11.960
way.

20:11.960 --> 20:15.640
I mean, this is one thing to consider is putting out as an RSS download so that way it's easy

20:15.640 --> 20:17.360
to throw in a podcast catcher.

20:17.360 --> 20:22.680
Well, basically we just need the video mostly just for some screen sharing so we can do

20:22.680 --> 20:27.200
some presentations. Hey, this is how the app works. This is how it looks or some kind of

20:27.200 --> 20:32.480
what's new and all that. But to show ourselves, that's not really very important.

20:32.480 --> 20:38.240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I tend to agree. That's usually my approach as well. Just in how I

20:38.240 --> 20:43.320
implement it tends to be a little bit different. So guys, that was sort of my opening impressions

20:43.320 --> 20:47.080
and stuff like that. But if you have any specific questions, feel free to throw them out there.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.480
I can jump in with some other things, but I'm sure there must be some things that are

20:50.480 --> 20:53.600
kicking around in your minds.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.360
Microphone choice to begin with.

20:55.360 --> 21:00.560
That's always a really hard question. So the microphone thing is really going to depend

21:00.560 --> 21:06.680
on how much money you can spend. But you know, what I would say is get something in USB and

21:06.680 --> 21:10.880
there are some pretty good ones out there. We did about a month ago a Linux action show

21:10.880 --> 21:16.360
where we linked to a bunch of stuff. I like the USB stuff. I don't like coming in over

21:16.360 --> 21:22.080
the sound interface. And there's better mics than the RODE Podcaster out there, but the

21:22.080 --> 21:25.080
RODE Podcaster is a pretty good one for vocals.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.080
One that works on Linux.

21:26.080 --> 21:31.560
Yeah, that works on Linux. Yeah. But we also linked to like some Audio Technica.

21:31.560 --> 21:36.320
I bought that Audio Technica one that you linked to. Linux support is flawless. It just shows

21:36.320 --> 21:37.320
up as a new sound device.

21:37.320 --> 21:41.680
Yes, and that's absolutely a good one. Or you can go all the way in and get an XLR mic

21:41.680 --> 21:45.720
that comes in through a USB audio interface. The mic question is kind of tough too because

21:45.720 --> 21:55.560
it kind of depends on your voice a bit. So I would just say my floor would be no headsets,

21:55.560 --> 22:00.360
no headphones that are like the mic for your phone. No, what do you call those? Just like

22:00.360 --> 22:02.160
you know, the ones that are built in.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.240
Those are terrible. Worse than webcam.

22:04.240 --> 22:10.840
Right. And no webcam audio. Yeah. So no headsets, no webcam audio, and you know, the cell phone

22:10.840 --> 22:13.800
things. Yeah, there you go. Rekai links to it. It was Linux Media Production. It was

22:13.800 --> 22:20.160
Linux Action Show Episode 355. And we linked to the pre-Sonos hardware. I also linked to

22:20.160 --> 22:24.480
the microphone that I do use. Because I'd like to tell you, I mean the audio, so it's

22:24.480 --> 22:28.480
the Audio Technica, but I'd like to say, you know, get a much nicer microphone. But you

22:28.480 --> 22:30.960
just get whatever you can afford to get.

22:30.960 --> 22:34.760
Maybe put a link to that show, that episode in the show notes, to this one.

22:34.760 --> 22:40.880
You will find it in the show notes, sir. You will. Yeah. And there's other people in there

22:40.880 --> 22:43.600
recommending. Now, Popi and Wimpy, you guys jump out. Do you guys have specific microphones

22:43.600 --> 22:48.320
that you use on your shows that you're big advocates of? Or where do you fall down there?

22:48.320 --> 22:50.440
Well, I know you hate my microphone.

22:50.440 --> 22:54.520
No, I like your mic. No, I like yours. You have the snowball and you're the one person

22:54.520 --> 22:55.520
who thinks it sounds good.

22:55.520 --> 22:56.520
Oh, the snowball. Nice.

22:56.520 --> 22:59.880
He's the one person I think sounds all right. I don't know. Must just be, I think it's his

22:59.880 --> 23:02.000
lovely voice. I think that's what it is.

23:02.000 --> 23:10.080
Oh, thank you so much. So I, you know, when we started the Ubuntu podcast, eight years

23:10.080 --> 23:15.480
ago or so, we thought long and hard about what hardware to buy and what to do. And we

23:15.480 --> 23:19.200
were all sat in the same room. So it was very different, you know, because we all drove

23:19.200 --> 23:26.800
to one location. Now that we're doing it online, and we're using things like mumble or Skype,

23:26.800 --> 23:31.440
and you know, recording locally and editing and all that kind of stuff is quite a burden.

23:31.440 --> 23:39.680
So you know, while I agree with Chris that it would be preferable to use better tools

23:39.680 --> 23:48.840
and to create audio that that you can put on a stream or on a an RSS feed like a traditional

23:48.840 --> 23:53.280
podcast so other people can get it very easily and download it and consume it in the way

23:53.280 --> 23:58.680
they want to rather than having to watch a YouTube video, right? That that puts a burden

23:58.680 --> 24:06.480
on you. And you you have to commit to a certain amount of time each week or every other week

24:06.480 --> 24:13.640
or every month or however often your release schedule is to actually record it, edit it,

24:13.640 --> 24:18.840
fix the audio and publish it. And that's quite commitment.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.800
It really is. And so you're saying anything you can do to make it easier if it's Google

24:21.800 --> 24:24.000
Hangouts is okay?

24:24.000 --> 24:30.940
Well, I'm not necessarily I I would do whatever you can to make it easier. But don't compromise

24:30.940 --> 24:34.320
on the quality. I mean, you can compromise on the quality to some degree. And you can

24:34.320 --> 24:38.800
apologize to your listeners because we've done this when you screw up the audio every

24:38.800 --> 24:47.840
week we do. Yep. But but you know, it's worth making some effort because you know, there

24:47.840 --> 24:54.120
are some podcasts that I've watched and listened to where I can't even get more than 60 seconds

24:54.120 --> 24:59.600
in and I just think screw this. This is terrible. I'm not wasting my time with this. Not because

24:59.600 --> 25:04.960
the content is terrible, but because the audio is now I sound like a massive jerk or I sound

25:04.960 --> 25:12.520
like an audiophile. I'm not that guy who has a vinyl record player on yeah, it's not that

25:12.520 --> 25:17.420
guy. No, but it's just you know, when when you don't take enough care to make it even

25:17.420 --> 25:20.000
listenable. It's awful for your listeners.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.520
So the thing I think the thing that you said in there that's buried that if I was a new

25:23.520 --> 25:29.860
podcaster that I might not have pulled out is you can get away with so much if you're

25:29.860 --> 25:34.480
locally recording everybody's audio, because then if you had to you could do the intermediary

25:34.480 --> 25:37.900
call could be a phone call. And you could you know, if they're if they're off in some

25:37.900 --> 25:42.840
weird place, as long as they're recording local rich mic audio, and then some some poor

25:42.840 --> 25:47.040
schmuck has to edit it all together. I love you him. It has to edit it all together on

25:47.040 --> 25:52.280
the back end. That is it is nice because it doesn't matter if Hangouts sounds like a robot.

25:52.280 --> 25:56.180
It doesn't matter if Skype drops you doesn't matter if mumble got weird, because you're

25:56.180 --> 25:59.720
recording locally. And in the end, it all comes together sounding very nicely. And that

25:59.720 --> 26:03.880
is a very nice way to come across. Now that is that is more like you know, you're going

26:03.880 --> 26:07.000
for your audio listeners, you're going for people that are listening with headphones,

26:07.000 --> 26:10.600
they're listening in their car with nice speakers, or their computer with nice speakers. And

26:10.600 --> 26:15.880
so you know, your target audience is a little more refined. I don't know if that is as important

26:15.880 --> 26:21.040
when you're when you're targeting video, but wimpy you what was it six months ago upgraded

26:21.040 --> 26:24.800
your microphone kind of re looked into your audio setup. Have you kind of walked away

26:24.800 --> 26:29.320
with any thoughts after it's been a little while you've been using the setup for a bit?

26:29.320 --> 26:35.160
Yeah, yeah. So around the start of the year, I changed my setup. And I've changed it twice

26:35.160 --> 26:40.520
since actually. So Popey invited me on to the open to podcast to stand in for a couple

26:40.520 --> 26:44.600
of episodes. And I thought I better make an effort and you know, put my best foot forward.

26:44.600 --> 26:49.680
So I went and got all my old junk out of the lot and lashed it together with bits of string.

26:49.680 --> 26:57.340
That's your best one! Well those two things don't align!

26:57.340 --> 27:02.680
So that's what I was using was basically a load of gear that I had from when I was a

27:02.680 --> 27:08.060
musician years and years ago, that I kind of made work. But the problem with that was

27:08.060 --> 27:13.240
is that each time I recorded, I had to keep messing about with the levels and the settings

27:13.240 --> 27:21.680
before I went on because it was so old and busted that it was a real faff. So about two

27:21.680 --> 27:28.540
months ago, I got myself a Blue Yeti mic, which like he was saying is just a simple

27:28.540 --> 27:35.320
USB connection. All the knobs and the levels actually on the mic itself. So I don't mess

27:35.320 --> 27:40.120
about with the mixer on the PC. You just you know, you just turn up every week and you

27:40.120 --> 27:45.680
know, it's going to sound like the week it did before. So that's what I'm using now.

27:45.680 --> 27:50.680
And that has an added advantage in that we're all off to Ogg camp at the end of the month

27:50.680 --> 27:56.040
and we're actually going to record a couple of shows whilst we're away together. And I'm

27:56.040 --> 28:00.280
going to take the Blue Yeti with me and you know, because it's got multiple recording

28:00.280 --> 28:04.480
modes, can actually use it as a traveling mic.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.920
You can adjust I guess like the recording capsule there so it can do direct capture

28:07.920 --> 28:11.720
or it can go into room mode or it can do like a figure eight or whatever.

28:11.720 --> 28:12.720
Yeah, that's fancy.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.720
Yeah, that does make it nice for group interviews and whatnot.

28:15.720 --> 28:20.920
So they're slightly more expensive. But if you, you know, use camel camel camel to watch

28:20.920 --> 28:26.840
them on Amazon, they drop down to sort of the sort of 80-85 pound mark every so often.

28:26.840 --> 28:30.120
So they're kind of a bargain when they get down to that price.

28:30.120 --> 28:34.840
Yeah, I think actually, though, the truth of the matter is, is you can kind of get it

28:34.840 --> 28:39.120
just right. But then, I mean, once you get it set, it's pretty much ran for you, right?

28:39.120 --> 28:40.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:40.120 --> 28:46.360
Yeah. Yeah, that is, that's the nice thing. There's a little bit of troubleshooting upfront.

28:46.360 --> 28:51.760
And the only other thing I would say is that I only listen to podcasts that I can subscribe

28:51.760 --> 28:58.280
to with a podcatcher. So I might watch the odd thing on YouTube, but I don't regularly

28:58.280 --> 29:03.040
watch the stuff that I subscribe to on YouTube because it doesn't have that same, like if

29:03.040 --> 29:08.120
I'm cooking in the evening, I might have a podcast going, and then I pause it whilst

29:08.120 --> 29:12.880
I do something else outside or, you know, do something with the family, come back and

29:12.880 --> 29:17.280
start it again. And it's that, you know, stop start nature. And that doesn't work so well.

29:17.280 --> 29:18.280
Yes, yes.

29:18.280 --> 29:19.280
You know, with YouTube.

29:19.280 --> 29:24.800
I'm the same way while I drive. I'll listen. And when I when I get there, I got with them

29:24.800 --> 29:29.320
with my new vehicle, too. It's I finally have I've reached the new age where it actually

29:29.320 --> 29:30.320
uses Bluetooth audio.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.320
Don't you love that?

29:31.320 --> 29:32.560
Oh, my gosh, it's so great.

29:32.560 --> 29:36.520
Your phone stays in your pocket. You just hit the button really makes it brings my podcast

29:36.520 --> 29:41.000
listening up to an entirely new level because it is just as approachable as the radio. I

29:41.000 --> 29:44.740
turn on the vehicle and the podcast resumes. Exactly. And then and the other nice thing

29:44.740 --> 29:49.000
is it doesn't stop playing until I open the door so I can park the vehicle, turn it off

29:49.000 --> 29:52.260
and I can listen for a few minutes while they complete their thought. And then I open the

29:52.260 --> 29:58.840
door and it pauses. And I just love that. And so for me, it has made and the other thing

29:58.840 --> 30:05.760
I do is I listen at bedtime. I sometimes listen to podcasts at bedtime. So I have I have podcasts

30:05.760 --> 30:09.400
that I listen to that make me sleepy. Yep. That I have good information, but they make

30:09.400 --> 30:13.360
me sleep. And I believe Popeye listens to one of them, too. It's it's the it's the talk

30:13.360 --> 30:17.100
show and I'll sometimes listen to it literally to just to fall asleep. It's it's brilliant

30:17.100 --> 30:18.100
for that.

30:18.100 --> 30:21.160
Great. This is very distracting. You don't worry about all the problems in the morning.

30:21.160 --> 30:25.000
He just kind of drones on in his Gruber kind of way. And I don't really quite care what

30:25.000 --> 30:28.480
he's talking about. So it's perfect to fall asleep to. And then I have other shows that

30:28.480 --> 30:34.220
keep me awake and amped up and listening while I'm driving. And so for me, I have the same

30:34.220 --> 30:38.160
threshold that Wimpy does is it's got to have an RSS feed because I got to be able to subscribe

30:38.160 --> 30:42.600
to it on my phone because this is pretty much I'm listening to shows now. I will watch the

30:42.600 --> 30:47.840
one off, you know, on YouTube from time to time. But I am much more apt to if I can put

30:47.840 --> 30:51.960
it on my phone, I will even if I'm not listening weekly, I'll download a few of them and then

30:51.960 --> 30:54.280
bang through them when I know I'm going to be on the road for a while.

30:54.280 --> 30:57.360
As someone who doesn't use RSS feeds very much, but does listen to podcasts, I will

30:57.360 --> 31:02.100
also say that any time that you can take out of that process is helpful. Like, you know,

31:02.100 --> 31:04.760
it's the worst when I'm sitting in my car and I'm trying to download it and the link

31:04.760 --> 31:07.960
isn't obvious. And it's like, I just want this to download so I can listen to it on

31:07.960 --> 31:12.760
my drive. Right. Even if it's not RSS, if you can just make it simple, that goes away.

31:12.760 --> 31:16.520
And Lord, you wanted to jump in with a mic that you think is pretty great. And I'll let

31:16.520 --> 31:22.840
you get a plug in for that as we kind of wrap up the mic question. You still have it? No,

31:22.840 --> 31:25.880
he moved on. All right. He left in the chat room for those of you that want to jump back.

31:25.880 --> 31:31.600
All right. So guys, Kubota Podcast, guys, any other questions about the show itself?

31:31.600 --> 31:35.960
I could talk a little bit about organizing and planning for the show. I know you guys

31:35.960 --> 31:40.600
have some kind of a dedicated machine for recording or something like that. How does

31:40.600 --> 31:45.680
that set up work? For example, I don't know if you have OBS on it and you record. I know

31:45.680 --> 31:50.160
you have some weird controller that you just switch screens and all that. Well, if you

31:50.160 --> 31:54.800
want to go down the rabbit hole. Yeah, this is a boy. This is quite the rabbit hole. If

31:54.800 --> 31:57.800
you're going to do it right, you need two machines. That's why I say it's a rabbit

31:57.800 --> 32:03.240
hole. So in front of me right now, I've got two systems. One is an OBS system and one

32:03.240 --> 32:08.280
is a Wirecast system. The Wirecast system is sort of our legacy system because it has

32:08.280 --> 32:15.920
to run on the Mac OS of tens. And it is sort of a all in one. It does what a $15,000 hardware

32:15.920 --> 32:21.920
video mixer does, only it does it for $1,000. So it does the video feed mixing so it can

32:21.920 --> 32:30.560
pull in USB video at 30 frames per second with PC desktop video working at 60 frames

32:30.560 --> 32:36.720
per second with HDMI video working at 30 frames per second. And then it can also pull in live

32:36.720 --> 32:40.720
screen captures, encode all of that in real time, send it up to Ustream, send it up to

32:40.720 --> 32:47.120
Scale Engine and also write a lossless ProRes file to a RAID 0 drive array at the same time.

32:47.120 --> 32:52.560
So it's a nice piece of gear and it's being very, very, very quickly replaced by OBS.

32:52.560 --> 32:56.040
And so right now on the other machine, on a much, much smaller machine, on a much weaker

32:56.040 --> 33:00.460
machine, we're able to accomplish a lot of the same stuff that we do in Wirecast on a

33:00.460 --> 33:05.640
freaking NUC because when you move over to OBS and when you move over to Linux, you are

33:05.640 --> 33:09.840
gifted in a ton of overhead of performance. And so one of the things that we are moving

33:09.840 --> 33:14.880
towards is a setup where a lot of that stuff going out to the stream endpoints, the recording

33:14.880 --> 33:21.840
to a lossless file, the recording to a regular file will happen under OBS and eventually

33:21.840 --> 33:26.120
OBS will sit in front of the Wirecast rig. Right now OBS is behind the Wirecast rig and

33:26.120 --> 33:30.320
supplies Wirecast with a certain set different amounts of feeds like rerun feeds, station

33:30.320 --> 33:35.180
identification feeds, kind of things like for like a screen capture feed, things like

33:35.180 --> 33:40.080
that that are sent by OBS into Wirecast and the Wirecast goes out to the web. Now probably

33:40.080 --> 33:43.380
at some point we'll reverse that and then at some point completely replace Wirecast

33:43.380 --> 33:47.560
altogether. It doesn't do everything. OBS doesn't handle everything like streaming to

33:47.560 --> 33:51.160
three or four different endpoints at the same time. It doesn't really do that. If that's

33:51.160 --> 33:55.320
not something you're worried about, then that's not really an issue. OBS isn't, we're not

33:55.320 --> 33:59.400
quite sure. We haven't totally tested its lossless yet file recording but it seems to

33:59.400 --> 34:03.960
be there for different formats. So there's some stuff you can do with OBS today that

34:03.960 --> 34:09.120
even back in January, we couldn't do yet. And so a lot of people have sort of opted

34:09.120 --> 34:13.080
to use Google Hangouts or they've opted to use something else completely different and

34:13.080 --> 34:17.520
I would invite them to check OBS out again because the one thing that is true is that

34:17.520 --> 34:23.480
since Linux Fest Northwest in April, we have been using OBS in production every single

34:23.480 --> 34:29.000
day in some capacity, to some degree. And in some cases we produce entire shows now

34:29.000 --> 34:32.880
using OBS. There's been some recent episodes of the Linux Action Show where the entire

34:32.880 --> 34:39.720
thing was recorded, the shots were done, all of it was done in OBS, no Wirecast, no Mac

34:39.720 --> 34:43.920
needed at all. And so it's getting really, really close. There's just a few areas we

34:43.920 --> 34:49.840
keep running into and we keep working on those. So I would say if you were, if I was starting

34:49.840 --> 34:55.200
out today, I would probably build the entire thing around OBS and just sort of, because

34:55.200 --> 35:00.600
I would imagine its limitations would not be outpaced by my noobness. Like my noobness

35:00.600 --> 35:04.640
would still be behind what OBS's limitations are. The problem is, is right now, is we're

35:04.640 --> 35:08.760
coming to OBS from this perspective of a ton of functionality and a ton of expectations

35:08.760 --> 35:12.120
and it's just not meeting all of them yet. But if I didn't have all those expectations

35:12.120 --> 35:15.480
and all those needs, and if my expectations were much simpler, OBS would be doing the

35:15.480 --> 35:16.480
job. Does that make sense?

35:16.480 --> 35:19.880
Yeah, you could grow with OBS. And I have to say the thing about it, just watching you

35:19.880 --> 35:24.640
guys use OBS, it's already grown a lot. And I think the more people we can bring on board

35:24.640 --> 35:28.920
and support it, then it will really become a great community tool to make these kind

35:28.920 --> 35:29.920
of podcasts.

35:29.920 --> 35:34.080
Yeah. Rekai says if you have trouble finding OBS for Linux on their distro, have a look

35:34.080 --> 35:40.280
for Open Broadcaster Multi-Platform, as that's actually the name of the rewrite, is multi...

35:40.280 --> 35:41.280
Multi-platform.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.720
Yeah, Open Broadcaster Multi-Platform.

35:43.720 --> 35:48.600
We've tried it, I think, last week or two weeks ago, and we've done some experimenting

35:48.600 --> 35:54.080
with streaming directly to YouTube, so we don't have a streaming server. And it worked

35:54.080 --> 35:58.840
really well, but when I clicked the record button, everything just froze. My whole desk

35:58.840 --> 35:59.840
almost...

35:59.840 --> 36:04.680
Yeah, that does happen, yeah. Boy, isn't that a monster. And you know what it is, it's probably

36:04.680 --> 36:08.600
some library, something underneath that OBS isn't working right with, and it really is

36:08.600 --> 36:12.000
a pain in the ass. But when you dial it in just right and you finally get it working,

36:12.000 --> 36:15.680
the nice thing you're gonna get by that is you're gonna have a local file. And that local

36:15.680 --> 36:19.940
file is very easy to strip the audio out of, so you can release an MP3 version. It's very

36:19.940 --> 36:25.400
easy to go directly to an MP4 file and post that up for download somewhere or a WebM file.

36:25.400 --> 36:31.540
I mean, the thing is, is just by mixing locally in OBS versus using Hangouts, you make it

36:31.540 --> 36:35.760
accessible to an entire different category of audience. And that's the category of audience

36:35.760 --> 36:40.160
that's gonna be your passionate long-term subscribers who are gonna be your foundation.

36:40.160 --> 36:45.720
So it is totally worth the technical trials, even if it's gonna mean you try it on a different

36:45.720 --> 36:52.920
distro, you try it on Ubuntu LTS versus Ubuntu 1510 versus Ubuntu Studio versus Arch. You

36:52.920 --> 36:56.320
try it on the different distros to see which, because the truth of the matter is, one of

36:56.320 --> 37:02.600
the mixes, it will work. It just, like what we do here is over there, that is an Archbox

37:02.600 --> 37:07.440
running a very fixed set of packages. And it's running the GNOME 3 desktop because that's

37:07.440 --> 37:11.220
the desktop I prefer. It's not the best desktop for production, but it's the one I prefer.

37:11.220 --> 37:15.600
It's running Arch, and we just simply don't install updates.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.600
It stays.

37:16.600 --> 37:20.100
And it just runs. And in six months, we'll replace it with a fully up-to-date box that's

37:20.100 --> 37:21.100
been tested.

37:21.100 --> 37:25.200
So we need a perfect Linux broadcast container that can just be distributed.

37:25.200 --> 37:30.240
Exactly. Yeah, Docker could very well help with this problem, too. So truth be told is

37:30.240 --> 37:35.980
we found the best combination was Arch, and then you don't change it. Because when you're

37:35.980 --> 37:42.520
working on this kind of stuff, a lot of the different software depends on the latest changes

37:42.520 --> 37:46.360
to FFmpeg, the latest capabilities of this. Like when we want to build a stream to multiple

37:46.360 --> 37:50.600
destinations, we're literally just waiting for final bits of code to be written. So to

37:50.600 --> 37:55.760
be running on a version of FFmpeg that's a year old is just not even an option for us.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.100
It's unusable.

37:57.100 --> 38:01.200
So you got to play with that. That is the definite downside to production under Linux

38:01.200 --> 38:10.200
is if this was the Mac unplugged show, I would say, yeah, don't install Capitan. Just install

38:10.200 --> 38:15.000
Mavericks and go get Wirecast, and you're good to go. Oh, yeah, you're going to be out

38:15.000 --> 38:20.320
$2,500 for the computer and $1,000 for Wirecast, but you'll be good to go.

38:20.320 --> 38:27.920
But the thing is, is that locks you into buying that new Mac every couple of years. It locks

38:27.920 --> 38:32.280
you into doing the OS X upgrades, and it locks you into buying the $500 Wirecast upgrades

38:32.280 --> 38:36.460
every year. And it is just a cycle that is unneeded because the open source stuff is

38:36.460 --> 38:42.360
super close. It's getting there. So yeah, I would say stick with OBS.

38:42.360 --> 38:46.520
That's why I also asked about the dedicated machine. Should we have... I saw you have

38:46.520 --> 38:52.560
a NUC, and I know they're really powerful, so I was thinking maybe we can invest in one

38:52.560 --> 38:57.920
and just use that one for the recording. But I don't know how would we stream, for example,

38:57.920 --> 39:04.000
from my laptop to the recording machine so that that machine records the video and audio

39:04.000 --> 39:06.840
from everybody? Or how would we configure that?

39:06.840 --> 39:11.560
Yeah, definitely do a separate machine because the reason there is, is it crashes and you

39:11.560 --> 39:16.040
lose your episode. And so anything you can do to isolate and make it less likely to crash,

39:16.040 --> 39:19.600
the less things that machine is doing, the less likely you're going to lose your show.

39:19.600 --> 39:28.080
And nothing hurts more. I have done the three best Tech Talk Todays of my life. I mean really

39:28.080 --> 39:34.360
good episodes with super good mumble conversation. All three of them have been lost. And it hurts

39:34.360 --> 39:39.560
because they were really good episodes, and they've all been lost. And so the less that

39:39.560 --> 39:43.160
machine does, the less likely you're going to lose that episode. If you can have a backup

39:43.160 --> 39:47.000
recording that's good, all that kind of stuff. So the NUC, if you're using it for serious

39:47.000 --> 39:51.300
production is probably not powerful enough yet. You might want an i7 with like 16 gigs

39:51.300 --> 39:53.440
of RAM or something. I don't know. Maybe you might be able to make it work.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.920
Too big for us right now.

39:54.920 --> 39:58.520
You might be able to make it work then. Just play with it and see.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.720
We'll try different hardware, see what happens.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.000
Definitely take some tuning there, I'm sure.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.800
Yeah, you just kind of have to dial it into how much usage you guys have for it and stuff.

40:08.800 --> 40:14.460
Like all the other thing is ours runs 24-7. What was it? I'm a kind of, this is how do

40:14.460 --> 40:20.400
you send the video recordings to the separate machine. Oh, that's a good question. It depends.

40:20.400 --> 40:27.480
So sometimes it's over the network using RTSP, and sometimes it is via direct capture on

40:27.480 --> 40:34.760
HDMI. Both come in as different camera sources, HDMI and RSTP, RTMP. So yeah. All right guys,

40:34.760 --> 40:39.120
any other questions before we wrap up the segment?

40:39.120 --> 40:41.760
How do you play music during the live show?

40:41.760 --> 40:43.800
Tricks of the trade.

40:43.800 --> 40:47.800
Yeah, how do you play music or like how do you do like soundboard clips?

40:47.800 --> 40:50.800
And the value of this is negative. Get it out of here.

40:50.800 --> 40:54.260
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

40:54.260 --> 40:57.840
That is honestly, it's not that tricky. You just have a separate machine that goes into

40:57.840 --> 41:03.240
a separate input on the mixer, and I just have it dedicated and ready to go. And sometimes

41:03.240 --> 41:09.200
I have soundboard software, sometimes I use VLC. I just have, I have input seven on my

41:09.200 --> 41:13.760
mixer is dedicated to a machine that can make silly sounds when I want it.

41:13.760 --> 41:14.760
Some audience members.

41:14.760 --> 41:15.760
Get it out of here.

41:15.760 --> 41:16.760
What's that?

41:16.760 --> 41:17.760
Some audience members prefer that didn't happen.

41:17.760 --> 41:18.760
Yeah.

41:18.760 --> 41:19.760
I don't know.

41:19.760 --> 41:20.760
Exactly. Very much.

41:20.760 --> 41:21.760
But it's here to stay.

41:21.760 --> 41:30.120
On the Ubuntu podcast, we have a separate person with their own laptop and I give them

41:30.120 --> 41:35.400
signals and they press the buttons for the sounds to be played in, but it works the same

41:35.400 --> 41:39.840
way. It's like an extra person on the stream. They don't say anything. I just give them

41:39.840 --> 41:40.840
the nod.

41:40.840 --> 41:47.440
That is hilarious. So it's almost like it is like another host in a way. It's commentary

41:47.440 --> 41:48.440
in its own way.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.440
I love it.

41:49.440 --> 41:53.560
So the microphone I've got disabled on that machine, but the audio out from it plays out

41:53.560 --> 42:00.080
over mumble. So we all hear it and it gets recorded locally. So everyone records locally,

42:00.080 --> 42:09.000
including that person. So we have a separate audio file for each speaker plus that device.

42:09.000 --> 42:15.280
But it means that we all get to hear it during the recording, which is actually quite important

42:15.280 --> 42:19.280
because you can all take a breather and you can hear the stings and the bumpers and the

42:19.280 --> 42:23.720
bed that goes underneath. You can all hear it and you know when to speak and when not

42:23.720 --> 42:24.720
to.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.960
Yeah, and you get to talk to the beat and stuff like that. Yeah, that's why we do our

42:26.960 --> 42:33.680
music live too. We'll do all of the music and stuff like that live so that way we can

42:33.680 --> 42:37.400
kind of play to the music and stuff like that. And that's another nice thing about knowing

42:37.400 --> 42:41.720
you're targeting audio a little more too, is that's a lot harder when you're doing video,

42:41.720 --> 42:42.720
as it turns out.

42:42.720 --> 42:46.160
All right. Any last questions, guys?

42:46.160 --> 42:53.040
Okay, last question. How do you organize the sections and keep in time with them? Because

42:53.040 --> 42:58.200
every time we plan, okay, we finish on that time and we always get over it.

42:58.200 --> 43:05.160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, also I'll do that backwards. How do I... So what was the first

43:05.160 --> 43:06.640
part is how do I plan the segments?

43:06.640 --> 43:13.040
How do you plan the segments so that you finish each segment on time? Because we always surpass

43:13.040 --> 43:14.040
that time.

43:14.040 --> 43:15.600
Wes, what do you suppose I do?

43:15.600 --> 43:19.000
Well, I would say it helps a lot to not have a time that you're set for.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.480
That is pretty much it. I just have a pretty innate feeling for how long I have to say

43:23.480 --> 43:28.280
about something and how long the Mumble Room has to say about that thing, how long Wes

43:28.280 --> 43:32.640
or Noah or whoever it is has to say about it. And I've just kind of sussed it up and

43:32.640 --> 43:36.320
I just keep plugging content in until I'm like, well, that'll take me about 20 minutes

43:36.320 --> 43:41.200
to talk about. And every now and then I blow it. Like last week or on Sunday, I blew it

43:41.200 --> 43:44.440
and we had a two-hour Linux action show. I usually try to go for about no more than

43:44.440 --> 43:48.920
an hour 45, which was great, just by the way.

43:48.920 --> 43:53.120
We were targeting for one hour, so that's why I was asking.

43:53.120 --> 43:58.800
Yeah, we do the same. We have a set of show notes and at the top we list each of the segment

43:58.800 --> 44:05.000
names and the amount of minutes that each segment should be. And I have a web-based

44:05.000 --> 44:13.680
clock that if you go to a specific URL that I know, all of you, even on remote locations,

44:13.680 --> 44:17.760
can go to this URL and it shows you the same clock. And when you want to advance to the

44:17.760 --> 44:23.440
next segment, anyone can tap the screen and it will move the clock on to the next segment.

44:23.440 --> 44:28.160
And the clock has the amount of time for this segment and how far you've clocked up in this

44:28.160 --> 44:32.680
segment. So you know when you're going over. And when you get to the end of the segment,

44:32.680 --> 44:37.560
someone hits the button and you move over and everyone's clock moves over.

44:37.560 --> 44:38.560
Link released.

44:38.560 --> 44:42.400
It's a single HTML file. I'll send you an email with the HTML file.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.800
Do you find watching the clock becomes distracting?

44:44.800 --> 44:50.800
Well, we have a – I personally have a tablet on my desk which I have always on with the

44:50.800 --> 44:51.800
clock on it.

44:51.800 --> 44:56.640
I don't mean physically watching the clock. I mean does it take mental CPU cycles to think

44:56.640 --> 44:57.640
about a clock?

44:57.640 --> 45:01.360
Yeah. But there's four of us. So it's not – like with you, you're often the only

45:01.360 --> 45:05.200
presenter or the main presenter, right? With us, there's four of us and –

45:05.200 --> 45:06.200
So you have more cycles.

45:06.200 --> 45:10.400
When one person's speaking, the other guys are looking at the clock and they're paying

45:10.400 --> 45:13.960
a message on the chat and be like, hey dude, shut up now.

45:13.960 --> 45:18.400
So that is like – I definitely do try to follow a clock when I'm doing tech talk.

45:18.400 --> 45:20.480
I try not to make it longer than 30 minutes. But otherwise –

45:20.480 --> 45:21.720
I think it's wasted effort.

45:21.720 --> 45:27.120
I'll tell you why I think it's wasted effort is I feel like following a specific

45:27.120 --> 45:34.440
time limit is following mainstream media's rules. And I'm not doing a podcast because

45:34.440 --> 45:38.480
I want to emulate mainstream media. And then one of the nice things about I think the podcast

45:38.480 --> 45:43.600
medium is I can say the podcast is exactly as long as the content justifies. And if the

45:43.600 --> 45:48.000
content justifies that it's a 45-minute show, then it's a 45-minute show. And if the content

45:48.000 --> 45:52.640
justifies it's a two-hour show, it's a two-hour show. And I don't really get that

45:52.640 --> 45:57.900
hung up on it because I have my rough goals that I'm aiming for. But at the same time,

45:57.900 --> 46:02.120
I don't want to necessarily take an outdated way of thinking and cram it into a new medium

46:02.120 --> 46:03.120
either.

46:03.120 --> 46:08.720
So the flip side of that is you're doing this as a job. I'm not. So I'm doing this

46:08.720 --> 46:12.200
during an evening. We start recording at half past eight in the evening and finish at half

46:12.200 --> 46:17.200
past nine. So we do two half-hour slots. And we set the expectation with our listeners

46:17.200 --> 46:22.840
that each episode is half an hour long. So if we suddenly turn up with a two-hour episode,

46:22.840 --> 46:26.040
they're like, whoa, dude, what on earth happened there?

46:26.040 --> 46:30.720
There's definitely shows too where you can say it's an hour-long show and it's part

46:30.720 --> 46:37.160
of the show. There's space for it too. I say don't get super hung up on it, but basically-

46:37.160 --> 46:42.360
Yeah, and I kind of agree with you. A couple of episodes recently, we've rumbled on a bit

46:42.360 --> 46:47.560
and while one person's talking, the rest of us, I can feel it, are all looking at the

46:47.560 --> 46:52.400
clock going, oh my God, oh my God, we're going over. Come on, dude, shut up. We're running

46:52.400 --> 46:56.840
over. And I think part of me thinks, well, maybe actually we should just chill out a

46:56.840 --> 47:01.200
little bit. And every so often put out, instead of a 30-minute episode, put out a 45-minute

47:01.200 --> 47:05.400
episode. And actually, that's not a big deal. But then the flip side is we're doing this

47:05.400 --> 47:11.200
in our evenings and we've all got families and stuff to do and really we're doing this

47:11.200 --> 47:14.480
in our spare time. And nobody's paying us for this. We're not asking for donations.

47:14.480 --> 47:20.240
Well, and honestly, your existing audience tends to love a longer show, but new people

47:20.240 --> 47:23.840
will tend to be put off by really long shows. So it's a hard line to walk.

47:23.840 --> 47:28.160
It's kind of how much does it help you? And I think what is important is to have good

47:28.160 --> 47:33.040
sideband communication between hosts so that even if it's not sticking to a distinct timeline,

47:33.040 --> 47:36.600
you can at least communicate like, that's enough. I don't have anything else. Keep things

47:36.600 --> 47:37.600
in sync.

47:37.600 --> 47:40.720
And there's a lot of different ways to pull that off. There's inline chat. There's IRC

47:40.720 --> 47:45.280
in the background. There's Google Docs chat. There's Slack. There's all that kind of stuff.

47:45.280 --> 47:46.280
There's a lot of different ways.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.200
Hand signals if you're lucky enough to be in the same room.

47:48.200 --> 47:53.560
Wimpy or Popey, you guys have any last wisdom to pass on before we move to the next segment?

47:53.560 --> 47:57.640
You've kind of covered it with your fancy equipment and OBS, but make sure you've got

47:57.640 --> 48:03.600
a backup. So if you're doing local audio recording, make sure that somewhere there's something

48:03.600 --> 48:09.080
recording all of the streams, because one day what will happen is somebody won't be

48:09.080 --> 48:14.760
recording or they'll have the wrong mic or something. And you'll need that backup.

48:14.760 --> 48:15.760
Yeah.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.000
So every person records their own stream.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.360
Yeah, it's super demotivating to lose a really good episode.

48:21.360 --> 48:22.360
Yeah.

48:22.360 --> 48:23.360
Yes.

48:23.360 --> 48:26.360
And it's also a great way to join a podcast, as I found out earlier in the year.

48:26.360 --> 48:27.360
Yeah, that works too.

48:27.360 --> 48:36.040
Yeah. I have a recording of the Open2 Podcasts, a mythical lost episode 30 on a hard drive

48:36.040 --> 48:39.480
that's somewhat fried on my desk. And one day I'll get around to getting it back.

48:39.480 --> 48:44.000
Oh, man. I have lost some good episodes over the years. And for a long time, I'd never

48:44.000 --> 48:49.000
lost any shows. And then now we have more backups in place. But that wasn't until after

48:49.000 --> 48:50.280
learning the hard way.

48:50.280 --> 48:53.120
Sometime last year, you had a bad streak there. And these are like the saddest day.

48:53.120 --> 48:56.560
The next day you'd come on and talk about how you lost. It was just so sad.

48:56.560 --> 49:00.480
Yeah. Well, because it's a double whammy because you don't have an episode. So people show

49:00.480 --> 49:05.960
up and you got nothing to give them. And he's like, you did all of the work except for the

49:05.960 --> 49:09.840
publishing part. You did all of the work and then lose it. So yeah, definitely make a backup

49:09.840 --> 49:10.840
if you can.

49:10.840 --> 49:15.080
And honestly, if you're going to do it live, that's probably right there as your point

49:15.080 --> 49:20.000
to do your backup. It all gets mixed down and sent out. Get a backup going right there.

49:20.000 --> 49:28.040
And there are a ton of great Linux podcasts out there. Wimpy and Popi just put out an

49:28.040 --> 49:33.240
episode of the Ubuntu UK podcast that basically talked about all the podcasts they listen

49:33.240 --> 49:36.560
to. And you can give a shout out or you can check out there because they have a shout

49:36.560 --> 49:41.840
out to a ton of great shows, including a couple of our shows. So you can find that over there

49:41.840 --> 49:45.360
on their podcast. So if you now are interested.

49:45.360 --> 49:50.280
That's a great example of one where one of us was talking a lot and the rest of us were

49:50.280 --> 49:51.280
looking at the world.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.280
Who, Wimpy?

49:52.280 --> 49:55.720
Because Wimpy has a podcast list that is as long as mine.

49:55.720 --> 50:01.560
It is a burning. It was good fun though. It was worth doing.

50:01.560 --> 50:06.680
That was nice. And then, you know, it's funny because really the truth of the matter is,

50:06.680 --> 50:12.440
and I think in a very good way, a few years ago there was a handful of Linux podcasts

50:12.440 --> 50:17.200
and now there's a heck of a lot more. And I think that's a sign that the nuances in

50:17.200 --> 50:20.780
the Linux desktop are sort of maturing a little bit and there's different podcasts that can

50:20.780 --> 50:23.520
fill each one of those nuances, which is awesome.

50:23.520 --> 50:27.920
That's really cool. So check it out and we'll have links to some of the stuff we talked

50:27.920 --> 50:32.720
about. And of course, you guys can also go look at the Kubuntu podcast if you're a Kubuntu

50:32.720 --> 50:37.600
user, might be of interest to you. They got five episodes up on YouTube. And guys stick

50:37.600 --> 50:41.660
around for the rest of the episode and let us, you know, hang out with us and share your

50:41.660 --> 50:45.280
insights and then I come back from time to time and let us know how it's going because

50:45.280 --> 50:47.800
you're always welcome to join us.

50:47.800 --> 50:49.480
Thanks a lot for the info.

50:49.480 --> 50:54.160
You bet. Good luck. All right. So before we get into the next segment, I'm going to take

50:54.160 --> 50:57.920
a minute and tell you about my cell phone provider. And they're pretty neat. It's Ting.

50:57.920 --> 51:04.920
I want you to go to linux.ting.com to support the show and get the Linux unplugged discount.

51:04.920 --> 51:09.480
Here's what I love about Ting. Mobile, that actually makes sense. You can wrap your brain

51:09.480 --> 51:14.440
around this because it's pretty straightforward. You just pay for what you use. Boom. So simple.

51:14.440 --> 51:19.080
That is really simple. It can't be simpler. Flat $6 for the line, pay for what you use.

51:19.080 --> 51:23.080
They just take your minutes, your messages, your megabytes, whatever you just use, that's

51:23.080 --> 51:26.320
what you pay. Plus they have really great dashboards to manage it all. They have super

51:26.320 --> 51:30.760
passionate customer service. All their devices are unlocked. I think, are you starting to

51:30.760 --> 51:34.120
get the picture here? This is pretty nice. They got a savings calculator. When you go

51:34.120 --> 51:39.140
to linux.ting.com, you can try it out. Now I want to put this out there because if you're

51:39.140 --> 51:45.280
clever at all, if you just put a little thought into this, you can work this. You can really

51:45.280 --> 51:50.200
work this to your benefit. I've got, I mean, Noah is really the ultimate example because

51:50.200 --> 51:54.480
he's got an unbelievable amount of lines and he just does not pay very much, but I got

51:54.480 --> 52:01.560
three lines. That's not baller, but I got three lines on Ting. And I'm paying 45 bucks

52:01.560 --> 52:07.320
this month. 45 bucks. Because I just think about it a little bit. I download my podcast

52:07.320 --> 52:12.760
before I leave. I make very few calls. Pretty much the data I use is for audio streaming

52:12.760 --> 52:18.440
or maps, like Waze and stuff like that. Otherwise, I'm really savvy about it. And honestly, that's

52:18.440 --> 52:23.400
all it takes. It's just that much forethought and you can save so much money on your mobile.

52:23.400 --> 52:27.760
And the nice thing about Ting is they have two networks to pick from, GSM and CDMA. And

52:27.760 --> 52:31.280
again, the thing I like about that, and I think this plays well in our audience, is

52:31.280 --> 52:35.180
if you're just a little bit clever, again, you know the difference in your area between

52:35.180 --> 52:39.640
a CDMA network and a GSM network, or even if you don't know the difference, you don't

52:39.640 --> 52:44.400
mind Googling. That's all it takes to figure out, well, I can get better speed or better

52:44.400 --> 52:51.080
coverage or maybe I want to move things around. The thing is flexibility, control, power.

52:51.080 --> 52:55.680
That's your position in the Ting relationship. Ting is built around giving consumers total

52:55.680 --> 52:58.800
control over their Ting account. And they have a bunch of great devices and a bunch

52:58.800 --> 53:02.960
of great tools to do this. I want you to go over to the Ting site right now to support

53:02.960 --> 53:07.560
the show, linux.ting.com, and then play around. Take a look at some of these, I was going

53:07.560 --> 53:10.640
to say computers, take a look at some of these phones I have.

53:10.640 --> 53:11.640
They are computers.

53:11.640 --> 53:14.440
They really are. I mean, the Nexus 6P.

53:14.440 --> 53:16.000
Ooh, look at that.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.200
Oh, man. I have to be honest with you. I am definitely tempted.

53:19.200 --> 53:20.200
I am too.

53:20.200 --> 53:26.400
So, okay, Wes, would you be more of a 6P guy or are you more of a 5X guy or a Moto X guy?

53:26.400 --> 53:29.840
Traditionally, I think the 5X is where I'd be looking, and I am looking, but the 6P,

53:29.840 --> 53:35.280
I don't know, I haven't had a metal body. The thought of that, Nexus line, metal body,

53:35.280 --> 53:36.280
I am very tempted.

53:36.280 --> 53:39.080
I agree. So the 5X is like the phone that I should get.

53:39.080 --> 53:40.080
Yes, exactly.

53:40.080 --> 53:41.080
It seems very reasonable.

53:41.080 --> 53:42.080
And it looks nice.

53:42.080 --> 53:46.040
Unlocked, $379, you can have it at Ting. I mean, it is like, it's the perfect phone because

53:46.040 --> 53:49.400
it's the Google experience. It's unlocked and you only pay for what you use. You're

53:49.400 --> 53:54.800
in control of the entire account, no contract, no early termination fee. It's amazing. Flat

53:54.800 --> 53:59.640
$6. The 5X is like, if I'm reasonable, that's where I should go. But then I look at the

53:59.640 --> 54:02.920
6P, I look at the 6P and I go, but that's bigger.

54:02.920 --> 54:03.920
And it's faster.

54:03.920 --> 54:04.920
It's faster.

54:04.920 --> 54:05.920
And it's got metal.

54:05.920 --> 54:06.920
More pixels.

54:06.920 --> 54:07.920
Yes.

54:07.920 --> 54:08.920
And it's got metal.

54:08.920 --> 54:09.920
Yes.

54:09.920 --> 54:10.920
And it's a new hardware vendor-ish.

54:10.920 --> 54:11.920
I don't have a lot of experience with Hawaii.

54:11.920 --> 54:12.920
Exactly.

54:12.920 --> 54:15.400
And I would be kind of curious what a Hawaii phone is. And I really want Marshmallow right

54:15.400 --> 54:20.840
now. I'm jelly for Marshmallow. I can't help it. I can't help it. Linux.ting.com, go check

54:20.840 --> 54:24.520
out Ting, see why I use them. I've been using them for two years and try out their savings

54:24.520 --> 54:25.520
calculator.

54:25.520 --> 54:28.920
I bring this up because I think my audience is savvy enough to know that they could take

54:28.920 --> 54:34.020
something like Ting and just use a little bit of their skill set to really maximize

54:34.020 --> 54:37.760
how much you could save. It is really a great opportunity for people that are willing to

54:37.760 --> 54:41.520
maybe do a Google search from time to time. You're not afraid to visit a subreddit every

54:41.520 --> 54:46.480
now and then. Or just call up their passionate customer service. It is an opportunity that

54:46.480 --> 54:50.760
is waiting for you. Linux.ting.com. Go try out their savings. I've saved over $2,000

54:50.760 --> 54:53.760
in the last two years. Go try them out. Linux.ting.com.

54:53.760 --> 55:00.280
All right. So, I was really kind of pumped about OpenStreetMap, oh, I don't know, about

55:00.280 --> 55:06.920
a year ago. And I really haven't looked into it very much. But recently, I've been thinking

55:06.920 --> 55:11.000
a lot more about maps and navigation and marking areas that I visit.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.400
Is that something to do with your recent road trip?

55:13.400 --> 55:14.400
It is.

55:14.400 --> 55:15.400
I don't understand.

55:15.400 --> 55:19.760
It is. You know what I discovered on the road trip is even the best mapping systems often

55:19.760 --> 55:24.360
need updates and improvements. And there is a lot of different things that you can get

55:24.360 --> 55:29.520
out of OpenStreetMaps. But for those of you that are not familiar, OpenStreetMaps is a

55:29.520 --> 55:35.800
really, really, really neat project. And as the name implies, it is open source maps.

55:35.800 --> 55:40.660
It's powered by users, thousands of users, data, web sites, mobile apps, all the stuff

55:40.660 --> 55:45.520
that comes in, dedicated hardware devices, local knowledge, community driven, all open

55:45.520 --> 55:51.100
data. And I really, really love this project. But it's one of those boring infrastructure

55:51.100 --> 55:56.240
things that you can't really like just randomly, randomly talk about from time to time because

55:56.240 --> 56:00.560
it's like, yeah, yeah, we all know about it. So what's new? Well, this week, some stuff

56:00.560 --> 56:04.120
is coming out that is brand new. And I'm going to get to that in just a moment. But I wanted

56:04.120 --> 56:08.440
to recap on OpenStreetMaps itself. If you're not familiar with it, it's greatly expanded

56:08.440 --> 56:13.480
access to geodata worldwide. When OpenStreetMaps started over 10 years ago, it was created

56:13.480 --> 56:18.760
as a response to limited geographic data. Now, primarily in the UK, it's grown much,

56:18.760 --> 56:25.960
much larger than that now. It's open and flexible. It's created for the greater good. This author

56:25.960 --> 56:29.120
who I'll link to in the show notes talks about one of his favorite things about OpenStreetMaps

56:29.120 --> 56:32.880
is this large and dedicated community. One of the best parts of this community is the

56:32.880 --> 56:37.800
Hot OSM whose memberships help coordinate updates to OpenStreetMaps in areas impacted

56:37.800 --> 56:43.320
by natural or humanitarian disasters. So that way, the maps reflect the current stuff. And

56:43.320 --> 56:49.400
it's enabling an entire new emerging industry to grow because the data is available to everybody.

56:49.400 --> 56:54.840
There's APIs and software development kits out for mobile devices. Developers, say, the

56:54.840 --> 57:00.720
ones that have written into Koda Radio, have told me that their API and their SDK is easier

57:00.720 --> 57:06.560
to use and integrate with your apps than Google's own native maps API on the Android platform.

57:06.560 --> 57:09.000
Like, it's a really, really good system.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.640
I was looking into it. I mean, at least the Python binding seemed very simple and straightforward,

57:12.640 --> 57:13.640
which is really nice.

57:13.640 --> 57:17.480
So think about taking something like Google Maps and making it available to everybody,

57:17.480 --> 57:21.040
making it available on all kinds of mobile devices. Well, then you can start to build

57:21.040 --> 57:24.760
some really cool stuff. And I want to tell you about some of these apps because I think

57:24.760 --> 57:31.480
this is a really amazing initiative. The first one I want to tell you about is Wheelmap.org.

57:31.480 --> 57:36.560
Wheelmap.org is an online map database to search, find, and mark wheelchair-accessible

57:36.560 --> 57:42.480
places, something that maybe Google would never really be motivated by profit to do,

57:42.480 --> 57:48.520
but something that a passionate community can do using the accurate, up-to-date, always-being-modified

57:48.520 --> 57:49.520
data from OpenStreetMap.

57:49.520 --> 57:53.200
You get so much infrastructure to just build on and tweak and update.

57:53.200 --> 57:58.960
So look at this. This is a Wheelmap.org for wheelchair users. It gives them places like

57:58.960 --> 58:04.600
bars, restaurants, cinemas, supermarkets, so they can look up and find places that are

58:04.600 --> 58:08.880
accessible to them. And, of course, there's apps available for mobile devices as well.

58:08.880 --> 58:09.880
That's awesome.

58:09.880 --> 58:10.880
And it's something that, like, you know.

58:10.880 --> 58:12.880
Wow, look at this. There's a lot of stuff on here.

58:12.880 --> 58:13.880
Yes, isn't this cool?

58:13.880 --> 58:14.880
It's crazy.

58:14.880 --> 58:15.880
Are you looking at it right now?

58:15.880 --> 58:16.880
Yeah.

58:16.880 --> 58:20.080
Yeah, I know. So, like, here, I'll look at Seattle, for example. And I think this is

58:20.080 --> 58:23.680
really kind of, and you can go right here to King County. And you can also have it get

58:23.680 --> 58:27.360
your direct location if you want, if you don't want to do, like, all of the searching stuff.

58:27.360 --> 58:31.840
Look at that. Look at this. And also, you'll notice, too, how fast it is. Doesn't it just

58:31.840 --> 58:32.840
feel super fast?

58:32.840 --> 58:35.200
I've been consistently impressed with the UI. Like, they've done a lot of work on the

58:35.200 --> 58:38.120
front end to make it snappy and competitive with Google, really.

58:38.120 --> 58:42.720
Yes, very much so. And there's some, there's cool ones. There's, like, OpenStreetMaps that

58:42.720 --> 58:44.520
will even show you where power lines are run.

58:44.520 --> 58:45.520
Oh, wow.

58:45.520 --> 58:48.720
Like, again, Google's never going to put that in there, right? Here's another really cool

58:48.720 --> 58:55.760
app, Maps.me. Offline OpenStreetMaps for iOS, Android, Mac, Linux, and Windows computers.

58:55.760 --> 59:01.320
Offline maps powered by OpenStreetMaps. Maps.me is an open source cross-platform offline maps

59:01.320 --> 59:07.960
application built on top of crowdsourced OpenStreetMap data. Isn't this neat? And here's Maps.me

59:07.960 --> 59:11.640
online right here. And, in fact, didn't you send this in, too?

59:11.640 --> 59:16.040
Yes, I believe I did. I just love how much you can do. You know, it's like, I was looking

59:16.040 --> 59:18.120
at one earlier where it was custom bike routes.

59:18.120 --> 59:19.120
Yes.

59:19.120 --> 59:22.000
And so, you know, people can take the data that's available here and then determine their

59:22.000 --> 59:26.760
own routing algorithms that might be better or more optimized or better for your city.

59:26.760 --> 59:30.760
And they pull in the data from a lot of different locations, like, Lorde, you're in the, Lorde

59:30.760 --> 59:34.080
Dirac in the chat, in the mumble room right now is mentioning that a lot of the U.S. data

59:34.080 --> 59:37.240
came from the Census Bureau. I didn't know that.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.240
That's great.

59:38.240 --> 59:41.720
Yeah, that is great. I mean, might as well get it from open locations. And I actually

59:41.720 --> 59:45.560
started looking into it because there is when you, now this is Chris talking about the road

59:45.560 --> 59:51.120
trip again, but when you are hauling something, there is an entirely different set of, I am

59:51.120 --> 59:57.200
driving like in a parallel dimension. So, when I'm pulling the rover, in total, I'm

59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.120
like 45 feet long. That's near semi-length, right?

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.680
Because you've got the truck and then you have a 25 foot long trailer, plus you have

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:10.080
the connection. And so, it's like 40 feet long, plus. And so, there are certain areas

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.960
that are just very challenging to go into. So, I have been looking to see if there's

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:19.560
specific OpenStreetMap based data that would help with this. What are you looking at there?

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.800
Well, this was linked here in the chat room to Kresney here. Tell them about State of

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800
the Map.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.400
That looks really, that looks really fancy.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.800
Yeah, it's the biggest OpenStreetMap conference ever. It sounds like there are videos up now.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.880
Very cool. So, I want to tell you about something that, this is why OpenStreetMap got on my

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:45.000
radar today. This is what kind of made me excited about it is, since the whole last

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
pass thing, I've been like, this is what I've been trying to square, is can I really

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.780
replace every service that relies on a hosted third party system? Is that really realistic

01:00:55.780 --> 01:01:00.240
in 2015 when everything's in the cloud and everything's online, everything's got to

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.240
be mobile?

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.240
Well, it has to be mobile.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.240
Everything's got to be mobile.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.240
It has to be in the cloud. That's the rule.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:10.480
I don't know if you saw that, but I think Obama came out and said, hey, everybody, one

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.480
of the rules is-

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.480
Executive order.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.280
Yeah, he said, first he came out on the stage and he said-

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.280
Hello, everybody.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.280
And then he said, look, this is-

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.280
That's how we roll.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:22.240
Everything's got to be mobile. And so I was trying to get my head around this and I realized,

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.920
how am I going to get nav routing and maps?

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.880
Yeah, you're dependent on the big providers with their big database.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:32.720
Yeah, and it seems like this is an impossible, impossible thing for an open source project

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.720
to take on. But you see, this is where OpenStreet, the data of OpenStreetMaps comes in. And there's

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.360
a few different projects that are tackling this. And there's a new one out there called

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:47.840
Mapzen, M-A-P-Z-E-N. And it is essentially an open platform trying to handle this particular

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.480
problem. It's a search engine for places that takes the philosophy of open communities and

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.500
creating data and open code to heart. Mapzen Search will launch this week. And in the meantime,

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.360
they're going to share some background info here with us. And so we're going to go into

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.360
all of this.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:05.480
Here's what jumped out at me. Okay. Their data collection is already underway. UK post

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.920
codes beginning with E. They got different countries, have different address number schemes.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.960
They figured all of that out. They went through US highways. They got all that figured out.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.940
East, west, odd routes, all this crazy stuff. And now they believe they have an open routing

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:20.280
system that's going to be available to users to go into and simply get planned routes,

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.440
maps, all this stuff as available as another data layer sitting on top of OpenStreetMaps,

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.560
which will then be available to developers. And they got a whole series of cool stuff

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:36.600
they're working on. When you go to mapzen.com, including Tanzgram, a flexible hackable mapping

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.480
engine designed for real-time rendering, 2D and 3D of maps.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.480
Oh, wow.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.080
Yeah. They got the Maps and Search, the Modern Geocoding and Play Search service. They're

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:50.360
going to have turn-by-turn directions available through this and vector tile services. Vector

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:56.480
tiles are awesome. I don't know. I think this is really like the next level. So you have

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:00.880
OpenStreetMaps providing the core infrastructure of the data. And then you got these guys providing

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.120
cool 3D maps, cool real-time routing with traffic, all this stuff coming in to Maps

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.320
in.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:11.400
To me, this is going to take OpenStreetMaps and sort of make it available at a whole other

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.480
level to apps. You could use this stuff on the go. And then you combine it with stuff

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:23.520
like OSM Tracker, which is a really nice way for sort of crowd-based Google Street Maps

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:30.280
taking photos, real-time corrections of OpenStreetMap data when there's errors. You can mark areas

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:36.000
of construction if the map is completely wrong. All that stuff right here from an app while

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
you're driving around.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Oh, that makes it so easy.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.880
So you can really keep this thing up to date.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.040
I thought that was pretty cool. I thought it was pretty cool. Wimpy, you wanted to jump

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.000
in and talk about an open source alternative to Google Maps.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.520
Yeah. So one of the hottest apps on Ubuntu Touch is called UNAV, which is written by

01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:02.800
Marcos Costales. And that's a full turn-by-turn GPS navigator for car, bike, and walking.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.600
And that uses OpenStreetMap and Maps then to do its mapping. And I'm going to use this

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:16.640
to hopefully navigate us from the south of England to the northwest of England when we

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:21.320
go to odd camp at the end of the month. So we're actually going to use it in anger to

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.680
drive somewhere unfamiliar.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.760
Cool. That's the ultimate test, isn't it?

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.760
You'll have to let us know how it goes.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.760
Yeah.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.760
Well, it's... Go on.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.000
Well, I noticed it does turn-by-turn by directions and it avoids toll roads. Do you notice it

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.360
do offline maps too? Because that's one of my favorite things about a lot of these OpenStreetMaps

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.360
apps.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.720
I don't think it does yet, but I do think that they're planning that. At the moment,

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:47.840
it's an online-only solution, I believe.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.280
But the good news is in the UK, we have pretty good coverage.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.280
Right.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.280
It's not as much of a problem, is it?

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.280
That's not a problem.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.280
Yeah.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.520
No, here is a sort of required thing.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:00.440
As we discussed a few weeks ago, I've got 3G in my car, so it should be all right.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.860
I will add a link to that in the show notes for people that are taking a look for maybe

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:09.120
a Ubuntu Touch-based app. So it's UNAV, GPS navigation, UNAV app explorer.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.120
Really cool.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.120
Yeah.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:16.720
Yeah, I've been looking for something that is specific for RVers. So if anybody out there

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:23.040
in the audience knows of something that is OpenStreetMaps-based that is geared towards

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.520
truckers or people that have RVs, large vehicles, I'd love to know because I was doing some

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.000
exploring around which kind of led me to find this topic.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.520
And then I realized, kind of much like we talked about LibreOffice a few weeks back,

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.520
there are some really other cool projects out there that are attached to Linux, but

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.480
not directly, that are really neat.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.440
And OpenStreetMaps, if you think about it, if you think about how critical that kind

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.040
of information is and how fundamental it is to a platform, I mean, that's why Apple went

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.240
off and made their own maps.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.240
Yeah, exactly.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.240
It's obviously important enough to them.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.240
Yeah.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.240
Google's got their own thing, right?

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.680
And, you know, one of the nice ways is there is more and more people using this OpenStreetMaps

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.520
stuff like DuckDuckGo.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:04.880
If you go to DuckDuckGo's Maps application, that is powered also by OpenStreetMaps.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:10.960
So you can get some Navi-type stuff right now using the OpenStreetMaps from DuckDuckGo,

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.960
which is pretty neat.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960
I don't know if you've played with it.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960
Yeah, go ahead.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.120
One of the other things we're using it for, when Martin's going to be driving us up to

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:23.720
Liverpool, I made a little app for Ubuntu Phone, which was inspired by your road trip

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.720
actually, Chris.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.720
Oh, yeah?

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:30.320
Yeah, I saw your – I was following your road trip online and watching the position

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.320
of your RV.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.320
Oh, the live tracker, yeah.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.240
And so I thought I'd write an app.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:40.640
And so I've written an app for Ubuntu Phone, which reports our location to an online map.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.640
Oh, that's fun.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:48.760
So if you go to ubuntupodcast.org slash road trip, then you'll see a map.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.240
It's currently blank because we haven't set off yet.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:57.200
But when we do, you'll see a little dot showing – showing where we are.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.840
It's all done on Ubuntu Phone or using free software.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.360
Now is there – what is the backend server software?

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.240
Is it TrackCar or is it something you just – are you up to date?

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.240
No, it's all homegrown.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.240
That's cool.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.240
Wow.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.240
It's all free software.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:17.200
So on the phone, it's a little HTML5 app which calls out to the phone to find the GPS

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.200
location.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.800
It's a battle bus.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:27.960
Yeah, once it gets the location – whenever the location changes, it sends a message over

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:33.960
web sockets to our server and our server then updates the map as and when.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.800
And I've got a little – I've got a little button in the app just in case I drive somewhere

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.680
that maybe I don't want people to know about.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.800
I can press a button that reverts it back to some other location.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800
Wow.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.800
Yeah.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.080
Yeah, if I actually wander into a strip bar, I can make it say I'm in church or something.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:52.920
There were a few times where I was on the road trip where I was like – I got lost

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:56.200
a couple of times and I'm like, damn it.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.600
If anybody's watching me right now, they're just – and I can't remember – I swear

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:03.200
to God, it was somewhere in Montana where we got off the highway to get gas because

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.800
once we got below a half a tank, we're like, we better fill up, especially in some of these

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:11.720
places in Montana because there's no gas for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.720
miles.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:13.920
It's ridiculous.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:18.160
And we pull off the freeway and, of course, the gas station was closed because it was

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.760
after 9 o'clock.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:26.080
And what we realized quickly is only the main road right off the highway was paved.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.280
Everything else was gravel and like –

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.280
Wow.

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:31.960
And I ended up going around in circles trying to get out of this place and I'm thinking

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.680
if anybody's watching me right now, I am in the middle of nowhere.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.160
What the hell is Chris doing?

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.160
Yeah.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.160
I'm driving around on gravel roads.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.880
I must look like an idiot.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:44.480
So having that button built in to be able to just be like, never mind, that's a very

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.480
–

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.480
I'm at the last scene.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.480
Yeah.

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.040
There's no attention to that.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.040
Yeah.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.000
I'm really excited about what OpenStreetMaps is doing.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
So – well, hi there.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Hell, there.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.480
So now, Poppy, did I miss it?

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.720
So you are using the OpenStreetMap data to power that?

01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.720
Yeah.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.160
The map is rendered on top of OpenStreetMap.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.160
I mean, from the phone.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.560
It's just a case of setting the latitude and longitude.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.560
It's nice.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.560
Why?

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.560
And direction and speed as well.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:14.520
So I might have to – depending on how fast Martin goes, I might have to add a button

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.520
that –

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.520
Got nine points on my license.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.520
Yeah.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.520
So I strictly adhere to the speed.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.520
Right.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.520
Okay.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.520
So now you do.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.520
I don't need to worry about that.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520
Now you do.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520
A delay function that's in here.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520
Yeah.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520
Yeah.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.520
That's the other thing is if anybody was watching me, they would see that sometimes

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.200
– they'd be looking at me going, you know, he's pulling a trailer.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.400
He shouldn't be going that fast because it tells you the exact speed I'm going to.

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.560
And then it's like, yes, I'm doing 75.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.000
It's 80 miles per hour here.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Leave me alone.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Which, whatever.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Well, that's cool.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
So there you go.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
That's a great idea, tracking that.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I think it's fun.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I think it's fun tracking it.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.840
I think I would love for the next road trip, I would love to use Track Car, T-R-A-C Car,

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.400
because right now I'm using like a hardware device, which works fine because what's really

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.160
nice about it is I just switch it on and all of a sudden it's working.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.640
But I would love to be able to use Track Car and just throw it on a digital ocean droplet.

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.640
And I think –

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.440
We can build that into a hardware device for you.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.440
You think?

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440
Like a Raspberry Pi?

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.440
Yeah.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.440
Yeah.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.440
I'm looking right now.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.000
I'm betting they must use – they must use –

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I believe they do.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I'm looking.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I don't see it.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
But I bet they use OpenStreetMaps.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I bet they do.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Wes, will you check?

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I will check.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Will you check while you do that?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Tell you what.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.080
While you do that, I'll prep us for the next segment, which is – I've been really looking

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.840
forward to it because right here we've got the Steam Link, which is this I'm excited

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.720
about, but I think the Steam Link is going to need some testing.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.300
For those of you who are not familiar with the Steam Link, I'm sure you probably know.

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:37.080
But it allows you to stream Windows games to this thing, or probably Linux games too,

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.540
to this thing that's hooked up to your TV.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:42.320
It's kind of like on live but in your house.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.440
And it works.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.400
And then the thing that we're really – the thing that we're really excited about that's

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.320
had a lot of different iterations is the Steam Controller.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:58.040
And now we have been told that beginning with Linux kernel 4.3, not only is Steam Controller

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.560
support built in, but some significant fixes for like the Xbox 360 controller are also

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.560
built in.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.120
Ooh, got to love that 360 controller.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.120
That's great.

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.640
Yeah, well, if you don't like – if you don't like the Steam Controller, you might

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.380
like the 360 controller.

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.240
It's a decent controller, right?

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:16.200
Built into Linux kernel 4.3, support for this built into Linux kernel 4.3.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.480
I however have Linux kernel 4.2.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.680
So we will see how it goes.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.480
We're going to unbox this, give you our first impressions of how the actual final product

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.200
feels in our hands, take a look at it, hook it up to the arch rig here, and see if we

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.380
can get it working.

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:35.320
And if we can, I'll give you the fix that we tried to figure out ahead of time.

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.960
We did come up with what we think it's going to take to make it work ahead of time.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.760
And if it does work, we'll share that – well, we're going to share it regardless in the

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.760
show notes.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.760
Did you find it there?

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.760
Oh, I'm looking for it right now.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.760
All right.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.760
Well, that's fine.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.800
I'm imagining TrackCar uses OpenStreetMouse, but I suppose they could use anything.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.800
Who knows?

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.800
Who knows, Wes?

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.800
I don't know.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.800
All right.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.800
But you know what I do know?

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:54.800
I know that we're brought to you by our friends over at Linux Academy.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:00.040
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug – linuxacademy.com slash unplug to get our special discount.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:05.560
They just had a live event, a big one, where they announced a ton of stuff.

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.720
Not only do they have a brand new CDN powering all of their content, not only do they have

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:14.800
a beautiful new HTML5 player, and not only do they have tons of great stuff like their

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.560
self-paced courses with instructor help available, their labs that are based on any of the distributions

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.960
from 7Plus to choose from that you've chosen, their scenario-based training, and now their

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.240
practice labs where you can go in there and actually be great on how you performed in

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.240
the lab.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:33.120
Not just did you make NGINX start and serve up a webpage, but how well did you actually

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120
do it?

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.120
That's in there now.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.040
Think about the technology required to make that work.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.080
7Plus distros – you choose the distro, your courseware automatically adjusts, your

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:46.880
lab server automatically adjusts, and now they can help you see how you actually performed

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.880
in there.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.720
Also, when you're ready to go take the big exam for whatever cert you're going for,

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.720
they've got different modes now that really help you learn.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.040
If you have a little anxiety around testing, they've got some stuff that really helps

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.040
with that.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.640
I also like – this is a huge component for me – the nuggets.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:06.000
Truth be told, sometimes I don't want to sit down and spend five hours to learn something.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.240
I want to spend about two hours, maybe I want to spend an hour at most, and I just want

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.720
to deep dive on a topic.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.720
They've got those.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.680
They also have an availability planner.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:18.140
Now for somebody like me, I know that a couple of nights a week I've got some extra time.

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:22.200
Other times during the week I'm a lot busier, especially when it comes to doing stuff with

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.200
the kids.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.840
So what I can do with the availability selector is I go Tuesday nights I've got time, Thursday

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:29.520
nights I've got time, Sunday night I've got time.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.440
And then Linux Academy will automatically generate courseware that matches my availability

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.360
with reminders about exams and all of that.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.280
And then the best part is they have a community stacked full of your friends, Jupiter Broadcasting

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:43.280
community members who I've been telling about this for a long time.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.080
They're over there now and they are passing these courses.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.160
They can give you a lift if you get down.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.600
They can give you tips and tricks.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.480
I hear from the folks at Linux Academy all the time about how well this works out.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.120
They're rolling out new technologies all the time.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.520
I'm going to start telling you about them over the next couple of weeks, but right now

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.480
I want you to go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.320
They just upgraded a ton of stuff on their system, a massive rollout.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.200
All the technologies around Linux making Linux even better and all of the associated stack

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.600
is all over there.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:13.680
This isn't one of your general learning sites where they're going to tell you how to have

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.520
effective leadership communication, how to use Adobe After Effects and how to set up

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.520
Apache.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.520
Because those sites suck at what they do.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.140
They try to do all of the things.

01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:27.160
They try to tell you how to fix your sync and how to use After Effects and how to use

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.160
Linux.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160
It doesn't work.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:32.240
There are people who truly know the subject matter, who are passionate about it, who are

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:36.200
motivated to bring Linux to as many people as possible, who then decided, how do I achieve

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.200
that goal?

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.200
Well, I team up with developers.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:41.560
I team up with educators and then they created the Linux Academy platform.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.680
That's who you want to learn from because that passion translates to a deep, deep understanding

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.120
of the root technology and following that technology's latest developments, which means

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.400
you're getting the best education possible.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.020
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:57.920
Go take care of, go take advantage of our discount, go see what I've been talking about

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.600
and now, go participate in the stacked community.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.200
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:07.360
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.840
You guys are rocking and that update is huge.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.440
And in fact, when you sign up, go into the community section and go read about the updates

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.440
from Anthony.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.440
A lot of stuff there.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:16.940
I'm really, really impressed.

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:20.280
Has somebody who feels like he's constantly running the rat race to produce the best content

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.280
available?

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.440
I am massively impressed because not only are they producing the content, they're also

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:25.920
developing the platform to deliver it.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.920
I know.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.400
They're building the infrastructure at the same time as they update all of their guides,

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.400
all of their tutorials.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.400
It blows my mind.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.400
It's very impressive.

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.080
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring Unplugged

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.080
program.

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.080
Okay, Wes.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.680
Okay, so this is a big moment, Wes.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.960
I pre-ordered this a while ago.

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:47.000
I'm really excited, but I invite you, sir, to unbox the Steam Controller.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Wow.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.080
It is a big moment, I know, I know, I know, but let's go for it.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.080
Are you ready?

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.080
I am ready.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.080
Okay, Wes.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.080
Have at it here.

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.080
You know what?

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.080
I will work on the link.

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.200
Now, I'm not as excited about the link.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.960
How destructive should I be here?

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.280
Well, you can go for it.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.280
Just rip it.

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.280
Let's just rip it.

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:07.280
Let's just rip it.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.280
Let's just go for it.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.280
Let's just rip this top one here.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.280
That's what the audience wants.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.280
Yeah.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.280
Yeah.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.280
Yeah.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.280
All right.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.400
So, I'm getting some new smell off this.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.560
They got a nice dark blue box here.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.560
Yeah.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.560
Yeah, this is nice.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.040
Cute little controller icon on mine.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.040
Yeah.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.760
Oh, I don't have any cute icons.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:26.760
I have a steam icon.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.240
Here, I'm going to take your keys to get the tape.

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.240
Please do.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:33.280
It's got a ring of tape on the outside of the box, and I'm going to cut through it now.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.080
Don't pass those back when you're done, Sid.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.080
So you see that?

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.080
You got that same ring.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.080
It's a nice ring, actually.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080
Yeah, very sturdy tape.

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.080
All right.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.080
If that's any sign.

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.520
Oh, there it is.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.520
Here's the link.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.520
I'm pulling it out now.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:51.840
I'd say it's about the size of a Roku 3, maybe even smaller, maybe even smaller.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.840
It's got...

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.240
Oh, man, it smells so good.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:56.040
It smells like new stuff.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.040
All right.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.040
Oh.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.040
Oh, I got it open.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.040
Oh, here it is.

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.040
Let me show you.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.040
I'll show it to the camera for those of you watching.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040
Here it is.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040
It's a nice little box.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.040
Yeah.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.040
There it is there.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.040
There it is right there.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.040
Okay, Wes.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.040
Take it out.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.040
Tell me how it feels.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.560
The link controller, the Steam Link, it's got two HDMI on the back, power, Ethernet,

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:16.800
or I'm sorry, two USB on the back, power, Ethernet, and an HDMI out.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.280
Oh, this thing, it's light.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.280
It feels solid.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.280
It's solid, but light.

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:21.280
It's light.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.280
All right.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.520
And it comes with a nice little wireless dongle here.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520
All right.

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520
Okay.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520
You ready?

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.520
Yeah.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.520
Let's get this hooked up.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.520
All right.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:31.520
So we're going to put batteries in it.

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.520
Interesting.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.520
Interesting.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.520
It's got a nice battery snap off in the back.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.520
It's got like a set little switch at the bottom.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.600
Like a bat wing almost.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.160
Nicer than your average TV remote.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:41.320
So one battery goes in each side of the controller, it looks like.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.320
Right?

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.320
That'll give a little heft.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.320
Yeah.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320
Here, Wes.

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.320
I'll let you...

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.320
You do that.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.320
I think that goes in there.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:53.800
It comes with a USB receiver with the Steam logo on it.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:54.800
Here.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.800
I don't think the camera...

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.760
I don't think that shows up on the camera.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.760
That's too bad.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:17:59.760
It's got the Steam logo on it.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:00.760
I like that.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:01.760
All right, Wes.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:02.760
I'm going to go...

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:03.760
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to plug this in.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.760
You know what I should do?

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.760
Do it.

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.760
Hold on.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760
Before I do it, I'm going to bring up dMessage.

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760
And then we'll...

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760
Let's watch this live.

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.760
Yeah.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:11.760
Then we'll pull...

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.760
Then we'll run dMessage afterwards, too.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:13.760
Okay?

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.400
So dMessage is up.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.760
And here, I'll bring it up on the screen.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.760
So there's dMessage.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.760
And there's...

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.400
Now, that's before I plug in.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.400
Now I'm going to plug in.

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.400
All right.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.400
All right.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.400
All right.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.400
All right.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.400
I just plugged in the Steam controller.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.440
I'm going to run dMessage again.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.360
Oh, we got some new stuff.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.360
Okay.

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.360
USB HID device.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.360
Valve software Steam controller.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.360
Oh, you see that?

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.200
It says Valve software Steam controller.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.520
I don't know if this is in all the way.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.760
You can kind of feel it in the back there.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.240
Oh, it doesn't feel like it's in all the way.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.240
Oh, no.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.240
Those are levers.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.240
That's what I thought.

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.240
Okay.

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.240
Yeah.

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.240
Those are levers.

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:48.240
What's going on, though?

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.240
Oh, it just beeped.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.240
Did you hear that?

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.240
It beeped at us, guys.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.240
Did you hear that?

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.240
Okay.

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.240
All right.

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.240
That's cool.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.240
All right.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.240
So that's cool.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.240
So something just happened with the Steam controller.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.600
I'm saying I'm not freaking out, but the Steam logo has lit up in the middle of the

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:00.600
controller now.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.560
I might be freaking out a little bit right now.

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:03.560
It's actually happening.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.240
Oh, wow, Wes.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.240
The smell is intoxicating.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.240
Wes, run your thumb along the Gabe nipple pad right there.

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.240
Do you feel that?

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.240
Oh, yeah.

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:13.240
It's got haptic feedback.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.240
It's quite haptic.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.240
Yeah.

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.240
Okay.

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:20.880
So we're going to launch Race the Sun, and I'd say it feels a little heavier than the

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:21.880
Xbox.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.840
So those of you who have used the Xbox 360 controller, I'd say it feels a little bit

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.600
heavier than the Xbox 360 controller.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:30.920
The X, Y, A, and B buttons do not light up.

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.240
The Steam button is blinking.

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.640
Oh, I was supposed to go into big picture mode, I think, wasn't I?

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.400
I think I was supposed to go into big picture mode after this.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.840
Try to get the firmware up there.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.200
Yeah, yeah, because nothing's happening in the game at the moment.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.200
All right.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.200
All right.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.200
So we'll jump out, and we'll go into Steam big picture mode.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.520
I mean, this might not work without it, but yeah, we'll see.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.520
We'll see.

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.840
This might be as far as we get, Wes, right here.

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:51.840
We may have...

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.240
The kernel's working hard for us.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.240
All right.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:20:01.160
So we'll go into big picture mode, and yeah, so there's big picture mode.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.480
All right.

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.860
So welcome to Steam from your couch.

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:07.080
Nothing's happening, though.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.080
Nothing's happening.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.080
Oh, hold on.

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.080
Update.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.080
Okay.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.080
Look at that.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.440
We can update the firmware on the Steam controller right now.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.440
Do it.

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:15.440
Live update, everyone.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.440
All right.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.440
Update Steam controller firmware.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.400
The new firmware is being installed on the controller.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.280
Well, so then we must be communicating with it.

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.280
Yeah, definitely.

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.280
Yeah, so that's a good sign.

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.960
Or it's chosen one of your devices to flash with the Steam firmware, and it's just brick

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.960
now.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.000
It's overriding my S6 over Bluetooth right now.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
All right.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.360
Well, cool.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:37.280
So I guess that means then if it's seeing this, then the Udev rule that we added to

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.400
my system must be working.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.400
Must be working.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.000
Your user has permission to update the firmware.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.480
So there was two things we had to do to make this work on a non-4.3 kernel.

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:47.360
It'll be different for your distribution, and I have it linked in the show notes.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.000
But number one is we created a Udev rule.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Oh, hey, look.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
It's done.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Whoa.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Yeah, and it vibrated the controller.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.580
And I am now operating this big picture mode with the controller.

01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:00.460
This is happening right now.

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:01.720
Let's go try Race the Sun.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:02.720
Okay, here we go.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:03.720
We're going to play.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.720
Oh, I'm excited.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:07.560
We're going to play Race the Sun with the Steam controller.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.600
So anyways, Udev rule got added, and then my user account, my chrisf user, had to be

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.560
added to the Steam group, which it already was by default.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.560
So okay.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:19.760
I don't know what I actually hit to launch the game.

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.060
That would be the big question.

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:25.640
So I'm going to say, I'm just going to use the...

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:26.640
All right, here we go.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:27.640
Here we go.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:28.640
All right.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.640
Are you ready, Wes?

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.640
Let's see if this works.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.640
So nothing's happening.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.640
It does not work.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.640
It does not work.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.640
Nothing's happening.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.120
This game may not support it.

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.040
It had a controller icon.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.040
No, it did.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.040
It did.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.040
It did.

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.040
All right.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.040
So here, I'll jump out.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.400
I have no idea what I'm doing, though, because maybe I have to go in somewhere.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.400
So here's something that's interesting.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.400
I don't know if you noticed this.

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:51.400
In fact, I'll jump back to the big picture mode here.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:54.560
You see how it has, in game, it has a controller icon.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.560
Yes, it does.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.560
Yeah.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.160
So I think it does support the Steam controller, but I just have to mess with it a little bit

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160
more.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.560
The creators of this game have made an interface that requires a keyboard and a mouse.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.560
Oh.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.560
Oh, okay.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.560
So I picked the absolute wrong game.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:06.560
But it's such a good game.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.440
A little pop-up showed up a couple seconds after we were on the page that said it doesn't

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:10.760
work with Steam controller.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.200
You see how it has a little controller icon there?

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:13.200
Yeah, I do like that.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.200
Yeah.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.200
Which almost is accurate.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.200
Yeah.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:20.980
So it does still emulate keyboard and mouse if you go to the manage game menu, configure,

01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:21.980
and pick a template.

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:22.980
Yeah.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:23.980
So expert tips here.

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:24.980
Thank you.

01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:25.980
Manage game menu.

01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:26.980
So where do I go here?

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:27.980
Yeah.

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:28.980
Open up your game, or go to the game tile.

01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:29.980
Okay.

01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:32.480
And then, oh, I have to manage it for each game, is what you're saying?

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.480
Yep.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.480
Since each game could have different mappings.

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.480
Oh.

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.480
Oh, I see.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.280
So I go here to manage game, configure controller.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.280
Ah-ha-ha.

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.280
Yes.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.280
I see.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.280
Yeah.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.280
I see.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.280
Okay.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.280
All right.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.280
All right.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.280
Hmm.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.280
I think I will play with that after the show.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.280
That'd be nice, though, if they just had some controller presets for some of the more

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.280
popular games.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.320
Well, they definitely do, actually.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.320
And users can contribute.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:01.000
In fact, I already contributed a controller scheme for Shovel Knight.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
So I can...

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Oh, okay.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
So here I go.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.480
I'm going to browse controller configs, and then I can say, this controller configuration

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:11.000
is recommended for this game.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.280
And so then I think it...

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.280
I think it just loaded it.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.280
I'm not sure.

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.280
So I'll browse configs.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.280
Select.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.280
Okay.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.280
I'm selecting this config.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.520
And now I'm going to save this config.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:23.520
All with the controller.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.520
Yeah.

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:25.520
I'm doing this all with the controller.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.540
Now I'm saying I'm done.

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:29.520
So should I try playing it and see what happens?

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.520
Do it.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.520
All right.

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:32.960
So now I don't know exactly...

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:36.240
I didn't actually study what all the buttons are supposed to be.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.520
Yeah, Kitson, you can ask a question.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.520
Go ahead.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.520
Yeah.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:41.520
North Ranger.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:47.560
You said that there is some per application controls in Steam regarding the Steam controller.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:52.720
Could you set that up to work with like an NES simulator or something of that nature

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:54.620
outside of Steam?

01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:57.320
To be honest, I haven't gotten that far yet.

01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:01.800
Everyone that I've played with has been through the Steam client because the Steam overlay

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:09.280
or the Steam big picture mode is required to emulate non gamepad activities.

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.640
So when I go into configure controller, let's see.

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:16.640
For a keyboard mouse only game, you probably have to go to the templates when you're browsing

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.640
configs.

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:18.640
Yeah.

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:23.560
And choose the keyboard WASD template instead of a gamepad.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:24.560
Okay.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.000
Oh, I see.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Community templates.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:33.400
And then you say keyboard WASD and mouse.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.400
So let's see.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.400
Yeah.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.400
Yeah.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:37.400
All right.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.400
I can give it a shot.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.400
I'll give this a shot.

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.400
This does seem a little...

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.400
It's nice that these are available, I guess, right?

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.120
That's kind of a nice thing.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.120
But I feel like...

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.000
I don't know.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.480
You're wishing it had just worked.

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.840
Well, I kind of wish by default it would just work.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:51.840
Yeah.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:52.840
But that's okay.

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:53.840
It doesn't have to, I suppose.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.640
Because it just takes the Race of the Sun guys one update.

01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.640
Yeah.

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.200
And they seem to update pretty often.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.360
So I'm moving the mouse now.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.800
I'm moving the mouse around with the Steam controller.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:04.800
Hey, that's a good start.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.280
And it feels really good, actually.

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:08.280
So that's actually...

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.280
That's working for me quite a bit.

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:10.280
All right.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.280
So I'm going to launch the game.

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.280
And we'll give it one more try.

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.240
We'll see if I can blow up or if I can actually drive.

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.240
Wow.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.240
Look at me moving the mouse.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:18.200
That's cool.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.760
But still not moving the guy, though.

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.240
I'm still not moving the guy.

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:23.200
So out of the box, it didn't move the guy.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.200
And we're dead.

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.200
Yeah.

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.200
You tried, Chris.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.200
Yeah.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.200
I did.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.200
I can move the mouse now.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.200
So that's an improvement at least.

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.520
But I still have some work to go, I guess.

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.040
Well, I'll keep playing with it.

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.040
You know, it feels...

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.040
Wes, give it another go.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.840
I mean, it feels pretty good in the hand, though, don't you think?

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:37.840
It does feel pretty good.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.840
You know, they've got the...

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:39.840
I don't know what to call them.

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.960
The input pads are at the slight upward angle, so you can kind of rest with how your thumbs

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:44.960
lay.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:45.960
Yeah.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.920
Oh, the triggers on the back, too, are very...

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.920
They're nice.

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:49.920
Yeah.

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.920
They're kind of like...

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.920
They've got a weight to them.

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.400
I don't know what the weight of them and triggers are.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.400
What do you think of that?

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.200
I'm not sure what I would use that for.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.720
Maybe shifting between different ammo or something like that.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.360
It seems like it would work well for a driving game.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.400
It kind of is like the paddle shifters on the expensive race cars.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.400
Yeah.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.400
Yeah.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.400
Yeah, exactly.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.400
Yeah.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.400
It feels like a pretty high-quality controller.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.000
Oh, but I will say the mouse emulation is really accurate.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Yeah.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
It feels really...

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Like it's really glued to your finger.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.280
It moves fast when you want it to.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.280
I could use that in place of the mouse.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.280
But it's got the fine control.

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.280
Yeah.

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.280
Oh, yeah.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280
Yeah.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.840
I could use that in Portal mode or even just if you could use it to control your mouse

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.920
on the native screen.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:27.000
I would use that from the couch, no problem.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Yeah.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
I don't know if I have a game...

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.840
I don't know if I have a game that would have it supported by default or not.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.440
Portal 2 is an excellent example of built-in controls.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.440
I wonder what I have.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.440
I will...

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.440
How do I get out of big picture mode?

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.440
Oh, you can just...

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.720
Oh, in big picture mode, you can view just installed games.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.720
All right.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.140
So I've got BioShock installed, Distance.

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:47.800
Well, of course, I've got Race of the Sun.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.120
I don't see Portal though.

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:53.840
I wonder what about Trine?

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.000
I'll have to play around with this and see because there's...

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.760
And the other thing is I wonder how it works in conjunction with the Link as well.

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.720
That's another area I have a lot of questions about.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.720
Oh, I know.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:07.320
That'll be really exciting for people who already have nice gaming rigs and just want

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.120
to, you know, bring it to the living room.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.120
Yeah.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.120
So there you go.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.120
That will be our...

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.120
Just for...

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.120
And it will be done.

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.120
I know because some people, they can't stand all the Steam talk.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.120
I know.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.120
So there you go.

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.080
There's our Valve update right there.

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.160
We talked about it.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.160
We unboxed it.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.800
The Steam controller is real.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:23.800
It's here.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.520
Did you talk about the community key maps?

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.520
Using a Steam controller.

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.520
Look at this.

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.560
Please run Steam in big picture mode to make full use of your controller.

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:31.920
Well, at least it tells us.

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:34.440
I was just looking at some of the community key maps actually.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.440
Those are pretty nice.

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:40.080
That's an awesome system that if there's a game that doesn't support it, you can build

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.680
it and then share it.

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.680
Yeah, that is really cool.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:50.720
And I bet within one week, all of the games I play will have tons of different profiles.

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.520
So is that new with the Steam controller?

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.520
Yeah.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.520
Okay.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.520
Wow.

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.040
I hope that that infrastructure is extended to support other controller layouts too.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.040
It feels...

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.040
It could be nice with the 360.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.040
It feels like...

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.040
It probably will.

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.040
Oh, yeah.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.040
Right?

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.040
Because there's some games where it's like, well, I know I could make this config, but

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.040
why doesn't Steam do it?

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:09.480
Well, they wrote the compatibility list stuff for the 360 anyway, so it makes sense if they

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:10.480
had the...

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.000
That'd be perfect.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.300
What I was kind of curious about was could the Steam controller become the Linux user's

01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:19.600
default game pad that...

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.360
So right now on Linux, when people write into the show or when we're talking about a game

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:28.360
controller, we always have to say, well, if you really want the best game controller for

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:29.360
Linux...

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.600
Buy this Microsoft product.

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:31.600
Yeah.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:32.600
And doesn't that feel a little weird?

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:33.600
A little bit, yeah.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.600
I mean, it's a great controller, but...

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:35.600
Yeah.

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.600
It's a little weird though.

01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:37.600
So I'm hoping...

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.280
Or buy this Logitech that pretends to be a Microsoft.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.280
Yeah, exactly.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.520
I'm hoping that this becomes the really solid recommendation that is also just a damn good

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:50.560
controller too, not just the fact that it's wireless, not just the fact that it has built-in

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:53.240
kernel support, not just the fact that VAL's behind it.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.720
Yeah, not just the VAL factor.

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.520
But the fact that it's a really good controller, and so...

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.440
Plus the box is really pretty that it comes in.

01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.440
I just want to...

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.440
You should keep the box.

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.440
I think my initial...

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.440
Put it up on your...

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.440
I should.

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.440
I actually should.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.440
You're right.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:06.440
I should.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.440
My initial impressions are pretty good, but I'm going to keep playing with it the rest

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.240
of the week, and I'll talk about more in Friday's Linux action show.

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:11.400
Or Ubuntu 15.10 and Friday's Linux...

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:12.400
Oh, look at this.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.760
The packaging has like a layer-by-layer breakout.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:15.760
Yeah, they did like a...

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:19.200
Probably pretty hard to see on the stream, but you can kind of see how the controller

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.200
is constructed.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.440
Yeah, they did like a schematics breakdown on there.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.440
That's really cool.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:24.440
That is...

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.440
That's neat.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.080
It's neat to have the first generation of this too.

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.080
I like that.

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.920
And I was looking at the price, so you were asking on the pre-show how much it was?

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.920
It looks like it was $49.99.

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:34.920
Oh, hey, that's not too bad.

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:35.920
No, that's not too bad.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:36.920
$49.99 is not too bad for that.

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:43.480
So, I'll give it some more testing, and on Friday's Linux action show, I'll have more

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.480
thoughts on the matter.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.480
Mumble room, any other...

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:47.480
Don't mind me.

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:48.480
Look at that.

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:49.480
Look at that.

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.760
And now I have three mice on this Bonobo.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:54.520
I've got the trackpad, the actual mouse, and now I've got the Steam controller.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:57.440
Oh, so it is just picking it up as a mouse on your desktop.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.440
Yeah, you're just...

01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.440
Yeah, you're using my desktop there.

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:00.440
Yeah.

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:01.440
Yeah.

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.560
This seems like a great pairing as well, if you have like a Steam slash Kodi box or...

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:09.280
That's what I was just thinking, is upstairs in my office, I'll often watch TV shows on

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:14.080
my Linux rig, and I use Unified Remote to be able to control it from my Android device,

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.640
but now I could just use it...

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.200
Yeah, you don't have to unlock it, you don't have to just grab it.

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.200
Yeah.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.200
I could just use it as a regular controller.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.200
Yep.

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.200
That is really cool.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:24.920
I'm really excited, and we won't spend all of the Linux action show this Friday because

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:28.480
it's going to be our Boon 2 review, but I'll give you an update on what it's like to actually

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:31.640
use it with a few games and with a few profiles and stuff like that.

01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:33.960
So, yeah, it's an exploded view.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:34.960
Exactly, Lord.

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.640
That's exactly what it is on the box.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:40.040
And I'd be curious if you've gotten one, what your experiences are, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:44.240
Heck, linuxactionshow.reddit.com is a great place to go to give us feedback on this particular

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.400
topic or anything else.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:49.400
Somebody in the Mamba Room have something they want to shut in before we wrap up?

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.280
I heard somebody open up their mic.

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.280
You're welcome to.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.280
No?

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.280
Okay, all right.

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.280
We're friendly, we promise.

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.320
OpenFaustrain, we'll have the link in the show notes, and that, right there, will signal

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:00.040
the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged Show.

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.400
Thank you very much for joining us, Mamba Room.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:02.520
We'd love to have you guys join us.

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:07.720
Go over to jblive.tv for the live show, or even better, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:08.720
calendar.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.760
Find when we're doing Linux Unplugged and join us in our virtual lug.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.080
We really do treat it that way.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.440
This is the community's lug, man.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:14.440
We love it.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:18.160
And if you can't make it to a local one in your area, at least attend a virtual one.

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:21.080
Or even if you can, why not supplement it with our virtual one?

01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:24.160
We don't judge, we're friendly, and it's the only bite when you ask.

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.160
That's true.

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.600
And honestly, honestly, we love the conversation.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.600
jblive.tv, join us.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:32.880
You can hang out in the chat room, or if you can't catch us live, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:33.880
All right, everybody.

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:36.360
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:59.400
See you back here next week.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:15.880
Thank you, everybody.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:16.880
Great show.

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:17.880
Good stuff.

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:18.880
Lots to cover this week.

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:19.880
It's all over the place.

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.880
It was going to be a hard one to title.

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.040
Boy, this Steam link is really solid.

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:23.040
Feel that thing.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.040
It feels like a solid piece of...

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:25.040
Oh, yeah.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:27.480
It's like an external hard drive, but kind of even more dense.

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.480
Yeah, it's very dense.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:32.040
JBtitles.com, let's pick a title.

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.800
That thing looks like you could throw it across the room and it'll still work.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.600
Yeah, it would put a hole through the wall.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:37.600
HDMI.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.600
Ethernet.

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:39.600
Reminds me of the Super Nintendo.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.400
Does anybody remember that beast?

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.400
Oh, yeah.

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.400
Oh, yeah.

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:44.400
Of course.

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.400
Yeah.

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:48.400
I've started using Firefox on my Android phone because it's better than Chrome.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.400
Really?

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.400
On the Android?

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:51.400
It's a ton better.

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:52.400
What's better?

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.600
Even Chrome people love it more.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.600
Really?

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.600
Really?

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.520
Versus Chrome on the Android there.

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.200
So Chrome on the Android basically does nothing.

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.200
Android does everything you need it to do.

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.200
It has add-ons.

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:08.080
It has, you know, good tabbing structure.

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.080
It's not...

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.080
And how's the sync with the desktop?

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.080
It's not incredibly limited.

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:12.080
It works fine.

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.080
Perfect.

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.080
Yeah, it works fine.

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.080
Nice.

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:16.560
It has an actual quit extension.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.560
I want to...

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.000
What's a quit extension?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.640
You can even install Android, the add-on for LastPass.

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:23.640
Great, right?

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.640
Yay!

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:25.640
Finally.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:26.640
I can finally...

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:27.640
Oh, good.

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:28.640
Good.

01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:29.640
Bit late for that.

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.640
Yeah.

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:31.640
Yeah.

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:32.640
Yeah.

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:38.960
I have a theory as to why Chrome is kind of bare bones in Android.

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:41.600
They don't want you blocking content.

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.440
For instance, Firefox has add-ons for ad control.

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:51.200
Since Google's an ad company, it would make sense that they wouldn't want to build an

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:56.440
add-on system because they don't want people creating ad blockers.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:01.320
Yeah, but then do you think they'd really be willing to make one of their most important

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:03.560
products less competitive?

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:05.320
On mobile, I think they're willing to do it.

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:09.560
I don't think they're willing to do it on desktop because otherwise Chrome wouldn't

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.520
be able to compete on the desktop.

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.520
Yeah, but there's just features...

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:18.240
They've got the advantage of being pre-installed on Android, so why would you bother installing

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.400
another browser in the same way?

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:23.760
The only reason why people install other browsers on Windows is because the one that comes with

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.480
it is crap on Android.

01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:27.240
The one that comes with it is pretty decent.

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:28.720
Well, no, it's crap.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.860
It's basically edge.

01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:32.160
It's limited.

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:33.160
It works.

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:37.120
It has support for standards, but pretty much it's limited crap.

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.720
So on the platform where they are the incumbent browser, they're the least competitive.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.560
That isn't that interesting.

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:44.560
Isn't that just exactly what Microsoft...

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.520
Well, their only real competition is Firefox, right?

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.720
That's exactly what Microsoft did.

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:51.080
As soon as they're an explorer became the incumbent browser, they just got nice and

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:52.080
lazy, didn't they?

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:53.080
Yeah.

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.200
Is it sad that I've actually been using Safari pretty regularly now?

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.200
Safari?

01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:58.200
Yes, on my phone.

01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.200
Wow.

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.200
It totally is.

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.360
I'm also going to use it on the iPhone because everything else is...

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.360
Chrome.

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:04.360
You can get Chrome.

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.360
Yeah, I know, but...

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.320
Chrome is actually a little bit nicer on the iPhone than on Android, actually, just comparison.

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:13.240
You can't really make it your default browser, though.

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:16.800
You can use it, and you can copy URLs, and some apps even have support if they detect

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.880
you have Chrome installed because they can do the URL hand...

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.680
All the Google apps will actually map you to Chrome instead of to Safari.

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:23.680
Yeah, exactly.

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:28.480
But otherwise, Safari is the default browser.

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:30.480
Actually Safari on iOS 9 doesn't seem to be that bad, but...

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:32.480
No, it's pretty okay.

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:35.560
Yeah, it is interesting.

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:58.680
State of Chrome.
