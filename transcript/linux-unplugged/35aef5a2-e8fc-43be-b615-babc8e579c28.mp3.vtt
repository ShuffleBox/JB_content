WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
I was looking at the list of people that are coming

00:01.800 --> 00:03.040
for Linux Fest Northwest.

00:03.040 --> 00:05.880
It is gonna be a huge party.

00:05.880 --> 00:06.840
Brent, you're gonna be here.

00:06.840 --> 00:07.800
I'm super excited, Brent.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.920
You oughta just stay here for a couple extra days,

00:09.920 --> 00:11.300
hang out at the studio.

00:12.760 --> 00:13.600
Yeah, so Chris.

00:13.600 --> 00:14.680
What do you mean, what do you mean, what, what?

00:14.680 --> 00:15.520
What's happening here?

00:15.520 --> 00:16.680
What do you mean, um?

00:16.680 --> 00:17.520
What do you mean, um?

00:17.520 --> 00:19.000
I thought this was a lock.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.080
Yeah, I remember saying, even on the show,

00:21.080 --> 00:24.160
it's in one of the shows that I was not not coming.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.200
I remember specifically saying.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.960
Yeah, not coming.

00:26.960 --> 00:27.800
That's a lock.

00:27.800 --> 00:31.120
I'm in this precarious place now

00:31.120 --> 00:35.040
where my very best photo client is,

00:35.040 --> 00:39.020
has just reached out to me for the exact same dates

00:39.020 --> 00:40.200
as Linux Fest Northwest.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.800
So I'm in a real pickle.

00:43.800 --> 00:48.800
So I may not be there for the festival itself,

00:49.400 --> 00:52.840
but I might like fly from Ottawa

00:52.840 --> 00:56.280
straight to the studio afterwards to see if I can maybe

00:56.280 --> 00:57.880
just catch some of the great people

00:57.880 --> 00:58.760
that are gonna be in town.

00:58.760 --> 00:59.800
Some of the afterglow?

00:59.800 --> 01:01.440
Well, what is it really about?

01:01.440 --> 01:02.280
It's about the people.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.120
That's true.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.160
And Linux Fest is kind of the bonus,

01:04.160 --> 01:05.720
so I'm gonna try to see if I can make that work.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.560
I got an idea.

01:06.560 --> 01:07.840
Okay, I got an idea for you, Brent.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.040
You bring the client to Linux Fest.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.200
They're gonna have a great time.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.800
We'll make sure they get some barbecue.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.400
So how did you know I was also thinking about that?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.400
You're kind of into podcasting, right?

01:20.400 --> 01:21.800
Good man.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.920
So I'm gonna see what I can swing here.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.920
Just give me a few days.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.920
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 289 for February 19th, 2019.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.280
Hello there and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show

01:46.280 --> 01:49.400
that this week is taking a look at the community news

01:49.400 --> 01:53.680
as it is deep diving finally into MX Linux

01:53.680 --> 01:57.560
and saying goodbye to a real trooper of a project.

01:57.560 --> 02:00.520
And then maybe, just maybe wrapping our heads

02:00.520 --> 02:04.720
around that fedora switch to the new C groups.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.320
My name is Chris and joining me every, every single week

02:08.320 --> 02:09.760
is my man, Mr. Wes Payne.

02:09.760 --> 02:10.600
Hello, Wes.

02:10.600 --> 02:11.640
Hello.

02:11.640 --> 02:12.760
Hello, Wes.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.000
It's good to be with you again here in the studio

02:15.000 --> 02:17.800
in a gray, cold Seattle day.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.640
It's easier that way.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.480
We don't have to be distracted.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.320
We're not gonna go run out and play in the sunshine

02:21.320 --> 02:22.360
because there isn't any.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.480
That's true.

02:24.480 --> 02:25.720
That's a good point, Wes.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.800
Hey, what do you think about later on in the show today

02:27.800 --> 02:29.400
talking about what it would take

02:29.400 --> 02:32.440
to make the next big Linux distro?

02:32.440 --> 02:34.600
Oh, you're getting ready to announce your distro finally.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.240
That's right, Chris, last Linux.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.400
No, I'm looking at clear Linux

02:38.400 --> 02:40.480
and I'm looking at some other projects out there

02:40.480 --> 02:42.680
and I'm thinking to myself in 2019,

02:42.680 --> 02:46.160
how do you displace your Ubuntu's of the world?

02:46.160 --> 02:49.200
How do you topple the fedora of the world?

02:49.200 --> 02:51.600
How do you get up there in that upper echelon

02:51.600 --> 02:53.160
of used distributions?

02:53.160 --> 02:54.680
So I thought maybe you and I in the mumble room

02:54.680 --> 02:56.680
could all talk about that in a little bit.

02:56.680 --> 02:59.840
And then there's a, not one, not two,

02:59.840 --> 03:01.440
let's count them right now here live on the show.

03:01.440 --> 03:06.440
One, two, three, that's right, four outrageously good picks.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.440
We may have to end the picks after this, Wes.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.880
Just call it done, yeah, we've peaked.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.040
How are we gonna do better than these picks?

03:12.040 --> 03:13.920
These right here are the very best picks.

03:13.920 --> 03:17.160
And then towards the end of the show,

03:17.160 --> 03:19.640
it's time for us to admit our shame.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.640
We have to look at our dirty, dirty home directories.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.480
When's the last time you went into your home directory

03:24.480 --> 03:26.000
and did a little LSLA?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.960
Well, I did it today earlier before the show.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.640
But before that it had been weeks

03:29.640 --> 03:32.120
and boy, it's a mess in there.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.040
It's like it's not even my own home directory.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.400
It's like it's owned by all the programs on my computer

03:36.400 --> 03:38.120
and not by me.

03:38.120 --> 03:41.400
So in a way, I mean, you would never admit to this,

03:41.400 --> 03:43.720
but you actually are bringing this particular soapbox

03:43.720 --> 03:44.540
to the show.

03:44.540 --> 03:46.480
I have a feeling I'll be the one stepping up on it,

03:46.480 --> 03:47.560
but you brought the box.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.440
You're welcome, buddy.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.000
All right, before we go any further,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.240
we absolutely have to bring in our virtual lug.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.240
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.680
Hello, everyone.

03:56.680 --> 03:57.520
Good evening.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.240
Hello, hello, hello.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.720
Hi, good to have you all here.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.160
Thank you for joining us.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.600
Are you both in the studio?

04:03.600 --> 04:04.560
Yeah, yeah.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.560
First time in ages.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.120
I guess it actually has been a while.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.640
It feels like a month or something?

04:08.640 --> 04:09.480
Maybe.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.560
I think the last time before this week I saw you

04:11.560 --> 04:13.480
was it's gotta be last year.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.560
That's true.

04:14.560 --> 04:15.400
How did you know, Brett?

04:15.400 --> 04:16.360
What was the tell?

04:16.360 --> 04:17.560
What was the giveaway?

04:17.560 --> 04:20.120
You both sound like you're in the same room.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.000
Well, that could be interesting.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.200
But also, I have to say, a little behind the scenes,

04:26.200 --> 04:29.960
the bathroom break kind of gives it away.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.840
We went to the bathroom together before the show.

04:31.840 --> 04:32.560
It's true.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.200
It's how we get on sync for the episode.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.280
Yeah, that's how we get our flow going.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.120
All right, well, let's try to dig ourselves

04:42.120 --> 04:43.300
out of that particular hole.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.920
And I wanted to start out with a new release

04:45.920 --> 04:48.040
this week of a distribution that we haven't really

04:48.040 --> 04:49.840
had an excuse to talk about much.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.800
And that's MX Linux.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.660
I've noticed more and more audience members

04:53.660 --> 04:57.280
writing into the show about this particular distribution.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.640
So that's probably what put it on my radar first.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.480
But it's got a few things about it that appeal.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.280
And I thought, you know what?

05:04.280 --> 05:07.440
This new release they have, it's time to give it a go.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.680
So MX 18.1 came out.

05:09.680 --> 05:13.440
It's not a particularly huge release on their part.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.520
It's mostly consisting of bug fixes and application updates

05:16.520 --> 05:18.720
since the 18 release.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.280
One thing of note is it does have that apt fix in there

05:21.280 --> 05:25.360
we covered a few days ago, or a few episodes ago.

05:25.360 --> 05:29.360
But here's what's neat about MX Linux.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.880
And I'll tell you, I think I'm kind of falling

05:32.880 --> 05:34.360
in love right off the top here.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.320
So my bias is strong right now.

05:37.320 --> 05:43.000
It's based off of Debian 9.8, which is a great release.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.880
It's using XFCE as a desktop environment.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.960
But it's a nice, clean, Unity rip-off style XFCE.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.300
Yeah, I mean, I don't think you'd

05:52.300 --> 05:55.120
be able to identify it unless you were a serious desktop

05:55.120 --> 05:55.600
geek.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.540
Yeah, I mean, looking at this right now,

05:57.540 --> 06:00.160
you've got the sidebar launcher.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.200
You've got icons there that are nice.

06:03.200 --> 06:07.920
I've turned on the dark mode for the GTK theme.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.600
It doesn't look anything like it.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.320
It's XFCE, but not like I've ever used it.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.400
Right, I think the biggest thing is you have the sidebar,

06:13.400 --> 06:14.840
but there's no top or bottom bar.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.480
So it's kind of a different feeling.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.520
They've got a conky style background

06:19.520 --> 06:23.120
where I've got my CPU usage and the clock on there.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.640
And the other thing they do is they include a couple of cool

06:25.640 --> 06:30.420
MX tools, like things that manage your boot environment,

06:30.420 --> 06:33.820
or set up the NVIDIA driver, or install codecs.

06:33.820 --> 06:38.420
And they also include a simple MX package installer.

06:38.420 --> 06:40.480
They have a menu system that pops up,

06:40.480 --> 06:42.140
and you go in there, and right in there,

06:42.140 --> 06:44.080
they have the package installer selected.

06:44.080 --> 06:47.020
And in here, they have a stable repo.

06:47.020 --> 06:48.900
They have the MX test repo.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.880
They have Debian backports.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.120
And they have flat packs, all just right here.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.600
And you can do a search in different categories

06:56.600 --> 06:59.360
to see if they have the applications in those particular areas.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.160
And I wanted to try out to see how easy it

07:01.160 --> 07:02.440
would be to install Chrome.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.840
It's a bit of a benchmark of mine.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.320
Like, how quick do I get to Chrome on a desktop environment?

07:07.320 --> 07:09.240
Kind of like a standard proprietary application

07:09.240 --> 07:11.160
that you actually do need.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.720
And in their popular applications category,

07:13.720 --> 07:16.680
when you search for Chrome, it comes right up, right up,

07:16.680 --> 07:18.960
and installs with Flash and all of that.

07:18.960 --> 07:19.900
Really nice.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.400
It reminds me a little bit, I mean,

07:21.400 --> 07:23.000
this is going way, way, way back.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.840
But if you remember the Drac tools in Mandrake,

07:26.840 --> 07:30.000
or if you're familiar with Yast in OpenSUSE,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.880
MX tools is similar to those, but cleaner, simpler, and more

07:33.880 --> 07:37.920
efficient, and probably a little simpler design, too.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.240
There's a few other things in here

07:39.240 --> 07:41.880
that just bring up command line utilities, like quick system

07:41.880 --> 07:42.560
info.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.760
So I'm running it right here.

07:43.760 --> 07:48.260
I decided to put it on my main studio system.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.840
And I got to say, Wes, just using this thing,

07:50.840 --> 07:52.440
I'm going to launch the file manager.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.360
Watch how fast this sucker pops up, pow.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.440
Oh, that was snappy.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.200
No wasted time on boring graphical effects.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.600
You don't even see the border of the window render.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.200
It's just instantaneous.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.640
It's instantaneous.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.160
And of course, it's because we're talking Thunar here.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.920
We're using Thunar, so it's a little lighter weight

08:07.920 --> 08:08.560
and things like that.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.520
But it's still great.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.960
I mean, Thunar's kind of proven itself over the years.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.760
You know what made me do this?

08:14.760 --> 08:16.160
We had those issues recently.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.360
So yesterday.

08:17.360 --> 08:18.400
I thought you were going to say the little Joe

08:18.400 --> 08:19.920
Resington in your ear.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.240
Well, I think that might have made me really kind of,

08:23.240 --> 08:25.560
all right, I'll try out XFCE, damn it.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.760
It's just it's XFCE that doesn't look like a bastard.

08:27.760 --> 08:28.400
That's the part.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.040
I like XFCE, but I don't always like going through all the work

08:31.040 --> 08:33.240
to style it, and theme it, and make it look modern.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.200
It's a bit much.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.600
Yeah.

08:35.600 --> 08:39.120
But we ran into this weird, weird issue.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.000
This is the only system in our studio that's running Neon.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.200
All of our studio systems run Kubuntu 18.04,

08:45.200 --> 08:47.960
with the exception of the presentation system, which

08:47.960 --> 08:50.960
is actually captured by OBS and sent out on the stream.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.480
For that, we like to showcase the latest Plasma,

08:53.480 --> 08:54.920
the latest application releases.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.280
It ends up being something of a test machine at times,

08:57.280 --> 08:58.080
playing with stuff.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.920
So this one was running Neon, Neon,

09:00.920 --> 09:02.120
which has been pretty solid.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.360
It's been running it for over a year.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.920
However, I came back from Texas, got here in the studio,

09:06.920 --> 09:08.280
and I thought, you know what, Self?

09:08.280 --> 09:09.440
Let's do a system update.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.160
It's been a while.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.120
So responsible.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.000
There's new packages to install.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.240
Got to keep the system secure.

09:14.240 --> 09:18.680
And I have two sides to me on this issue.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.400
Part of me is like, don't ever change the systems.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.800
Everything stays static.

09:22.800 --> 09:23.360
Lock it down.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.600
That's the old school mentality.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.360
The least change possible, things won't break.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.080
Yeah.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.240
That would be a very predictable, reliable approach

09:31.240 --> 09:35.280
to managing the studio system, but not the most secure.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.720
But then there's that righteous side of me.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.840
It's like, well, screw this.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.400
If I can't update my operating system and keep it secure,

09:42.400 --> 09:44.160
then it is a clown show.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.560
And these things are connected to the internet, after all.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.280
I literally said that to you yesterday.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.720
You did say exactly those words.

09:48.720 --> 09:49.880
And I mean, it's true, right?

09:49.880 --> 09:52.600
We should be able to do, especially even with Neon,

09:52.600 --> 09:54.560
on an LTS base, we should be able to do

09:54.560 --> 09:56.160
simple security updates.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.000
Yes.

09:57.000 --> 09:57.720
Yes.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.560
I mean, that's why I'm running an LTS.

09:59.560 --> 10:00.560
Exactly.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.680
So, and that's what Neon's based on.

10:02.680 --> 10:06.280
However, I recognize that it is more of a showcase

10:06.280 --> 10:07.880
of new plasma technology.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.840
They certainly wouldn't suggest that you deploy it

10:09.840 --> 10:11.880
in your podcasting studio.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.400
But we had this crazy ass issue yesterday.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.160
After all of the updates were done,

10:17.160 --> 10:19.560
we had this problem where the EFI boot

10:19.560 --> 10:23.960
managing software called EFI Manager Signed, I think it was.

10:23.960 --> 10:24.440
Yeah.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.960
I mean, it was the package that contained

10:25.960 --> 10:29.320
like a bunch of the sign stuff and the shim to do UEFI.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.600
And it wouldn't install.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.760
It wouldn't finish setting up.

10:31.760 --> 10:32.240
Right.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.400
It would not fully get through all of the D package

10:34.400 --> 10:35.360
configuring.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.640
What did we ultimately do to solve that problem?

10:37.640 --> 10:39.240
We booted into a live environment.

10:39.240 --> 10:39.400
Yeah.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.400
We did a little troubleshooting.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.680
And then we just booted into a live environment,

10:41.680 --> 10:43.480
partially, to see like, would it boot?

10:43.480 --> 10:43.640
Yeah.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.800
We suspected it was borked.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.080
And it definitely was.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.880
So I just want to make it clear.

10:47.880 --> 10:52.040
My Ubuntu LTS system borked after I did a system

10:52.040 --> 10:54.040
apt update, upgrade.

10:54.040 --> 10:54.720
Normal way, yeah.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.400
That's all I did is I did sudo apt update, sudo apt upgrade.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.080
I didn't do a dist upgrade.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.960
I just did a sudo apt upgrade.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.800
And what broke wasn't a plasma package.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.480
What broke was some of the low-level boot stuff.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.440
Yeah, we were getting some strange errors about being out

11:09.440 --> 11:12.360
of dist space, despite not actually appearing that way.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.800
And it just wouldn't install.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.800
Also, there was probably a kernel upgrade in there.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.840
So obviously, some complications around trying

11:17.840 --> 11:20.760
to get all the new, like the new kernel in InterRAMFS

11:20.760 --> 11:23.160
linked up with the UEFI system.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.960
End of the day, we had to go chroot into there,

11:25.960 --> 11:29.080
uninstall all of the grub stuff, and do a reinstall.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.160
For some reason, that worked.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.400
Yeah, that did work.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.560
Yeah, I mean, and I knew you and I together

11:35.560 --> 11:37.160
would be able to solve that no problem.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.320
I was not worried about it.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.920
I knew we'd get it recovered.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.380
In fact, I've never had an Ubuntu system that I have not

11:42.380 --> 11:43.460
been able to recover yet.

11:43.460 --> 11:46.040
That has not been an issue.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.600
But there is that thing inside my brain that's like, well,

11:48.600 --> 11:49.320
wait a minute, man.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.640
You didn't do anything weird.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.260
You just did an update and then a reboot,

11:54.260 --> 11:56.920
and your system was completely hosed.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.760
And that's sad with me, because this is my studio.

12:00.760 --> 12:01.640
It sits with me.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.540
So when an opportunity came around

12:03.540 --> 12:06.080
to try something that was perhaps Debian-based,

12:06.080 --> 12:08.960
and now I've learned also is using also a lot.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.560
It's not really like when you go in here,

12:10.560 --> 12:13.640
you're setting also settings, not pulse audio settings,

12:13.640 --> 12:15.640
which could be better for us.

12:15.640 --> 12:16.960
We have had some issues.

12:16.960 --> 12:20.600
That's an angle that does appeal to me, especially simplicity.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.280
The less moving parts, we don't need fancy features,

12:23.280 --> 12:24.440
at least on these machines.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.800
We just need a basic system.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.600
Our laptops, maybe that's one thing, right?

12:27.600 --> 12:30.960
But these systems here that are running 24-7 in the studio,

12:30.960 --> 12:32.080
simplicity.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.360
And MX Linux is super fast.

12:34.360 --> 12:37.920
It's based on Debian, which I trust and know how to use.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.400
And it has a bunch of these tools

12:39.400 --> 12:43.400
that sort of fill in the rough edges that I think you could

12:43.400 --> 12:44.480
look at them in two ways.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.020
In some ways, it's a warning sign

12:46.020 --> 12:48.040
that a distribution needs these tools.

12:48.040 --> 12:53.480
You know, like in here is fixed GPG keys, fixed boot

12:53.480 --> 12:54.640
environment.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.160
Why do we need that?

12:56.160 --> 12:59.320
But at the same time, I just had my boot environment break.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.320
Yeah, right.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.240
So it's not all the way on your own.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.480
It's not arch or gen 2.

13:03.480 --> 13:06.320
You're not left in the weeds, or even just like doing a manual

13:06.320 --> 13:07.920
Debian install.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.840
But I like their phrasing.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.840
They call it a mid-weight distribution, which

13:11.840 --> 13:13.000
you don't hear all the time.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.800
So it's not all the way full featured,

13:14.800 --> 13:16.080
but you have a few niceties.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.440
Well, this is a combination of a couple of projects.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.560
So you've got MIPS in here.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.600
I mean, you remember MIPS Linux and not

13:21.600 --> 13:25.680
MIPS, or not like the MIPS processor, but MIPS or M-E-P-I-S?

13:25.680 --> 13:26.760
Yes.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.160
So you've got a couple of different distros.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.360
Right, and Anti-X too, right?

13:30.360 --> 13:31.860
That's some of the folks from there.

13:31.860 --> 13:33.240
Yes, exactly.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.280
And I think it's a good example of a distribution that

13:36.280 --> 13:38.600
plays well with others, because there's also

13:38.600 --> 13:41.520
like a minimal version of sort of the same group

13:41.520 --> 13:44.160
that people are working on a minimal version of Linux.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.160
And this is a mid-level version of Linux.

13:46.160 --> 13:49.200
And it's a good example of cross-community pollination.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.360
And I think it's kind of what's leading to its success.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.080
Their forms are very active.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.760
You've got the overall support network of Debian.

13:55.760 --> 13:56.280
Right.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.120
Yeah, between the support and the availability of software,

13:58.120 --> 13:58.920
that's huge.

13:58.920 --> 14:03.240
Right, whereas like Ubuntu is ultimately based on Debian,

14:03.240 --> 14:05.600
MX Linux is Debian.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.020
It is a Debian install.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.200
And there is a difference there.

14:09.200 --> 14:13.960
And there is perhaps, perhaps, an end result

14:13.960 --> 14:16.000
that I'll see differently in a simplification

14:16.000 --> 14:17.320
here of our audio stack.

14:17.320 --> 14:17.680
So we'll see.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.600
I'm going to try it for a little while.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.400
Yeah, that's what I was going to ask.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.000
You're going to leave it on here.

14:20.000 --> 14:20.500
Oh, yeah.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.560
Oh, yeah, 100%.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.920
Yeah, I thought I'd throw it on for the day.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.240
And I was going to just have a laugh and call it good.

14:27.240 --> 14:31.740
But damn, that just means Joe's going to be right.

14:31.740 --> 14:32.240
Crap.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.240
Well, I don't know.

14:33.240 --> 14:33.520
I don't know.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.880
That's fine, as long as we do it in our own way, you know.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.480
Right, it's a pretty version of XFCE, right?

14:38.480 --> 14:39.920
And we'll tweak it and stuff.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.360
I'll install Jack on there later.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.520
All right, thanks.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.880
That makes me feel a lot better, Wes.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.500
That makes me feel a little bit better.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.960
Anyways, MX Linux 18.1, if you've

14:47.960 --> 14:49.720
been looking for a new Linux that

14:49.720 --> 14:52.720
is based on a tried and true distro like Debian,

14:52.720 --> 14:53.800
give it a spin.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.840
Give it a spin.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.680
I don't think it's going to, you know,

14:57.680 --> 14:59.180
we're going to ultimately later today,

14:59.180 --> 15:01.480
we're going to talk about what makes the next big distro.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.940
I don't think it's going to be that.

15:02.940 --> 15:04.600
But I think for people like me, I

15:04.600 --> 15:06.200
think it's filling a pretty good use case.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.120
It's almost a nice thing, right?

15:07.120 --> 15:07.680
You don't need it.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.200
You're not looking for a project with huge, ambitious goals.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.120
You want simple.

15:11.120 --> 15:11.880
Yeah.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.360
I really do just want something that just works, Wes.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.400
I just want it to work.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.640
I've never installed gnu slash Linux.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.720
Who brought him in here?

15:19.720 --> 15:20.920
Who brought that guy in here?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.160
Well, we mentioned, you know, Linux.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.420
Yeah, I guess so.

15:24.420 --> 15:27.460
So you may notice, we're sitting around the show today.

15:27.460 --> 15:31.960
And our buddies from Canonical are not here this week.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.640
They're out doing not only, I guess,

15:35.640 --> 15:39.260
what they call an engineering sprint, as it were,

15:39.260 --> 15:42.800
but it's turned into a full-fledged multimedia

15:42.800 --> 15:44.080
production.

15:44.080 --> 15:54.480
So our friends over at Canonical have

15:54.480 --> 15:56.760
been doing these SnapCraft summits for a while.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.040
I went to one.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.480
And it's pretty intense and pretty interesting

16:01.480 --> 16:05.440
because there is a lot of pressure to get work done.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.640
And then there's also a pressure to socialize, too.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.200
You're seeing all these people you don't often get to see.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.000
And you know, they're just a fun bunch.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.960
But it kind of all happens behind closed doors.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.880
It all kind of happens out of the view of the community.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.340
And that's a bit of a shame because I

16:20.340 --> 16:22.240
think there's takeaways from the people that

16:22.240 --> 16:23.800
are involved outside of Canonical that

16:23.800 --> 16:25.640
are there trying to solve their problems.

16:25.640 --> 16:28.320
Like, I got a tremendous amount of insight

16:28.320 --> 16:31.920
talking to some AWS engineers and the Plex packaging

16:31.920 --> 16:35.060
individual at the last SnapCraft summit.

16:35.060 --> 16:41.320
Like, it just opened my eyes to the scale of AWS, which

16:41.320 --> 16:42.640
you always need a resetting.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.440
When you're not intimately familiar with how

16:44.440 --> 16:46.480
the scale of AWS, anytime you get an opportunity

16:46.480 --> 16:49.280
to talk to an AWS engineer and appreciate the scale they're

16:49.280 --> 16:51.000
dealing with, it's mind blowing.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.800
You realize that the units you normally talk in

16:52.800 --> 16:53.520
are way too small.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.880
No, they're adorable is what they are.

16:54.880 --> 16:55.920
They're adorable.

16:55.920 --> 16:59.640
And then the issues that groups like Plex face trying

16:59.640 --> 17:03.520
to package up the Plex server onto Netgear NASes

17:03.520 --> 17:06.240
and onto every individual particular type of operating

17:06.240 --> 17:06.740
system.

17:06.740 --> 17:07.320
No, thank you.

17:07.320 --> 17:08.040
It's crazy.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.520
It's absolute craziness.

17:09.520 --> 17:12.640
But that doesn't translate to a public understanding.

17:12.640 --> 17:16.020
It doesn't really inform the rest of the Linux community

17:16.020 --> 17:18.640
about what these people are trying to solve.

17:18.640 --> 17:22.600
And that's where I think things could be beginning to change,

17:22.600 --> 17:25.080
depending on how much the folks over at Canonical

17:25.080 --> 17:26.320
are willing to share.

17:26.320 --> 17:31.040
But famous internet leaker, Alan Pope,

17:31.040 --> 17:34.480
is live streaming the SnapCraft Summits.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.040
They're calling these a Bootstrap Summit.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.600
Yeah, they say, we've run a few in-person SnapCraft Summits,

17:39.600 --> 17:41.760
bringing together application developers and experts

17:41.760 --> 17:43.160
from SnapCraft and Linux security

17:43.160 --> 17:45.840
to help get software into the Snap store.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.040
Often, it's paired programming.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.280
And they build a Snap together, and that accelerates

17:50.280 --> 17:52.200
the developer's knowledge and understanding.

17:52.200 --> 17:52.700
Right?

17:52.700 --> 17:53.200
It's great.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.320
I mean, that makes a lot of sense,

17:54.320 --> 17:56.480
especially if you're trying to, you know the application.

17:56.480 --> 17:59.400
Someone on their side knows the packaging technology.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.720
I think this would, if Flatpak could pull this off,

18:01.720 --> 18:04.000
this would serve Flatpak really well.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.700
But the goal of SnapCraft Live is

18:05.700 --> 18:07.360
to bootstrap developers in building snaps

18:07.360 --> 18:09.440
and publish them into the Snap store.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.160
We will cover the tools and set up

18:11.160 --> 18:14.080
required best practices and recommended processes.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.720
We also have an opportunity to ask the experts who

18:16.720 --> 18:19.600
sit in the live stream alongside the live session

18:19.600 --> 18:20.800
and ask them questions.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.040
So they will be live streaming some of these.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.960
They've already done one, the kickoff episode.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.320
They built a few simple snaps.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.760
They had a few people sit around and answer some questions.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.480
And they're going to be doing more of this.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.600
There was a second episode on February 13th

18:34.600 --> 18:38.400
where they did a complex application example.

18:38.400 --> 18:43.320
And long term, I think this is a pretty savvy way

18:43.320 --> 18:47.520
to get the word out on what is involved in packaging

18:47.520 --> 18:50.640
software for Linux and what particularly

18:50.640 --> 18:53.200
these universal packaging formats are solving.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.000
Because you have people listening today

18:55.000 --> 18:57.720
that still don't get it.

18:57.720 --> 19:02.080
And I think this kind of thing is maybe, maybe

19:02.080 --> 19:05.280
the move Canonical needs to make to better explain

19:05.280 --> 19:06.640
the value that these bring.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.340
It is interesting, right?

19:07.340 --> 19:10.240
We're watching them try to grow this new ecosystem

19:10.240 --> 19:11.360
of applications.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.840
So it's a whole new marketplace.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.320
Well, and from a business standpoint,

19:15.320 --> 19:18.940
you've got Canonical spending considerable sums of money

19:18.940 --> 19:20.800
flying all these people to Malta.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.200
I mean, there's a big push on this in all kinds

19:23.200 --> 19:24.520
of directions on their side.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.080
So if they can reach more people through these live streams,

19:27.080 --> 19:29.540
that would be a much, much more effective use of their time.

19:29.540 --> 19:32.080
But as an audience, as a viewer, it

19:32.080 --> 19:34.320
gives you an opportunity to get insight

19:34.320 --> 19:37.400
into how software is built and made for Linux.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.880
And I can't stress how informational that can be.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.200
It changed my perspective on so many things

19:43.200 --> 19:44.600
witnessing this firsthand.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.320
And now you can do it via live streams.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.760
It's not necessarily the same exact thing as being there.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.320
But man, that's a heck of a lot better

19:50.320 --> 19:51.440
than what it was before when it was just

19:51.440 --> 19:52.840
all behind closed doors.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.640
So hats off here to Popi for pulling that off.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.760
And hopefully, it gets a little traction.

19:57.760 --> 19:58.720
People go check this out, and it's

19:58.720 --> 19:59.960
something they can keep doing.

19:59.960 --> 20:00.640
Yeah, I hope so.

20:00.640 --> 20:03.800
And more and more, especially, Popi will come on this show.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.520
And by the end of the episode, he's

20:05.520 --> 20:07.240
snapped up some new application.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.240
If you watch this, you can probably

20:08.240 --> 20:09.920
go decipher it and snap up applications

20:09.920 --> 20:11.040
that you might want snapped.

20:11.040 --> 20:11.560
That's true.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.880
Yeah, last week, we covered that Solitaire on the command line.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.160
And then by the before our show notes were done.

20:17.160 --> 20:18.880
Yeah, before the notes were even finalized,

20:18.880 --> 20:21.480
he had snapped up the Solitaire command line application.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.000
Yeah, so go out there, go check out what they're doing,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.040
and really get an insight into what it's

20:26.040 --> 20:27.600
like to ship software for Linux.

20:27.600 --> 20:30.400
And I say thank you to Popi for actually streaming that thing,

20:30.400 --> 20:33.840
because having gone to those, I'd say they're super insightful.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.560
And with a live chat room, you can always ask questions.

20:36.560 --> 20:37.920
Live at Malta!

20:37.920 --> 20:51.720
Now, the next story we have in the community news is a bit,

20:51.720 --> 20:54.400
I don't know how you describe this one, Wes, it's like sad.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.920
It's also extremely encouraging.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.600
And it's a victory story for open source.

21:00.600 --> 21:04.000
And it's an opportunity for a possible new direction.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.240
But it starts with saying goodbye to the maintainer

21:09.240 --> 21:12.680
of the Shorewall project, which is a really brilliant way

21:12.680 --> 21:15.480
to set up IP tables, makes it super simple,

21:15.480 --> 21:17.280
and easy for end users.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.360
So on TechStamp, we were just talking about Firehole,

21:19.360 --> 21:20.600
which is an alternative.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.360
And by far and away, any time you bring that up,

21:23.360 --> 21:25.040
the very first thing that gets said,

21:25.040 --> 21:26.560
unless it's someone who's just trolling you and be like,

21:26.560 --> 21:29.520
just learn IP tables, is go use Shorewall.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.480
It is kind of dominant, unless you're already

21:31.480 --> 21:33.440
doing Firewall D or UFW.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.400
Yeah.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.960
And it's been mentioned a few times on this show.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.800
It doesn't quite get the attention that Firehole does,

21:39.800 --> 21:41.000
or that maybe PSN does.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.080
It's one of those earlier generations

21:43.080 --> 21:44.640
of open source projects, because it has

21:44.640 --> 21:46.400
been around for a long time.

21:46.400 --> 21:50.200
But its website might not be flashy, but it works.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.600
And it's also, it's got some of those core values

21:52.600 --> 21:54.160
that you want from an edge application

21:54.160 --> 21:55.840
like this, something that's just been around,

21:55.840 --> 21:58.280
it's been reliable, steady, maintained.

21:58.280 --> 22:02.840
Well, the Shorewall maintainer, his name is Tom.

22:02.840 --> 22:03.680
Tom Estep.

22:03.680 --> 22:04.800
Estep, yep.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.320
And I did not know this until today.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.680
He's based in Shoreline, Washington.

22:08.680 --> 22:11.520
I drove past his residence, surely, on my way up here.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.680
40 minutes from the studio.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.960
Man, I'd love to buy that guy a beer.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.440
Boy, Tom, if you happen to listen to Linux Unplugged Show,

22:18.440 --> 22:21.680
reach out to me, chris at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.000
If you ever make it up to Linux Fest Northwest,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I swear to God, man, beer on me.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.800
Or whatever your beverage of choice is.

22:27.800 --> 22:28.560
Could be a glass of water.

22:28.560 --> 22:28.960
We could be halfway.

22:28.960 --> 22:29.720
We'll go to Muckle Tio.

22:29.720 --> 22:30.280
We'll be fine.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.800
I'd like to shake your hand.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.120
So he writes, I'm now in my mid-70s

22:34.120 --> 22:38.160
and have spent almost 50 years in tech-related industries.

22:38.160 --> 22:40.800
More than three years ago, I retired from my position

22:40.800 --> 22:42.760
at Helium Packard Enterprise.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.760
And while I've continued to develop and support Shorewall,

22:45.760 --> 22:49.800
I feel that it is now my time to say goodbye.

22:49.800 --> 22:54.040
Shorewall 5.2.3 will be my last Shorewall release.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.600
If you find problems with that release,

22:55.600 --> 22:57.120
I will attempt to resolve them.

22:57.120 --> 23:01.120
But I am now departing on an extended trip

23:01.120 --> 23:03.960
to visit some, oh man, he won't make it to Linux Fest then.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.040
He's departing on an extended trip

23:06.040 --> 23:08.560
to visit some of the places in the world that I've always

23:08.560 --> 23:10.840
dreamed of seeing.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.040
That's a pretty good reason.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.040
That is.

23:13.040 --> 23:13.560
That is.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.360
You've earned it.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.600
No kidding.

23:15.600 --> 23:18.120
50 years in IT.

23:18.120 --> 23:19.200
And he's survived.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.920
Can you imagine the change he has seen in 50 years?

23:21.920 --> 23:23.120
And then towards the tip of that,

23:23.120 --> 23:26.200
to be working on Linux and IP tables.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.240
Wow.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.740
Yeah, just doing Linux and IP tables for the past 10 years

23:29.740 --> 23:32.440
has been a crazy amount of change, but then 50 years.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.960
With 50 years of perspective, Linux

23:33.960 --> 23:35.320
is still the new operating system.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.600
Sure is, yeah.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.920
That's just mind bending.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.560
I would love to pick his brain about some of those changes.

23:40.560 --> 23:41.440
Yes.

23:41.440 --> 23:41.880
I don't know.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.080
I don't know where this goes next.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.520
The project is a healthy project.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.760
I hope to see it get picked up.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.280
He says, most of all, he ends with, most of all,

23:48.280 --> 23:51.560
I want to thank all of you who have used Shorewall

23:51.560 --> 23:54.480
and who have helped make it better over the years.

23:54.480 --> 23:57.240
You are the ones that I will miss the most.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.320
That's just really sweet.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.840
It really is a great example of open source

24:00.840 --> 24:02.920
and the huge amount of time and investment

24:02.920 --> 24:05.040
that volunteers put into these projects.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.840
And talk about, I mean, just talk about a classy way

24:07.840 --> 24:08.880
to sign off.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.160
Not a rage quit, not a burnout quit, but like, you know,

24:12.160 --> 24:12.680
in my 70s.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.000
Just enough personal information.

24:14.000 --> 24:14.760
Yeah.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.000
And I mean, he does make it clear, too,

24:16.000 --> 24:17.840
that he's happy to help future maintainers.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.040
Like, Shorewall doesn't need to die.

24:20.040 --> 24:20.960
I don't think it will.

24:20.960 --> 24:21.880
I don't think so either.

24:21.880 --> 24:22.840
It's got so much momentum.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.400
Especially if you've got Tom sticking around

24:24.400 --> 24:25.600
willing to answer questions.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.680
I think that makes a huge difference.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.640
Even if he can only do it when he's somewhere

24:28.640 --> 24:30.440
with connectivity as he travels the world.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.440
Various Wi-Fi hotspots around the globe.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.240
Oh, man.

24:34.240 --> 24:38.200
If you use Shorewall, I don't think

24:38.200 --> 24:39.520
you have much to worry about.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.560
Plus, the underlying IP tables is not going anywhere.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.520
It's not going anywhere anytime soon.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.360
That's one of the great things about these.

24:45.360 --> 24:50.320
You know, if you think about this, just as an aside,

24:50.320 --> 24:52.440
in the commercial world, you'd probably

24:52.440 --> 24:56.040
have some sort of custom-grown firewall solution

24:56.040 --> 24:59.200
that is at end of life now.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.920
If the company, if you've got a small business that

25:01.920 --> 25:03.480
develops this product, this happens all the time

25:03.480 --> 25:05.720
in enterprise, if you've got a small business that develops

25:05.720 --> 25:08.080
the product and the guy decides he's going to close up shop,

25:08.080 --> 25:08.800
that's it.

25:08.800 --> 25:09.800
No more releases.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.080
But with open source, you can look at that and go,

25:12.080 --> 25:15.120
yeah, you know, we've got five Shorewall boxes in production,

25:15.120 --> 25:17.840
but they're all using standard IP tables.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.880
So we've got nothing to worry about here.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.880
You can move tables, tools.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.280
You can just save that state.

25:23.280 --> 25:23.840
It doesn't matter.

25:23.840 --> 25:24.920
I think that's pretty cool.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.240
I mean, it just shows some of the wisdom, right?

25:27.240 --> 25:29.120
Like, it doesn't matter if you're using Firehole

25:29.120 --> 25:30.520
or Shorewall or UFW.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.440
Because we have a common kernel interface,

25:32.440 --> 25:33.680
we can use whatever tools we want.

25:33.680 --> 25:34.160
Yep.

25:34.160 --> 25:34.640
That's it.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.120
That is it.

25:35.120 --> 25:35.480
Thank you.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.040
You put that much better than I was.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.920
All right, well, let's talk about a big upgrade.

25:38.920 --> 25:47.600
I've been playing a lot of Mario recently.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.800
I've been playing a lot of Mario.

25:48.800 --> 25:49.400
It's showing.

25:49.400 --> 25:49.960
Yeah.

25:49.960 --> 25:50.560
You're happier.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.080
It's nice.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.520
I am very pleased, too, with the new release of Geary.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.080
Geary 0.13.0.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.160
I thought I was never going to talk about Geary again.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.880
Honestly, I thought the same way.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.120
Not that I didn't want to talk about it.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.520
It just hadn't been updated.

26:01.520 --> 26:02.360
No.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.960
No, and it was getting a little rough.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.400
It was getting a little rough.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.880
But it is under new maintainership now.

26:07.880 --> 26:11.280
And version 0.13 is a major release,

26:11.280 --> 26:13.240
featuring a number of new features,

26:13.240 --> 26:16.680
including some brand new user interfaces for creating

26:16.680 --> 26:19.040
and managing email accounts, integration

26:19.040 --> 26:21.720
with GNOME Online accounts, which, by the way,

26:21.720 --> 26:23.340
means if GNOME Online accounts is broken,

26:23.340 --> 26:24.440
the Geary is also broken.

26:24.440 --> 26:25.920
Side note.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.120
Not that I would know.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.080
Improving and displaying of conversations,

26:29.080 --> 26:33.160
composing new emails, kind of a key feature, improved.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.560
Interacting with other email apps has been improved.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.080
Reporting problems has been improved.

26:37.080 --> 26:38.720
And a number of important bug fixes,

26:38.720 --> 26:41.560
server compatibility fixes, and security fixes.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.760
And the latest version is available as a flat pack.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.040
So you know what I did?

26:45.040 --> 26:47.000
Gave it a go.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.880
Now, I have got about three inboxes that I'll attach.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.520
The inbox that has the least amount of unread messages

26:54.520 --> 26:56.820
is around 4,000 unread messages.

26:56.820 --> 26:58.520
There's about 30,000 read messages.

26:58.520 --> 26:59.760
It's like an iceberg, yeah.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.380
So I can really stress test these applications.

27:02.380 --> 27:04.760
And I got to say, Wes, my order of op

27:04.760 --> 27:08.640
was add my Google account to GNOME Online accounts.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.400
So you're going system wide here, yeah.

27:10.400 --> 27:13.840
Fedora 29, I added it to GNOME Online accounts.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.520
Then I installed the Geary flat pack.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.560
Launched Geary, immediately had all my stuff.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.600
Immediately had everything.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.600
All set up, ready to go.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.520
That's like Apple level slick.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.000
It was.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.880
It was like you log into iCloud on the Mac,

27:25.880 --> 27:28.280
and then you open up Mail, and it's just, I presume.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.840
I actually don't think that actually works on the Mac.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.800
Now, they talk about it, but it should.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.500
It should work like that on the Mac.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.320
But it does with Geary now.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.240
And you know what's crazy about that, right?

27:37.240 --> 27:38.280
I'm putting all of that.

27:38.280 --> 27:39.880
I mean, it's not crazy, but it's great.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.320
I'm putting all of that information

27:41.320 --> 27:43.720
into the GNOME Online account system settings.

27:43.720 --> 27:46.880
And a sandboxed flat pack application

27:46.880 --> 27:48.800
still gets to go find all of that detail.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.800
Right, and respects my dark mode theme, all that stuff.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.240
We have come a long way.

27:54.240 --> 27:54.920
Yeah.

27:54.920 --> 27:55.800
It looks really good.

27:55.800 --> 27:56.880
I sent you a screenshot.

27:56.880 --> 27:57.280
You did.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.080
That was beautiful.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.240
So do you think it'll hang around?

27:59.240 --> 28:00.240
Are you going to keep using it for a bit?

28:00.240 --> 28:01.280
Absolutely.

28:01.280 --> 28:01.840
Yeah.

28:01.840 --> 28:02.360
Wow.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.500
See, because that's a big change,

28:03.500 --> 28:05.520
because I feel like just a month ago,

28:05.520 --> 28:08.120
we were like, there are no desktop email clients to use.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.000
I'm like, I got to buy an iPad to do email,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.840
because I can't even Linux right now.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.840
And we'll see, you know?

28:14.840 --> 28:15.680
We'll see.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.200
You have to wait a little while to find

28:17.200 --> 28:18.880
what little tiny details are wrong.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.040
But I can already tell you, some of the paper cuts

28:21.040 --> 28:22.840
I used to have with the older version of Geary

28:22.840 --> 28:24.040
have been taken care of.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.200
So huge, huge improvement.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.820
Version 13, 0.13 is out.

28:28.820 --> 28:30.540
You can grab it as a flat pack.

28:30.540 --> 28:33.720
And I recommend it.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.840
If you look at the enhancements in this release,

28:36.840 --> 28:40.240
it's literally every major aspect of the application.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.200
Just a huge congratulations to them.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.360
And then while we're talking about great open source

28:44.360 --> 28:46.840
applications getting an update or an upgrade,

28:46.840 --> 28:49.960
our favorite photo management application, well,

28:49.960 --> 28:55.640
maybe one of the favorites, DigiCam 6.00 is released.

28:55.640 --> 28:59.400
And now, Brett, I realized when you and I have talked before,

28:59.400 --> 29:00.840
you're more of a dark table guy.

29:00.840 --> 29:01.960
I was going to say it's our favorite,

29:01.960 --> 29:04.080
but dark table might be our actual favorite, right?

29:04.080 --> 29:06.480
Well, you know, you're including all of us.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.720
For me, definitely dark table has done what I need it to.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.240
But DigiCam does something a little bit different.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.400
So it depends sort of which angle you're coming at.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.120
And some people absolutely love it.

29:16.120 --> 29:20.640
I've used it a lot for more personal side photo

29:20.640 --> 29:21.640
kind of management.

29:21.640 --> 29:24.000
And for that, it certainly works great.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.320
And it's awesome to see the software keep evolving.

29:26.320 --> 29:29.000
So definitely anyone who's looking

29:29.000 --> 29:30.920
for that type of software should check it out.

29:30.920 --> 29:34.800
So you do a breakdown of you have one photo management

29:34.800 --> 29:36.560
application for your personal pictures.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.360
And then for those listening that don't know,

29:38.360 --> 29:40.320
Brent is a professional photographer

29:40.320 --> 29:41.800
that uses Linux for his workflow.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.720
And then you have a separate application

29:43.720 --> 29:45.300
for your pro app, for your pro photo.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.920
So one personal, one pro.

29:46.920 --> 29:47.520
Is that true?

29:47.520 --> 29:49.920
Is that what I just heard?

29:49.920 --> 29:51.480
That is what I alluded to.

29:51.480 --> 29:56.120
But actually what I meant for a bit more detail, what I mean

29:56.120 --> 29:58.560
is that on the personal side of things,

29:58.560 --> 30:00.840
I suggest DigiCam to a bunch of friends and family

30:00.840 --> 30:05.040
to use because dark table is a bit more involved than what

30:05.040 --> 30:05.840
they're looking for.

30:05.840 --> 30:10.800
And DigiCam just kind of makes it easy in ways

30:10.800 --> 30:13.320
that they don't need to sort of understand

30:13.320 --> 30:14.720
what's going on in the back end.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.120
That's really interesting because I'm

30:16.120 --> 30:17.960
kind of curious about that since I mostly

30:17.960 --> 30:18.880
use dark table myself.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.800
I was here, I was like, where's the sweet spot

30:20.800 --> 30:21.880
that DigiCam fits?

30:21.880 --> 30:29.080
Yeah, it depends if like from what I know of you, Wes,

30:29.080 --> 30:31.320
you are probably pretty organized

30:31.320 --> 30:33.000
when it comes to your files.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.820
But some people are just kind of willy nilly with their photos

30:35.820 --> 30:37.200
all over the place.

30:37.200 --> 30:41.600
Applications like DigiCam or the other one that's

30:41.600 --> 30:45.040
passing my mind now, they do a really good job

30:45.040 --> 30:48.040
of just kind of organizing all the photos for you.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.000
Where I'm more of a folder-based organizer

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
when it comes to projects and stuff like that.

30:52.000 --> 30:52.920
Same, yep.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.720
Yeah, so if you're using your own methods

30:55.720 --> 30:58.360
to sort all of your projects and photos and stuff like that,

30:58.360 --> 31:00.400
then you really just need to point the software

31:00.400 --> 31:02.520
at the folder that you want.

31:02.520 --> 31:05.640
For some people, they just want to take a broad look

31:05.640 --> 31:08.920
at all of their photos all at once

31:08.920 --> 31:10.560
and then sort of dive in from there.

31:10.560 --> 31:15.000
So for that approach, some of this other software

31:15.000 --> 31:17.680
is just a different workflow, I think,

31:17.680 --> 31:19.200
is a different way of looking at it.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.640
I actually think that's a very, very useful differentiating

31:22.640 --> 31:25.200
way of managing your photos that you just pointed out.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.400
Because myself, I have two modes.

31:27.400 --> 31:30.400
I have the ones that I've taken with my DSLR of my kids

31:30.400 --> 31:31.920
at holiday events or something like that.

31:31.920 --> 31:32.600
Something you planned a little more.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.800
You brought the good camera.

31:33.800 --> 31:34.600
Yes.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.040
That's the ones where I put them in folders.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.120
I organize them that way.

31:38.120 --> 31:40.040
Maybe you can go through them and pick through stuff.

31:40.040 --> 31:41.040
Yep.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.000
I manually copy them off the SD card.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.880
And then you've got the cell phone pictures,

31:44.880 --> 31:46.160
which I just blast away at.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.440
And I just want to slam all of those in an application

31:48.440 --> 31:50.680
and just scrub through it from time to time.

31:50.680 --> 31:54.680
And you may have taken one photo one day that you care about,

31:54.680 --> 31:57.480
and then 20 the next day.

31:57.480 --> 32:00.880
So the other application I was thinking about is Shotwell.

32:00.880 --> 32:04.160
It does a good job of just amassing a bunch of photos

32:04.160 --> 32:09.440
in a thumbnail style view and figures out all the date.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.360
You can sort it by date, if you want, or by folder.

32:12.360 --> 32:16.120
So it's just like, oh, I've got these 3,000 photos

32:16.120 --> 32:19.880
from the last year in one folder from my phone

32:19.880 --> 32:20.840
or something like that.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.560
So those applications are great for that kind of thing.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.160
But certainly, they're capable of a lot more than that, too.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.600
And the other nice thing that's appealing for some of us

32:27.600 --> 32:30.520
with DigiCam is that it's a Qt-based application.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.760
So it looks really nice on the plasma desktop.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.340
Well, then I'm just going to have to give it a dress.

32:35.340 --> 32:39.720
Well, version 6.00 now includes support for video file

32:39.720 --> 32:40.640
management.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.520
So videos are essentially just as fully supported

32:43.520 --> 32:44.800
as photos are.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.640
And that's like, OK, Chris, that sounds kind of, well,

32:47.640 --> 32:49.160
to be expected, right?

32:49.160 --> 32:52.280
However, if you think about what they had to pull off,

32:52.280 --> 32:55.000
it actually required, to put it quite simply as they write,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.360
a huge factoring of source code to make this possible.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.440
So you're telling me that videos aren't just

32:59.440 --> 33:01.320
a bunch of moving pictures?

33:01.320 --> 33:04.140
They say the challenge to deal with these videos

33:04.140 --> 33:06.840
was to extract the metadata and then populate

33:06.840 --> 33:09.200
the database in a way that is actually

33:09.200 --> 33:10.640
relevant to the end user.

33:10.640 --> 33:14.160
And they say they started this work in version 5.50,

33:14.160 --> 33:17.520
so the last major release, using the Qt AV framework

33:17.520 --> 33:19.720
to play video files in DigiCam.

33:19.720 --> 33:22.040
Now, Qt AV, for those that don't know,

33:22.040 --> 33:25.800
is just essentially a direct Qt way to get to FFmpeg.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.920
So whatever FFmpeg can play, this

33:27.920 --> 33:29.920
can play, which is really, really nice.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.120
Then they had to build a video thumbnailer.

33:32.120 --> 33:32.840
Yep, yep.

33:32.840 --> 33:33.480
Obviously, right?

33:33.480 --> 33:33.960
Absolutely.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.200
But not something you think of.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.320
And they wanted something, again,

33:36.320 --> 33:38.320
that FFmpeg could help generate the thumbnail

33:38.320 --> 33:41.340
so they could support as many wonky camera formats

33:41.340 --> 33:43.680
as they could possibly support.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.560
And they had to look at the different Qt APIs

33:45.560 --> 33:46.240
to pull that off.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.640
And they had to pick the right one to get that working.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.160
The advanced search tool needs to be

33:50.160 --> 33:52.720
able to search for the metadata in videos.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.120
So they had to get that working.

33:54.120 --> 33:56.480
They had to get that metadata extracted from the videos

33:56.480 --> 33:58.320
into the database to make it searchable.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.920
This is a really good reminder of just,

33:59.920 --> 34:02.280
despite a lot of that metadata filling the same role,

34:02.280 --> 34:05.120
regardless of container format, it's always different.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.000
Yeah, there's always so many edge cases.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.320
Like, there's a standard.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.400
And then there's like six variants to the standard.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.400
And then undocumented semi-official standard.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.280
Right.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.440
Yeah, so much so.

34:16.440 --> 34:18.240
And there's other nice things in this, too.

34:18.240 --> 34:20.440
They've improved their raw file decoding,

34:20.440 --> 34:21.800
so for even more camera support.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.440
Yeah, that's big.

34:22.440 --> 34:22.960
Yeah.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.420
And they've simplified authenticating

34:26.420 --> 34:29.800
with remote web services using OAuth, which I think is cool.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.320
Yeah, that's a good call.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.880
So anyways, it looks like a really solid digicam release.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.200
And I really appreciate that breakdown that Brent did,

34:37.200 --> 34:40.040
because I feel like it actually made me feel a little bit less

34:40.040 --> 34:41.200
like a madman.

34:41.200 --> 34:44.600
Because I felt like I had this sort of bipolar way

34:44.600 --> 34:45.680
to manage my photos.

34:45.680 --> 34:47.280
And it's really just the ones that I've

34:47.280 --> 34:49.960
put a lot of intention into and a lot of thinking behind,

34:49.960 --> 34:52.040
and then the ones that I just blast on my camera.

34:52.040 --> 34:55.680
And that actually might, maybe the solution there for me

34:55.680 --> 34:57.240
is just two different applications.

34:57.240 --> 34:58.820
And I don't know why I never thought of that before,

34:58.820 --> 35:00.480
but it just seems so obvious.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.240
So thank you, Brent.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.040
There you go, community service for you.

35:04.040 --> 35:05.200
Very, very nice, sir.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.440
Thank you very much for that.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.160
Hey, you're in studio.

35:07.160 --> 35:08.480
You got the real bell beside you.

35:08.480 --> 35:09.280
Come on.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.000
Analog bell.

35:11.000 --> 35:11.500
You're right.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.200
Is there a real bell?

35:13.200 --> 35:15.640
What you have to remember is there is no bell.

35:15.640 --> 35:16.960
There is no bell.

35:16.960 --> 35:20.920
Just like there is no system when you're in a C group,

35:20.920 --> 35:26.840
Fedora 31 is planning to use C group's version 2 by default.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.920
All right, I got to come clean here.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.520
Didn't really realize there was a version 1 or version 2,

35:32.520 --> 35:35.000
and didn't realize that distributions

35:35.000 --> 35:38.760
may be considering moving to a new version of this C group

35:38.760 --> 35:39.240
thing.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.100
So maybe if anybody else feels this way,

35:42.100 --> 35:43.560
could you just explain to me what

35:43.560 --> 35:46.920
the difference between a version 1 C group and a version 2 C

35:46.920 --> 35:47.440
group is?

35:47.440 --> 35:51.160
And are there going to be version 3 and 4s?

35:51.160 --> 35:54.360
Actually, and maybe explain what a C group is.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.280
Maybe.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.360
OK, that's a lot there.

35:56.360 --> 35:59.240
But quick lightning refresher, C groups

35:59.240 --> 36:01.600
are part of the magic in the kernel that makes what

36:01.600 --> 36:03.160
we call containers possible.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.120
They're also known as control groups.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.800
What's the difference between a C group and a namespace?

36:07.800 --> 36:09.180
Well, I mean, they basically do different things.

36:09.180 --> 36:11.360
So a namespace sets up basically what you can see.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.480
So you might have a mount namespace showing you

36:13.480 --> 36:15.680
the mounts that you as a process have access to.

36:15.680 --> 36:18.840
And a control group is for controlling access

36:18.840 --> 36:20.340
to resources and limiting those.

36:20.340 --> 36:22.840
So if you want to make sure that your container can only

36:22.840 --> 36:25.480
use x amount of memory, well, you put it in a C group.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.600
So I kind of think of namespaces a little bit

36:27.600 --> 36:29.520
as almost like a VLAN, but that's probably

36:29.520 --> 36:30.360
a bad explanation.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.400
But you can namespace an application

36:32.400 --> 36:34.480
so it exists in this namespace.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.560
Now, a C group, can I use a C group

36:36.560 --> 36:39.120
to control what that namespace can get access

36:39.120 --> 36:40.600
to on the host system?

36:40.600 --> 36:42.280
No, you really do it at the process level.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.040
Oh, really?

36:43.040 --> 36:43.520
Yeah.

36:43.520 --> 36:44.720
And you can go poke at it.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.400
They're both tree structured.

36:46.400 --> 36:49.320
So basically, you'll see in V1, you

36:49.320 --> 36:51.640
had separate trees for different things.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.760
So you have under the CPU C group or the memory C group.

36:54.760 --> 36:56.560
And then you could go add things in there.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.160
C2 is changing to a unified hierarchy.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.560
Version 1 has been around for a while, which is, you know,

37:02.560 --> 37:04.560
we started back in like 2006 at Google.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.400
And so there's just been some growing pains.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.880
It was the first time the kernel was really

37:07.880 --> 37:10.880
experimenting with adding these kinds of in kernel controls

37:10.880 --> 37:12.720
so that you could actually do that.

37:12.720 --> 37:13.840
And like some of the benefits, right,

37:13.840 --> 37:15.380
one of the big ones for memory, you

37:15.380 --> 37:17.080
can have separate out of memory killers.

37:17.080 --> 37:19.880
So you can make sure that even if your Java application goes

37:19.880 --> 37:22.800
crazy, the kernel will never accidentally shoot SSH

37:22.800 --> 37:24.520
by mistake.

37:24.520 --> 37:25.560
So those are some handy features.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.960
But unfortunately, especially because it

37:26.960 --> 37:28.640
had different hierarchies, it meant

37:28.640 --> 37:30.320
you kind of had to keep a lot in your head

37:30.320 --> 37:32.140
as you're like, OK, well, I want to control these six

37:32.140 --> 37:33.640
different things about my processes.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.960
Then I've got to go add them to these separate trees.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.920
Now, it's a lot simpler.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.120
It's more of what they call a purpose-driven design.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.640
So you can make one C group under the new hierarchy

37:42.640 --> 37:44.720
and then add different controllers to it,

37:44.720 --> 37:46.160
depending on what you actually want to control.

37:46.160 --> 37:47.800
OK, so I can add a controller.

37:47.800 --> 37:48.640
What's a controller?

37:48.640 --> 37:52.200
So that's the thing that lets you control CPU or memory.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.560
So is it like a group of resources?

37:54.560 --> 37:55.680
Somewhat.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.960
You can go find all the links to the nitty-gritty details.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.040
The funny part about this, and we're even talking about it

38:01.040 --> 38:02.940
at all, is you as a user, unless you're

38:02.940 --> 38:05.600
doing a lot of container stuff or you're into this stuff,

38:05.600 --> 38:06.720
you're not going to see it.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.800
But what I thought was interesting,

38:08.800 --> 38:11.060
it's another example of Fedora pushing things.

38:11.060 --> 38:13.460
Because C groups v2 is considered

38:13.460 --> 38:15.960
stable-ish in the future from the kernel perspective

38:15.960 --> 38:17.760
in like 2016.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.920
And have we talked about it at all since then?

38:19.920 --> 38:20.480
No, probably not.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.120
You didn't even know.

38:21.120 --> 38:21.620
No.

38:21.620 --> 38:23.280
And that's because no one's really shipping it.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.240
You can enable it, right?

38:24.240 --> 38:25.200
The kernel has it.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.480
So you're telling me we've had version 2 since 2016

38:27.480 --> 38:29.000
and everybody's shipping version 1?

38:29.000 --> 38:29.760
Yeah, pretty much.

38:29.760 --> 38:32.240
And then also, also all the applications

38:32.240 --> 38:34.640
that are going to take advantage of these new kernel features,

38:34.640 --> 38:37.300
well, they can only really count on version 1 being out there.

38:37.300 --> 38:39.080
So a lot of them don't support version 2,

38:39.080 --> 38:40.680
which means then distros don't have a lot of reason

38:40.680 --> 38:42.640
to support version 2 either.

38:42.640 --> 38:43.360
Well, yeah, OK.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.360
Fedora's breaking that cycle.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.860
It sounds like, or at least they're

38:45.860 --> 38:47.460
considering doing that in Fedora 31.

38:47.460 --> 38:49.400
So whether or not you'll actually care,

38:49.400 --> 38:50.800
it might make some of the things.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.380
There are some new features and nice design improvements here.

38:53.380 --> 38:55.400
So systemd will take advantage of those.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.640
Docker will take advantage of those.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.120
In what way does systemd take advantage of those?

38:58.120 --> 39:00.080
Oh, I mean, systemd uses cgroups all over the place

39:00.080 --> 39:01.060
to go constrain stuff.

39:01.060 --> 39:03.640
If you ever look at all those slices on your system

39:03.640 --> 39:05.000
under the hood, it's using cgroups

39:05.000 --> 39:06.520
so that you can keep track of stuff.

39:06.520 --> 39:07.640
That's another way.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.080
Remember those old init scripts where you double forked

39:10.080 --> 39:12.480
your daemon and then it could escape from itself?

39:12.480 --> 39:14.900
That doesn't happen anymore because you're not just trying

39:14.900 --> 39:16.920
to track child processes.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.120
They're contained in a cgroup.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.080
So you might not actually directly notice anything,

39:21.080 --> 39:24.160
but I think it adds to the story of doing

39:24.160 --> 39:26.320
the small little improvements.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.320
We needed to do this, right?

39:27.320 --> 39:28.160
The kernel has done it.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.760
At some point, version one is going to disappear,

39:30.760 --> 39:33.600
but the kernel community hasn't forced user space to change.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.360
So it's nice to see someone doing it.

39:35.360 --> 39:36.880
Yeah, it is nice to see.

39:36.880 --> 39:40.000
At least if nobody else steps up and moves the ball forward,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.120
it's nice to see Fedora do it because there's a potential.

39:42.120 --> 39:44.760
It could eventually end up shipping that way in RHEL.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.920
Yeah, right, down the road once everything's stabilized.

39:46.920 --> 39:50.800
And, you know, surely cgroups v2 isn't perfect.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.560
There'll probably be future changes to the kernel.

39:52.560 --> 39:53.400
Who knows?

39:53.400 --> 39:54.640
But we won't know what changes are needed

39:54.640 --> 39:55.840
until people are really using it.

39:55.840 --> 39:56.880
Yeah, exactly.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.200
Let's go to the virtual lug there.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.000
Neil, I bet you have thoughts on this one.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
So the main thing here to consider about the cgroups thing

40:05.000 --> 40:08.160
is that for many years Fedora has been running

40:08.160 --> 40:11.240
in cgroups configured in hybrid mode

40:11.240 --> 40:12.640
through systemd as a controller.

40:12.640 --> 40:17.640
So hybrid mode allows us to offer a unified hierarchy

40:17.640 --> 40:20.320
which provides some aspects of cgroups v2

40:20.320 --> 40:22.520
along with cgroups v1 compatibility

40:22.520 --> 40:24.560
for basically most of the world

40:24.560 --> 40:27.000
which only supports cgroups v1.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.840
So the idea going forward is that

40:29.840 --> 40:33.120
we will switch off the unified hybrid mode

40:33.120 --> 40:36.240
and move fully to the pure cgroups v2 mode.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.960
This means applications will finally be forced to adapt

40:38.960 --> 40:41.720
and actually start working

40:41.720 --> 40:44.280
from the new cgroups v2 controller.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.440
And to be fair, one of the reasons

40:46.440 --> 40:51.200
why it's been taking so long for cgroups to get good

40:51.200 --> 40:52.560
and also to be adopted by things

40:52.560 --> 40:54.960
and also for switching from v1 to v2

40:54.960 --> 40:57.400
is because primarily systemd is the driver

40:57.400 --> 40:59.720
for a lot of the cgroups development.

40:59.720 --> 41:00.800
That's a lot of good context.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.240
Thank you, Neil, I appreciate that.

41:02.240 --> 41:05.720
So this begins to roll out in Fedora 31

41:05.720 --> 41:09.320
which we will see using cgroups version two by default

41:09.320 --> 41:10.920
and we still have 30 to get through.

41:10.920 --> 41:13.920
So it's not like it's gonna like smack us in the face here.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.720
We have, there is time

41:16.680 --> 41:18.360
and I think it's good to get that ball rolling.

41:18.360 --> 41:21.560
And to be fair, at least me personally,

41:21.560 --> 41:23.560
as Chris, you already know this

41:23.560 --> 41:25.520
and some of the rest of the world here may not know

41:25.520 --> 41:28.840
but I am the snapd maintainer in Fedora.

41:28.840 --> 41:31.960
So I maintain the snappy integration and stuff like that.

41:31.960 --> 41:34.960
Snapd is going to currently be broken with cgroups v2

41:34.960 --> 41:38.640
because we leverage cgroups v1 exclusively.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.560
The hybrid mode is what allows us to work

41:40.560 --> 41:43.720
even when we access some aspects of cgroups v2

41:43.720 --> 41:46.040
and now because Fedora 31

41:46.040 --> 41:49.080
is now planning to move to cgroups v2,

41:49.080 --> 41:50.840
we're finally going to start.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.280
Snapd upstream is starting to look at the,

41:56.160 --> 42:00.400
at moving snapd to be able to support cgroups v2.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.680
It's an issue we've known for a little bit over,

42:02.680 --> 42:04.520
well, I wanna say two years now

42:04.520 --> 42:05.800
because the bug was first filed

42:05.800 --> 42:07.800
by one of the system d maintainers

42:07.800 --> 42:10.240
who was doing the first explorations two years ago.

42:10.240 --> 42:11.760
So we've known about the issue.

42:11.760 --> 42:14.480
It's just a matter of like figuring out what we need to do.

42:14.480 --> 42:17.000
And over the last couple of years,

42:17.000 --> 42:18.680
cgroups v2 has filled out more

42:18.680 --> 42:22.240
so that functionality that we require is now available

42:22.240 --> 42:23.760
for us to use in some form.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.640
Maybe not exactly the same way

42:25.640 --> 42:28.520
but we have a means of getting to where we need to go.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.200
I imagine it'll be the same for Flatpak

42:30.200 --> 42:31.480
and many other things

42:31.480 --> 42:33.880
that also in some way leverage cgroups.

42:33.880 --> 42:34.760
That is good to know.

42:34.760 --> 42:38.200
Like as the time has been spent,

42:38.200 --> 42:41.400
it seems like at least on the surface,

42:41.400 --> 42:43.440
it's been in somewhat of preparation for this.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.360
It is also interesting that like

42:45.360 --> 42:46.480
you said roll up pretty quickly.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.880
All right, well, as a result of this,

42:48.880 --> 42:51.000
well, snap stuff is fixed.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.800
Well, that makes it a lot easier for Ubuntu

42:52.800 --> 42:53.640
to start enabling these things.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.080
That's true, that's true.

42:55.080 --> 42:56.440
Mr. Payne, would you go ahead

42:56.440 --> 42:58.040
and hit the seatbelt sign there?

42:58.040 --> 43:02.640
We have a little housekeeping to attend to here on the show.

43:02.640 --> 43:07.040
And I just wanna say meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

43:07.040 --> 43:08.880
I never in the history,

43:08.880 --> 43:11.720
in the many, many, many year history of this network,

43:11.720 --> 43:16.720
have we had three simultaneous meetups going at once.

43:16.760 --> 43:19.320
I feel like we've hit a new milestone here.

43:19.320 --> 43:20.160
Don't a big.

43:20.160 --> 43:21.120
We are going big.

43:21.120 --> 43:25.000
So the first one coming up is on March 5th, Tuesday.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.680
It'll be following immediately after Linux unplugged.

43:27.680 --> 43:30.160
We are doing the Linux operating system

43:30.160 --> 43:33.120
fundamentals study group.

43:33.120 --> 43:35.320
The training architect Kenny and Elle

43:35.320 --> 43:36.760
will be joining us to go over

43:36.760 --> 43:38.680
some of the fundamentals of Linux.

43:38.680 --> 43:42.800
This is a course that I have recently released for free

43:42.800 --> 43:44.880
to community members of Linux Academy.

43:45.760 --> 43:47.920
People hate it when I talk about this, but it's not an ad.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.440
This is just part of my day job

43:49.440 --> 43:51.440
that I don't normally talk about here on the air

43:51.440 --> 43:56.440
is working with Elle have released about 22, 23, 24

43:56.440 --> 44:00.280
24 content courses from like lab.

44:00.280 --> 44:02.760
I say content course because it's like labs, it's quizzes,

44:02.760 --> 44:06.320
it's all kinds of stuff and video and audio and all that.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.200
You're just on that content free mission, aren't you?

44:08.200 --> 44:09.040
I have been.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.600
Sneaky soldier you.

44:10.600 --> 44:14.280
And I think my favorite one is,

44:14.280 --> 44:16.120
the student's favorite one I think maybe

44:16.120 --> 44:17.800
is subnetting fundamentals.

44:17.800 --> 44:18.640
Oh, that's a good one.

44:18.640 --> 44:19.460
Yeah.

44:19.460 --> 44:22.440
My favorite one is the Linux operating system fundamentals

44:22.440 --> 44:25.920
because it Kenny goes, if you take the whole course,

44:25.920 --> 44:27.640
which is available for free,

44:27.640 --> 44:31.880
Kenny goes from the world before Linux existed

44:31.880 --> 44:35.320
and the conditions that made it ripe for Linux,

44:35.320 --> 44:38.680
then the launch of Linux, the introduction of GNU.

44:38.680 --> 44:42.440
And now like he goes from all of that to like the cloud

44:42.440 --> 44:46.080
in one course, it's about like an hour and 45 minutes.

44:46.080 --> 44:49.080
Now what's great is we're gonna do that

44:49.080 --> 44:53.280
in a condensed interactive version on March 5th,

44:54.120 --> 44:55.560
immediately following Linux unplug.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.680
We're just gonna keep the mumble room rolling

44:57.680 --> 44:58.900
and Kenny's gonna join us

44:58.900 --> 45:00.120
and we're just gonna go over that.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.360
We're gonna do a study group on the fundamentals of Linux,

45:02.360 --> 45:03.840
like the very basics.

45:03.840 --> 45:07.000
So if you have been using Linux for over a decade

45:07.000 --> 45:08.400
or if you've just found Linux

45:08.400 --> 45:09.920
and want some of the gaps filled in,

45:09.920 --> 45:11.040
you want some of the history,

45:11.040 --> 45:12.880
you wanna interact with somebody

45:12.880 --> 45:15.040
who intimately knows that stuff.

45:16.560 --> 45:18.080
It's like a classroom unplugged.

45:18.080 --> 45:19.260
That's what these study groups are.

45:19.260 --> 45:21.320
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

45:21.320 --> 45:23.960
And then the other couple of things that we have going,

45:23.960 --> 45:25.880
which is only applicable to those of you in the States,

45:25.880 --> 45:27.800
but it's pretty exciting.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.800
We are, I don't know if I can,

45:29.800 --> 45:31.620
I'm gonna say it, I'll say it, I'll say it.

45:31.620 --> 45:34.960
We are doing two different meetups and I'm pretty sure,

45:34.960 --> 45:39.960
I'm pretty sure that Mr. Popey is officially going to scale.

45:40.880 --> 45:41.720
Wow.

45:41.720 --> 45:43.700
So Popey, I think, I'm pretty sure he's gonna be at scale.

45:43.700 --> 45:44.540
I'm pretty sure he's like logged in.

45:44.540 --> 45:45.360
Well I'm just gonna hold him to it already.

45:45.360 --> 45:46.440
So there, it's done.

45:46.440 --> 45:48.120
Yeah, so we're doing a JB dinner meetup.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.240
I'll be there, Wes will be there,

45:49.240 --> 45:51.840
Elle will be there and all of you,

45:51.840 --> 45:54.080
if you're going to scale, go to meetup.com slash

45:54.080 --> 45:56.000
Jupiter Broadcasting and come hang out with us.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
Thank you to Maddie for setting that up, aka Geek Dad.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.600
And then, last but absolutely not least,

46:02.600 --> 46:05.280
I will be driving my home to the beautiful

46:05.280 --> 46:08.280
Bellingham, Washington, parking it in the parking lot

46:08.280 --> 46:11.520
of the Bellingham Technical College and cooking for you.

46:11.520 --> 46:14.220
Along with the great folks over at System 76,

46:14.220 --> 46:17.300
who will be providing meats and other things.

46:17.300 --> 46:19.320
I just say things, so I don't wanna put anything

46:19.320 --> 46:21.020
on the record, but you know what I'm saying, Wes.

46:21.020 --> 46:22.120
You know what I'm saying.

46:22.120 --> 46:24.480
Supplies for a wonderful evening.

46:24.480 --> 46:26.280
That's right, that's right, that's a good way to put it.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.100
And Levi's gonna be there, you're gonna be there.

46:28.100 --> 46:28.940
Yeah, that's right.

46:28.940 --> 46:31.360
The whole JB crew will be there at Linux Fest Northwest

46:31.360 --> 46:34.520
and we are going to do a Lady Joob's barbecue

46:34.520 --> 46:35.340
in the parking lot.

46:35.340 --> 46:36.180
I'm hungry already.

46:36.180 --> 46:37.600
It's gonna be so good.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.560
It's, people are flying in literally

46:39.560 --> 46:40.920
from all over the world for this.

46:40.920 --> 46:41.760
Isn't that something?

46:41.760 --> 46:43.480
It's blowing my mind already.

46:43.480 --> 46:44.440
It is really cool.

46:44.440 --> 46:46.840
And you're gonna be giving a talk at Linux Fest.

46:46.840 --> 46:47.960
Looks like two.

46:47.960 --> 46:49.140
Really? Yeah.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.680
Oh, what are they?

46:50.680 --> 46:51.800
I mean, I know one of them.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.880
Yeah, well, one's like a nerdy dev talk

46:53.880 --> 46:56.480
where we're gonna go from basics and explore

46:56.480 --> 46:58.740
the Lambda calculus and why you might care.

46:59.600 --> 47:00.920
So that one's a little bit nerdier.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.880
And then the other one is gonna be a review

47:02.880 --> 47:06.280
and a basic intro to Linux audio production.

47:06.280 --> 47:08.400
Did you think, I mean, looking back like a year ago,

47:08.400 --> 47:10.560
did you think you would have this level of understanding

47:10.560 --> 47:11.400
like you do now?

47:11.400 --> 47:12.220
No, I did not.

47:12.220 --> 47:13.800
And it's changing every day.

47:13.800 --> 47:16.580
So yeah, Wes has really done a deep dive into Jack

47:16.580 --> 47:19.360
and Pulse, but also editing under Reaper.

47:19.360 --> 47:21.120
Like you're really getting some good experience.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.720
So it's a good time to give a talk on that.

47:22.720 --> 47:23.920
Yeah, you know, it should be a lot of fun

47:23.920 --> 47:24.760
and lots to learn.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.880
Yeah, so meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

47:26.880 --> 47:27.700
for that information.

47:27.700 --> 47:29.120
That's really kind of what we had

47:29.120 --> 47:31.460
in the housekeeping section of the show.

47:31.460 --> 47:33.800
We're just really excited because

47:33.800 --> 47:35.440
I think Linux Fest is gonna be,

47:35.440 --> 47:37.640
it's gonna be really great, not even just for us,

47:37.640 --> 47:39.760
but it's their 20th anniversary.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.640
And that's kind of special.

47:41.640 --> 47:44.040
Yeah, even if you didn't have like all the great people

47:44.040 --> 47:46.200
that we're bringing in, it's just a good time.

47:46.200 --> 47:47.560
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah.

47:47.560 --> 47:48.680
We'd love to have you there.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.760
Yeah, I know it's not feasible for most of you

47:50.760 --> 47:53.560
because tens of thousands,

47:53.560 --> 47:55.840
and there's many, many more than tens of thousands

47:55.840 --> 47:56.700
of you that listen to this show

47:56.700 --> 47:58.660
and only a couple hundred of you are gonna make it,

47:58.660 --> 48:01.520
but yeah, it's just a lot of fun.

48:01.520 --> 48:04.080
And if you can't make it to that,

48:04.080 --> 48:06.400
consider doing a smaller micro version of that.

48:06.400 --> 48:09.140
Microdose our virtual lug.

48:09.140 --> 48:10.560
Think about that for a second.

48:10.560 --> 48:13.280
You can't get the full Linux Fest Northwest

48:13.280 --> 48:15.000
or the scale experience.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.480
Well, come Microdose over here at Linux Unplugged.

48:17.480 --> 48:18.840
We have a virtual lug.

48:18.840 --> 48:20.720
We interact with these folks all the time.

48:20.720 --> 48:23.040
You just have to pass an audio check from time to time.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.640
I mean, today we didn't even have any mods

48:24.640 --> 48:26.080
because they're all having lives today.

48:26.080 --> 48:27.920
So you just got on air today.

48:27.920 --> 48:28.760
You showed up.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.000
Again, it's unplugged.

48:31.000 --> 48:31.840
Yeah.

48:32.720 --> 48:33.840
And we love having you.

48:33.840 --> 48:34.800
We just, we really do,

48:34.800 --> 48:36.560
and we think it makes for a great community experience.

48:36.560 --> 48:39.320
And it does give you a small version

48:39.320 --> 48:41.640
of what you get in person at Linux Fest Northwest.

48:41.640 --> 48:42.480
Yeah, you get to tell us

48:42.480 --> 48:44.660
when we've just got something horribly wrong.

48:44.660 --> 48:46.480
Yeah, but I mean like Brent,

48:46.480 --> 48:47.920
he wouldn't be kind of trying to figure out

48:47.920 --> 48:50.640
all these crazy ways to like appease his client

48:50.640 --> 48:51.720
and make it to Linux Fest

48:51.720 --> 48:54.220
unless there was some real value there.

48:54.220 --> 48:55.060
I don't want to put you on the spot.

48:55.060 --> 48:56.600
Or it might just be that he hates his house

48:56.600 --> 48:57.440
because he's never been there.

48:57.440 --> 48:58.280
Yeah.

48:58.280 --> 49:00.000
It's the best way to travel.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.320
Have a really terrible home.

49:01.320 --> 49:02.160
That's for sure.

49:03.560 --> 49:04.480
Or just don't have one.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.520
That's been my approach.

49:05.520 --> 49:06.360
Right.

49:07.480 --> 49:09.080
I mean, I don't want to put you on the spot, Brent,

49:09.080 --> 49:12.200
but like what, how do you put a value on,

49:12.200 --> 49:13.800
I'm trying to convince people to come out

49:13.800 --> 49:15.440
and hang out with some Linux users

49:15.440 --> 49:17.040
and talk Linux stuff,

49:17.040 --> 49:19.480
but I don't know how to explain why that's valuable.

49:19.480 --> 49:21.160
It seems like it's a preposterous idea.

49:21.160 --> 49:22.720
Like what kind of money are we?

49:22.720 --> 49:24.360
Who would spend thousands of dollars

49:24.360 --> 49:25.420
to just go talk about Linux?

49:25.420 --> 49:27.480
I could jump in an IRC room and do it for free.

49:27.480 --> 49:29.720
Well, I think it's the intangibles really

49:29.720 --> 49:31.200
that you kind of hit on.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.260
There's something about being face-to-face

49:33.260 --> 49:37.520
with the people in the community that is priceless.

49:37.520 --> 49:40.760
Let's say that, that works well for me personally.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.160
And I think this might be true

49:42.160 --> 49:44.520
for a lot of the community out there.

49:44.520 --> 49:47.760
Last year was my first Linux Fest of any kind.

49:47.760 --> 49:52.040
I had never been to any Linux conference at all before that.

49:52.040 --> 49:54.200
And I just happened to be in the area

49:55.320 --> 49:58.380
when Linux Fest Northwest was happening last year.

49:58.380 --> 49:59.220
And I thought, okay,

49:59.220 --> 50:02.040
I'm going to make a little effort here to try to go.

50:02.040 --> 50:06.120
And for me, that really kick-started my ability

50:06.120 --> 50:08.880
to be a part of the Linux community.

50:08.880 --> 50:12.120
I had been listening to the JB shows for years and years,

50:12.120 --> 50:16.540
but now, I mean, you guys can totally see that.

50:16.540 --> 50:19.280
I was able to put faces to the people

50:19.280 --> 50:22.020
that I hear on the podcasts every week.

50:22.020 --> 50:23.840
And we've developed friendships

50:23.840 --> 50:25.380
with all sorts of people in the community.

50:25.380 --> 50:28.160
And so for me, as a creative,

50:28.160 --> 50:33.160
I didn't quite know how I could help the Linux community

50:33.320 --> 50:34.800
by giving back.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.240
And then once I was at Linux Fest,

50:37.240 --> 50:40.440
it became really clear that my participating in any way

50:40.440 --> 50:41.280
was really helpful.

50:41.280 --> 50:44.520
So I encourage anybody to go to any Linux Fest

50:44.520 --> 50:48.160
or any Linux conference anywhere just to make connections.

50:48.160 --> 50:52.080
And it turns something virtual that we connect online,

50:52.080 --> 50:53.120
but it turns something virtual

50:53.120 --> 50:56.140
into something really tangible and that's super priceless.

50:56.140 --> 50:57.320
It sounds cliche to say,

50:57.320 --> 51:01.220
but we are wired for in-person.

51:01.220 --> 51:02.760
Like you and I have been doing a show together in Mutt.

51:02.760 --> 51:03.600
This feels great doing a show together.

51:03.600 --> 51:04.640
It does, yeah, it's a lot of fun.

51:04.640 --> 51:06.340
It's great because we're in-person.

51:06.340 --> 51:11.340
Like we've developed like a whole way of communicating

51:11.840 --> 51:14.780
that is visual.

51:14.780 --> 51:17.440
It's body cues, it's language.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.480
It's all of that that when you're not in person,

51:19.480 --> 51:20.320
you don't get that.

51:20.320 --> 51:23.680
And it seems so obvious and everybody knows that.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.800
The text conversations don't necessarily have

51:25.800 --> 51:28.360
the same context that in-person conversations have.

51:28.360 --> 51:30.520
I'm not telling you anything you don't know.

51:30.520 --> 51:31.840
You know that.

51:31.840 --> 51:34.040
And yet I'm here to tell you,

51:34.040 --> 51:36.840
I am the biggest recluse.

51:36.840 --> 51:40.200
I honestly would be happy not seeing another human being

51:40.200 --> 51:41.440
for weeks at a time.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.080
I could stay in my room for weeks at a time.

51:43.080 --> 51:44.280
A real homebody.

51:44.280 --> 51:46.160
I am, I don't need it.

51:46.160 --> 51:47.680
Don't need it.

51:47.680 --> 51:48.600
Don't need it.

51:48.600 --> 51:50.520
And yet I'm the one sitting here telling you,

51:50.520 --> 51:51.880
come to these things, it's worth it.

51:51.880 --> 51:53.600
And it is really hard to imagine

51:53.600 --> 51:55.240
what you're missing out, right?

51:55.240 --> 51:56.980
It's like, well, some conferences are not great.

51:56.980 --> 51:59.320
Some are average, not this one.

51:59.320 --> 52:02.100
You, my friend, are a bit of a community success story

52:02.100 --> 52:02.940
in yourself.

52:02.940 --> 52:03.760
Yeah, that's right.

52:03.760 --> 52:06.920
You just decided to come to one of our barbecues

52:06.920 --> 52:07.760
that we had.

52:07.760 --> 52:08.760
For this very show.

52:08.760 --> 52:11.200
And, I mean, how many years ago was that?

52:11.200 --> 52:12.040
Four?

52:12.040 --> 52:12.860
Yeah, I think so.

52:12.860 --> 52:13.700
Wow, that's great.

52:13.700 --> 52:14.540
Four years ago.

52:14.540 --> 52:15.360
That's crazy.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.200
And now you're a full-time employee,

52:16.200 --> 52:17.280
you're doing this as a job,

52:17.280 --> 52:20.680
and we've been doing this show for years together.

52:20.680 --> 52:22.120
Because you showed up to a barbecue.

52:22.120 --> 52:22.960
Totally.

52:22.960 --> 52:23.800
Right?

52:23.800 --> 52:25.720
I just happened to see you having a party at the studio.

52:25.720 --> 52:29.040
Yeah, had you gone to Linux Fest in the past before that?

52:29.040 --> 52:30.440
I had, but that was before I even knew

52:30.440 --> 52:31.600
about Jupiter broadcasting.

52:31.600 --> 52:32.440
Wow.

52:32.440 --> 52:34.880
Who are those jerks over there hogging all the floor

52:34.880 --> 52:36.400
doing a broadcast?

52:36.400 --> 52:37.600
Who's making all that noise?

52:37.600 --> 52:38.920
Yeah.

52:38.920 --> 52:40.720
Yeah, I just, I don't know.

52:40.720 --> 52:43.340
I mean, maybe it changes your life, maybe it doesn't.

52:43.340 --> 52:45.640
But, I mean, you just heard two stories from Brent

52:45.640 --> 52:47.860
and from Wes, and actually three from me too.

52:48.920 --> 52:50.100
If you can make it, it's worth it.

52:50.100 --> 52:51.400
And there's two different events going on,

52:51.400 --> 52:53.800
Scale and Linux Fest Northwest.

52:53.800 --> 52:54.840
And we'll be there.

52:54.840 --> 52:56.360
And I'd love to be part of that story.

52:56.360 --> 52:57.200
So come see us.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.000
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.760
All right, hit that sign again.

53:00.760 --> 53:03.120
We got something I want to talk about here.

53:03.120 --> 53:05.960
It's been on my mind for about a good solid year and a half,

53:05.960 --> 53:09.400
and I haven't thought of a way yet to address it.

53:09.400 --> 53:13.640
However, you and I hashed it out earlier today,

53:13.640 --> 53:15.960
and I think we've come to a way to talk about this

53:15.960 --> 53:17.240
that isn't a big downer.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.040
It isn't super depressing.

53:19.040 --> 53:22.480
And the big question that I want to ask the class today,

53:22.480 --> 53:24.400
and I have a way for us to think about this,

53:24.400 --> 53:25.760
so we're gonna frame this a little bit,

53:25.760 --> 53:28.900
but the question that I want to ask the class today is,

53:28.900 --> 53:32.840
how can there ever again be a big distro?

53:32.840 --> 53:34.720
Like an Ubuntu scale distro?

53:34.720 --> 53:35.800
Are we thinking about numbers here,

53:35.800 --> 53:38.240
or does brand count as well?

53:38.240 --> 53:40.560
I actually think both are pretty important metric.

53:40.560 --> 53:41.600
I think both are pretty important.

53:41.600 --> 53:42.820
Because that's kind of what you're asking, right?

53:42.820 --> 53:44.400
Like when do you get another distro

53:44.400 --> 53:47.040
that pushes its way into the marketplace

53:47.040 --> 53:48.760
and becomes one of the distros?

53:48.760 --> 53:50.200
Right, right.

53:50.200 --> 53:52.960
Okay, so a couple of distros come to mind

53:52.960 --> 53:54.600
as pretty big distros.

53:54.600 --> 53:58.240
I think in terms of end user desktop usage,

53:58.240 --> 54:01.800
it's Ubuntu is the undisputed champion.

54:01.800 --> 54:05.960
In mindshare, you've got Fedora, and you've got OpenSUSE,

54:05.960 --> 54:07.760
you've got elementary, which is based on Ubuntu,

54:07.760 --> 54:11.000
you've got a lot of those distros, like Debian,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.840
and you know what tier I'm talking about, that tier.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.200
What else do you see in the enterprise space?

54:15.200 --> 54:16.280
You've got Debian, of course,

54:16.280 --> 54:17.620
and there are Ubuntu's in there for sure,

54:17.620 --> 54:18.460
but what else?

54:18.460 --> 54:19.280
RHEL?

54:19.280 --> 54:20.160
RHEL, yeah.

54:20.160 --> 54:22.960
Well, there's a little guy known as ClearLinux then.

54:22.960 --> 54:23.800
You see that sometimes?

54:23.800 --> 54:24.640
Yeah, you do.

54:24.640 --> 54:25.460
You see container sorts of Linux?

54:25.460 --> 54:28.280
So all of these kind of have a common thread, don't they?

54:28.280 --> 54:29.640
A corporate backer.

54:29.640 --> 54:30.600
Yes, they do.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.200
They all have a big corporate backer

54:32.200 --> 54:34.440
that has a enterprise strategy.

54:34.440 --> 54:36.160
Support contracts, what have you.

54:36.160 --> 54:37.560
Now, the one that you say there, though,

54:37.560 --> 54:40.400
that's maybe not as well known, ClearLinux.

54:40.400 --> 54:41.800
I think that's a great use case.

54:41.800 --> 54:43.640
So let's take a look at ClearLinux.

54:43.640 --> 54:47.960
They just published a video, which is all audio,

54:47.960 --> 54:50.240
so I don't really know why it's a video,

54:50.240 --> 54:52.420
other than the sound effects are pretty good,

54:52.420 --> 54:53.560
but they've published a video

54:53.560 --> 54:56.880
that kind of tries to make the case for ClearLinux.

54:56.880 --> 54:58.520
So let's play this,

54:58.520 --> 55:00.480
and then let's talk about if ClearLinux has a shot,

55:00.480 --> 55:02.400
because A, corporate backer.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.120
There's a clear strategy.

55:04.120 --> 55:07.080
They're optimized for certain types of workloads.

55:07.080 --> 55:09.600
They have clearly,

55:09.600 --> 55:12.000
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.880
Clearly they have a couple of competitive edges,

55:14.880 --> 55:16.520
and they have those intel pockets.

55:16.520 --> 55:20.160
Every application you have runs on an operating system

55:20.160 --> 55:21.880
made up of several parts.

55:21.880 --> 55:23.480
So when you update one part,

55:23.480 --> 55:25.440
it may throw things off balance,

55:25.440 --> 55:27.640
still leave security threats open,

55:27.640 --> 55:30.800
and maybe flat out cause the app to not work.

55:30.800 --> 55:34.000
This means that your team spends time and resources

55:34.000 --> 55:37.600
manually fixing the issue, or you reject the update.

55:37.600 --> 55:38.840
That means stability,

55:38.840 --> 55:42.240
but you may lose out on improved performance in the update.

55:42.240 --> 55:44.960
Whether breach, crash, or latency,

55:44.960 --> 55:48.880
not keeping your OS up to date can have real consequences.

55:48.880 --> 55:53.120
You need ClearLinux, an OS that's secure, performant,

55:53.120 --> 55:55.520
manageable, and customizable.

55:55.520 --> 55:57.520
By scanning for vulnerabilities

55:57.520 --> 56:00.000
and automating the latest security updates,

56:00.000 --> 56:01.920
ClearLinux delivers an environment

56:01.920 --> 56:05.800
designed to minimize breaches without causing slowdowns.

56:05.800 --> 56:08.440
Automated testing checks OS components

56:08.440 --> 56:10.040
for dependency issues.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.520
Since ClearLinux is built

56:11.520 --> 56:13.880
with the end user application in mind,

56:13.880 --> 56:16.480
it ensures that performance optimizations

56:16.480 --> 56:18.760
are done at every layer of the stack,

56:18.760 --> 56:22.120
so that when it comes to end user application performance,

56:22.120 --> 56:25.480
you get the very best without having to worry about it.

56:25.480 --> 56:29.400
Where other distros have updates the size of the entire OS,

56:29.400 --> 56:31.320
ClearLinux software packages

56:31.320 --> 56:35.400
contain only the changed portion, leading to faster updates.

56:35.400 --> 56:38.240
ClearLinux is also easily customizable,

56:38.240 --> 56:40.240
so you can build a custom component,

56:40.240 --> 56:42.480
then use the mixer tool to combine it

56:42.480 --> 56:45.600
with the rest of the OS without recompiling it all.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.920
And finally, having a file structure

56:47.920 --> 56:50.480
that is separated into distinct layers

56:50.480 --> 56:53.040
makes ClearLinux easier to manage.

56:53.040 --> 56:57.120
With performance, security, customization, and manageability,

56:57.120 --> 57:00.840
the ClearLinux OS will be a reliable, stable pillar

57:00.840 --> 57:02.680
for whatever apps you run on it.

57:02.680 --> 57:05.360
Learn more at clearlinux.org.

57:05.360 --> 57:07.880
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

57:07.880 --> 57:09.960
I mean, that's pretty compelling, right?

57:09.960 --> 57:11.800
I mean, see what those Intel dollars get you there.

57:11.800 --> 57:13.480
Yeah, marketing budget.

57:13.480 --> 57:16.640
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.840
Yeah, that was great.

57:17.840 --> 57:19.440
It sounds really corporate to me though,

57:19.440 --> 57:21.320
in a way that I'm not used to with Linux.

57:21.320 --> 57:23.120
Yeah, oh, you know, you're right.

57:23.120 --> 57:24.920
It is very corporate Linux, isn't it?

57:24.920 --> 57:26.720
It's a product almost, is what it feels like.

57:26.720 --> 57:27.880
It is, yeah.

57:27.880 --> 57:30.080
The ClearLinux thing is kind of funny

57:30.080 --> 57:33.520
because Intel is the steward

57:33.520 --> 57:36.920
of three different Linux distributions

57:36.920 --> 57:39.280
that they back for specific purposes

57:39.280 --> 57:43.400
and have been over the course of the, what, last 15 years,

57:43.400 --> 57:45.360
five or so of them.

57:45.360 --> 57:47.920
So it's weird that ClearLinux now

57:47.920 --> 57:51.600
is suddenly special enough to be considered something

57:51.600 --> 57:54.200
that might be viable when the four of it

57:54.200 --> 57:55.920
that preceded it haven't been,

57:55.920 --> 57:57.800
even though they put the same kind of effort.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.360
So let me put this out there to you then.

57:59.360 --> 58:04.360
So what does it take to make a Linux distribution big?

58:04.600 --> 58:06.920
Because I feel like talking like this,

58:06.920 --> 58:09.880
positioning like this, trying to clearly address a market,

58:09.880 --> 58:13.800
maybe it's containers or servers or Intel-based systems,

58:13.800 --> 58:17.120
like they're clearly addressing a particular market.

58:17.120 --> 58:19.520
They're coming at it with a very measured,

58:19.520 --> 58:21.600
very focused message,

58:21.600 --> 58:25.560
and it's backed by Intel with plenty of billions.

58:25.560 --> 58:27.360
Isn't that what it takes to make

58:27.360 --> 58:29.640
the next successful major Linux distribution?

58:29.640 --> 58:31.000
Mr. Payne, what do you think?

58:31.000 --> 58:32.760
Does ClearLinux have a chance here?

58:32.760 --> 58:34.880
Or are we just locked in?

58:34.880 --> 58:37.560
Like the big Linux players are the big Linux players

58:37.560 --> 58:39.600
and so it will remain forever.

58:39.600 --> 58:41.280
It's a tricky thing to nail down

58:41.280 --> 58:43.760
because it really is, it's a mindshare thing.

58:43.760 --> 58:45.680
It's almost a feeling, right?

58:45.680 --> 58:46.800
It's how you think about it.

58:46.800 --> 58:49.760
It's how people model that distribution in their mind.

58:49.760 --> 58:52.240
And sometimes things start slowly

58:52.240 --> 58:55.320
and build more momentum than you really can appreciate.

58:55.320 --> 58:57.000
And so Clear feels like it's on the cusp.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.680
I don't know how far it's gonna go,

58:58.680 --> 59:00.480
but like when we first started talking about Clear,

59:00.480 --> 59:02.240
which was ages ago,

59:02.240 --> 59:03.800
there were some nice benchmarks out at Ferronix,

59:03.800 --> 59:05.120
but other than that, it was like, yeah, okay,

59:05.120 --> 59:06.920
well, really, what are you bringing?

59:06.920 --> 59:07.960
I kind of still feel that way,

59:07.960 --> 59:10.480
but after we played with it in a bit,

59:10.480 --> 59:12.240
it was a pretty usable system.

59:12.240 --> 59:14.880
Now that's not enough to unseat,

59:14.880 --> 59:18.120
but with time and mindshare, maybe it is.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.400
But I don't know, it does feel pretty locked in

59:21.400 --> 59:24.240
and without some big corporate vendor

59:24.240 --> 59:26.160
deciding that they really wanna play in that space,

59:26.160 --> 59:29.080
which does seem to be what Intel keeps wanting to do.

59:29.080 --> 59:30.400
I don't see it happening anytime soon.

59:30.400 --> 59:32.400
I'll tell you what my insights have given me

59:32.400 --> 59:36.120
at Linux Academy is that there is so much momentum

59:36.120 --> 59:38.960
in the industry around certifications

59:38.960 --> 59:41.720
and qualifications for a job

59:41.720 --> 59:45.880
that it takes certain things reach a point in the industry

59:45.880 --> 59:48.040
and then they become like a benchmark

59:48.040 --> 59:49.120
in which you are measured by.

59:49.120 --> 59:53.160
So like a Red Hat certification or a Docker certification

59:53.160 --> 59:55.800
is extremely valuable when you're trying to get a job.

59:55.800 --> 59:58.240
And so it sort of creates a cycle

59:58.240 --> 59:59.960
where people go to get that training,

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.240
they go to get that certification

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.520
so they can get those jobs.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.040
So then those jobs are looking

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.400
for those particular qualifications.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.800
Right, yeah, you've built that.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.360
And it kind of gets locked in in a way.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.680
The other part too is,

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.760
so we're talking about Linux,

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.720
but which aspects are we talking about?

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.360
Because it's like Alpine is a distribution

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.480
that's gotten way more popular.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.920
It's not gonna be the next big Linux,

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.560
but we talk about it way more than we used to,

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.280
thanks to containers mostly.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.200
I don't know that I see someone like,

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.440
is there gonna be a next big desktop Linux?

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.120
Or is that Chrome OS?

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.280
That was the other thing I was gonna say.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.240
Yeah, is that Chrome OS?

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.520
Now on the server, all right,

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.840
well, like Amazon Linux,

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.680
if you wanna consider that separate or a derivative,

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.440
it's kind of unclear at this point.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.720
That doesn't see much use outside of it, but you can.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.240
You've got their virtual desktops as well.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.880
So I could see like stuff on the server happening.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.480
You're right that there are certifications and stuff,

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.360
but enough of that now,

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.960
I think also ends up being like,

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.720
you can still get certified on AWS

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.480
and switch out distributions and figure it out, right?

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.560
True, yeah.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.400
Yeah, that's interesting.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.240
And if you end up just using

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.960
a bunch of configuration management scripts,

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.720
then maybe you're not the person who has to know all that.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.040
What you're really kind of saying at the meta level there

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.840
is the version of Linux

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.920
and the details about the Linux that you use

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.000
on the different cloud providers

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.480
just simply becomes an implementation detail.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.520
Yeah, I mean, it might matter,

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.480
but it only matters to the extent that your tools

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.840
are built to use them and take advantage

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.400
of whatever features they might have that you need.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.680
Wow, I'm just sitting with that for a second.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.200
I mean, the idea that like,

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.480
it doesn't really matter if I'm using Ubuntu or Red Hat,

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.280
what really matters is that the cloud scripts that I'm using

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.040
or the service provider that I'm using

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.400
has the right tools or the right integration.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.400
I don't like the way that feels when I sit with that.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.240
I mean, you are completely right.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.160
It's kind of a success story consequence, right?

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.000
Or it's just ubiquitous.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.840
Like Android.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.400
Yeah, it is, mm-hmm.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.200
Wow, geez, you're right.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.520
And then, yeah, and I think you're right too.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.200
Pair that with like Chrome OS is probably the next big desktop.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.040
It is the same thing.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.240
End users could care less that it's based on Gen2

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.480
or that when you run a Linux application

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.400
that's running some kind of crazy Debian environment

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.160
on top of a Gen2 box, like, they don't care.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.000
They just want to use it.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.760
They just want to get their sound working,

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.600
which is happening too.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.800
I have Google Drive docs to edit, man, come on.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.440
The key here is partnerships.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.520
Everyone has kind of missed the point.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.800
The Intel thing is only as interesting

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.160
as when the first agreements come in

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.440
for saying like, this will be happening with this

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.160
and this is our recommended solution.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.000
The way SUSE made Enterprise Linux

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.160
become a success story in itself

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.000
when they pioneered the business model

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.200
was that they partnered with companies

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.120
to support exotic hardware platforms, exotic designs,

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.760
and they started working with doing direct engineering

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.880
of migrating systems from legacy Unices

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.960
that we don't know about anymore to Linux-based platforms.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.320
And when Red Hat took that model,

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.920
they just went and ran with it.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.520
They built on top of it all kinds of other things.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.240
And of course, between the two of them,

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.120
they developed a certification programs.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.320
They built life cycles and management

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.000
and tooling and infrastructure.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.160
And like when you build all these things together,

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.400
you start building an ecosystem.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.440
And the thing that everybody gets wrong,

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.480
be it server, desktop, containers, or whatever,

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.880
is that you can't be an island.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.840
You have to be an ecosystem.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.960
If you're not developing an ecosystem

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.200
or if you're not thinking from the point of view

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.960
of making it so people can easily adopt your platform,

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.240
your technologies, or become a part of it or a partnership

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:29.160
and or help people pull away from one ecosystem

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.400
to pull into the other,

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.000
because the friction is relatively low,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.440
but there's this perception that it's really high.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:38.240
As you can easily move from an Ubuntu system

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.160
to a Fedora system, to a CentOS system,

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.800
to a SLES system, to an open SUSE system.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.480
And it doesn't really matter all that much

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.600
when it comes to like,

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.960
oh, your graphical applications are all kind of the same.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.040
The libraries are all there.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.800
You can compile stuff, things like that.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.960
But it matters when you're trying to figure out

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.640
what the hell you can use it with.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.680
And if you've got partnerships that say,

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.200
okay, these 3D printers,

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.400
Red Hat through some of their enthusiastic employees

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:08.640
come together, they build a group,

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.640
but they start talking to 3D printers vendors

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.560
and they get the drivers written.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.520
And then they put them into the upstream kernel

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.920
and then they bring them into Fedora first.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.920
And they talk about it as a Fedora feature.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.200
Then that means that Fedora has an avenue

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.360
in which building another arm to their ecosystem.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.560
And then that eventually propagates into RHEL

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.520
where the industrial people start taking advantage of it

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.040
and building a platform in which they can do commercial

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.520
or industrial grade stuff built

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.840
on top of 3D printing technologies.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.640
And so like it kind of feeds into this cycle.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:45.000
And that's just an avenue where volunteer ship

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.200
evolves into something that's valuable for the business.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.400
It could easily go the other way too.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.520
It doesn't really matter.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.520
The point is that there's gotta be this connection

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:00.400
between among multiple parties to make it work.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.600
And this is why desktop Linux has never been successful.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.680
Everyone tries to do it as a goddamn island.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.160
There it is.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.400
I was waiting for it.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.480
All right, Neil, hold it there.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.560
We're going to continue on.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.480
I think we'll pick it up in the post-show though.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.600
And we were gonna look at our home folders today,

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.200
but I feel like we could save that for next week.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.200
Yeah, that's evergreen.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.520
Yeah, it is.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.640
In fact, maybe why don't we do this?

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.840
Go look at your own home folder.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.080
Do an LSLA and just take a look at it.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.080
I want you to look at how many dot folders are in there

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.000
versus the dot config directory,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
because that's where they're supposed to be, right?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.560
I mean, I guess we'll get into that.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.960
But yes, you'll probably find a lot.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.640
Some will have their own subdirectories.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.720
Maybe there'll be some weird intercasing.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.960
Yeah, if you've got tree, just type tree in your home

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.640
and go stare at all the lines.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.680
If you don't have tree, install tree.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.520
Yeah, there you go.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.320
And then run tree on your home directory.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.240
And then listen to episode 290,

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.800
because we're gonna be talking about this.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.160
Because Wes and I have to come clean

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.240
about our home directories,

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.440
and we want you to understand what we're talking about.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.280
So this will be a good exercise for you at home.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.080
But I did promise some great pics.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.240
So let's do those before we get out of here.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.800
First pic this week is something

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.360
that I am trying out in studio,

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.560
getting ready for the big Linux Fest Northwest.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.640
Here, can I tell you something?

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:14.960
Oh yeah, I will tell a soul.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.880
Don't tell anybody else.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.000
The cone of silence.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:18.840
Oh, good idea.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.000
They can't hear us outside of that, that's perfect.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.040
So I wanna make it look like we got our shit together.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.200
And I was thinking, maybe we could get

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.160
like a couple of media devices set up

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.720
just with our content or with some music.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.560
So that way when people are hanging out at the studio,

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.400
they got some stuff to listen to.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.320
The space is ready to go.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.800
But we just pretend like we've always had it.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.360
The studio is just, those are built in, yeah.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.400
Yeah, it's always been here.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.480
It's like, we use Linux everywhere obviously.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.440
I don't know what you're thinking about.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.000
Okay. The cone of silence.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:43.840
Ooh.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.960
So let me tell you about Pi Music Box,

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.040
something we use here in the studio.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:53.200
And it's pretty sweet.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.840
Okay, maybe technically I haven't used it yet,

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.680
but I'm about to.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.840
It is a Spotify SoundCloud Google Music player

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.720
for the Raspberry Pi.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.080
In fact, I think it even supports Apple AirPlay version 1.0.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:11.200
And it turns a Raspberry Pi into a media device receiver

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.120
with a web interface that works great on both the desktop,

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.360
but your mobile device as well.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.960
So guests can come over, they join your wifi,

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.720
you give them the URL and then they're up and going.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.360
And they can like cue music up

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.080
and they can play their own mixes and stuff like that.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.760
So it's called Pi Music Box.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.560
There's a bunch of stuff, just does a bunch of stuff.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.400
This really seems perfect.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.800
Actually, I had some friends over

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.240
and they used a different streaming service than I did.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.840
And they're like, oh, we have this playlist that you should.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.080
And I was like, what?

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:36.920
I'm not set up.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.240
This would be perfect.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.920
Yeah, that kind of thing happens.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.640
And what tends to be the case is the Chromecast

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.120
becomes the sort of like unifier.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.840
Everybody's got Chromecast support.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:51.600
So then it's like whatever you can send to the TV

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.280
and play on the TV speakers is what you got.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.280
Not this year.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.160
This year, we're gonna go all out.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.440
So that we'll be using Pi Music Box to deliver that.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.480
Now, this is pretty neat.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.600
You found this one, it's called ETA.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.440
And it's a graphical tool for monitoring progress.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.800
I mean, I don't know that I would call it graphical.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.160
Command line graphical.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.720
They call it graphical.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.680
I don't think the audience would define it as graphical.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.920
You're right.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.680
But it lets you get insights into the progress

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.400
of a process that you normally wouldn't get insight,

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.840
like a file transfer or like how long something's taking.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.360
The nice part, so it's not like, it's not magic.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.080
You're gonna have to do a little thinking to use it,

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.240
but it sets up a framework for a generic way

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.080
to get an ETA with a little progress bar.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.120
So if you have some units that are changing

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.760
and you have a way to get what the total size should be

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.440
in a way to get the current size

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.480
of whatever size might mean for your problem set

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.600
on one place versus another,

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.480
it will draw you a pretty progress bar.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.800
I kind of think one of the things

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.200
that it took me a little adjusting to

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.240
when I switched to Linux many, many eons ago

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:56.800
was returning nothing was a success.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.640
Right, yeah, right.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.560
When something goes perfectly,

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.480
the computer tells you nothing.

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.400
Nothing, and it's like, is that, did it work?

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.480
And like when it's like a big file copy

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.320
and you're just waiting and waiting and waiting.

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.520
And you need that, you don't have time to go.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.600
And then like all you get back is the command line.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.560
You're like, okay.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.920
So that's where this could kind of be nice.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.800
I could see that.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.440
So I don't, I've moved beyond.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.720
I'm past that now.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.360
Now I just like PS like a son of a bitch,

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:22.480
but no, I could see how ETA would be very useful.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.360
It is up on GitHub.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.440
We have a link in the show notes, linuxunplug.com,

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.240
slash 289.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.680
Now, I feel like we've talked about this next pick before.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.040
Oh, definitely, definitely.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.080
But I did a whole site search and I, nothing.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.120
But either we just are bad at tags.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:38.960
That could be it.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.800
We should, let's put it in the tags this week.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.800
NetData, the open source real time performance monitoring

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.100
and health monitoring application.

01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:50.420
If you don't know what NetData is,

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.920
then I have failed in my job as a podcaster

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.400
and I apologize to you.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.520
So we are trying to make good right now.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.920
This is so, so, so great.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.480
If you got like a VPS somewhere

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.000
where you're doing a few things

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:02.940
and wanna know what it's up to,

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.480
or maybe you got like a home file server.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:05.640
It's also great on your laptop.

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.480
Oh, absolutely.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.080
Yeah, have you used it recently?

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.760
Yeah, it's running on my system right now.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.680
I feel like it just came up in conversation recently.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.520
Yeah, it sure did in the most recent episode of TechSnap.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.680
Yeah, it turns out Jim, he uses it too.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.000
Okay, there you have it.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.680
Go check out that new TechSnap.Systems.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.520
397.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.580
397, Wes and Jim get into some really cool tools

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:27.840
for making your network a little more manageable,

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.480
a little more quality of service, if you will.

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.760
Something to be proud of.

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.960
Yeah, so NetData looks really, really good.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.440
And it is our bad if you're not familiar with it.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.960
I absolutely apologize

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.600
because it is an open source darling

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.400
and you need to go get it

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.820
if you haven't checked out NetData yet.

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:48.340
So ETA, Pi Music Box and NetData.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.640
In the show notes, we have a link towards like a demo of it.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.660
It's just so cool.

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.500
It's just so, so cool.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.360
Yeah, you're gonna get lost just playing with graphs.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.560
Yeah, you really could.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.520
I think though, the cool, the thing is I'm gonna take,

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.840
I'm gonna take my new Raspberry Pi that I got

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.080
and I'm gonna set up this Pi Music Box on it.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:04.920
I think that's gonna be-

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.280
I have one later and I'm gonna do it too because-

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.880
I'm gonna have like, I feel like I need a rack.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.140
Maybe if anybody has a recommendation,

01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:12.560
like a rack of Raspberry Pis

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.720
because I'm gonna have one Raspberry Pi

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.920
doing the music stuff.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.520
And then you got, I wanna do,

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.880
here's what I haven't told you about this yet.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.040
I wanna do a dedicated Raspberry Pi for my WireGuard stuff.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.160
Oh yeah, little WireGuard VPN box.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.520
Cause I got WireGuard running on my workstation

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.740
in my office, but I feel like now that I'm using it

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.480
as much as I am using it,

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.160
like it needs to be on a dedicated WireGuard device, right?

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.800
So a Raspberry Pi, WireGuard server, perfect, right?

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.000
I mean, we might as well set up a Pi-hole server too

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.520
just cause why not?

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.140
That's true, that's true.

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.120
And then last but not least, this Pi music box.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:51.120
So I want like a four or so rack of Raspberry Pi devices

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.680
that could do like wire management and stuff.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.000
If anybody has any recommendations,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.480
go to linuxunplug.com slash contact

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.000
or tweet me at Chris LAS

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.880
and let me know what you recommend for that kind of thing

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.480
because I could see, I could see some of a few.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:07.840
I mean, I've got like two or three floating around the studio

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.040
not being used right now.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:09.960
They just accumulated.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.080
What happens when you're, I guess, a nerd?

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.520
So might as well put them to some good use.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.760
That's right.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.000
All right, Mr. Payne, where do people find

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.920
that new TechSnap, revamped TechSnap?

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.560
TechSnap.systems.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.640
Very good, very good.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:22.920
Can they find you on the Twitter?

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:23.760
At Westpane.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.960
Ah, ah, I'm at Chris LAS.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.880
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.560
And don't forget, go check out Popeye and friends

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.720
live from Malta.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.800
We'll have a link in the show notes

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.200
if you want to check out their live stream.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.100
That's pretty cool.

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.640
That is pretty cool, so go check that out.

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:45.240
Linuxunplug.com slash 289 for all of our links.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.560
We'd love to have you join us live.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.040
Next week, I'll be flying into a remote location

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.520
and jumping on the live stream.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.720
So I would love you to make it.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.540
See you then.

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:53.380
Next Tuesday!

01:12:53.380 --> 01:13:09.380
We'll be right back with another episode of TechSnap.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.400
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.880
that's too busy getting actual work done

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.120
to care about what your silly display server.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:32.920
My name is Alan.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.520
You know what stings about that clip?

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.720
That was like three years ago.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.160
And we're still figuring out the Wayland stuff.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.480
And we've never properly gotten them back, either.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.560
Well, no, I mean, we don't have anything to tell.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.160
No, we don't.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.840
And once Wayland is finalized, I suppose.

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:53.720
Anyways, JBtitles.com, go vote, thank you, Mumble Room.

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.200
So I think we had a pickup, but I can't remember

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.680
what it was in the post-show.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:58.800
Do you remember what it was?

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.140
I said we'd pick it up in the post-show.

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.480
The ecosystem thing.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.480
In the ecosystem.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:02.980
Ecosystem.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.480
Do you remember what it was, though?

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.120
Because ecosystem has got to be the most generic description

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.720
of what we were going to talk about.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:13.120
I was talking about how the reason why

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.760
Enterprise Linux is successful is because it's

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.000
about partnerships and people and partnerships

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.600
and certifications and all these things that feed into each other

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.020
to help actually sustain it.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.700
And the reason why desktop Linux has failed

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:30.360
is because everybody tries to approach it like an island.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.880
Now you're saying failed.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:35.440
I prefer to look at it more as like a slow burn.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.760
And I look at it from an infinite timeline perspective,

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.880
in which what we just have to wait for

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.240
is the Microsoft Corporation and the Apple Corporation

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:49.000
to fade away, and then the desktop is ours.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.240
Now that we've got a little bit extra time,

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.840
you know what I think we should do?

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.680
Is we ought to get the audience to send us

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.640
some screenshots of all of the dot folders

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.800
in the root of their home directory.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.080
You know what I think?

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.920
Yeah, I think that's best because you

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.640
can have a number that describes it, which is good.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.400
Do that, too.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.240
Yeah, we need the number.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:06.680
But just seeing the mess.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.840
Yeah, we want to see the mess, the number, all of it.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.720
Take a screenshot.

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.120
Go install that tree application if you don't have it.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.560
And then get us a screenshot of your home directory

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.880
and tweet me at chrisles, or email into the show

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:22.080
by going to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.720
I want to see these home directories

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.480
because Wes brought a soapbox, and by God, we're

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:44.520
going to use it.
