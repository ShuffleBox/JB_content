1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
So we've been on the road for a couple of weeks and this is normally the time when I come on the air and tell

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,600
You how something broke in the rv or maybe I broke myself trying to fix whatever's broken in the rv

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,240
But I gotta say

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,320
Jupes is doing great. Those investments are paying off right? You got those shocks

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,040
You've been I mean fixing slides since the day I met you

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,840
Must be working now, huh?

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,360
Yeah, yeah

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,200
Yeah, the rv's working great

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:32,080
But the home server that runs pretty much everything like home assistant my sync thing my media server

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,840
My documentation my scheduling system all

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,840
of that

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
It died while we were down at jpl

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,240
Came back to a dead server

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,400
It only it's always something that breaks in the space where we aren't I know right?

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,680
I thought it might have been down because I couldn't connect a home assistant. I thought okay

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,320
Well could be home assistants hung up could be a networking issue or it could be something much worse

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
It turns out it was much worse

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,000
so now

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
no, I think you'll hear us do an episode on home servers soon because

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,840
Uh, you know, who knows what i'm gonna do. I gotta figure that out in the meantime

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,660
I guess the show must go on another episode of what not to do with chris

22
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,660
So

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,820
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly linux talk show. My name is chris. My name is les and my name is brent

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:35,140
Hello gentlemen coming up on the show today. We all get a front row seat to linux history in the making

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,620
We'll take you behind the scenes of our tour of nasa's jet propulsion laboratory and our thoughts on a famous linux platform

26
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,260
Getting shut down and then we'll round out the show some boosts and picks and a lot more

27
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,620
So before we go any further, I want to say a big good morning to our friends over at tail scale

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:57,460
Tail scale is a mesh vpn protected by wire guard. We use it. It's what connects all of our machines

29
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,660
It's what's making the show possible right now and it'll change your game

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,000
Go to tailscale.com and try it out for free for up to 20 devices at tailscale.com

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,500
So we are on the road

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
We are at listener jeff's right now

33
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,060
in sacramento, california

34
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,620
Just got done with the big pasadena meetup and the jpl tour which we will tell you about in a little bit

35
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,820
I feel like i'm still buzzing from that experience of so much great stuff there and that might be the hangover. Oh

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,740
Or some of those chemicals they use, you know for the

37
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,380
What for the science experiments and all is it the chem chem trails? Is that what you said?

38
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,260
Yeah, he did. He did break into that one room that he wasn't supposed to go into

39
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,100
It was like I like the color red and everything was red in there

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,220
Yeah, but that thing said chem trails don't go in. What'd you do?

41
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,900
You went in

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,460
But before we get into all of that, I wanted to talk about something that's been sent into the show quite a bit

43
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,820
We've been asked over and over again about our thoughts on stadia getting shut down google stadia

44
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:59,720
You remember it was launched as google's big entrance into game streaming and it was going to bring so many game developers

45
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,020
Over to linux to get things compatible with stadia

46
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:10,420
Stadia is only the newest most logic defined mind-bending absurd gaming platform on earth

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:17,700
Forget boxes forget consoles just your games your screens and electric air and this electric air is

48
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,180
stadia

49
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,060
Well absurd might be right 412 linux on twitter wrote sadly at chris last is the first person

50
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,620
I thought of after reading the stadia update. He really did believe in it. Can't wait to hear his thoughts on at linux unplugged

51
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,100
And if you missed the news

52
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
While we were on the road google wrote

53
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,800
That they are shutting down stadia changing strategies

54
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:47,140
And they will be refunding all stadia hardware purchases and game purchases to players. I didn't expect that part

55
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,780
I mean it does I think somewhat ease my frustration because

56
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,940
I mean i've been predicting stadia's downfall for what a couple of years now

57
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,420
Yeah, we all have

58
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,140
Everybody knew this day was coming

59
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,060
And I think that's actually maybe what sort of prevented it from being a success

60
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,900
In the first place

61
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,940
Is this like the moment where when your predictions comes true for the year or wes is wes usually makes this prediction

62
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,820
I can't remember. We'll have to review. I don't know if I did this year. Well, yeah, we'll find out

63
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,180
Unfortunately soon, you know the verge blamed linux

64
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:27,620
How come the verge writes google spent millions convincing publishers like ubisoft and take two to bring their biggest games to stadia

65
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,540
They go on to say

66
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:36,580
Google had to pay such large sums because of the work to port their games over wasn't particularly easy given stadia

67
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:44,100
Runs on linux a platform game developers haven't paid enough attention to I mean they're not wrong in the sense that yeah

68
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,020
That probably made this more difficult than if you were trying to set up some sort of you know

69
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,420
windows game streaming environment, but

70
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,780
at least by google's read they expected more user adoption and I don't know if the

71
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,900
One of those two were directly connected. I kind of liked a take I saw over at tech crunch which which said

72
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,780
Stadia died because no one trusts google. I agree with that take

73
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,540
I think that's that's why I never got into it as much as I wanted it to be a hit

74
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,500
And I really wanted it to create a network effect where developers begin porting more and more games over to linux

75
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,060
I think you could argue it was good for vulcan adoption. Yeah, it does seem like the

76
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,100
The bare bones of the like the technical side of this actually actually worked pretty darn well, you know

77
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,220
Like linux between all the work that valve is put in between the work that obviously google and then the stadia folks have put in

78
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,220
Between all the regular good linux stuff

79
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,940
Linux is ready for games. I just don't know if the world is ready for games on linux

80
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,220
Especially on google. Is there a connection between

81
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,780
Sort of steam doing its work and stadia coming out at the same time because it seems like those two were overlapping and I wonder

82
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,100
Which one made which possible?

83
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,580
Is it is it that google brought more attention to gaming on linux and that steam was able to take that?

84
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,060
Sort of energy and make it really run

85
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,940
No, I think you know, the linux side was kind of hidden over at stadia to me

86
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,860
it just seems that I don't know if anyone believes google can have a

87
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,580
Exciting new independent division that exists beyond their like core ad tech or youtube platform

88
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,980
And also the need for me personally with stadia was reduced when proton got good and I could run most games that I didn't

89
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,620
Have access to before on my machine again, right stadia was a little bit better of a solution

90
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,820
when I didn't have a local option for that stuff, but when

91
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,420
Proton came along and proton was pretty pretty good. Then I could just play that stuff on my computer again

92
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,140
So I think in some ways valve's entrance maybe harmed stadia's overall momentum, but I don't think it really could

93
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,540
Probably be accused of anything more than that. The other side of this too is you know

94
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,140
Even as a stadia sometimes stadia user feels like a lot of technologies these days

95
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,240
Like some apple products or sometimes tesla products or other things where I really like the technology

96
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,260
But the way it ends up being presented to the consumer and all the all the top layers of it

97
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,180
Just doesn't work for me

98
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,420
And I don't know like I was never going to get that excited about stadia because even at the in the best use case

99
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,340
How much was I going to really invest in it? It was never going to be fully under my control

100
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,460
I was just going to be depending on internet pipes and uh, you know google to keep running it

101
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,660
yeah, it's even worse than the compromise you make with the steam store where

102
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,140
You know when you buy games through valve, I guess they could technically take them away

103
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,540
but you when you install them you're at least downloading them and installing them locally and you've paid for them and you can put them on

104
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,020
other computers and other devices like the deck when those come out but with stadia

105
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,860
You are always tied to google in a very direct way in a way that made a better experience honestly because i've tried g force

106
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,620
I even tried on live back in the day and none of them were quite as good as google because they chopped off some of that

107
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,940
Uh user interface stuff and just got you right into the game

108
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:59,940
But classically like microsoft before them and and now how google seems to emulate what they once so much hated they don't

109
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,260
They don't fully embrace a technology like this

110
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,700
I should have been able to look up a game on youtube, you know, destiny 2 or star trek online

111
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,620
Look up that game on youtube watch a gamer and then one click

112
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,780
Inside the youtube ui I should have been able to transform that into a gaming experience

113
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,100
Launch the game in my browser and start playing within seconds. Google has the technology

114
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,580
They even they even talked about doing that at one point

115
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,940
They just never pulled the trigger because you could tell even internally at google. They just didn't have the support

116
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,220
They didn't even believe it themselves. It would stick around and I don't know if that's true

117
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:39,540
Stick around and I guess the upshot is is the only way they can save face and prevent a controversy is by refunding everybody

118
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,100
Which is probably going to cost them a pretty little penny

119
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:48,340
Yeah, people are also concerned that all those controllers out there unless google enables bluetooth on them

120
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,700
Which they have the hardware for i'm led to believe but just wasn't ever turned on

121
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,180
Well, that could also be a bunch of e-waste

122
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,020
I guess we should probably make it clear that this isn't actually going into effect until

123
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,600
Until january, I think it is so you still have a few months. Yeah, january 2023

124
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,980
Uh, they they said you have you got some time for quote unquote final play sessions

125
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,980
Yeah, yeah, you know go get your gameplay out now, I guess

126
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,580
But I imagine that if you've spent like I don't know 80 000 hours or so on playing a game

127
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:25,300
You can't even transfer it out. So what the heck it's so dumb. Yeah that part. I just don't get I don't understand why

128
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,940
Uh, they didn't like give you the option to maybe get a steam key or something. Maybe it's the competitive angle

129
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,420
I don't know what it is

130
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,220
But uh, not good enough chief not good enough

131
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,620
This is disappointing to see and the refund helps but it's not going to make me

132
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,820
Stop thinking everything google launches. They eventually are going to kill now. That's just like they just confirmed it

133
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
We are on the road again

134
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
On the road again

135
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,660
Just can't wait to get on the road again. This one has been a busy blur

136
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,900
There has been multiple phases of this road trip

137
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,940
I think we're like on the fifth phase right now because we got down to grant's pass like two weeks ago

138
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,540
We had a meet up down there. Then we got down to sacramento

139
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,420
We had another meet up there and we got to park here at listener jeff's house where we've got power and ethernet like

140
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,420
Kings, you know

141
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:24,900
It's nice over here. Then we uh, we switched from the rv and we switched to the car and we took the car down to pasadena

142
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:31,460
Which is like another seven hours from sacramento. Yeah, in case you've never been to california. It's obscenely giant. It's huge

143
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,540
It's way too huge. This is definitely it should be two states. There's no doubt about it in my mind

144
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,900
And then you get to pasadena where we had an airbnb as a team

145
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,220
So we flew in some of the team and we hung out there and uh, we did the jpl tour

146
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,860
Which we'll tell you about here in a little bit and then we did the pass

147
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,020
Adena meetup, which was our largest meetup yet and just an absolute blast

148
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,780
And along each of these major five phases of this road trip

149
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,660
We have been dropping geo caches all along the way as little treats for you guys

150
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,940
That could be listening today that could be listening a year down the road

151
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,060
Maybe you couldn't make it to a meetup. Maybe you're not even in that area today

152
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,820
But one day you will be we have little treasures for you that we have stashed throughout the west coast

153
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:19,780
And brent you did one of the first ones in southern oregon just north of grants pass at that little rest stop that the seven

154
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:26,100
Feathers casino has yeah hadia and I uh figured we actually talked a long time about like how hard do we make this?

155
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,780
Because we want people to find it. That's definitely true, but we don't want just random people finding it

156
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,420
We want jb listeners to be the ones finding it. So that was a bit of a tricky go

157
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,900
But we did find at this rest stop

158
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:45,380
A giant wall of boulders that seemed like just the perfect place. So we stashed this little geocache

159
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,980
It's got a bunch of really great stuff in it. It's got some swag t-shirts. It even has a freaking computer in there

160
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,220
So I feel like it's a wonderful to find if you do find it

161
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,180
Well, please work hard to find it because there's some great stuff in there

162
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,580
And if you do find it take some audio and uh, take some video as well send that our way

163
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,300
We would love to hear about how you find it

164
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:11,380
And um, also feel free to take the stuff and put new stuff in there and even I don't know

165
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,060
Start a journal of all the people that have found it just get creative like that

166
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:23,540
I like that but but no bsd stuff, right? Right? No kidding. Jeez gross. We like the idea of something that people could

167
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:29,620
Uh go look for when they're visiting the area. So look in the canyonville, oregon cow creek rest stop area

168
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,180
And hopefully you'll find something that you like

169
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,460
And then the lady and I we stashed the second

170
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,320
Geocache in sacramento in fulsome california

171
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:46,820
There is a hydro plant that has been retired that's open to the public worth going just for that

172
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,660
I think johnny cash played a really famous concert near there. Okay, nice good little hint, too

173
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,860
And uh at this retired hydro dam

174
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:02,660
There is a little nice space down by the water a little park area just to hang out and there is some burnt trees

175
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:10,980
That's your hint. It's in that general facility. We will have gps coordinates for all of these but they only get you within so close

176
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,700
So you're gonna need these hints too and that one so that one's in uh, sacramento in fulsome california area

177
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,220
And uh, also some good stuff in there again a little mini-carousel

178
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,460
In fulsome california area and uh, also some good stuff in there again a little mini computer in there some t-shirts

179
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,140
Some stickers feel free to leave a note and take the note that we've put in there for you and leave something else

180
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,400
Uh, because that's just too much fun. And then wes you got to hide one in pasadena

181
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,260
Yes, I did

182
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,320
Well here I am in beautiful downtown pasadena

183
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,800
The meetup's over the jpl trip is done and it's time to go home but

184
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,480
Before that i've got one last task

185
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
I've got a geocache to hide

186
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,420
Ah here we are this looks like a nice little spot

187
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,220
Good luck pasadena wes, I would love to know like give us more hints

188
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,140
I I feel like I need to know kind of what's out there. Was it on a beach?

189
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,020
Was it in a forest? Was it kind of in the middle of the city?

190
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,100
Oh, it's in the middle of the city. All right, and let me just say downtown pasadena

191
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,540
Absolutely, lovely. I hadn't been back there, uh since we went to scale a few years ago

192
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,420
So it was it was nice to get to see the city. It was nice to get to see the city

193
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,860
It was nice to get to see the city

194
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,580
Hopefully I hadn't been back there since we went to scale a few years ago. So it was it was nice to get to

195
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,580
Spend a little bit of time there on my last day

196
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,860
Let's see a hint. Okay

197
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,820
Well, there's a nice little park in downtown pasadena with some beautiful trees

198
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,300
Those trees

199
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,900
They seem they seem to have more than a few nooks and crannies. So maybe start there

200
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,260
All right, that's a good hint. I can I can I can almost kind of picture it already

201
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,300
The sacramento one I think is only hard because there's so many nooks and crannies it could be in

202
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,380
So we'll see the pasadena one. I imagine it's a little tricky too because there's probably a lot of area

203
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,540
There um, you know, well, can you trim it down? Is it in a nook or is it in a crane?

204
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,220
I'm not gonna classify that come on. That's above my pay grade

205
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,700
Okay, fine. This road trip has been a

206
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:25,900
Blur it feels like it's been one long monday. In fact, do check out office hours 13

207
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:31,340
We recorded that down at the airbnb and we recounted a lot of the story behind the scene stuff getting down here

208
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,660
So if you're curious about what the trip has been like some of the stories some of the meetup stuff

209
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,740
Do check out office hours 13 office hours dot hair

210
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:46,380
but I want to get more into some of the history we got to see being made at jpl and some of just

211
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,820
The real world uses of linux, you know, we talk about it here on the show

212
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,520
But to go somewhere and see them using it in these mission critical situations

213
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
It's always so educational

214
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
So I want to talk about all that seriousness

215
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
But before we get there, I want to have a little fun

216
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,920
And there was a moment where listener jeff who's been hosting us here at his house

217
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,400
Took us out to one of his favorite local diners a great staff there

218
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,080
They seemed like a lot of fun and I got myself a nice stack of pancakes

219
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
And after I got done eating these pancakes

220
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,360
I wanted to know what our local maple syrup experts opinion was on what I had just eaten

221
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,480
Okay, brent reviews the local syrup

222
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,560
Okay, this is actually a very small mug of syrup presentation is top notch

223
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Fragrance is nice

224
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,880
It's it's it's it seems a little more on the golden side than the that darn kirkland brand we had the other day

225
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
ready

226
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,720
Oh my god, okay, so

227
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,360
It's definitely not maple syrup and uh

228
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
What do I just eat

229
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
It's like corn syrup or something

230
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,480
With a tiny bit of maple in it perhaps but the texture is all wrong

231
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,840
So that's my review with brent. I'm still trying to get that mouth feel out of here

232
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,480
Like I just it was such a bad experience. I I kind of loathe that you put me through that

233
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,280
I thought when I handed it over to him saying I'm not going to do that

234
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,240
So you got to picture it. It's in a mini. Um, what are those mugs called brent like those, uh,

235
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,560
Hmm, it's kind of like one of those mason jars with the handles on it. Yeah, it's a mason jar mug

236
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:27,440
But it's a smaller one and it's filled with syrup. So they give you a ludicrous amount of syrup. It was just right

237
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,640
Okay. All right canadian. So, uh, I put on the pancakes and I you know, I was hungry and I ate them all up

238
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
And i'm like this syrup

239
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,680
It's not so good. And it's not so good. It's not so good

240
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,800
It's not so good. And I wanted to see what his take was

241
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,360
And then you just kind of like tore into it you troll

242
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,200
That was one of my highlights of the trip. So as you can imagine

243
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,800
Um, i've had some fun with brent. We tell it all in office hours 13. So do check that out

244
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,520
Lino dot com slash unplugged go there to get a hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account

245
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:13,040
And it is a great way to support the show while checking out something awesome because linode is fast reliable cloud hosting with the best

246
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:20,160
Support in the biz i'm talking about like real humans all day everyday humans that are right there fixing your problems on the first call

247
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,840
Not like this multi-tiered weird support system where you got to start a chat with somebody and then like they can escalate you to a

248
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Phone call but then that person can't no

249
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,480
No

250
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,320
Linode has built their business differently

251
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,580
So that way they can provide you great support while also continually investing in their infrastructure

252
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,360
Linode

253
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,240
Is gonna go crazy crazy. Linode is blowing out the doors and they're adding

254
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,640
I think it's 11 more data centers or something like that

255
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,480
So they got 11 data centers now and I think they're going to like 12 more additional data centers

256
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,040
It's it's wild you guys linode is just really moving these days

257
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,560
They invest back into their infrastructure and just make it better and better since i've been a customer

258
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,480
I have seen mvme hard drives. I have seen new amd epic processors roll out

259
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,760
I've seen upgrades to their infrastructure. I've seen new services come along like managed database services

260
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I've seen improvements to their physical servers that you can deploy and of course

261
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,240
I have begun to just use the absolute heck out of their s3 compatible object storage

262
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,000
And they're 30 to 50 cheaper than the hyperscalers that just want to lock you into their crazy esoteric platforms

263
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
30 to 50 cheaper is no joke

264
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,240
That adds up immediately

265
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,120
And on top of that they got the best performance. That's not chris saying that's not brent sitting over there quietly saying that

266
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,160
You go google it. It's been tested right right see brent's nodding. He knows

267
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,080
He knows he knows and it's just got great features as well easy backups and so much more

268
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
So go build something go learn something

269
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,240
And try it for yourself and thank them for supporting us on this road trip, too

270
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640

linode.com

273
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,840
We have a few things I want to tidy up around here before we get into the rest of the show

274
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,520
We have one more meetup. I want to let you know about friday, october 7th in portland

And we got a baller boost into the show this week so we love getting to your boosts

285
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,360
They're a great way to communicate with the show and the way to exchange a little value for value

286
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,680
And we want to highlight the big boosts that come into the show every single week

287
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,640
And ladies and gentlemen prepare yourselves because he's done it

288
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
for a fifth week in a row

289
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,080
John a is our big baller for linux unplugged this week

290
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:31,520
Unbelievable sir unbelievable. He says, uh, yes, I uh, he because we pre-recorded so he got in on a technicality last week

291
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,040
And he says yes, in fact

292
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,400
That was an accident on my case, but I am more than fine with that. You guys have been on fire lately

293
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,020
He sent in

294
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:47,360
And one sats into the show this week. So we really appreciate that john. Thank you so much the big ballers

295
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,200
Those are the moments when those come in you're like, okay, this gives me this gives me a little energy

296
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,080
It's like a little hit of like dopamine. Yes. All right. Let's go. Let's keep working and boy. Did we need that?

297
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,680
Today so john a thank you very very much. We appreciate that. Unfortunately, we were not able to stream live this week. So, um,

298
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,160
We uh, we did have some tech issues. We weren't really I actually thought we weren't gonna have an episode

299
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,400
I thought we weren't gonna have an episode then you see boosts like that come in. You're like no we got to keep going

300
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,680

We appreciate it and we have more boosts that we'll get to later in the show

303
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,220
If you'd like to send one and get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com

304
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:33,440
So let's talk about how we ended up at the jet propulsion laboratory because I think not everyone is familiar with the story

305
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,780
And it starts with a mutual love for linux, doesn't it with listeners?

306
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,760
And brothers that listen to the show and work at jpl

307
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,520
And we started talking with tim who was at the time like the mars helicopter operations leader

308
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,360
I think he's I think he's had a title upgrade since then and we knew tim was a kindred spirit when we started talking

309
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,840
Linux and solaris with him on the show

310
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,280
So jpl for many years was a solaris house, right? You know when I came out of school

311
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:09,200
Everybody wanted a big solaris workstation. Yep, you know the old spark workstations. They were pretty cool. They were cool

312
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,600
And so I got you know, I kind of came up the you can call it the unix curve learning how to

313
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,800
work on solaris and you know the

314
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,320
the flight project side used solaris a lot

315
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,480
and

316
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,600
Prior to getting on curiosity, which is the the big rover that's still on mars and operating

317
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,960
um, I had been on a project where we were doing a lot of

318
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,680
software technology development and

319
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,360
We could kind of see the writing on the wall that solaris was

320
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,920
starting to decline in the marketplace, so we in our own project we went and started looking at alternatives and

321
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,240
I just bought a pc made out of random parts

322
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,360
You know just commodity parts at the time

323
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,120
and

324
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
loaded linux on it

325
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,680
And took the software that we had on that project and compiled all that software on linux

326
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,240
and it was kind of a somewhat comical moment because one of the senior engineers in the project had had gotten his

327
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,140
$15,000 son solaris workstation

328
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,440
That he you know, he wanted as a senior guy

329
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,240
And we had the software compiling on both

330
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,520
And I took my my little commodity level pc and compiled the software

331
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,320
And and it compiled twice as fast

332
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,120
And he just had this look of what do they waste all my money on?

333
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,600
Yes, he just just just look came over his face like I can't believe that

334
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,800
And he ended up pawning off the whole system to an intern and then went out

335
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,200
It was kind of funny

336
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,680
you know when we were talking with tim at the meetup the fat theme kind of came up over and over again about how

337
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,320
things have flipped where jpl and nasa used to be seeding the technology that would then create the

338
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,300
The consumer tech that we all used now things have flipped around and the consumer tech like snapdragon processors

339
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
and lithium ion batteries

340
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,440
And blades for drones and whatnot have become so good that they buy the consumer stuff and they can buy it cheaper

341
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,840
And they can tinker with it easier and quicker. Yeah, I think on the on the tour

342
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,360
We heard that back in the old days. They even made their own physical nuts and bolts. Yeah

343
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,720
And it's like a 10x savings when they can buy it just from the market. It's a massive savings

344
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,120
They said but also means they can prototype quicker

345
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,960
And then the other thing that tim mentions later is that you know, it also means that they can find people who already know this stuff

346
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,960
So just having that relationship with tim was great because of what they're working on and that linux copter that they've built

347
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
That has just been so incredible and really become

348
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,560
Probably a real future part of all mars exploration that has a rover. I mean just incredible to watch that history and so tim

349
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,920
Tim started chatting with us. He said, you know, I think I could probably arrange

350
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,400
A little bit of a tour for you and some of the listeners if you're interested like well, yeah. Okay. We're interested

351
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,400
Are we not interested? Come on? Yeah, of course we are and so then it was just a matter

352
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,160
Well, how do we get down there?

353
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,560
And so that's when I started talking to linode and I said, hey, what do you think about doing another road trip this year?

354
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,480
We could do a series of meetups and then we get down to jpl and we could do a tour of jpl

355
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,880
And they don't said well, how are we gonna make money on that?

356
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,040
No, they didn't say that they said of course. They said that'd be great. We'd love to support you in the community doing that

357
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,320
and so they worked with us to make it possible to get down here and do this and

358
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,360
I'm telling you guys even as we were walking up to the entrance of the jet propulsion laboratory

359
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
It just wasn't feeling

360
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Real until we came around the corner

361
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
And we saw everybody there

362
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,760
Hello, sir, good to see you again. Hello. Hello. Hello

363
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,600
Hello

364
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,780
Hello. Hello. Hello everybody. Hello. Welcome to jpl

365
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,960
It's real it's actually happening

366
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
And you're all early good job

367
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,600
now we'll just uh

368
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,840
Take over the place because I think we got the numbers. So I see a bsd shirt. Yeah

369
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
You're gonna be our frontline guy

370
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,400
How about everybody showing up on time? How great is that? I mean we were on time and I felt late

371
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
Right

372
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,080
So, what'd you guys think of the tour wes I didn't capture your thoughts much afterwards

373
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,840
So i'm curious to know your overall take on the tour and if anything surprised you

374
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,600
I was really quite impressed with our tour guide, you know, he he um

375
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,480
Not only related a crazy amount of information

376
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,880
but I think I think did a pretty good job of bridging the gap because you know, you gotta have

377
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,380
You know much like doing podcasts sometimes you gotta be able to accommodate all kinds of different knowledge levels and backgrounds

378
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,500
And even as a science and space nerd myself

379
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,220
I felt like I was getting lots of little tidbits to hang on but it also seemed like like he did a good job

380
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,740
You know engaging some other folks. I'm thinking partially here of of your wife adia here chris in you know

381
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:52,900
Being interested in the crazy stuff going on in space, even if it feels very far away sometimes I appreciated too that

382
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,060
Especially with our crew that was there

383
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:00,580
You could throw a few of the technical questions at the tour guide and he had answers for like 99 of them

384
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:08,180
And which was really really impressive because we do have the best nerds in our audience and they geek out on this stuff

385
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:16,120
Oh jpl was awesome. Uh, I I really enjoyed seeing the cassini space probe and all the other space probe models in the auditorium

386
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,420
uh, but uh

387
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,580
since I I mentioned galileo before

388
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,540
I I was really happy. They built the entire museum around the galileo ground model

389
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:31,460
And that they left the high gain antenna deployed in its undeployed arrangement just like in real life

390
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,860
Nice, and then uh, how was it to see the control room because we weren't sure we were going to see that

391
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,620
Oh getting into where the magic happens

392
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,740
It was incredible and i'm glad I was able to sneak a couple peanuts out of one of those tubes, too

393
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,780
Sneaking the peanuts the control room was great. Hey, did either of you get any peanuts? No, I didn't even think of that

394
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:59,220
Oh, oh, well, I did I was oh really? Yeah. Oh, man. I was so focused on not touching any buttons

395
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,420
Yeah, I sat next to you and it was I mean you did touch a few that you just touched them really lightly

396
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,700
Yeah, and I actually caught my hand once reaching out on its own. But seriously that was that was amazing

397
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:15,300
I mean i've i've watched so many streams, you know and seen images on the internet of that control room

398
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:21,720
I reckon, you know, you recognize the little details and to be to be set physically there and watching the little animations

399
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,940
But they're not for show right? Like sure

400
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,060
I mean they're a little for show because they're on big tv screens, but that it's real data

401
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:33,540
We could see in real time. Like what's the transmission bit bit rate across the deep space network to these probes out in the universe?

402
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
i'm, just pausing for a moment because

403
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,420
You're right wes like I I the whole time felt surreal for me

404
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,820
and I

405
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,340
at a few moments

406
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:50,340
Tried to ground myself and be like wait, but wait, this is actually happening for us. We're in these places that we've

407
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,300
only seen on tv or dreamt of and

408
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,900
uh

409
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
That's what stood out for me was

410
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,980
You know everybody who was on the tour with us was super invested in the experience

411
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:06,740
Super respectful of everyone who was there trying to work really hard. You know, we got into some places that

412
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,180
People were actually working and we were trying to like just shimmy around them while they're working and take photos quietly

413
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,180
and so that we weren't disturbing them and

414
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,140
I I think that's what stood out for me is like

415
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,780
We got an amazing audience who really took everything in and appreciated every bit of it

416
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:28,840
Yeah, and the other thing that was a lot of fun from a technologist standpoint is just watching the eras of technology

417
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,700
When you go in there you see like oh that was clearly state-of-the-art in the late 70s

418
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:39,860
And this is the mid 80s and here's the 90s and here's the early aughts and you can see that with everything from like the storage

419
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,700
medium to the operating systems and how the operating systems could get more complex and

420
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:49,060
That all is extremely fascinating and hearing too about how they're now they're struggling with

421
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,740
Well, we deployed this up into space with an ubuntu 1604 base

422
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,580
And now we can't get modern software to build on an ubuntu 1604 base

423
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,540
but we still need to reproduce production and so they're like discovering kind of

424
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,660
linux specific challenges in a way and hearing a little bit about that was

425
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,740
Um enlightening, you know, these are the real problems that they face out there in the world

426
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,860
It was such a great tour. Unfortunately, they weren't very cool with us recording the tour

427
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:22,100
They were not okay with any kind of press or professional gear or anything like that

428
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,260
So we did our tour and then we had to say our goodbyes and do the swag giveaway thing

429
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,940
Well, thank you guys for all making it. This is a lot of fun

430
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,980
Okay, so we do have some great swag provided by linode got to tell the lady your t-shirt size

431
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,300
They run a tad small

432
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,180
Not atrociously

433
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:45,700
But yeah, just a tad nothing too bad. We got updated shirts this year and you know brand's going on right now

434
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,460
Yeah, it's actually really comfortable. I like this

435
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:52,740
We wanted to get alex's thoughts too from self-hosted because he was able to join us and is also a big space nerd

436
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,220
I think i'm just struck by the fact

437
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,300
of how amazing

438
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:04,740
This whole experience has been the audience that turned up were fantastic. You know, all interesting people all had stories

439
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,340
Some had driven 25 hours to come and see us

440
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Uh and take the tour too

441
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,860
And I couldn't believe some of the cool stuff. We got to see like the clean room. We actually got to see

442
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,300
The next europa satellite or the next europa mission that's about to happen

443
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,100
uh, we got to see

444
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,900
There was this really cool picture paint by numbers

445
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:33,140
Picture of a the first image from mars and I used to have that in a textbook from when I was a child

446
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,980
And I got to see it in person. My mind is still processing that

447
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,780
So huge. Thanks to tim

448
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,460
Chris hadia

449
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,460
Everybody at jb that made this happen

450
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,220
But from personal perspective, it was super cool, but I know from talking to several of the audience members as well

451
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,380
That they had a blast as well

452
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,900
Alex probably would have joined us on the show today, but he's flying back home. So he captured that in the airport for us

453
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:04,340
So we had the jpl tour. It was absolutely fantastic. And then a lot of that crew plus a whole bunch more people

454
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,740
Joined us the next day

455
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:13,780
For a big meetup at the congregation brewing ale house right here in pasadena. Hi, we're here at the meetup

456
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:20,900
Uh just after our jpl tour yesterday and uh, there's a bunch of ton of great people here. So, um, hello

457
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:26,900
How are you both? I'm doing great, man. And uh, tell me your names. Uh, i'm zack. I'm alex

458
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,780
Hello. Hello, and I uh gleaned from our conversation that you've come a long way

459
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,020
Yes, we came from central arkansas in little rock area

460
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,580
That's amazing. And how long did that take?

461
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:44,900
Uh, so we did it over two days. It's a 24-hour drive. Uh, we left saturday morning. We finally got to la monday

462
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,900
Isn't that something?

463
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,140
You know chris i'm realizing that you and I are not the only ones on a crazy road trip, right?

464
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,660
The audience is definitely making their own road trip to feel like they're here with us

465
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:00,820
I believe listener optimus gray did about a 24 25 hour one-way drive himself and uh,

466
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,020
Listener steve came from wyoming just to hear people talk about linux. My name is stephen ing

467
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:12,020
And i'm from lander wyoming and I yeah, I first went to the salt lake city meetup

468
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,260
I happened to be in southern california

469
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:19,300
So I thought I'd join you guys here and it's really cool, you know, it's a lot of fun to be among

470
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,180
I consider you all to be friends and colleagues because

471
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,380
I don't have friends outside this world who are into things like linux

472
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,340
They kind of look at me with that kind of

473
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,460
Scared stare, you know what I mean?

474
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:42,420
Well, thanks for coming all this way. Um, tell me something you hate about linux and what you love the most about linux

475
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,780
It's a vibrant bypass

476
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:50,420
The one thing I hate about linux is that it is so complex and it's so many pieces all over the place

477
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,420
And that's also the thing I like about it because there's just so much there

478
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,340
It's funny how often we got that answer. We asked people that a lot

479
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,220
complexity, uh number of choice

480
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,060
Uh too many options

481
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,620
It was the thing that was the number one thing they hated and the number one thing

482
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,140
They loved people really like a lot of different packaging formats. It turns out

483
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
Yeah

484
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Everybody had thoughts on that too

485
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,340
And you know when you're doing a trip like this and you're doing the meetups and you're you're doing these tours and all that

486
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,100
Kind of stuff. There's so many logistics so many and just to give you a taste

487
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:27,460
one of the many things that has to be solved is somebody has to watch levi the podcast dog like

488
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,700
You can't go to jpl. And while he could go to the meetup, it's probably not ideal

489
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:38,500
Yeah, my wife and I watched uh, levi during the jpl tour yesterday. This is listener tim

490
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,940
my wife is watching levi right now during the uh,

491
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,260
the meetup

492
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,540
Well, thank you for that. I mean I heard he had a really great time

493
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,020
So he was talking all about it when he got home yesterday

494
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,860
Yeah, it was fun. We enjoyed levi as a wonderful dog

495
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
very very chill

496
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:02,100
And made made himself right at home. That sounds like levi. Yeah. Well, it must mean they don't have any squirrels over there

497
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,580
Right, and they're probably not podcasting

498
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,940
Long-time listener eric who made it to the meetup also attended the jpl tour and we wanted to get his thoughts

499
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,740
It was epic. Um, it was really good like as someone that doesn't follow

500
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,700
nasa or jpl too closely

501
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,860
Um, I was a little bit, you know, like oh, this is gonna be too much

502
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:27,060
But I knew it was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime and I really I loved it

503
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,820
I loved every minute and as we talked to him

504
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,900
It's like stuff really stuck like stuff. He never knew it really registered with him

505
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,140
And I I think listener eric is slowly turning into a big space nerd now

506
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,260
I don't think he knew too much about it beforehand and it really stuck with him

507
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,580
And I think he's going to be geeking out a whole bunch. This was a pretty fun meetup

508
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,140
We were there for at least five and a half hours

509
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:53,460
We had so many people come and go we had food we had drink and tim who helped set all this up at jpl

510
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,260
And has you know just been like our tour guide to linux in space

511
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,980
He made it to the meetup as well and he sat down with brent

512
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,940
It's been a great time. It's been great to meet everybody and the hosts and all the other people that come along because

513
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,340
we're all engineers and and uh

514
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,420
Computer geeks and we love space. So it's been a great time to meet everybody great

515
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,340
I saw uh, you brought a little something that you've been showing people. Are you allowed to talk about that?

516
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:22,760
Yeah, sure. I brought an example of the processor or one of the processors that's on the ingenuity mars helicopter

517
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
And it's a tiny little helicopter

518
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,420
Computer it's about the size of a match book box

519
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,220
And it's great to show everybody the kind of computer that we're flying and how small it is something

520
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,420
They could just take a look at yeah previously on linux unplug

521
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:42,500
We've talked about these things but seeing the scale of it and some of the stories you've been telling about batteries and stuff is

522
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,900
kind of incredible actually

523
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,860
It's incredible, but it's also concepts people can understand right there were people here who did drone development

524
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,620
And they looked at the board and they said hey, that's almost identical to the board

525
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:58,020
I use and yeah, I understand you're using these sony batteries that i've used before and

526
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:03,300
Using these sensors and things and you're managing, you know software so I get it

527
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,700
So it's it's the same time. It's exotic

528
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:11,860
But it's also approachable that a lot of people here who've worked in the industry and or just as hobbyists could understand it

529
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,140
Yeah, is it nice for you to see people out in the world?

530
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,540
Who understand the concepts that you deal with on a daily basis kind of back at work?

531
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,580
Yeah, it's nice to talk to people who understand some of the concepts because often with you know

532
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,580
Being an engineer some of the family and friends

533
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,280
They just kind of stare at you blankly when you try to when you try to explain the technology

534
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,100
And whereas with this crowd they're like, oh, yeah. Yeah, I understand

535
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:40,020
that's you know, that's linux and you do these kinds of things in linux and you know, that's flash memory and it's

536
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:45,380
It's running a computer an arm processor. That's like the raspberry pi and so on and so forth

537
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,740
So they get it and they can relate it to things they've done in their own career

538
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,460
So it's in many ways easier to explain it to that crowd

539
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,340
These meetups that we do, you know

540
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:59,700
We've done a few of them now and it's always a treat because you learn something new you meet people who have these

541
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,140
Wild backgrounds and you know having you here is a special treat

542
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:08,420
But actually every single one of them is is great to talk to you as well. Yeah, absolutely. It's it's not like i'm some

543
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,540
A special person i'm just a somebody who grew up probably similar to many of the people here

544
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,900
I was just fortunate enough to get a cool job at a place like jpl

545
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,340
And apply the skills that I learned and you know, I always

546
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,060
Take time to step back and just realize

547
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:30,180
Even though i'm an ordinary person. I've really had a chance to have an extraordinary career at a place like jpl

548
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,780
But you know all these people too have their own special niche

549
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:39,060
Where they've learned something and they've had fun doing it and they they're enthusiastic about it. That's why they're

550
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,780
Listening to the podcast and coming to events like this because they just enjoy it

551
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,860
Okay, tim i've been asking a few questions of almost everyone. So, uh, hopefully you're ready for this one

552
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,300
The question is what do you hate the most about linux and what do you love the most about linux?

553
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,860
What I love about it is it's a really nice

554
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:06,420
Stable environment to do software development in it's one of the reasons we picked it for the helicopter. It's very stable

555
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,100
So that part I like about it

556
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,820
I've been living in that world for a long time doing software development

557
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:16,340
And compared to an environment like windows where you're just it feels like you're always forcing yourself to do

558
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,020
Unnatural ways to do things but linux just has a smoothness to the the whole development

559
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,740
Environment and you know all these tools especially open source you can take advantage of

560
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,860
I think the thing that is the most frustrating is that

561
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,100
even though it

562
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:39,460
Is in its core really stable a lot of the user facing features just seem fragile at times you try to configure a program

563
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,780
You know or a desktop or try to set up a video card

564
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,660
Or something like that and things just break with mysterious errors and you just don't know why

565
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,660
And so I think

566
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,900
You know, you live with the good and you live with the bad right you live with the nice parts and live with awards

567
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,900
You just got to know how to

568
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,960
How to manage a system like that and use it for its strengths. Yeah, you were talking about using 1604

569
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,380
and uh

570
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,140
Just trying to port a few gooey's and that's actually some of the some of the worst stuff

571
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:11,060
You're dealing with because it's just super annoying and you want to move to more modern stuff

572
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,860
And uh, that was interesting to hear you talk about that. Yeah, we just had to reconstruct an older environment

573
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,220
And a lot of the hardware has moved on a lot of the software has moved on so kind of rewinding back to that era

574
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:27,620
You know 1604 would be 20 2016 which is an eternity for something like linux

575
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,580
But having to do that and trying to reconstruct this environment was tripping me up

576
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,980
And so I was gnashing my teeth a little bit trying to do that. But you know

577
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,060
It's still on the on the sum. It's it's a great environment to work with

578
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:48,500
Uh tim, thank you a for inviting us to jpo and we had an amazing tour yesterday

579
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,540
I know you wanted to join us on the tour, but you didn't quite get a chance

580
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,540
But you were there for a little bit. So thank you for that

581
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,580
You're welcome

582
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,140
And I always love to meet up with people who are kindred spirits

583
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,500
And i'm glad that the group was able to get together and have a really good time

584
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,380
Exploring a place that i've really loved to work at over the years nice and also

585
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,980
Thanks for coming to the meetup as well. I mean, it's been a real treat to have you here

586
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:16,340
Yeah, it's nice to just kind of sit back and relax. Enjoy the crowd. Enjoy the food and just talk about life

587
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,260
Even apart from technical issues. It's been a great group. Hey, well, thank you

588
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,700
You're welcome

589
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,860
And we really can't say thank you enough because it just gave us a great opportunity for us to come together as a team

590
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,420
And it gave us a great opportunity to do something that will

591
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,620
Last with us forever, right? We created some great memories there

592
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:37,300
Yeah, and I feel like some great friendships too. Tim has already invited us back. He said anytime you're back. Say hi

593
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,860
Maybe the airbnb could have been a little better. Uh, that was a funky airbnb

594
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,700
We stayed at but I guess it had some gems and it had some rough edges

595
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:51,060
You're just mad because you started a greets fire. There was the grease fire. I blame barbecue maintenance on that one

596
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,500
I don't blame that on me

597
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,420
Uh, I I am grateful for the star trek the next generation live stream that played the entire time

598
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,300
We were there we made it through 94 episodes of star trek the next generation and we didn't even plan that

599
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,540
No when we walked through the door

600
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:10,340
Episode one of season one just happened to be playing on the television and when we went out the door cupid was playing

601
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,400
Um, we didn't see all of them obviously because we had to go to bed sometimes

602
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
Wesson I tried. Yeah

603
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,440
You got to a lot of them, this is good memories it's good time and it's so exciting to see uh

604
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,800
linux and all of this technology coming together at a point that makes it approachable and accessible for these kinds of missions and then they're

605
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:35,560
Performing and exceeding expectations like for example those little sony batteries that tim mentioned there

606
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,120
They're holding up in the deeply deeply deeply cold martian winter

607
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:47,000
Uh, the way tim put it is the lithium batteries are turning into battery cycles every single night and they were paranoid

608
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
They were they were absolutely afraid that that would destroy the batteries, but they're holding up

609
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,760
It's making it and the linux little copter just had its 33rd flight recently. I mean we've got one planet down

610
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
How many more to go for linux, right?

611
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:07,400
Bit warden dot com slash linux go sign up for yourself or an enterprise account go try it and you know

612
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,480
October is cyber security awareness month and bit warden would like to remind everyone about key actions that the federal agency for cyber

613
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:21,240
Security recommends that you take and it starts with what I always say use strong passwords bit warden can generate and store strong passwords for you

614
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,200
Enable multi-factor authentication on all your accounts including your password manager

615
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,160
They also recommend that you keep your software up to date

616
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,600
And take steps to recognize and report phishing as well

617
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,920
Remember weaker stolen passwords represent the majority of successful hacking attacks

618
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,360
Using a strong unique password for every account protects you and your business from these attacks

619
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:50,920
Bit warden can create save and auto fill passwords for you and multi-factor authentication. That's the easiest way to add extra security to your accounts

620
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,960
Enabling two-step login on bit warden improves the security of your password vaults

621
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,240
And there's options like verification through email or an authenticator app that's available for all your accounts

622
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,600
Fido 2 or yubikey odp if you're a premium subscriber

623
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,360
Premium subscribers can also have bit warden generate time-based one-time password authentication codes for your accounts

624
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:17,960
Adding strength to your passwords and bit warden supports security for all with fully featured free accounts available to everyone

625
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:24,040
This cyber security awareness month protect yourself and help protect loved ones by educating them about password security

626
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,440
And by starting up a free bit warden account today

627
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:33,580
So get started today at bit warden.com slash linux. That's bit warden.com slash linux

628
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,680
As always we got some great feedback this week, so thank you very much for sending some in

629
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,700
Sid wrote us about some photo adventures

630
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,160
Sid writes I wanted to add to the discussion around replacing google photos

631
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,400
I've been using image since last week when you mentioned it and it's been working great for me

632
00:45:53,400 --> 00:46:00,200
Regarding storage though. I've written software on top of storage and I plan to use it for automatic off-site backups

633
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,440
Using something like duplicati or restic

634
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,440
However, I found that their documentation is pretty bad and overall it was a headache to implement

635
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,560
I would not recommend it for anything sensitive and I feel like you should definitely use encryption on your end if you're using it

636
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,360
Yeah, I agree on that. It sounds like sid is still pushing ahead with using storage

637
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,840
So it knows those weren't enough of a deal breaker. Yeah, isn't that interesting? I am too

638
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,160
And I think the documentation point that depends on what you're looking for, right?

639
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,880
Like I found pretty good documentation on getting duplicati configured

640
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,920
But I could see if I was trying to write an app that lives on top of storage

641
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
Maybe I wouldn't be as happy

642
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,760
And then you got to figure it's kind of early days too in regards to image. I am m I ch which is a google photos alternative

643
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,680
Also early days what I love about image is that it has a local app

644
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,440
So it'll run on your phone and uploads to the server. That's great. It's got a nice ui nice

645
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,320
But it doesn't have all the classifications and search features that something like photoprism has right now

646
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:01,800
So um in my book photoprism is the further along solution for the problem that needs a solution today

647
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,980
But uh, I am definitely keeping an eye on image and I have a suspicion

648
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,280
That we will do future coverage of image on the self-hosted program

649
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,780
If you'd like to hear more we did talk about some of chris's early investigations

650
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:21,820
Into some of this photo syncing in a linux unplugged episode 476. Yeah, and shout out to listener tony

651
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:28,860
Uh, they stayed up to the double up and watched it on jupiter.tube last week. Wow. That was a five hour live stream

652
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,100
so

653
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,180
That is very impressive. I have to say I don't know. I don't think I could watch it

654
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,260
I don't even know how we did it to tell you the truth

655
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:44,780
I don't even know how we did it to tell you the truth. I don't even know have we mentioned that we have the best listeners?

656
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,580
And now it is time for the boost

657
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,060
Speaking of those best listeners listener

658
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:55,660
Michael b boosted him with 3000 sats and said I was just listening to your chat about package managers and I wanted to share something

659
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:01,820
I just recently switched from ubuntu to fedora and now due to work and other reasons. I ended up with four

660
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,660
different

661
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:08,540
Package managers i've got dnf flatback homebrew and snaps

662
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,340
I admit that sounds crazy, but so far

663
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,380
It's all working without issue. Thanks for the great show

664
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,860
Michael, okay. Now we tell michael about next so we can get to lucky number five

665
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,620
Exactly. There's also pip that can come in handy. Oh, he probably has that he probably does have pip installed

666
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,620
He's just probably not using it very often

667
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:32,060
I mean michael, I think you could add a couple more to that list. Um, is that a problem or is it a gift?

668
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,740
You tell me because according to our listeners at the meetups is the thing they love the most

669
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,220
And the thing they hate the most so

670
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,940
I don't know what that tells us

671
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,180
Gene being boosted with 2048 sats

672
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,900
Hey chris, if you edit a synced photo on your internet phone

673
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:53,260
Does that updated image get pushed to your server? Remember reminder i'm using photosync with photoprism

674
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,900
He says for example say all your photos are synced up

675
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,580
Then you decide to crop a picture from full size to a square on the phone

676
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:05,020
Does that one on your server also now appear cropped? If not, how would you deal with this?

677
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:10,220
I ask because a lot of my post processing I do as an amateur on my phone

678
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,460
Great question, you know, i've noticed doing this on android

679
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:23,260
In a variety of different apps that it typically saves a duplicate photograph with the very similar name maybe an extra

680
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,180
Prefix or suffix that means that you just have two files

681
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:31,420
You have the original and now you have the crop version and I would assume that both of those would get synced

682
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:35,900
Yeah, I think it would on android. I think on the internet phone. They do like a layered thing of revisions

683
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,380
And so when you crop a photo

684
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:45,420
Photosync and this is a photosync issue doesn't necessarily see it as a new photo if you saved as a copy it would

685
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,300
But if you crop the original photosync is like what there's no changes. What's the big deal?

686
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,860
Oh, so it doesn't even sync the edit rather than the edits wiping out the original. You just don't get the edit

687
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,180
Yeah, it doesn't see it as a new file as far as I can tell on the iphone

688
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,420
I think it would on android, but if I tap it and manually sync that file

689
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,900
Then it updates on photoprism just fine. It overwrites the one in photoprism the way you'd expect

690
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,420
So i'm going to play around a little bit more with that even these kinds of things

691
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,860
I'm fine with working these out because not only is there all the issue with google

692
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,180
And the things that we talked about recently

693
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,700
But just after we recorded our episode about getting rid of google photos

694
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,820
It turned out that google photos was messing up old backed up images for some users like way back in their archive

695
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:27,980
and people's images were getting screwed up and they've been rolling out a fix, but

696
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:32,460
I mean, I just think it's just time to get off google photos and I think that just sort of underscored it

697
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,500
Agreed, we're gonna have a big land this week

698
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:41,500
So next cloud introduced a new photo feature that I think we got to dig into and try it before this week's land

699
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:45,020
Because that could be another option could be we'll see

700
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:50,220
In the meantime sky push boosted in with 1000 sets

701
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:54,940
I've been running calyx for about a year now after the privacy bug bit

702
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,880
I wanted something that straddled privacy and stock functionality

703
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:06,300
The majority of my apps come from f-troid while aurora store anonymizes the two proprietary ones. I still need

704
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,900
Calyx is kind of perfect for my use case and clock's creepy uncle google

705
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:16,540
I commend the devs and at this point we'll never go back

706
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:22,460
So the number one thing i've heard since i've installed graphene os on my pixel is that I should try out calyx

707
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:26,060
I had to tell you it's something you know, this happens every time I do an android rom

708
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,860
Whatever rom I didn't try is the one I hear about a whole bunch

709
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,940
Have you heard about stock bro?

710
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:35,340
At the meetup a lot of people liked calyx again a lot and what i've kind of pieced together

711
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,420
I don't know if this is true or not because i'm new to all this but

712
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,940
It seems like calyx is really popular with the linux community

713
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:44,460
And it seems like graphene os is really popular with the security community

714
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:49,340
And i'm kind of going more for the security angle of things and the one thing that graphene os

715
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:54,060
Has going for it that seems super appealing to me is you can install via their tool

716
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,220
google play

717
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,900
And the play services in a sandbox and then you can restrict

718
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:06,780
everything the play and uh services can get to and you can run apps that require the play api

719
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,180
Or are only available in the play store or the new one I discovered is a pain in the butt

720
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:16,700
To require in-app purchases and sometimes then require the play store with graphene os

721
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,700
You can sandbox all of that stuff and that is so appealing to me

722
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,860
So i'd be curious to know what people think about that

723
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:26,700
What they think about the quality of the sandboxing and how that compares to what calyx offers

724
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:32,160
Well on that subject bond boosted in with one thousand two hundred and thirty four satoshis

725
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:39,520
Former iphone user here turned calyx os user for about one and a half years now, and i'm loving it

726
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:44,000
calyx makes google camera available in the aurora store, but

727
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,800
Turn off network access to it and don't allow any permissions before you open it

728
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,680
Then you get the best phone camera available without the google access

729
00:52:54,080 --> 00:53:00,000
That sounds like a really nice trick and actually fairly simple. Yeah, no sandbox required. It sounds like yeah, but again with

730
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,320
Graphene os. I just installed the play store and I can just get the google camera and it all works pretty well

731
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,600
And now the google google camera is also sandboxed and limited on what it can do

732
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,880
I like it. I like it a lot, but i'm i'm open

733
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,960
I'm i've heard a lot of good things about calyx. Well, we've got a little more for you then four-legged emu boosted in with

734
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:22,320
3000 sets coming in hot with the boost calyx os is worth looking at for your pixel

735
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,680
I haven't tried graphene, but i'm very happy with calyx

736
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,280
And uh frozier boosts in with 5000 sets

737
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,880
A little representation here because frozier is a three-year graphene os user

738
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,200
Everything works perfectly no paper cuts at all. And then I think they're throwing a little shade at you here chris

739
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Google play services can be enabled

740
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:51,360
If you wish I get that I do get that like like I when I mentioned this to people in person like you realized

741
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,440
The point of this was to get away from google

742
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,400
You realized the point of this was to get away from google, right?

743
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,880
Oh, yeah, I know I know

744
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,000
It's just sometimes I want to be able to take pictures that look decent too

745
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,640
true grits wrote in following up on some of chris's questions around listening habits with

746
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,000
2468 sets even live long and prosper

747
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,720
I try to listen to all the episodes as they come out

748
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:22,160
However, sometimes such as during the summer I get a few weeks behind been slowly catching up and i'm almost there. No worries true grits

749
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,120
Thank you for letting us know i've been curious to hear people's various listening habits and how far behind they are

750
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,440
Just so we have data on that. So, uh, if you want to share that with us, please boost it in

751
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,600
But how how far behind was true? Chris? When did we when we posed that question? I think about three weeks ago

752
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,920
There we go. I just want to I just want to creep a bit on sure gets that's my there you go

753
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:47,040
Yeah, I feel like listening math is hard. Yeah, because we pre-recorded so it's technically maybe a month

754
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,460
The golden dragon also boosted in with a set of lead sets

755
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,440
Love mascot

756
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,640
Golden dragon writes long time no boost. So gold by imagine dragons seems cool

757
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,080
I'm, not a huge pop rock guy, but that song kind of grooves

758
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,040
I was aiming for something from free music archive, but it's a bit of a mess over there

759
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,760
Also, what do you think of magic wormhole as far as i've researched?

760
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,520
It's a great way to send files across long distances that's encrypted and compressed kind of like bit word and send

761
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,760
Hmm. Yeah, okay

762
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,600
I like wormhole a lot wes and I use it frequently to move files back and forth

763
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,200
And I think the encryption is probably adequate for what you're looking for

764
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,520
Yeah, I mean, you know if you want to you've got something really secure then

765
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:39,200
Layer something on top but the you know, the fact that it's nice and ephemeral

766
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,760
And it means, you know, you can transfer that file and then once you're done walk away

767
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,160
And one part I really like is just that you know, it's it's a python program. Uh, so

768
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,480
To brent's point earlier. It's really just like a pip install away and that means it can work on

769
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,120
It can work on your mac on your linux or even your windows box

770
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,640
And it does and it's also packaged by everything too. So, you know brew linux packages

771
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,960
They've all got it and the syntax is so easy. It's wormhole send then you point at the file

772
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,240
So if I were a little more paranoid or doing it for myself, I might just use tail scale send since I have that

773
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,880
On all my machines now and that's kind of like airdrop, but using tail scale on the back end

774
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,320
Um, or you know, maybe you could look in a bit word and send I think that'd be another option as well

775
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,160
Just kind of depends on what your security requirements are. I have another one to throw in there as well

776
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:30,480
Uh simply wormhole dot app and uh, I think what really gets me there is just really the background seems to work fine

777
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,840
And of course with lots of these tools you can uh, host your own little relay server if you need to and that's another way

778
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,840
To add on some layers of security

779
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:44,880
Oh, whoa, see sneaky double boost this week from frozier with 5 000 additional sats

780
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:50,320
Dwm was very difficult with nixos for me

781
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,520
Because it's meant to be configured by the user

782
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,840
in the source code

783
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,720
Before it's built so I gave up and I used awesome wn

784
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,880
Here's my config. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, I could see that being a little tricky, you know

785
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,560
I mean nix is great at building stuff

786
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,640
But then you got to kind of maintain your own version and hook that up to everything surely possible

787
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,200
But as a former awesome user myself

788
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,720
Love it and uh, thanks for thanks for sharing the codes and the bits. That's that's great

789
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,400
Yeah, we'll put a link to that in the show notes

790
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,400
So people want to check that out wolfman 2g1 boosts in with 1500 sats. You're doing a good job

791
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,520
Just got my ham license and it got me thinking

792
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,980
Is any of the jb crew amateur radio operators?

793
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:39,440
Oh, no, another ham question what's happening? I know I think our next boost is about ham radio, too

794
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,160
Ask might as well read that i'll be 1984 boost in with a thousand sats

795
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,480
first boost ever

796
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,600
Hey, oh, hey, congratulations. Hey, you know what you're doing a good job, too. You're doing a good job

797
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,240
Oppie goes on. I also would be interested in a ham radio discussion

798
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,560
Here's a link to a ham site with some dedicated ham linux distros. We'll keep that one in the notes nice

799
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,560
Okay

800
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:10,880
All right. All right. Well, you know something that we should mention on air and rust a cast of versa boosted with 2000 sats

801
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,120
Linux and ham. Did you know there's a whole podcast around this called linux in the ham shack?

802
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,320
Maybe a little special with noah would be cool. That is the best linux podcast name

803
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,200
I've ever heard it. That is pretty good. And you know what it would be a lot

804
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,200
It would make so much sense to do it with noah

805
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,000
So, uh, I think that's something maybe that's how we'll handle it

806
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,440
We'll talk a little software defined radio because the matrix room has been talking about this quite a bit in the feedback rooms

807
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,160
And they think we should do something around software defined radio

808
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:41,280
So maybe we bring in a little noah we get a little brown bear going on the topic and we have some fun

809
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,120
I could see that coming down in the future. So keep your radios tuned. You never know

810
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,440
There might be something in the near future

811
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,980
Rasta also boosted with another 2000 sats. It's a dubs

812
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:59,120
He writes was the dev1 unboxed in the bat cave I swear I hear lots of water running

813
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,440
Yeah, you know I meant to address that when we recorded the dev1 unboxing. Um

814
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,280
Unboxing. Um brent has a urination issue. It's true

815
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,680
It's just all that hydration

816
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:17,040
So we've rigged the studio up special to handle it because you know, there's sanitation issues. No, I have a frog tank in the studio

817
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:23,360
In the living room and we were doing the unboxing and it's one of those things that i'm totally used to because it's been in

818
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,480
There forever

819
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:29,040
But it does sound a little obnoxious in that particular recording. It sounded like you set your

820
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:33,620
Recorder right on top of the thing. It was so bad. I apologize about that. Um, you know

821
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:39,140
Just think of it a little ambiance resta, you know picture a little froggy in there swimming around while we're unboxing the dev1

822
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,060
It's pretty great

823
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:45,940
Also, I just want to say a big thank you to some folks who boosted in but we didn't read their boost on the air

824
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,540
There's so many that come in. We are just selecting some of them now

825
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,660
But a couple of just a couple of quick shout outs here

826
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,660
Here

827
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:01,860
90 sats from retro penguin a long time first time sending in their very first boost

828
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:07,220
We got 50 sats from couch fox who earned his first sats that day and then sent them into the show

829
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,380
Absolutely amazing. It's so great. And then we got nine thousand sats from sultros

830
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,660
Who just got himself an hp x?

831
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:24,440
360 convertible laptop and he's running Debian testing on that thing with gnome and he says the touchscreen support works

832
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,920
Well, I like it. I'm loving that. I'm loving that. Keep keep the hardware reports coming in folks

833
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,120
We can just slowly but surely let people know what's working out there

834
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,180
So they know what hardware to get if you'd like to boost into the show

835
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:41,640
Go get a new podcasting app at new podcast apps comm get one that supports podcasting to know like fountain or pod verse

836
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,480
which is GPL and available for the web Android iOS and

837
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,280
It's an f-troid. It's right there in f-troid, too

838
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,480
So go check that out

839
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,360
And if you really want to nerd out you can use boost CLI or breeze

840
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,880
That one then you don't got to change your podcast app

841
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,600
I'll tell you what and we should mention to thank you everybody who's boosted in we've been doing splits with Brent so that way he

842
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,940
Has some sats for his gas tank in office hours 13

843
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:09,240
We bought some steaks with those fats too since we had a few extra ones and we grilled up some steaks for everybody and

844
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,760
Then the barbecue caught fire

845
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:18,140
Yep, the barbecue caught fire like not intentionally on like like not like we turn the burners on kind of fire

846
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,680
But like an emergency fire where we were afraid to open the hood because we thought we might get back drafted kind of fire

847
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,280
Thankfully we saved most

848
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:33,680
And we talk all about it and officer's pretty great clip if you're curious how we convert the sats into real-life goods

849
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:38,200
Well, we just send Brent out on the street and he comes back with cash. I'm not exactly sure what he does

850
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:43,200
We don't ask we thought about doing that but instead we went for the easier option

851
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,800
we went with bit refill and

852
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:51,040
bit refill calm lets you actually use Bitcoin on chain or lightning and then you buy a gift card and then you spend that so

853
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,820
Like Chevron Texaco instacart the grocery store

854
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,560
Banks, there's so many gift cards on there

855
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:02,880
And so it was actually pretty trivial for us to be able to convert those sats and then you know

856
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,840
Put them in instacart and we ordered groceries for the Airbnb

857
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:10,600
That was something else that we were able to do with those sats. So thank you everyone that split worked out fantastic

858
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,760
Not only did it give us the funds to get Brent down here

859
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,840
But then we're able to treat the crew to some steaks as well

860
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,480
And you know, sometimes we did that just kind of on a whim like we weren't even really planning it

861
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,960
But it's like we got a couple of hours tonight. Let's just get this. Let's do it

862
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,100
And we just had a lot of fun. So thank you everybody. That was really a treat

863
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,680
We have a pretty special pick I don't know if this is for everybody

864
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:39,840
but those of you who are into this kind of thing are gonna absolutely love this up on the jet propulsion laboratory github page

865
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,680
They have the open source Rover project. Yep. That's right

866
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,960
the open source Rover project and

867
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:52,600
It has so many goodies on here about the little Rovers out there including just like

868
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,000
stats and specs and information on how to build your own and

869
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:03,200
Even how to emulate one and control it with an Android device an Xbox 360 controller and a Raspberry Pi. That is so incredible

870
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,800
It's so perfect

871
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,640
So we'll link to this in the show notes you can go check it out because it looks like a lot of fun

872
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,040
Even if you just want to geek out on the 3d models that they have there in the different parts

873
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,720
It's really amazing that you can build this with just off-the-shelf stuff now, you know

874
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,920
If we built one for the studio

875
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:26,600
We'd have a little company for the days that Levi's not here with us and maybe we could teach this one to bring us a cider

876
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,420
Hmm, we could just build a little cooler into its back. Oh now you're thinking, you know

877
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:37,420
I've been pretty impressed at JPL's open source mentality. Tim's mentioned several times how much he loves that

878
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:44,040
Paradigm and way of working with software and hardware, but they just really prove it with their github page

879
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:48,640
There's like projects galore on there that you can dive into Chris you and I had a blast

880
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,760
Just trying to pick a pic for this episode. And I mean this one's great, but there's a lot of other stuff in there

881
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,480
So there's a lot we could have picked

882
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:01,160
Totally. Yeah, why didn't you pick this automated low latency global glacier flow and elevation change data set?

883
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,640
I mean, come on, obviously we were saving it for next week spoiler

884
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,240
You know speaking of next week

885
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:13,720
Hopefully we're back in studio. We should be back at our regular live time, which is noon Pacific 3 p.m

886
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,000
Eastern over at Jupiter dot tube and

887
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
You know things are just gonna be back to normal. No more on-the-road shows

888
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,640
Just a call really now that we're back is gonna be trying to start working on the taxis

889
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:29,440
But I'll still be on the road. That's true, but you'll be at the studio. Yeah, it's all the way from home

890
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,840
It's like home 2.0 home be for you. You know, I'm telling you what home but with better internet home with benefits

891
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:42,840
Podcasting benefits. So join us on Jupiter dot tube for that. See you next week same bad time same bad station

892
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:49,480
and of course links to what we talked about today will be at Linux unplug calm slash four seven eight er and

893
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:54,360
Thank you to our members over to unplugged core comm you are still getting a special version of this show

894
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,520
Unedited extra content even though we weren't live

895
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:03,480
We still made something for our members because we love them and they are investing our ongoing content and last but not least

896
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,840
There is more Linux content out there and it's gonna be a big episode this week

897
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:12,800
So go check out Linux action news Linux action news.com. Don't miss it

898
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:18,760
All right, everyone. Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the unplugged program and we'll see you right back here

899
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:48,560
next Sunday

900
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,760
You
