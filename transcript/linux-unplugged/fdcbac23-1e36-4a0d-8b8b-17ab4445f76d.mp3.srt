1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
I have to apologize to the podcast audience.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,520
There's going to be some rain noise and maybe some thunder, although I think that's past

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,280
about 15 minutes before we went on the air.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,000
I was watching a storm approach and it just got bigger and bigger.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,960
And then about 10 minutes before we went on the air,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,720
I realized it was really impacting my LTE performance.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,960
I sent Wes a message and I'm like, Wes, my LTE coverage is dropping rapidly.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,800
So Wes goes and looks up the weather map for me.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,800
He's like playing meteorologist over there.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,160
You know, when I look at it, I'm like, it's not clearing up anytime soon, is it?

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,080
No. So I decide, all right, I got to get the cell booster up,

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,320
see if I can't get the LTE signal back up to some sort of usable range.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,240
That way we can do the show because I'm remote.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,880
I'm in Wyoming. I have to have good connectivity.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,920
So there I am in probably one of the top 10,

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,840
maybe even top five thunder and lightning storms of my life.

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,440
Like an idiot, I'm climbing up the ladder on the back of my RV.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,600
Do do do with a coax cable hanging to the ground in my mouth.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,040
So that way my hands are free. Do do do climbing up the back of the RV.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,120
I wrap my arm around the ladder.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,840
So one arms around the ladder.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
The other arm is trying to tighten down a coax cable.

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,360
The wind is nuts.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,640
My clothes are getting soaked by this crazy sideways rain.

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,160
I'm up on the roof getting this thing all tight and I climb down.

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,800
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm just totally soaked head to toe.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,800
By now, I feed the wire, the coax cable into the RV in one of the slides.

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,600
I just feed it in there.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,840
I go get it all hooked up, power up the cell booster,

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,400
sit down, get ready to do the show.

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,000
And I notice my cellular performance has not improved at all.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I go look, random air light.

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,240
I'm sitting there dripping water on the floor with a random booster air light.

35
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,640
So I've got no LTE. I got a big storm.

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
But you know what, Wes? The show goes on.

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
It sure does. Can't stop it.

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:02:02,800
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 254 for June 19th, 2018.

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
that's live from a very stormy Casper, Wyoming.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
My name is Chris.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
My name is Wes.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,560
Hello, Mr. Payne.

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,760
It is good to be connected with you over the past few days.

45
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,280
Over the power of a somewhat shaky LTE connection,

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,000
thanks to the thunder and lightning.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,400
But that doesn't prevent us from having a great show.

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,040
We're going to get into some major stories

49
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,400
that are really concerning several large open source projects.

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,840
We'll talk about what's going on with Blender and their situation with YouTube.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,760
And then we'll get into a bunch of community news,

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,600
including some important news for one of the important members.

53
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,560
Important news for an important member of our community, Techstar.

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,920
We have an update on his health situation.

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,200
Deepen has a new release.

56
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,440
We're doing an update to on the Librem 5,

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,800
what they're working on, where they're at,

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,040
some new portable hardware coming, a distro you might not have considered.

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,480
And then I'll give you an update on my adventures

60
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,720
at setting up Linux Academy with OBS running on Kubuntu 1804

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,160
and migrating their live stream from a Mac to GNU slash Linux.

62
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,480
Then we got a little segment on retro games.

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,400
I've just sort of embraced it.

64
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,360
I've decided it's time to be an old man.

65
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,360
I'm going to love the old games.

66
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,440
In a way that only the love games, the old games can love me.

67
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
Give you an update on my Texas trip.

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,720
Plus Linux desktop's usability seems to reach a peak

69
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,800
and then they want to change everything, whoever they might be.

70
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,440
And it all goes out the window for some new design.

71
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,280
And often with that, a loss of usability.

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,280
And a follower of the show has documented this process over and over again,

73
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,280
going back to the original Xerox interface to the latest versions of Gnome 3.

74
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,240
So we'll cover that as well in the show.

75
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,760
Get a good conversation going.

76
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,600
But Wes, before we go any further, you know, we got to bring in that mumble room.

77
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,040
So time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

78
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,120
Hello. Hello.

79
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,480
Good evening. Hello, everybody.

80
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,520
It's super good to be connected with you.

81
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,920
As I was I was driving yesterday for 10 hours and I literally had the thought,

82
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,240
you know, tomorrow I'm going to be sitting down, just hanging out with my buddies.

83
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Like today's kind of a grindy day.

84
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,680
But tomorrow, tomorrow we get to hang out.

85
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,760
So thank you, everybody, for being here. I really appreciate it.

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,720
I've been looking forward to it.

87
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,920
That's what got me through driving nonstop yesterday.

88
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,880
But we'll talk more about that later.

89
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,600
Let's get into some of the news that's going on.

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,320
It's impacting the community and one that's got Blender Project upset.

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,680
The MIT courseware that's open is been been screwed around with.

92
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,720
And it all is kind of building towards my concerns around Article 13.

93
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,080
So that's a lot of stuff I just laid on you.

94
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,480
Let's start with the bigger picture stuff.

95
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,280
YouTube. It's an ongoing issue.

96
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,120
And the centralization of services.

97
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,480
We've been constantly reminded of the limitations that open source

98
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,280
and free software projects run into when they use centralized services

99
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,480
like Slack, like GitHub and like YouTube.

100
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,560
And several popular YouTuber accounts, including the MIT OpenCourseWare account

101
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,480
and the Blender Foundation's accounts have had all of their videos blocked.

102
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,600
Channels just been screwed with completely by YouTube.

103
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,920
And in a little bit of irony, too, the MIT courseware stuff

104
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,640
has been taken down because it contains content from MIT,

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,120
according to the YouTube video. Have you seen this, Wes?

106
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,800
Yeah, it seems. Oh, man, I don't know.

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,200
It's very frustrating.

108
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,080
I'm still trying to catch up on all that's happened because a lot has happened

109
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,560
kind of quickly.

110
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,880
But just the fact that there's so many blocked videos,

111
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,360
that the centralization of this platform is once again so highlighted.

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
I just want to watch local media.

113
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,320
Yeah, I know, right? Yeah.

114
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,360
So the MIT one isn't an isolated incident either.

115
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,200
There's other organizations that have been blocked by their own content.

116
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,160
I once got a copyright flag on my own voice.

117
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,840
You know, when I do the introductions, I do them for Koda Radio.

118
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,040
I go, this is Koda Radio, episode 283.

119
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,120
Yes. Yes.

120
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,120
They flagged my own voice once on YouTube claiming that it was owned by somebody else

121
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,600
because it's just some scripts, right?

122
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,960
They're listening to the audio waveforms, doing matching.

123
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,320
It's kind of it's not as advanced as we like to think it is.

124
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840
And that's how Blender is getting screwed.

125
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,520
No, right. Absolutely not.

126
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
It has so much data to churn through.

127
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,120
And it's really just a simple, somewhat simple fingerprinting procedure.

128
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,680
So there's very much limits.

129
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,640
And unfortunately, we hit them all the time.

130
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,760
And you can thank Facebook for all of this.

131
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,480
I think also, though, the YouTube like Python scripts to do content ID matching.

132
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,080
Didn't it really start with the Viacom lawsuit against YouTube before Google bought them?

133
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,960
Sure. But no other company has promoted more responsibility of the

134
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,560
platform to monitor uploads than Facebook.

135
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,160
And now there are even actual very concrete proposals waiting to be voted on, especially

136
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,080
in the EU side on actually making it Google, for example, responsible for the content

137
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,400
and to require automated tools to exist so that content can be removed within an hour.

138
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,880
Right. So if they like any any corporation, like they already had content ID because it

139
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,160
was for the music association to get out of their ass.

140
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,200
Now they have another incentive to try to make sure the algorithms are acting as fast

141
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,600
as possible. And as a consequence, we're seeing now open source projects to be mostly

142
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,840
affected because those were the ones that usually had more loose policies.

143
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,200
I think it's just a natural consequence of the political environment at the moment.

144
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,480
Yes, I think you've nailed it there.

145
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,280
And Blender is taking matters into their own hands.

146
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,520
They've launched a video Blender dot org, which is peer to it's just a test at this

147
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,080
point. But it's peer to which is a peer to peer video distribution platform.

148
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,600
I tried it doesn't work as well for me.

149
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,840
Blender thinks that this is something to do with the monetization strategies at YouTube

150
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,000
because they've never since 2008 tried to monetize their YouTube channel.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,880
But it keeps getting turned on for them and they keep going and turning it off.

152
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,720
Who knows? But I think what what you say, Dar, is the bigger point here is people are

153
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,960
really upset about if we cauterize all this with with legal ease and we essentially take

154
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,160
the YouTube problem, which I just mentioned, and we apply it to the entire Internet where

155
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,080
you're supposed to for every GitHub documentation submission that has a screenshot.

156
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,120
You need to have somebody review that there.

157
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,880
It gets it just gets completely unscalable.

158
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,880
And several different projects are raising a red flag about Article 13.

159
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,200
And UbiPorts is one of them.

160
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,720
They say, Dear UbiPorts supporters, the freedom to develop software collaboratively

161
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,560
online is at serious risk by an article included on the current proposal for copyright

162
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,400
reform in the European Union.

163
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:46,080
The specific proposal known as Article 13, which just a side note, sounds like something

164
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,640
out of 1984, imposes mandatory upload filters on online platforms that share, quote,

165
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,440
large amounts of user generated content.

166
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,480
Large amounts is not clearly defined. So that's red flag number one.

167
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,280
And it could be as many as 500 pieces of arts, 500 songs, 500 programs, 500 units of any

168
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,680
work that could be legally protected by copyright.

169
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,240
This is extremely concerning, and it's not just UbiPorts is raising this red flag.

170
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:18,280
The Free Software Foundation over on their website says free software is under attack

171
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,880
within the European Union.

172
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,840
The proposed European Copyright Directive poses a great risk for free software and its

173
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,200
development. The Legal Affairs Committee of the European Parliament will be voting June

174
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:38,880
20th and 21st on whether or not to continue to allow us, as in the free software

175
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,880
community, to build software online together.

176
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,840
So one of the situations I say is don't, like for, especially for open source projects

177
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:54,280
listening, don't flunk out of the platforms just yet, because then they will say, see,

178
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,520
you have an alternative.

179
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,240
Use your voice to actually make your argument against the Article 13.

180
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,880
There is a, the EU is actually doing a public consultation and you can, I will provide the

181
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,320
link if you guys want.

182
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,280
Yes, please. I'll drop in the show notes.

183
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,920
That you can participate and basically just answer, say your piece and it's going to

184
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,520
matter. Even if you're not the local business, even if you're not in the EU, it will

185
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,040
matter.

186
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,120
Yeah, I will definitely put that in the show notes.

187
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,720
It's also more than just the 13th Article, the three in Lebanon are also terrible.

188
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,600
Yeah, and I don't understand them as much, but it sounds like it could actually impact

189
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,640
people that are just sharing news articles and whatnot.

190
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,560
What's your understanding?

191
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,720
It doesn't have any correlation to fair use.

192
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,280
So there's, so even if you do something legally in the fair use concept, the European

193
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,000
change, copyright reform would ignore all of that and still say that you're violating

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,440
it. And there's other cases where if someone provides a service that you display that

195
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,920
service or let's say, for example, you take a Twitter, like a tweet from Twitter and you

196
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,760
use the embed thing where you display it directly from the Twitter embed code and then

197
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,920
you load it on your website, you're violating the copyright reform of Article 11 at that

198
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,120
point.

199
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,440
Right. And they're trying to essentially protect the journalists and say, you have to

200
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,120
go to the source to get the information.

201
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,600
So therefore they'll stay alive.

202
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,160
They'll stay in business because everybody forced to go to the source.

203
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,160
What are your thoughts, Dar?

204
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,520
No, no, they explicitly put a tax on it, too.

205
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,880
Actually, it's not just forcing you to go to the source.

206
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,240
They the ancillary link that that's what they call it, essentially.

207
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,040
It says that if you include a snippet, it's not so much the link, but if the link brings

208
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,480
a snippet over, that snippet requires a license before you can actually present it.

209
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,240
So platforms that like Google News would essentially have to pay a tax.

210
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,920
What about my show notes where I link to a story and I include like a preview of the

211
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,960
article in there? Like maybe I even embed like a quote.

212
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,760
If you embed that quote, then again, if this place that you're gathering this information

213
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,440
from is a news outlet, because this is very specific to news outlets, it doesn't go and

214
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,000
say, hey, your blog or something.

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
It goes like into a news agency.

216
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,320
So that is actually the bigger problem, because it's also making distinction between

217
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:21,000
copyright of some individuals versus other individuals, which is actually probably illegal.

218
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,040
But curiously enough, because you're then you're discriminating against citizens,

219
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,640
different types of citizens. But essentially, the end result is still news organizations

220
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,760
would be able to get these licensing benefits.

221
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,040
At least that's what their their intent is.

222
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,200
And when it comes to the other measure that they want to pass through, which is what we

223
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,480
already talked to Article 13, like fair use right now is not standard across the EU, which

224
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,800
is one of the reasons to bring these actually copyright reform overall.

225
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,320
We're losing out in some countries and in some countries, people are actually gaining.

226
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:06,040
So even though it feels very negative, when we look at from technical point of view, it

227
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,680
is easy to see why there's actually still some support for these reform.

228
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Some countries don't even allow you to take a picture of a building.

229
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,800
And also the parliament in the UK don't allow you to use any content that's not

230
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,920
to use any content that's for satire.

231
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,080
Like there's all kinds of different things that are violating fair use, the idea of fair

232
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:37,400
fair use. But there's this that one individual thing is there's so many things wrong

233
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:44,120
with this, this reform that not there's so many things that break the idea of any kind

234
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,560
of fair use in trade that it makes it where most of these services are just trying to

235
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,160
make as much money as possible.

236
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,440
And so they like, for example, the not being able to have to pay a tax or a license to

237
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,280
display content on your website.

238
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:05,920
It's so these news organizations that can't somehow figure out how to stay relevant, they

239
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,160
can force people to if they use their content that they have to go that they have to pay

240
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,640
them to use it or don't use it.

241
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,680
So that is really, I think, devastatingly awful to those of us in the states.

242
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,680
But Dar brings up a good point that outside the states, there are some countries where

243
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,120
aspects of this are an improvement.

244
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,080
So I want to move forward in this conversation, keeping that in mind.

245
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,400
But talking specifically about Article 13, this this seems to be the where it really

246
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,720
goes off the rails because you reports other aspects, Article three and those aspects,

247
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,280
maybe maybe there is some merit to that to that argument.

248
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:43,480
But Article 13 of this whole copyright reform seems really to be where the damning bit that

249
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,600
the Internet's freaking out about is you report says that it's going to totally screw over

250
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,840
Launchpad and GitHub for them and that all user generated content on those platforms

251
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,560
will have to be reviewed at the time of submission and will have to be if it isn't found in

252
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,520
violation or potentially in violation removed instantly.

253
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,040
Yes, that doesn't seem possible.

254
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,400
Like the bigger companies could could maybe you could argue that big companies could sustain

255
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,560
that. But smaller like open source project would be impossible to review any code like

256
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:11,800
that.

257
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,760
I completely agree.

258
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,400
And not only that, if you actually zoom out a little bit and see what a lot of you

259
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,320
countries are attempting to try to do, they like France and Spain, even a couple of a

260
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,800
couple of countries basically did it.

261
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,480
They've set up what they call A.I. incentive programs for companies to open their A.I.

262
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,960
incentives. To be honest, this is no brainer.

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,120
You open an A.I.

264
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,560
center in tax incentive for companies to bring their development to your country.

265
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,320
Then you make it so that it's actually required to use A.I.

266
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,240
services like upload filters.

267
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,880
And there you go.

268
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,720
The economy booms there, not elsewhere.

269
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,560
Yeah, this is no brainer what these countries are actually the countries that are pushing

270
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,520
more for this vision are the countries that did investments to make tax benefits and tax

271
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,200
cuts for setting A.I.

272
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
research centers in their country.

273
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,120
Now, from my very U.S.

274
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,560
centric point of view, admittedly, it feels like the EU keeps screwing up my Internet.

275
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,520
So first of all, can I just say I still am angry about all of those notices about cookies.

276
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,720
I don't care if I care about cookies.

277
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,280
I'm taking care of it via other means.

278
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,080
I am so sick and tired of clearing those messages.

279
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,440
This just this week, I finally started actually clearing them out instead of just leaving

280
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,120
them up in protest, wrecking the website.

281
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,320
And then we have GDPR, which is as a business owner has made my life a little bit more

282
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,000
complicated. And now Article 13 is coming down, which gives me once again the heebie

283
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,160
jeebies. Am I am I wrong here, Wes?

284
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,840
But don't you feel like that we're starting to really run up against the edges of traditional

285
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,640
laws and borders and having them applied to the Internet?

286
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,320
It feels like the only reason why this stuff has any chance of being successful is because

287
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,680
of the size of the EU.

288
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,520
If this was some small, tiny little nation, if North Korea was doing all of this, nobody

289
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
would give any craps.

290
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,560
Hang on.

291
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,680
Hang on just a minute.

292
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,160
Because it feels like it feels like you guys are wrecking my Internet, to be honest with

293
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,040
you. You're wrecking my net.

294
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:18,040
So when the US go round hoovering up people for DMCA, DMCA violations outside their

295
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
borders, that's fine and dandy.

296
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,600
But when we try to implement laws that protect users, that's bad.

297
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,680
Right. No, I mean, you know, yeah, right.

298
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Exactly. Like there is a place for the GDPR data protections and especially just giving

299
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,960
users control over how their data is stored, that kind of things.

300
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If it's stored, I'm kind of actually for that.

301
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Not actually against it. But the cookie stuff really getting old.

302
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,920
It's like, it's like what it feels like is old people that don't know how the Internet

303
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,600
are working or making laws about the Internet that affects everyone.

304
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,680
Right. And that's not to give them control.

305
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,840
It's to show them what people are collecting about them.

306
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,480
And to make this aware is a good step, in my opinion.

307
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,560
Except it doesn't go too far in which way they proved by when they when they within the

308
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,400
first week of the GDPR becoming in effect, there is like thirty five thousand requests

309
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,680
for removal from Google and various search engines from government officials in the EU.

310
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,840
Oh, my God. Thirty five thousand.

311
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,360
Yeah. There was a variety of countries of all levels of their governments.

312
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,520
Like it was it was the most blatant, obvious usage of it was coming down immediately.

313
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,560
It does seem like it's a problem of scale in many ways there, right?

314
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Like where a lot of these laws, there are intent.

315
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,440
And in the like what you were saying to the to the nature of the Internet, but the you

316
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,000
know, the economic and political impacts of the Internet have grown a lot and maybe the

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,880
ways we interact with it haven't.

318
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,720
And so a lot of the intent here maybe makes sense because there are these very large

319
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,320
corporations that do have nation level impact, but it just they are not well crafted enough

320
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,600
to scale down to the individual contributors that make up the parts of the Internet.

321
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
We value a lot.

322
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,560
That's true. Nation scale impact.

323
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,920
That's a good way to put it. I do have an extremely positive side note on all of these

324
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,320
debate. So one of the situations that has been complained about is ability to link and

325
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,440
basically to deal with content online.

326
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:23,000
These changes made it so that it is actually harder to have people like Snowden whistle

327
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,080
blowers. And because of these high criticism generated in parliament about the inability

328
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,640
to have whistle blowers, actually, there is now a whistle blowers protection legislation

329
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,080
coming through because of these debates.

330
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,360
So there has been reticence all over because different countries have different policies

331
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,200
of what it should entitle you to be a whistle blower and making an EU makes it applicable

332
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,960
to the 27 remaining member states.

333
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:02,520
And when you look at that, you actually see a greater point that they are aware of the

334
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,200
limitations being placed.

335
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,720
So now we just have to say that they will not be elected and we'll try our best to put

336
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,440
it down so that they don't pass it because they are aware if they weren't aware, they

337
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,320
wouldn't debate the need of having now better whistleblower protections because it would

338
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,920
be harder to expose things.

339
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,360
Right. Because when you release a piece of information that is private to an organization,

340
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,440
it will be filtered out by an upload filter.

341
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,000
Right. So ultimately, making yourself becoming a whistleblower is kind of impossible then.

342
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
Oh, that is really, really creepy.

343
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,880
Popey, did you want to jump in?

344
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,360
Because I know we kind of just went off on a couple of rabbit holes here.

345
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,040
Did you want to follow up on my whole you guys are recommending it or I've calmed down.

346
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
It's fine.

347
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,840
And just to be clear, I don't think anybody here would be happy to defend the DMCA.

348
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,080
No, no. And I wasn't defending GDPR either.

349
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,760
I'm not. I'm not defending it.

350
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,240
I agree with Chris that it was a law implemented by old people who don't understand the Internet.

351
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,000
Right. I get I get that.

352
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:11,640
But you can't use it as an excuse for why we're all terrible people when other people

353
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,280
around the world do exactly the same kind of thing and they get off scot-free.

354
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah, fair enough. And I got to remember, too, to be nice to old people, because not

355
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,800
only am I quickly becoming one, but I met a ninety three year old listener, I believe

356
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,280
it was at Texas Linux Fest.

357
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
That's incredible. Yeah.

358
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,480
Yeah. So I got to remember to be nice.

359
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,440
But now you can get paid for your data because that's a positive thing with GDPR.

360
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,760
You know, I'll take it.

361
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,520
You know, maybe I could just start selling my you know, that could be a good way to make

362
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
revenue.

363
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,600
And there's actually definitely a couple of new advantages.

364
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,240
So, for example, right now, if you let's say a speed ticket, you can't actually use the

365
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,960
camera footage to prove that you had, for example, an alibi.

366
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,960
But because the data is yours, you actually have a right to that data.

367
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,920
To request it and to have it, and therefore you can use it, for example, to prove that

368
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,640
you are in a different place in case of a false accusation.

369
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,520
This is just an example of what actually GDPR does for you.

370
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,080
It goes even further. Like you're talking about, for example, how your credit score

371
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,640
gets evaluated because GDPR doesn't cover just your data, but data related about you.

372
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,200
Ultimately, you have to make the question of, all right, if you go to your bank and

373
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,960
say, hey, give me all the data that you have on me, they will have to give you all the

374
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,200
data that you have on me. They will have to basically show you how they are using your

375
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
data to evaluate your actual credit score.

376
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,040
And as a consequence, it disambiguates lots of services that are around data.

377
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,680
I think that's a positive thing, because oftentimes algorithms nowadays make decisions

378
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
that affect your life.

379
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,960
You kind of want to know how that happens.

380
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,800
In a way, you could also think about this is this could be like a good thing to as far

381
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,960
as it is stops people from forcing like asking for data they don't need because they're

382
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,520
too afraid to like to just store it.

383
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,000
They don't they don't have it. So they'll disable things like the New York Times or

384
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,480
some other news organizations would disable JavaScript entirely so they didn't have to

385
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
deal with it anymore.

386
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,280
I've really enjoyed the reduction in spam email that's come my way over the last few

387
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,440
weeks. That's been quite nice.

388
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,240
But also, don't forget that the US have just as many ways to screw up the Internet as the

389
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,840
EU do. You've got SOPA.

390
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,280
You've got net neutrality.

391
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,880
You've got SOPA didn't pass.

392
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
PIPA didn't pass.

393
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,720
No, but they could have done.

394
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
That's the point.

395
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,880
Net neutrality was good and it's been removed.

396
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,800
And that's true. That is that is that is going to be a problem.

397
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Yeah, that's a fair point.

398
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,600
Yeah, it's you're right.

399
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,440
The US has their everybody really that has any major influence.

400
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,400
It's what you do when you have the influence.

401
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

402
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,720
So another influence in our community has been Techstar.

403
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,240
He is the guy that made PC Linux OS.

404
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,560
I've been following PC Linux OS since I was a Mandrake user way back in the day.

405
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
It's been a long, long journey.

406
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
And I have some bad news.

407
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,720
I just wanted to make you guys aware of it and maybe you can send well wishes or do

408
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
whatever you do.

409
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,080
It looks like Techstar is facing the end of a battle with cancer.

410
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,920
And he posted on their forum that he doesn't think he's going to be around much longer.

411
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:18,440
And that is super sad to see because Techstar was one of these individuals who was an early

412
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,200
pioneer in creating a really user friendly Linux desktop operating system.

413
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,560
And he's had he's held strong opinions.

414
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
He's been a really unique individual in the community.

415
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,040
And he's somebody Texas, somebody I've followed for a long time.

416
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,400
And when I saw this announcement, I wasn't I know I just wasn't prepared for it.

417
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,640
I was in Texas at the time, too.

418
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,280
So I know. Yes.

419
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,920
Serious is, by the way, she says she says she doesn't understand.

420
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,240
I just want you guys to know that Siri just let me know that she doesn't understand why

421
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,600
Techstar is is losing his battle with cancer.

422
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,480
And I don't like to cover down or stories like this, but it is.

423
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,760
And it's something I think people need to be made aware of.

424
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,080
And we can get into a bus factor and small distribution debates in the future.

425
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:05,360
But for now, the show's best wishes to Techstar, his family and the PC Linux OS community.

426
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,640
I'll have a link in the show notes.

427
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,440
If you guys want to see that, or if maybe you want to go in and jump in if you've been

428
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,120
a member of the community and leave your comments.

429
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,640
I think there's probably not much to add, but our thoughts are with them.

430
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,840
And it's super sad.

431
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,720
And, man, cancer sucks.

432
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,280
Cancer just like talk about something that has taken some great people.

433
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,760
Absolutely.

434
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,800
Yeah, so that'll be links in the show notes.

435
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,800
If you guys want to read his words and maybe leave a message in the form.

436
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,560
Let's talk about Deepin for a moment, something that we don't get a chance to talk about very

437
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,120
much on the show.

438
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,880
Deepin 15.6 was released.

439
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,400
It's got a new app launcher.

440
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,400
And if you don't remember, one of the things that is sort of unique about Deepin is their

441
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,880
own custom desktop and well, quote unquote, custom, their own unique desktop environment

442
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,360
with a new efficient launcher that's all based on Qt.

443
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,560
It's a little more modeled off of Windows 7, I would say, the launcher.

444
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,560
If I were to give it a description, if it's like a start menu, you click it, you get your

445
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,160
most favorite apps on there.

446
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,560
Left side, then you get computer, document, videos, music, pictures, downloads and the

447
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,080
clock on the right side.

448
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,320
It's a more traditional style launcher and it's a nice update.

449
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,760
There's a new welcome app as well, sort of reminiscent of Monte welcome.

450
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Does anybody in the in the Mumble room that knows better than I remember what distribution

451
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,080
deepens based off of or or what the desktop environment is based off?

452
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,560
Yes, Debbie and they used to be a bunch of them.

453
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,440
They're Debbie and and they're their devs environment is their own.

454
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,240
The deep and desktop environment. What are our thoughts on this?

455
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,120
Um, doesn't seem like it gets much attention because I think it's the largest audience

456
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,800
is outside the US, but they say their claim is sort of expect the simplicity of Gnome

457
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:47,280
Shell and maybe Budgie and but Qt, you know, like Qt underneath that does sound appealing

458
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,720
to, but I think a lot of what you've talked about previously on the show.

459
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,440
I am downloading it now because it seems like they have caught on to the concept of

460
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,000
it seems like they have caught on to the zeitgeist.

461
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,280
I can't speak to it because I haven't really tried this release, but I will.

462
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,960
They're very friendly every time you talk with the devs and they generally fix the stuff

463
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,760
you complain about.

464
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,040
I had that experience, but also weirdly enough, every time I go to IRC to talk with them,

465
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,000
I get a huge influx, an increase of influx of spam from China.

466
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,920
That may be just a coincidence.

467
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:26,000
Um, the also the other thing is I guess maybe why people are reluctant to actually use it

468
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,880
as a daily driver, even though there's, you know, technically it's being open source

469
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,400
and we can check it is that the power that Chinese government has on Chinese companies

470
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,200
or whatever organization runs on China.

471
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,600
That generally I think would be their biggest bottleneck, right?

472
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,280
The elephant in the room always.

473
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,080
They did announce that they did have contracts with in some ways with the government.

474
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,200
That makes it even worse.

475
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,240
Like I guess it will work well for their market because all right, people already are using

476
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,520
the system, right?

477
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,720
And are already bound to the same legislation.

478
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,080
So I guess it makes sense.

479
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,960
Like if you're using it's like we understand, you know, Google is going to be a friend of

480
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,880
NSA and so Microsoft, we understand that and we're generally okay because we have that

481
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,840
same regulatory environment in every other company that operates in our territory.

482
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,040
So for them might be okay, but for us it feels like, okay, this is a party we don't really

483
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,080
go with.

484
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,800
Good points.

485
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,280
Good points.

486
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,240
Dar, you're on fire today.

487
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,560
I wasn't going to say it for some reason, but I agree that is that was the elephant

488
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,040
in the room.

489
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,000
I don't know why I just felt like it was inappropriate to bring it up.

490
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,080
So I'm glad that you said something.

491
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,040
What do you think, Michael?

492
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,960
It is interesting and it definitely has to be said because it's just it just is what

493
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,480
it is, but there's no there's no evidence that there's they're doing anything wrong

494
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,320
as far as tracking information or anything.

495
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,800
There's been multiple attempts to show like to test to see if there's any like spyware

496
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,520
or anything.

497
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,320
And while there are some things that are somewhat sketchy, none of it's technically any kind

498
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,040
of spyware.

499
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,200
So as far as me, the reason why I don't use it is because it doesn't have plasma.

500
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,320
And that was an easy choice.

501
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,080
Boom, right there.

502
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,000
And funny enough, we probably have higher scrutiny for Deepin because just sort of where

503
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,840
they are based and we actually check more than stuff done in our own region.

504
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,720
But, you know, people are biased and isn't that funny?

505
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,360
You're so right.

506
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,000
You're so right.

507
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,160
We should be we should be much more critical of stuff coming out of the US really than

508
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,040
we are.

509
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,640
So all fair points around.

510
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,560
I want to talk to Wimpy in a moment about his his new NUC.

511
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:33,600
But before we go there, how about just a super brief update on the progress of the Librem

512
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,080
five?

513
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,760
It's something we've been tracking fairly steadily on Linux Action News, but we've kind

514
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,480
of had a few smaller developments that don't quite rank moving up to Linux Action News.

515
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,400
So I thought I'd just bust them out here for you.

516
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:52,320
First of all, in case you didn't know or forgot, it is a Wayland stack on the Librem five and

517
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,840
they're continuing to work on that.

518
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,120
They've been testing the vibrators in that thing, chargers and the usability improvements

519
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,400
to their posh phone shell.

520
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,760
Posh is the name and they say it's running on top of Wayland now.

521
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,840
They've had some lock screen improvements, arrow widgets were added to the library for

522
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,560
swiping, et cetera, so you can get a little overlay.

523
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,800
They're continuing to work on their back end GTK three calling application that their

524
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,720
dialer application that they call calls.

525
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,080
Clever.

526
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,240
And on the hardware front, they continue evaluating components like the Wi-Fi module.

527
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,680
Still an evaluation right now.

528
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,520
Vibration motors and battery charges.

529
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,200
You got to test some of that stuff, make sure it's the right stuff, especially battery

530
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,320
chargers, I would imagine.

531
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,920
And they're also exploring camera options still for the Librem five.

532
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,840
And I think like all of the previous outreaches, it's really top notch.

533
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,040
Purism has a great blog where they're really keeping everybody up to date and all this

534
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,440
kind of stuff.

535
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,000
They're working hard, I would imagine.

536
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,160
Having been inside companies, they're trying to expose the great work that's happening

537
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,960
to the blog.

538
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,320
It can be a long process and I really commend them for doing that because I love watching

539
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,600
how they're building this thing.

540
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,120
Looking at the prototype stuff that they're doing and the fact that you can get a prototype

541
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,000
sent to you and stuff like that, it's just so cool that there's people now doing videos

542
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,760
of them testing stuff, showing the plasma mobile working on the prototype builds and

543
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,320
stuff like that.

544
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,760
It's very cool to see.

545
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,280
I was under the impression that the plasma mobile folks hadn't got Librem five test

546
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,840
hardware yet.

547
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,720
Although they don't have it.

548
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,880
The Librem Purism is doing it.

549
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,400
The plasma mobile people are getting prototypes.

550
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,160
But the fact that they're showing that plasma mobile is working on their current prototypes

551
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,720
that Purism themselves are doing it to show that it is functional.

552
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,760
That's very cool.

553
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,320
Yeah.

554
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,320
So I think a couple other folks are still waiting to get their test hardware yet.

555
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,880
But maybe they're not there yet.

556
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,760
And it also sounds like Michael Larabell over at Ferronix has noted that they're using

557
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,600
a secondary processor.

558
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,440
So one processor is not good enough, Wes.

559
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,680
They're going to have two processors and it really comes down to the binary blobs.

560
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,640
Did you catch this?

561
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:56,880
Yeah.

562
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,360
It's interesting.

563
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,440
Well, Chris, your freedom is important, right?

564
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,840
And if that's kind of the whole point of what you're trying to do, it's interesting to see

565
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,800
them taking this rather maybe serious approach and just not have to deal with that.

566
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,400
Not have to embed them on that first processor.

567
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,320
Have a secondary unit that they can talk to you and try to get that information with.

568
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,520
And still, quote unquote, respecting your freedom.

569
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,440
Yeah.

570
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,720
That's a neat trick.

571
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,280
So you get the Free Software Foundation's AOK because it's a secondary processor.

572
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,640
So they need a binary blob for this phone to do the DDR4 memory training.

573
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,520
Of course you do.

574
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,640
That's just we're still there.

575
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,000
We're still in that world.

576
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,120
Oh, wow, though.

577
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:42,000
Like that's what we're up against is binary blobs that train the DDR4 RAM how to behave

578
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,560
timing wise on boot every single boot.

579
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,320
Like that's the level that we are trying to get down to here.

580
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,920
OK, talk me out of this because right now I'm feeling like this is like an impossible

581
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,480
never ending war that we are going to be constantly behind, never able to catch up on.

582
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,600
So talk me out of this, Dar.

583
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,640
No, I'm not going to talk you out of it.

584
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,080
I'm going to make it worse.

585
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,960
I'm going to make it worse.

586
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,560
There is just in U.S., for example, there is a law Communications Assistance for Law

587
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,200
Enforcement Act or CALEA for short.

588
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,520
This legislation actually has been used and there's money that government even gives

589
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,320
to companies to make sure that their hardware and software is updated to allow actually

590
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,000
into lawful interception.

591
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,720
So I am curious to see how they're going to do because one of the reasons modems in

592
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,120
phones have direct access is not only for performance when it comes down to, you know,

593
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,080
reaching out to your microphone and your speaker.

594
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,240
And they also have a real time capability.

595
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,680
They connect to the tower.

596
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,920
They have generally overriding capabilities on top of their actual phone OS.

597
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,080
That's also because it helps with complying with CALEA law when you want to sell in the

598
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,120
United States market.

599
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,440
I actually am curious to see how they're going to do this.

600
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,720
Also, on top of this, if you have a VoIP service or even if you just make, let's say, an IP

601
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,840
based only phone, right?

602
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,440
You just you use data.

603
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,080
Well, CALEA law also says that if you are doing VoIP services, you're then classified

604
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,480
as a carrier, the VoIP provider, and therefore you have to support CALEA as well.

605
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,200
There's that part that is interesting too.

606
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,080
So what about this idea of breaking it out into a secondary co-processor or second processor

607
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,000
that you could almost change out per region or situation?

608
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,120
Like, is that a good idea?

609
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,960
That could, I could see that actually working, but it seems like it would add complexity.

610
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,080
It's an excellent idea.

611
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,120
It adds complexity.

612
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,280
Of course, it will drain your battery slightly more.

613
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,920
Hopefully Linux, you know, in Plasma will just be more battery efficient.

614
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,880
We hope for that.

615
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:44,000
And, you know, at least we're trying, which has been usually the biggest bottleneck is

616
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,240
nobody actually tries because the know-how is, the requirement is just too big, right?

617
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,520
To do it as a single man.

618
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,560
And now there's a team working on it.

619
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,880
Maybe we'll start to find, but I am skeptical.

620
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,680
And I think that in the end of the day, the fight will still end up in the same place.

621
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,640
It's going to be a fight to live in the same place.

622
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,800
It's going to be a fight to legislative reform and not necessarily on the technical means

623
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,200
because the law is there and you have to comply with it, especially because you're selling

624
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,000
a product.

625
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,920
So now my last bit is a bit of a miss for the Purism folks is it looks like potentially

626
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,400
they may have an issue with their iMX8 ARM processor that's going to be in the Librem5.

627
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,520
It just missed the 4.18 kernel window and that's a bit of an issue for them because

628
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,760
the next window for 4.19 will be the last release of 2018.

629
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,880
And so if this iMX8 ARM processor bits, especially the bits around the system on the chip, because

630
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,200
part of it is already actually in the kernel, like the SATA support and some DRM bits are

631
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,440
already upstream in the Linux kernel.

632
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,400
So close.

633
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,280
Yeah, I know.

634
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,640
It's just the rest of the bits of the system on the chip, like the drivers and all that

635
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,960
kind of stuff that haven't made it in the kernel yet.

636
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,520
And if they don't get squared away by 4.19, then there's really not going to be a kernel

637
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,440
for the Librem5 that has upstreamed all of the driver support.

638
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:15,760
Right.

639
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,480
They can build it in the meanwhile, deal with the situation of the SATA back and be then

640
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,520
the ones providing a kernel that supports the things that they need until they sync

641
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,840
back up and then you're just getting normal releases.

642
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,680
I don't see that as a huge issue.

643
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,120
It's manageable, probably.

644
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,520
I feel like that phrase is said a lot and, you know, it's manageable, probably.

645
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,200
Sometimes that works out, sometimes not.

646
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,000
We will see that.

647
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,200
But yes, it probably is right.

648
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,960
Like if they can just build it with those almost upstream sources and manage their transition,

649
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,960
if they already have a resilient sort of, you know, updating system in place where they

650
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,200
can fall back if it fails, then there's less risk.

651
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,080
If they don't, aren't smart about that, then maybe it's riskier.

652
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,000
It's a phone, it better update well.

653
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,840
It better update well, right?

654
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,160
Yeah, exactly.

655
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,400
It's a phone, it better update well, right?

656
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,800
So it's a good thing, actually.

657
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,200
Let them try it before you buy it.

658
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,600
It's certainly interesting work that Purism are doing with the Librem 5.

659
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,600
You know, there's a lot of technical challenges here and there's a lot of innovation that

660
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,080
needs to happen in order to create a device like this.

661
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,400
But I think the people that are following this project and particularly those people

662
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,960
that are backing the project probably need to reset their expectations as to when they

663
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,360
need to reset their expectations as to when this phone is going to ship as an actual device.

664
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:38,560
Because I've backed a number of mobile phone type crowdfunding devices in the last 18 months

665
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,060
or so.

666
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,200
And at the moment, they're posting lots of interesting information about the hardware

667
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,320
enablement that they're doing, and the applications that they're writing and their display stack

668
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,280
and all the rest of it.

669
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,960
Their goal is to launch in January, February next year.

670
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,160
On the crowdfunders for similar mobile devices, six months from delivery dates, they were

671
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:10,240
making prototype devices and manufacturing runs to test the manufacturing processes to

672
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,840
square away quality assurance, you know, niggles and what have you so that they could start

673
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,160
to plan for production runs.

674
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,240
And on both these crowdfunders I'm referring to, one was the Jelly Pro phone and the other

675
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:29,680
was the Gemini PDA, even though they were doing this four and six months before their

676
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:36,480
release deadlines for the devices, both missed their release targets by four and seven months,

677
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,680
even though they were, you know, that far along in their, you know, production planning,

678
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
actually making the devices.

679
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,680
So for all of the interesting things that are going in in the software, whilst the wireless

680
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,480
chipset is not agreed and whilst the camera module is not agreed, that means that the

681
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,080
casing dimensions and what have you is also not agreed yet.

682
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,800
So they can't be in a place where they're producing casing samples and starting production

683
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,600
runs.

684
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:07,440
So I think, you know, these devices are going to ship into the back end of 2019.

685
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Hmm, not January?

686
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,000
It will be a Herculean effort if Purism pull it off and they deserve, you know, a round

687
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,400
of applause and all the champagne corks popping in celebration if they do it.

688
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,440
But I can't see how they're going to be able to do that because from what I understand,

689
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:35,200
they don't have engineering samples of the devices and they don't even have dev boards,

690
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,640
you know, available to all of the people that are working on this stuff yet.

691
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,240
So, you know, hardware enablement needs to happen in various projects and those developers

692
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,720
will need devices in order to do that.

693
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,480
So it's a very interesting project and it's great to see all of the updates.

694
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,880
But, you know, in terms of actually producing a device, a phone that you can hold and use,

695
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,680
I think there's some considerable way out yet.

696
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,000
Yeah, I can't really argue with you on that.

697
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,840
That all kind of adds up.

698
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,960
So let's talk about your NUC for a moment because I have been thinking about making

699
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,080
this RV studio setup permanent.

700
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,120
The part that is not permanent right now is I'm just using my XPS laptop, which is not

701
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,720
quite the right machine for the job.

702
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,320
And I also would like to have that machine available while I'm doing the show for like

703
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,600
browsing the web and whatnot.

704
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,080
And I've been thinking about installing a NUC in a cupboard.

705
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:32,480
So above where I'm sitting, I have a cabinet and in that cabinet, I have a DBX 286.

706
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:39,520
I have a PreSonos sound interface and then I have a USB-C hub where I have all of that

707
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,760
stuff connected in and then one USB-C cord down to my XPS.

708
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,840
And I can get all of that with one cord and it's fantastic.

709
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,400
I love it.

710
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,520
Beautiful.

711
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,240
It's great.

712
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,240
I could make it a little bit better, though, if the machine was permanent.

713
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,400
If it wasn't my personal laptop that I just play around with and I use to play video games,

714
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,760
even though it's not got a great video card.

715
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,320
A podcasting station right there in the RV.

716
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,720
Wes, you might call it a podcasting workstation.

717
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,040
Oh, I like it.

718
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,600
So the NUC was really what came to mind because I could just slot it right on top of all this

719
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,960
equipment in the cupboard and it has USB-C on it.

720
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,800
But the last time I talked to Wimpy about it, he said,

721
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,160
there's some stuff missing from the kernel so it doesn't work so good.

722
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,920
He didn't quite say it in that high pitched voice.

723
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,360
But I don't know, a little birdie tells me that perhaps Wimpy has reached some level of success

724
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,840
and now I can't help myself.

725
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,200
I'm beginning to dream, Wimpy.

726
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,400
How are things going with your Linux experiment on the new, what is it, the Hades Canyon NUC?

727
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,600
Yeah, it's the Hades Canyon.

728
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,880
I have a fully hardware accelerated Hades Canyon NUC now.

729
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,240
So I thought the big problem was that the video drivers weren't in the kernel yet from Intel,

730
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,320
like they hadn't actually submitted them upstream or they hadn't.

731
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:56,400
No, so well, it's actually from AMD because this is a Vega M GPU.

732
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,840
So it's actually the work of AMD.

733
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,960
So what's happened in the last week is this.

734
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:11,600
Linux kernel 4.18 release candidate one has been released and the necessary kernel drivers

735
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,520
exist in the 4.18 kernel.

736
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,640
So you need the 4.18 kernel.

737
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:27,040
You need the microcode for the RX Vega M GPU, which is not in the upstream Linux firmware

738
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,200
Git repository yet, but it is available from AMD's staging Git repository.

739
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:40,560
And the other thing you need is Mesa 18.1.1 or newer.

740
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,600
Are you writing this down, Chris?

741
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,840
The weekend, an interesting thing happened.

742
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,680
So you can install Ubuntu 18.04, any of the flavors will do.

743
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:56,320
And the Ubuntu mainline kernel PPA now has 4.18 RC1 in it.

744
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:02,960
So you can go and grab that kernel and Timo Altonen, who's the maintainer for the graphics

745
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:10,960
stack in Ubuntu, he's been updating Mesa in 18.04, but has also started to prep what will

746
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,920
be the new enablement stack and Mesa 18.1.1 is in the X updates PPA.

747
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,440
So just by turning on a couple of PPAs and installing a different kernel and updating,

748
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,080
you know, just doing an update to pull in those Mesa updates and then adding the microcode

749
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:36,480
into lib firmware, lib firmware AMD GPU, I now have the whole thing going, which is great.

750
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,920
And it's performing quite well.

751
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:45,600
Now, the thing is, is that for this to really fly, it needs Mesa 18.2, which is currently

752
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:51,600
in development. So if you and what I haven't done yet is test this configuration with Mesa

753
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:58,080
18.2. So that's a project for this weekend. And I expect some modest performance games

754
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,800
by doing that. But right now, as a workstation, all the bits and bobs are now working.

755
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,200
And work casting pod station is what FreqLab calls it in the IRC. And I think that's not

756
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:07,680
bad.

757
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,720
Just a pod station.

758
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,840
It's a pod station. It sounds like it's a bit of work, but not insurmountable.

759
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,080
It's really, really quite straightforward. Yeah. Once you know, once you know what needs

760
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,480
doing, doing it is really quite straightforward.

761
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,200
Yeah. So how likely would any of this be to land and say like a hardware enablement of

762
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,240
1804?

763
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:36,400
So by Ubuntu 1804.2, all of the necessary bits and pieces should be landed in order

764
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,440
for this to function.

765
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,080
Oh, I mean, you know, I mean, that sounds really nice.

766
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:49,440
Yeah. But what I'm talking to some people about at work is also so 18.2 will be out

767
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,240
just after 18.10. So the other thing we're talking about is trying to make sure that

768
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:01,760
everything we need is landed in 18.10. Because it turns out resellers of these NUCs have

769
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,640
approached Ubuntu and asked about, you know, getting the enablement going for these devices

770
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,880
because it turns out lots of Linux users have been buying them.

771
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,040
Yeah. Good. Good. Voting with the wallet does actually work, it sounds like.

772
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,080
Yeah. And the other thing to add, I think I may have mentioned this before, but the

773
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,600
LVFS project with all of the firmware updating and what have you, this device, all of its

774
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:30,080
bits and bobs are supported in LVFS. So I was able to do the firmware and BIOS upgrades

775
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,680
all through FWUPD.

776
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,880
Oh, that's fantastic.

777
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,720
Just pretty, pretty nice. Yeah.

778
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,680
That's like a, that is a sleek system now.

779
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:45,600
That is. Oh, okay. So I think that will be the pod station, but I may be just lazy enough

780
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:53,680
to wait till 18.02 just simply because, 18.04.2, because after this road trip, and I'm not

781
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,800
going to get the NUC on this road trip, I'm back in studio for a while. So I won't really

782
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,800
need it. So I don't think, I don't know. I don't think, although I say that and then

783
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,440
something comes up and I'm back on the road.

784
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,440
It's just going to happen.

785
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,240
Are you making me want to do it? And the eGPU stuff's all working too Wimpy? The device

786
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,760
is your main driver at this point?

787
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,680
So literally this, this has been, I've got this working within the last 36 hours. So

788
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:21,560
it's on the desk behind me and I need to like move over all of my data and configurations

789
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,960
and what have you know, I haven't done any of that yet. I've been running benchmarks

790
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,640
and things on it and playing games on it and what have you, but I've not set it up for

791
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:35,000
real work yet, but it will be over the course of this weekend, it will be transitioning

792
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,120
to my dedicated workstation. And whilst it does work with external GPUs because it has

793
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:49,120
two Thunderbolt 3 enabled USB-C sockets on it. So you can really go to town with your

794
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:56,800
Thunderbolt on this device. I want to run it with just the integrated GPU, which in

795
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:06,240
terms of performance right now with Mesa 18.1.1 is operating around the performance of like

796
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:16,800
a GTX 1050, something like that. So it's good enough that for 1080p gaming with, you know,

797
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,480
medium to high settings, it's absolutely fine. As soon as you start cranking things

798
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,880
up to, you know, 1440p and you really sort of turn on all of the features, then it starts

799
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,760
to run about, you know, 30 frames a second for the games. But if you go at 1080p, it's

800
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,760
more than capable.

801
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,640
Yeah, fair enough. Yeah. And I, you know, for what I'd be using it for, that would be

802
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,200
totally great. Well, that's a good update. I'm glad to hear all that.

803
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,760
If you've got any GPU, then you just plug in another device. And on that front, I've

804
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,600
also got a Razer Core X now as well.

805
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,400
Oh, what? And how do you like this? And no, so the Razer Core X, isn't that, that's like

806
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,240
the, it was released what, three months ago or something? It's like a fairly new external

807
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,240
GPU unit.

808
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,160
No, the Razer Core X was released a couple of weeks ago. So some time ago. Oh, yeah,

809
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,360
this is brand new. So some time ago I got the Razer Core and then I got the revised

810
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:17,560
model which was the Razer Core V2. And now I have the Razer Core X. So this is, these

811
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:24,480
are eGPU enclosures. The difference between the Razer Core X and the earlier models is

812
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,800
it's a much bigger device. So it can take triple width cards. So if you've got a graphics

813
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,880
card with one of these super spanky cooling solutions on it, you know, that makes it super

814
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:41,760
fat, then it can accommodate those. It's got a higher rated power supply. So it can take

815
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:49,440
the RX Vega 64, for example, which the other models can't quite cope with. And this one's

816
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,880
cheaper. This is half the price of the other. So this is $250 instead of $500. And those

817
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:02,040
cost savings come from the fact that it doesn't have any RGB and it doesn't expose any additional

818
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:09,320
USB ports or ethernet ports on the, on the back of the device, like the, the Razer Core

819
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,320
V1 and V2.

820
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,560
Ah, it's not quite like a hub.

821
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:17,640
No, it's not like a hub. It is just an enclosure for a PCI card basically.

822
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,680
Yeah, but I do like that additional power.

823
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:26,360
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I've put my RX Vega 56 in that now and I'll be selling the Razer

824
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:35,000
Core V1 so I should keep the V2 and keep the X. I'm all about the eGPUs. I'm an eGPU hipster.

825
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,480
Yeah, you are. Well, I want to talk a little bit about games here in a moment. In fact,

826
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,560
one that you were playing on your live stream in a bit. So actually, let's pick that thread

827
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,500
back up. But let's, let's take a moment and mention a quick app pick and then we'll do

828
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:54,040
our sponsor block. I first want to mention, though, this is one that came in from James

829
00:49:54,040 --> 00:50:01,600
via the contact form at linuxunplug.com slash contact. And it is a early days, self-hosted

830
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:08,520
Google Photos clone. Frickin' finally. That's all I have to say about that. It's self-hosted.

831
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:13,480
It is a front and a back end. Django back end and a React front end. It's in heavy development

832
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,040
right now. Some features are currently implemented. You can label faces, you know, so that way

833
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,200
you can find all your Westpain pictures.

834
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,260
That's right. You want those.

835
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:26,420
You do, of course. I've got a Westpain search. Westpain all the time. All the time. It's

836
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,760
Docker ready too, Wes. So this is, I think, actually you might have found this. I don't

837
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,240
think I found this. I think you... No, no, it was sent in by James. I just said that.

838
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,200
I don't know if you had a chance to look at it, Wes, but it looks like it could be the

839
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,200
beginning.

840
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,160
Actually, yes, I'm playing with the demo right now. It's not bad. I mean, for the basic browsing

841
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,160
around, looking around, it seemed just fine. There's several galleries on the demo site

842
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,120
of seemingly random faces grouped together, so I don't know what that says about the actual

843
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:57,120
application performance. But otherwise, it was a fine UI. It seemed to work well.

844
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,920
Yes, you can check it out. If you go to the link we'll have in the show notes, linuxownplug.com

845
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,640
slash 254, and the login is demo. Demo and then demo1234. And the guy says right here

846
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,880
in the Jithub, as Noah calls it, that it's early days. But it's called OwnPhotos. No

847
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:22,280
relation to OwnCloud or like OwnNotes or anything. It's just a name. It's a semi-name

848
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,600
collision. That happens all the time. And it's got back end. It's got like a back end

849
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32,600
and a front end. So the theory could be that if this were to take off, one day you could

850
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,480
have like, say, Shotwell that is using the back end of this thing and Shotwell is a front

851
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:43,240
end or something. So it could have some potential. Could have some potential. And probably with

852
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,560
a little bit of help from the open source community, it might get there. So we'll have

853
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,680
a link to that in the show notes. Otherwise, like Noah says, it's up on the Jithub.

854
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:55,840
Now let's talk about our sponsors this week. We're doing this new in the show and I'm actually

855
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:01,280
sort of actively soliciting feedback on it. We're trying to block all the sponsors together.

856
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,020
It's what's sort of become the new standard in the podcast industry. If you subscribe

857
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:09,960
to more newer podcasts, you'll notice that about this percentage into the show, it's

858
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,120
kind of like percentage based on the content. They have a real formula for it. It's pretty

859
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:19,320
adorable. And they put the ads here. They put them right here and they say, we'll put

860
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:23,880
them all back to back and you listen to this bit and then it doesn't interrupt the flow

861
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,860
of the content earlier or later in the show. I like the idea and I want to see what you

862
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:32,800
guys think because it also gives me an opportunity to sort of collect all of the cool things

863
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,940
that our sponsors are doing and link them all up in one spot and collate all of that

864
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,520
and kind of get the word out there about the things that our different sponsors are actively

865
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,020
doing because you may have heard of them before. You may know that Linux Academy sponsors us

866
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:49,000
or that Digital Ocean or Ting sponsored the show. You may know that by now. But you might

867
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,560
not know the new stuff that they're doing. So that's the other thing I kind of like about

868
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,780
this opportunity. So I am actively looking for your feedback. Tweet me at Chris Ellis

869
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,960
or send it into the contact page at Linux Unplugged dot com slash content. So let's

870
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,980
start with Linux Academy because that's why I am on the road. I'm on my way back from

871
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,280
Linux Academy. I'll tell you about that here in just a couple of minutes. Wrapped up their

872
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,400
OBS system, got it all built for them. And while I was there, I started to get the inside

873
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:18,180
scoop. People are working just like heads down like maniacs on this new content launch

874
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:23,440
they're doing in July. Now in April, I told you about 70 plus new challenges and courseware

875
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,840
and updates and all the stuff that they'd rolled out. And I was like, that's their biggest

876
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:32,120
content push ever. Well, in July, they're basically bringing Christmas to July with

877
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:38,080
150 new courses, challenges and learning activities. They're going to be launching in July. And

878
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:43,320
this reason I was down there was for their ability to live stream and sort of try to

879
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:49,800
message what is in all of this update. Because when you get to 150, it starts to get lost

880
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,020
a little bit in the details. And so that's one of the reasons they want to start doing

881
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:57,240
more live streams. So they can kind of break it down, do giveaways, tell people about what's

882
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:02,720
in there, that kind of stuff. But this isn't official yet. But I got the scuttlebutt. Like

883
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,900
I was talking to some of the course authors. I got an idea of what's coming down the pipe.

884
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,940
So if you're a Linux Academy subscriber already, if you went to Linux Academy dot com slash

885
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,680
unplugged, you're going to get all of this stuff. Or if you want to go subscribe, you

886
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:19,760
can get it soon. And this is just one or two of many things. But it looks like they're

887
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:26,800
going to be slipping in in this 150 plus bundle. Saltstack certification training, Red Hat's

888
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:33,340
certification for expertise and virtualization, also Red Hat's expertise cert and ansible,

889
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:37,200
and a Red Hat certified architect full support, which is a big one, I guess, in the industry.

890
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,080
The Red Hat certified architect full support. Also a couple other ones that sounded kind

891
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,520
of interesting. A Lambda deep dive. They're going to have a course where they're going

892
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:50,960
to be slipping in that 150 bundle. And an AWS security specialty certification. In fact,

893
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,960
I didn't really get the details on this, but it looked like they're going to be doing a

894
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,640
lot of stuff with security. Like that's going to be a big area Linux Academy is going to

895
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,640
go into.

896
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,640
Please.

897
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,920
And it looks like, yeah. And I think they're even doing hiring around that, too, to try

898
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,160
to staff up. That's going to be awesome. So if you're not familiar with Linux Academy,

899
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,800
you can subscribe for seven days for free when you go to Linux Academy dot com slash

900
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,880
unplugged and try out their hands-on labs, their courseware, their schedule planner,

901
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,040
hang out in the community that's stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members. They've got

902
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:24,360
courseware on AWS, Azure, and anything around Linux. Or if it runs Linux or Linux runs on

903
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,760
top of that. And if you're ready to sort of like upgrade your skills on OpenStack or if

904
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,600
you ever need help, they have instructors that are there to help you. It's a great service.

905
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:37,400
And they're launching Christmas in July with 150 new ways to train and learn, as well as

906
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,280
some Azure courseware that's going to be in there, although I didn't get the details on

907
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,360
what, because the Azure courseware is like, it's hard for my brain to remember, because

908
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:49,640
it's like, it's like Azure 70-535. And I'm like, what does that even mean? Whereas with

909
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:54,940
like Red Hat, it's Red Hat certification of expertise and virtualization. I kind of get

910
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,800
what that means. So that I grok. But they're just doing it's a whole bunch of stuff. And

911
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,760
they have some blog posts that are teasing some of it out. So you can check that out.

912
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,680
So thanks to Linux Academy. And thanks to everybody who goes to linuxacademy.com slash

913
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,440
unplugged to sign up, support the show, and get a free seven day trial. And speaking of

914
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,920
good deals, a big thank you to Ting for supporting the Unplugged program for a long, long time

915
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,180
now. The storm has cleared. I don't know if you can hear it, but the storm has cleared

916
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:26,700
in the background. And my Ting connection is strong. Ting is smarter than unlimited.

917
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:33,360
If you use less, you pay less. The average Ting bill is just $23 per month. It's $6 for

918
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,360
your phone, $6 for the line. And then it's just your minutes, your messages, and your

919
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,900
megabytes on top of that. Nationwide coverage, you can rest assured that Ting's got your

920
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,040
coverage from coast to coast. They got coverage. And they got CDMA and GSM. So you can pick

921
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,960
whatever works better in your area. Today, I'm on CDMA. I think last time we did the

922
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:54,680
show, I might have been on GSM. I can't remember, because I just have both now. It's $6 a month

923
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,000
for the line. That's a pretty easy expense to cover. And I use it like a couple of times

924
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,440
a year. I love that, because Ting has a control panel where I can go in and I could actually

925
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,820
turn the service off if I wanted to. I could transfer it. When Rekai decided to go do Twitch

926
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:12,360
full-time, we transferred his line out of my Ting account to him. So he could just keep

927
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:18,700
that phone number, keep that phone, all that stuff. It's really nice. And in that particular

928
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:24,060
case too, their customer service was fantastic, because they need my permission to do a thing.

929
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,200
And then he's got to call up and activate a thing and give payment info. And they were

930
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,300
totally cool about just sort of coordinating all of that. And it's just a super nice aspect

931
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:35,360
of Ting that doesn't get enough attention. But on top of paying for what you use and

932
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,640
that control panel, they have a great set of devices that you can go grab. Or because

933
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,680
they support CDMA or GSM, you can bring your own. Just check their BYOD page. And for a

934
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,200
little bit, I want to tell you about their giveaway. They're doing something new here.

935
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:55,480
It's the hashtag Ting Summer. Hashtag pound sign. Pound sign. Ting Summer. And if you

936
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,600
do that, when you like to submit a photo to Twitter or Instagram, and it's a good, you

937
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,800
know, it probably doesn't have to be that good. Let's be honest. They're going to be

938
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,360
nice. They're Ting after all. But try to take a good one. And then do a hashtag on their

939
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:11,640
Ting Summer on the Facebook, on the Twitter, on the Instagram. And you will get entered

940
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:18,160
for a bi-weekly giveaway of the Moto Z2 Play. They're also going to give away the True Zoom

941
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:26,520
Moto Mod snap-on that gives it like an actual DSLR lens on the Moto. If you ever see a picture

942
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:32,280
of this thing, Wes, it's like a full-fledged lens on the back of a camera, or on the back

943
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:38,720
of a phone. It's ridiculous. It's awesome though. And they're giving it away for like,

944
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:44,040
you know, using a hashtag. So I just encourage you to... Ting is awesome, dude. They're just

945
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:48,140
insane. There's a few rules and the whatnot, so just go over to their blog. But do me a

946
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:53,480
favor. Start by going to linux.ting.com. That'll take $25 off a device, or if you bring one,

947
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,000
it'll give you $25 in service credit. But on top of that, it lets them know you heard

948
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,080
it here, linux.ting.com, and then click over to that blog post and read about the giveaway.

949
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,360
Because I think you can get on that. I think you could probably get in on that. You know,

950
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,960
sometimes Wes is snapping a few pictures there in that Seattle area. You had that hashtag,

951
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,880
Wes, you might get yourself... I'm on there liking that stuff. I see it. I'm like, oh

952
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,400
yeah, that's good. I'm liking that. You know that? I want you to know I'm liking your stuff

953
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,880
sometimes. It's important you know that. Hashtag Ting Summer. All right. Now, before we go

954
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:26,320
any further, I got one more thing to give out here, because we all love and know Digital

955
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:32,800
Ocean, and you can get in on the goodness, do.co.plugged. Get a $100 credit. Yeah, 100s.

956
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,960
100s applied to your account for 60 days when you sign up with a new account. 100s in Digital

957
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:43,400
Ocean credit is... It's way more than you need. It's an excessive amount of credit.

958
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,840
I think you should go sign up, because I don't know why they haven't turned this off yet,

959
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:51,480
to be honest with you. If I was Digital Ocean, I would cut this crap off right now. Because

960
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,840
I don't know what you're doing with that 100 bucks. Because here's the thing. Our previous

961
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:01,240
promo was 10 bucks. That was enough. 10 bucks was enough, Wes. Just like 640k of RAM was

962
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:06,480
enough. Yeah, right. It's crazy. It was. It was plenty. And now $100. You know, back in

963
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,600
my day, back in my day, we got $10 in credit. And then even further back in my day, we had

964
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,680
to rack our own gear. Okay? So now you're gonna... I can't even with you guys. But if

965
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:22,160
you go over there to do.co.plugged until Crazy Digital Ocean quits it, you can sign up. And

966
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:27,000
with a new account, you'll get that 100 credit. And you can try to deploy a system in seconds.

967
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,960
I mean, it just only takes you seconds to get a system up and going. You want to go

968
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,320
try out GitLab and say, screw you to Microsoft, which I don't necessarily agree with. But

969
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:40,680
I don't judge you either. Well, you can do it with that 100 credit and then just see

970
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,760
how perfectly useful it is and then just keep paying. That's probably what I would do. But

971
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,800
you know what? I can't really say what you're gonna do. You may just want to seed your favorite

972
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:54,200
distribution for a bit. But they do have some really cool options. Like you can mix and

973
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:58,960
match droplet resources now, which is kind of a new feature for Digital Ocean. So say

974
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,320
you want like a lot of CPU for all that Monero. Well, then you can just throw like a ton of

975
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:08,000
CPU, which I also do not recommend. But you could. And let's just say you want a lot of

976
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,360
disk because you're like Crazy Chris and you're backing up all the photos from your road trip

977
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:16,680
using Nextcloud to your cloud, which is your own cloud up on the Digital Ocean. I want

978
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,700
all the disk, Wes. That's what I do. So I attach 250 gigs of block storage. That's how

979
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:26,200
I do. And let's just say that I had this really long video message I wanted to send Wes. You

980
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,400
know how I would do that? Digital Ocean spaces generate an URL. You know what somebody ought

981
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,440
to do is they ought to take and this is a serious thing. They ought to take that Digital

982
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,320
Ocean API, which is really well documented, easy to understand, and I think their crazy

983
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,400
great dashboard might be a client of because it's feature complete. I tell you what. Just

984
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,840
make me one app for iOS and you can make it for those Androids if you want to put it in

985
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,920
the share sheet. So I hit a share button. It comes up and then I hit a button on my

986
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:58,800
share sheet and it creates a Digital Ocean space using the API with my account and then

987
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:03,320
it generates a link and then I could send that file to Wes because you see that would

988
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:08,680
be awesome because the Digital Ocean API is so slick that there's already tons of great

989
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:13,040
open source software that's been created for it. So this is just one more thing that Chris

990
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,880
is asking for. Somebody out there go take advantage of it. Also, because Digital Ocean

991
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:23,640
is not satisfied with just giving you $100 in credit, they're also going to enable you

992
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:31,040
to donate your time for writing tutorials to open source projects and charities. You

993
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,320
can write for donations. I'll have a link in the show notes. And if you want to write

994
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:39,480
up some, say you're an expert on WireGuard, which is probably not super common yet, or

995
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,920
maybe something else that is more common that people are interested in, you could go write

996
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:47,200
that up, submit it to Digital Ocean, and if they like it, what they were going to pay

997
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,260
you because they do sometimes pay their course authors or whoever is writing up like the

998
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:54,480
tutorials and stuff. Instead of giving it to you, they'll give it to the charity of

999
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:01,360
your choice. Isn't that pretty cool? Up to $400 too. I have information in the show notes

1000
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:06,960
if you want to check that out. dio.co slash unplugged and a big thank you to Digital Ocean

1001
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,720
for sponsoring the unplugged program. So I got some retro gaming nostalgia on during

1002
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:19,080
Linux Fest Texas and it feels sort of good. Like at first I was like I shouldn't do this.

1003
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:23,920
I shouldn't succumb to nostalgia. I shouldn't allow myself to revert. And you know, I don't

1004
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,580
want to be like my folks who like are still listening to the stuff from high school when

1005
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:31,300
they were in high school. They listen to that music. I don't. I try to keep my music taste

1006
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:35,800
current even though all new music is horrible. I want to stay fresh. I want to stay current.

1007
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:42,040
I don't want to let myself become an old man. However, the classics are the classics, man.

1008
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:46,680
And and you can't ever beat Mario. Mario's solid. And there's some other things like

1009
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,880
in that category. Like I will. I still love to sit down and play a great game of Doom.

1010
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:56,000
Can't help it. I love it. And another game in that category for me where it may not look

1011
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,720
the best. It may not be peak first person shooter. But damn, I love original quake and

1012
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:09,640
and if if this didn't land at just the right time for my soul, there is now a snap to install

1013
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:15,720
quake shareware snap install quick dash shareware and you can play the classic quake first person

1014
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:21,320
shooter back when it games is making quake. And you get the shareware one boom right there

1015
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:25,360
and it's done. It's good to go. Isn't that awesome? This couldn't possibly be easier.

1016
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,480
I don't think Melissa came reinstalled. But that's really just that's not that's crazy

1017
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,880
sauce. So yes, I know what I'm doing after the show. I also because I'm kind of snap

1018
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:40,600
stupid. So maybe somebody could educate me on this. But I have a snap installed that

1019
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:45,180
I cannot link you to and I don't understand how this works. Because it's in the snap store.

1020
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:49,880
So I thought I could go to snap craft.io and link you to it. But I installed something

1021
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:55,120
I think I can't remember the exact syntax, but something like snap install, go g dash

1022
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:01,960
galaxy dash wine space dash dash edge, I think. And then I get the go g galaxy client for

1023
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:09,800
Windows in a snap container. And I just use that to log into my go g account and started

1024
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:15,400
installing software. And it was great. And I wanted to link you all to it. So you could

1025
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,640
try it out. But I don't understand maybe because it's an edge release. I can't link you to

1026
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:25,720
it. Is that what it is? So by default, the web version of the store only shows you stable

1027
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:30,640
channel snaps. And it hides everything in the other channels. But we're looking to change

1028
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,120
that. So you will be able to see and link to snaps that are in other channels. But it's

1029
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,360
just the default at the moment is stable only. Okay, so that is out there if you want to

1030
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:43,080
install it, I don't really know what the utility of it is other than it just made it really

1031
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:48,360
easy to get the galaxy client going. And then I installed a couple of games. I also I recently

1032
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:53,680
installed the battle net manager so I could get Diablo two and Starcraft three installed.

1033
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,440
Yeah, this is it's been happening over here was it's been happening. The guy who made

1034
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:03,360
that go g galaxy snap is actually in the IRC is still down. And he's going to give you

1035
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:09,200
the what you need to do to to to run it. Oh, thank you, sir. Very nice.

1036
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:14,080
So the other thing that I noticed was created as a snap. It's not exactly a retro game,

1037
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:19,720
although it did come out in 2008. So I guess that was like a decade ago, is Trackmania

1038
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:26,780
nations forever, which I got to watch you and wimpy play on wimpy's live stream the

1039
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:31,560
other night. This is now a snap that you can just install somehow. I don't understand how

1040
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:36,200
this works. Maybe somebody can explain explain this to me. You can snap install the Trackmania

1041
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:42,280
snap and it comes down. It pulls down like a Windows installer, which then launches and

1042
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,840
loads additional software. Am I getting this right?

1043
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:52,360
Yeah, yeah. So Trackmania nations forever is a free to play Windows game, but it's proprietary

1044
01:06:52,360 --> 01:07:00,080
and you can't redistribute it. So the snap is called TM nations forever. And the snap

1045
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:10,100
contains a wine runtime and some scripts to bootstrap that environment. So when you install

1046
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:18,560
the TM nations forever snap and run it for the first time, it interrogates the isolated

1047
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:25,880
wine prefix, sees that the game isn't there, reaches out to the internet, downloads the

1048
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:33,640
installer from the internet, and then installs the game into the contained wine environment

1049
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:41,040
that that snap created. And then you have you that you now have this Windows game running

1050
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:46,760
in wine inside the snap. And now it's just a game that you can use. And also, you're

1051
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:52,840
saying it's retro. But for me, I've been using Linux on a full time basis for 13 years by

1052
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,960
the time this game came out. So when I actually discovered it for the first time, this was

1053
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:03,000
a new game, as far as I was concerned, irrespective of what the release date was. And I think

1054
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,400
it stands up. I mean, it's it's quite, it's pretty, it runs very fast. It works really

1055
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:15,240
well on integrated graphics and discrete graphics. And it's it's at and the most important thing

1056
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:22,960
is, it's really, really good fun. It's easy to play, but very, very difficult to put down.

1057
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,000
Yes. Yeah, I really just enjoyed watching you to play it the other night on your live

1058
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,520
stream. And I thought to myself, like, when I when I saw the year was 2008, I thought

1059
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,560
to myself, how did I miss that? When I was watching them play that the other night, I

1060
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:40,080
would have thought it was a game for maybe just two years ago. It did look really sharp.

1061
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,480
So the 2008 thing isn't a put down. The other thing is when we were doing that live stream,

1062
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,600
we were both live streaming. So the papi was live streaming to his channel, and I was streaming

1063
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:54,960
to mine. But we were obviously using the snap of the game. We were using a snap of Firefox

1064
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:01,800
to drive twitch. We were using a snap of discord to communicate with each other. We were using

1065
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:08,920
a snap of OBS to do the live streaming, and then a snap of telegram to orchestrate our

1066
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:13,880
listeners. And we were joined by several of the Ubuntu podcast listeners who installed

1067
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,480
the snap and came in and joined us in game.

1068
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,480
Incredible.

1069
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:22,460
That's the part I like. Yeah, it just makes it super easy for people watching to also

1070
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:27,080
play snap install and you're good to go. Which is, that's a really great feature.

1071
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:32,560
Yeah, and this was extensive QA because we just published that snap into the stable channel.

1072
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:39,920
So being the dedicated people that we are, papi and I were doing QA on Twitch from half

1073
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,600
past nine until half past one in the morning just to make absolutely sure it all worked

1074
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,600
fine.

1075
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
Bless you.

1076
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,600
I love my job.

1077
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,240
That is the kind of dedication that you just can't pay for. You know, that is true dedication,

1078
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,240
gentlemen.

1079
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,440
Yeah. Write a letter to Canonical and stall them.

1080
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,440
Right.

1081
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,440
Mark at Ubuntu.com.

1082
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:05,160
Yeah, yeah. Well, it does seem to work quite well. And so we'll have links to that in the

1083
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:09,640
show notes as well. Mr. West, you and I were debating on the pre-show, like how to cover

1084
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:14,800
this next story. It's from a listener of the show, Pro Bono, and he's also involved with

1085
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,160
AppImage. And it does influence his write up a bit over on Medium, but he makes some

1086
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:25,680
solid points about Linux desktop usability. And he writes, why do desktop environments

1087
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:30,560
increasingly degrade the desktop UX that once used to be straightforward and common sense?

1088
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,160
Now stick with us here. This isn't like the common rebaked argument we hear all the time.

1089
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,260
And don't mistake Pro Bono for anti Linux. He's a fan of the Linux desktop and the projects

1090
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,960
we're going to talk about here. But he says there seems to be a tendency specifically

1091
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,080
for desktop environments and applications to mess around with the proven concept of

1092
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:53,400
menus. Menus specifically seem to be what have him upset. And Bill Atkinson, the inventor

1093
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,240
of menus, well describes them. He says in a quote, I'm proud of the pull down menus.

1094
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:02,580
I thought that pull down menu was a very good solution to providing visibility, spatial

1095
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:07,080
memory of where the commands were as well. And that's a you can find that quote in the

1096
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:13,080
Computer History Museum as well. He says, Pro Bono, he says, he goes on, why is there

1097
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:19,560
an unsettling tendency to kill the beloved file, edit, etc. menus that also date back

1098
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:26,980
to the Lisa interface that has been engraved in our brain muscles for 40 years? This goes

1099
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:32,300
way back. But yet, we seem to keep wanting to reinvent it. Going back to Bill Atkinson,

1100
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:36,360
another quote, he says, the nice thing about this menu was because the titles of the menus

1101
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:41,100
were always much narrower than the items. It basically tripled your effective screen.

1102
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:45,700
You could scan along the top and see all available commands without doing any of them. You could

1103
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:52,080
harmlessly see what is available. And discoverability seems to be a big point of Pro Bono's case

1104
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:56,800
here. He mentions like the new GTK three pop over menus, which they were super, super proud

1105
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:02,000
of have taken out all of the keyboard shortcut commands in order to make the menu shorter.

1106
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,460
So there's like no control C for copy, no control P for paste, no control S by the save.

1107
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,900
Discoverability is gone. But to make matters worse is then the browsers really started

1108
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:18,100
this offense is it's all compounded by the hamburger menu. Like we gave Microsoft a hard

1109
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:23,440
time for the ribbon. But the hamburger menu is the biggest offender of all of them because

1110
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:30,400
it's just this lazy cram everything in this three dot menu. Just put it all in there,

1111
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:36,900
cram it all in there. And that's really like a huge step back. In fact, and I love this,

1112
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:43,120
Pro Bono goes to point out in his post that when you go way, way, way back to 1981, the

1113
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:50,560
Xerox Star, the original thing that Apple ripped off the idea from and iterated on,

1114
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:58,200
the Xerox Star had a hamburger menu in 1981, had a fricking hamburger menu in 1981. And

1115
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:06,280
then Pro Bono shows the design notes for the Lisa interface where they try out a global

1116
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:11,360
menu, application menus, and they also try out a hamburger menu. Like they try out all

1117
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:17,600
the different stuff in the 1980s, early 1980s, and they have solid notes on why those designs

1118
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,780
did or did not work. And so when we go back to the hamburger menu, when we drop global

1119
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:28,360
menus, his point, Pro Bono's point is we're actually going back to design mistakes of

1120
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:35,580
the early 1980s that designers worked and iterated to get us out of for years. And now

1121
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:41,280
some of the most popular open source desktops like GNOME 3 are making the mistake that we

1122
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,880
made 40 years ago. And Wes, this is a pretty strong argument that he makes with lots of

1123
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:55,040
pull quotes, screenshots, early UI concept design. And it leaves me just going like damn,

1124
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,960
dude really has a point here. What did you think?

1125
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:02,520
Well, we are lucky to live in a pretty rich ecosystem of different paradigms that you

1126
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,560
would like to use. And he makes reference to a really large number of them, especially

1127
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:12,120
in projects like Monte where there's even more customization of different layout styles.

1128
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:16,640
I think some of his points are spot on about there are some simple features that could

1129
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:22,800
help discoverability that like, maybe if they're not enabled, is an option of the installer.

1130
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,600
Maybe there's some degrees between not having them at all or options to have them there.

1131
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,240
I'm wondering what do you think in now that you've spent some time with Plasma? Do you

1132
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,000
think any of this is less relevant?

1133
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,920
I tell you one of the things that I like about having in Plasma is I've gone in, I've turned

1134
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:39,400
on all of the menus for like in Dolphin. By default, they're off. But now when I launched

1135
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,200
Dolphin, I have like my alt, you know, if you hold down alt to get those menus, I have

1136
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:49,160
them now. And the reason why is what he points out where he makes a strong case here is discoverability.

1137
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,860
When I'm learning a new UI, I like to have that style, I like to get the little hint

1138
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:57,400
of what the Ctrl C would do for copy or what the Ctrl S would do for save. Like, if I didn't

1139
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:02,680
know that, how do I learn that unless it's put in some menu somewhere? And he makes a

1140
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:09,980
strong case for global menus, which I am not so sold on. Because the basic idea for global

1141
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:16,360
menus comes down to, well, look, you can jam your mouse up to the top of the screen faster

1142
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:22,000
than you can finesse it to the top of an application. That I'm not so sold on. I don't know, does

1143
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,080
anybody in the Mumba room have thoughts as has the desktop made steps?

1144
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:32,960
So I actually did a good portion of a master's thesis on the Linux desktop usability. And

1145
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:41,280
I tested Cinnamon, Mate, KDE. It was all the stuff that was on Antegros back in the day

1146
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:47,160
that was all the defaults that were there. I didn't install anything special. And the

1147
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:51,840
most quote unquote usable desktop was Cinnamon. And if you look in the Hacker News comments

1148
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,240
for this article, there's actually quite a few people who say, oh, have you tried Cinnamon

1149
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:02,860
in some kind of magical way? And I think there's a lot of stuff that different desktop environments

1150
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:03,860
do well.

1151
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:08,860
And one of the things that's mentioned in the article is on the Mac, for example, they

1152
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:13,400
have the search in menus for help. I can't tell you how many times that's actually saved

1153
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:18,800
my bacon when I've been looking for something quickly. And I think there's a lot of small

1154
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:25,480
things that Linux could learn from Mac and Mac could learn from Windows. And it's a cycle.

1155
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:29,600
But the other thing that's happened in the last 10 years is that obviously mobile interfaces

1156
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:35,360
have come along, and they've kind of shaken up how most people interact with devices.

1157
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,560
And you look at things like the hamburger menu, and they are as a direct consequence,

1158
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,640
I believe, because of mobile stuff.

1159
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,640
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

1160
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:49,000
I don't necessarily need to have the about stuff available, taking up valuable screen

1161
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:55,120
real estate all the time. But I do probably want my history to be available, for example,

1162
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,120
easily in a web browser.

1163
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:00,120
Yeah, I definitely see there's a compromise too, when you're trying to save like development

1164
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:04,000
resources and you want to create mobile applications, you want to create desktop applications, you

1165
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,720
want to create web applications, there's going to be compromises that are made. I think it's

1166
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,240
a tight line between compromises and repeating old mistakes.

1167
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:15,100
And there's also I mean, who are you targeting? You have to think like some of those desktops

1168
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:18,160
you can be very productive in once you've learned everything and discoverability is

1169
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:24,560
perhaps less of a priority for you. Obviously, that's not the best for reaching a wide audience

1170
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,360
or a number of things. But for power users, sometimes that's all you care about.

1171
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,520
Yeah, and I definitely agree once you kind of know a system. That's a good point. Alex,

1172
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:37,320
you had to drop a link in the IRC to that write up you did. Now, I want to kind of get

1173
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,840
out of here with just kind of an update on how things went at Linux Academy and with

1174
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:44,440
the work I did there and just spend the last couple of minutes on that. But just a quick

1175
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:49,520
mention, I think it's FreeBSD's birthday today. I think they just turned 25. So congratulations

1176
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,880
to the FreeBSD project. Just want to mention that too in the show. So today, we're doing

1177
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,280
the show from Casper, Wyoming. We were just in the middle of a storm, but now actually

1178
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:02,320
blue skies are starting to clear. Since we did the last Linux Unplugged, I've driven

1179
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,320
1070 miles.

1180
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,320
Whoa!

1181
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,280
19 hours and 25 minutes.

1182
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,280
Mm-hmm.

1183
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,280
Yeah.

1184
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,280
Impressive, sir.

1185
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:15,840
Thank you. I left Linux Academy last Friday. And for some crazy reason, Hadia flew back

1186
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:21,180
to Seattle Friday a.m. really early, picked up all three of our kids and brought them

1187
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:27,200
back to Dallas. And now they've been with us for the drive home. So that's been fun.

1188
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,680
And it was a good way to spend Father's Day for sure.

1189
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,680
That sounds great.

1190
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,140
Yeah, it's been, yeah, it has been great. It has been great. It's been challenging like

1191
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,880
to do work, but it's also been really nice to have this opportunity. And we split our

1192
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:41,040
time up between playing hard, getting sunburns, which we've now gotten out of our system,

1193
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:46,700
and driving like crazy and doing a bit of work here and there. We had 95 plus days though,

1194
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:50,040
you know, for like weeks. We were just ready to get out of there. So we pushed hard yesterday,

1195
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,920
drove a lot. Kids are off at the movies right now as I do the show. They're actually on

1196
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,360
their way back right now. And then we're going to continue. We're going to keep on pushing

1197
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:01,640
home, probably do like a couple of more stops, like some swimming holes and things like that.

1198
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:06,800
And then make it home probably this weekend if all things go well. Yeah, so the next Unplugged

1199
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,000
I should be back in the studio, I think.

1200
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,540
That's wild.

1201
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:19,920
And so I got, I got Dell, I got Dell, I got a Dell XPS desktop set up at Linux Academy

1202
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:26,800
with Kubuntu 18.04 minimal install and the latest version of OBS. Now they got a couple

1203
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,840
of PCI expansion. I can't remember. Oh, Sonnet, I think. I can't remember. Somebody makes,

1204
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:37,080
but they're just standard PCI USB cards. But each port has its own dedicated controller

1205
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:41,480
and they got like six ports or something like that on the back of each PCI card. So each

1206
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:47,200
one has a controller with full USB bandwidth going into the PCI bus. Yeah, it's nice. And

1207
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:52,440
then they got Elgato capture cards that hang off of those. And they have different sources

1208
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:58,600
coming in like a Chromebook or like a guest machine or like a desktop. And we also got

1209
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:03,200
them set up with a bit of a mixer setup so they could do a little mix minus action and

1210
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:07,360
a 4K Canon camera coming into that thing, which is the first time I'd ever worked with

1211
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:12,320
4K and OBS, which was fun. And yeah, it's a pretty straightforward setup. They're going

1212
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:17,040
to be using in July when they do their new big content launch. And I got them set up

1213
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,080
with the same switcher, the same shuttle pro switcher that I have in the JV one studio.

1214
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:25,240
They had, so now they have one of those, which is sort of fun. Oh, nice. Took a little funky

1215
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:29,480
work to get that going under Linux these days because it's not really well supported anymore,

1216
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:35,240
but it's still my favorite switcher. Yeah, yeah, but it went pretty well. I kind of want

1217
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:40,520
to go back down there in July, which is crazy because I've just gotten home. But that's

1218
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:44,720
when they're doing their live stream stuff for this big content release. And I kind of

1219
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,520
want to be there for the first stream because I don't really want to make sure it goes well.

1220
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:52,760
I don't want the first stream on Linux to go badly. Your reputation's on the line. Linux

1221
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:58,320
is reputation too, right? So because otherwise it's right back to Wirecast and the Mac. And

1222
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:04,240
I got to give credit. I met Jacob, their production guy they just hired recently, and he's never

1223
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:08,680
used OBS. He's never used Linux, but he's totally on board with learning because he's

1224
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:15,120
working at Linux Academy now. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. And so he was there. I was showing

1225
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:19,000
him how it works. Meanwhile, he was dealing with some exciting family stuff at home. And

1226
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,760
so that was like, we were balancing all of that and everybody was super dedicated and

1227
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,160
really invested in making it all work. So I just want to be there if I can when it happens.

1228
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:31,720
I don't know. I'll probably fly down if it's possible. Just to make sure that first live

1229
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,080
stream on Linux where everybody's watching goes smooth. And then after that, I'll feel

1230
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:39,720
much better. We did a test stream on Friday. So I know it works, but it's a little bit

1231
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:46,240
different when it's actually like the time where it's go time, you know, we'll see. We'll

1232
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,360
see how that goes. But yeah, it was a good trip. Now I'm on the way home. And by the

1233
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:56,720
next time we see and hear you here and see me, I'll be in the studio. I'm a little sad,

1234
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,920
but I'm also kind of looking forward to getting back to Seattle. I'm looking forward to it.

1235
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:05,780
It'll be nice. I miss the studio. So let's wrap it up with just a little bit of deets.

1236
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:09,360

1240
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:27,240
here. A lot of things we talked about get picked up or continued on their show. So go

1241
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:32,100
get that at Ubuntu podcast. And if you want more Wes and myself, then tech snaps your

show tech snap dot system will boom. How about that for all the plugs? He's like I got through

1243
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:42,800
them all the little block of plugs ease. Also, why not join us live on a Tuesday? I'm gonna

1244
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,820
just throw this out there. Come get yourself a nice healthy Linux sandwich. It's way more

1245
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:52,380
fun, way more fun. You see, we start out around 130 on our live stream Pacific time, we get

1246
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:56,760
going with the unplugged show, we chat, we say things we shouldn't say, then we do the

1247
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:00,160
show. That's the part you just heard. And then we kind of hang out a little bit more

1248
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:04,200
say a few more things we shouldn't say. And then that crazy cat Noah takes over and he

1249
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:09,400
starts answering your questions live, all right here and you just sit back and absorb

1250
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:14,200
via the process similar to osmosis, but nothing like osmosis. Thanks so much for tuning this

1251
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:18,760
week's episode of the unplugged program. We'll be back here next week, back in the Seattle

1252
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:22,880
studio. I'm looking forward to it actually. See you next Tuesday.

1253
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:59,240
All right, now we got to pick a title. Those kids are out from the movie. They're in the

1254
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:05,220
Uber. They're on their way back to the RV. So the countdown has started. It's go time.

1255
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:10,840
So the EU broke the internet is currently on top one. It was a play on words. It was

1256
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:15,840
supposed to be you broke the internet. But anyway, nevermind. Oh, I love it. Who's gonna

1257
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:22,720
read it like that? Who's gonna read it like that? Well me, but then I'm weird. Yeah, yeah.

1258
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:29,920
Article 13. Unlucky for some nation scale. That hasn't been passed really yet. Okay,

1259
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:38,220
let's not get ourselves. Fair enough. Copyright is broken and stop killing the internet. Wow.

1260
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:43,400
Super positive show guys, but they would actually reintroduce 20 years in a way because if you

1261
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:49,680
really think about it, currently it's eight years plus after the author's death and these

1262
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:55,200
new provisions would make it 20 years only. I can't though. All these are super depressing.

1263
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:01,720
We can't name the show that. We can't name the show EU broke the internet or stop killing

1264
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:09,800
the internet. Ionic. Come on now. Ironic. Okay. How about this one? How about everything

1265
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,600
is great? How about just everything is great? Let's just do that. Let's just do everything

1266
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:18,200
is great. We love you. Everything is great. Everything should feel fine. Nothing's wrong

1267
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:24,280
here. Nothing to be concerned about. Linux unplugged 254. The longest title ever. Bury

1268
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:42,120
your head in the sand. Yeah. Nothing to see here. How are you?
