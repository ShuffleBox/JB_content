WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
So we've been on the road for a couple of weeks and this is normally the time when I come on the air and tell

00:04.560 --> 00:09.600
You how something broke in the rv or maybe I broke myself trying to fix whatever's broken in the rv

00:10.720 --> 00:12.240
But I gotta say

00:12.240 --> 00:16.320
Jupes is doing great. Those investments are paying off right? You got those shocks

00:16.320 --> 00:19.040
You've been I mean fixing slides since the day I met you

00:19.920 --> 00:21.840
Must be working now, huh?

00:21.840 --> 00:23.360
Yeah, yeah

00:23.360 --> 00:25.200
Yeah, the rv's working great

00:25.200 --> 00:32.080
But the home server that runs pretty much everything like home assistant my sync thing my media server

00:32.560 --> 00:35.840
My documentation my scheduling system all

00:36.640 --> 00:37.840
of that

00:37.840 --> 00:39.840
It died while we were down at jpl

00:40.400 --> 00:42.240
Came back to a dead server

00:42.240 --> 00:46.400
It only it's always something that breaks in the space where we aren't I know right?

00:46.720 --> 00:49.680
I thought it might have been down because I couldn't connect a home assistant. I thought okay

00:49.920 --> 00:54.320
Well could be home assistants hung up could be a networking issue or it could be something much worse

00:54.320 --> 00:56.320
It turns out it was much worse

00:57.040 --> 00:58.000
so now

00:58.000 --> 01:01.120
no, I think you'll hear us do an episode on home servers soon because

01:02.160 --> 01:05.840
Uh, you know, who knows what i'm gonna do. I gotta figure that out in the meantime

01:06.320 --> 01:10.660
I guess the show must go on another episode of what not to do with chris

01:10.660 --> 01:12.660
So

01:22.420 --> 01:28.820
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly linux talk show. My name is chris. My name is les and my name is brent

01:28.980 --> 01:35.140
Hello gentlemen coming up on the show today. We all get a front row seat to linux history in the making

01:35.140 --> 01:41.620
We'll take you behind the scenes of our tour of nasa's jet propulsion laboratory and our thoughts on a famous linux platform

01:41.940 --> 01:46.260
Getting shut down and then we'll round out the show some boosts and picks and a lot more

01:46.740 --> 01:51.620
So before we go any further, I want to say a big good morning to our friends over at tail scale

01:51.940 --> 01:57.460
Tail scale is a mesh vpn protected by wire guard. We use it. It's what connects all of our machines

01:57.620 --> 02:00.660
It's what's making the show possible right now and it'll change your game

02:00.660 --> 02:05.000
Go to tailscale.com and try it out for free for up to 20 devices at tailscale.com

02:06.900 --> 02:08.500
So we are on the road

02:08.500 --> 02:10.500
We are at listener jeff's right now

02:11.060 --> 02:13.060
in sacramento, california

02:13.060 --> 02:17.620
Just got done with the big pasadena meetup and the jpl tour which we will tell you about in a little bit

02:17.780 --> 02:22.820
I feel like i'm still buzzing from that experience of so much great stuff there and that might be the hangover. Oh

02:23.700 --> 02:26.740
Or some of those chemicals they use, you know for the

02:26.740 --> 02:31.380
What for the science experiments and all is it the chem chem trails? Is that what you said?

02:31.460 --> 02:34.260
Yeah, he did. He did break into that one room that he wasn't supposed to go into

02:35.140 --> 02:38.100
It was like I like the color red and everything was red in there

02:38.180 --> 02:41.220
Yeah, but that thing said chem trails don't go in. What'd you do?

02:41.780 --> 02:42.900
You went in

02:42.900 --> 02:47.460
But before we get into all of that, I wanted to talk about something that's been sent into the show quite a bit

02:47.780 --> 02:52.820
We've been asked over and over again about our thoughts on stadia getting shut down google stadia

02:52.820 --> 02:59.720
You remember it was launched as google's big entrance into game streaming and it was going to bring so many game developers

02:59.940 --> 03:04.020
Over to linux to get things compatible with stadia

03:04.580 --> 03:10.420
Stadia is only the newest most logic defined mind-bending absurd gaming platform on earth

03:10.500 --> 03:17.700
Forget boxes forget consoles just your games your screens and electric air and this electric air is

03:18.580 --> 03:20.180
stadia

03:20.180 --> 03:25.060
Well absurd might be right 412 linux on twitter wrote sadly at chris last is the first person

03:25.140 --> 03:31.620
I thought of after reading the stadia update. He really did believe in it. Can't wait to hear his thoughts on at linux unplugged

03:32.420 --> 03:34.100
And if you missed the news

03:34.100 --> 03:36.100
While we were on the road google wrote

03:36.580 --> 03:39.800
That they are shutting down stadia changing strategies

03:40.340 --> 03:47.140
And they will be refunding all stadia hardware purchases and game purchases to players. I didn't expect that part

03:47.140 --> 03:51.780
I mean it does I think somewhat ease my frustration because

03:52.500 --> 03:55.940
I mean i've been predicting stadia's downfall for what a couple of years now

03:56.420 --> 03:58.420
Yeah, we all have

03:59.140 --> 04:01.140
Everybody knew this day was coming

04:01.700 --> 04:05.060
And I think that's actually maybe what sort of prevented it from being a success

04:05.700 --> 04:06.900
In the first place

04:06.900 --> 04:11.940
Is this like the moment where when your predictions comes true for the year or wes is wes usually makes this prediction

04:11.940 --> 04:16.820
I can't remember. We'll have to review. I don't know if I did this year. Well, yeah, we'll find out

04:17.440 --> 04:20.180
Unfortunately soon, you know the verge blamed linux

04:21.300 --> 04:27.620
How come the verge writes google spent millions convincing publishers like ubisoft and take two to bring their biggest games to stadia

04:28.260 --> 04:29.540
They go on to say

04:29.540 --> 04:36.580
Google had to pay such large sums because of the work to port their games over wasn't particularly easy given stadia

04:36.580 --> 04:44.100
Runs on linux a platform game developers haven't paid enough attention to I mean they're not wrong in the sense that yeah

04:44.180 --> 04:48.020
That probably made this more difficult than if you were trying to set up some sort of you know

04:48.420 --> 04:50.420
windows game streaming environment, but

04:51.220 --> 04:55.780
at least by google's read they expected more user adoption and I don't know if the

04:56.660 --> 05:02.900
One of those two were directly connected. I kind of liked a take I saw over at tech crunch which which said

05:02.900 --> 05:07.780
Stadia died because no one trusts google. I agree with that take

05:08.420 --> 05:11.540
I think that's that's why I never got into it as much as I wanted it to be a hit

05:11.860 --> 05:18.500
And I really wanted it to create a network effect where developers begin porting more and more games over to linux

05:18.980 --> 05:23.060
I think you could argue it was good for vulcan adoption. Yeah, it does seem like the

05:23.620 --> 05:28.100
The bare bones of the like the technical side of this actually actually worked pretty darn well, you know

05:28.100 --> 05:33.220
Like linux between all the work that valve is put in between the work that obviously google and then the stadia folks have put in

05:33.220 --> 05:35.220
Between all the regular good linux stuff

05:35.860 --> 05:39.940
Linux is ready for games. I just don't know if the world is ready for games on linux

05:40.740 --> 05:43.220
Especially on google. Is there a connection between

05:43.780 --> 05:49.780
Sort of steam doing its work and stadia coming out at the same time because it seems like those two were overlapping and I wonder

05:50.340 --> 05:52.100
Which one made which possible?

05:52.100 --> 05:58.580
Is it is it that google brought more attention to gaming on linux and that steam was able to take that?

05:59.060 --> 06:01.060
Sort of energy and make it really run

06:01.300 --> 06:05.940
No, I think you know, the linux side was kind of hidden over at stadia to me

06:06.100 --> 06:09.860
it just seems that I don't know if anyone believes google can have a

06:10.500 --> 06:16.580
Exciting new independent division that exists beyond their like core ad tech or youtube platform

06:16.580 --> 06:22.980
And also the need for me personally with stadia was reduced when proton got good and I could run most games that I didn't

06:22.980 --> 06:27.620
Have access to before on my machine again, right stadia was a little bit better of a solution

06:27.860 --> 06:30.820
when I didn't have a local option for that stuff, but when

06:31.380 --> 06:36.420
Proton came along and proton was pretty pretty good. Then I could just play that stuff on my computer again

06:37.300 --> 06:43.140
So I think in some ways valve's entrance maybe harmed stadia's overall momentum, but I don't think it really could

06:43.140 --> 06:47.540
Probably be accused of anything more than that. The other side of this too is you know

06:47.940 --> 06:53.140
Even as a stadia sometimes stadia user feels like a lot of technologies these days

06:54.500 --> 06:59.240
Like some apple products or sometimes tesla products or other things where I really like the technology

07:00.500 --> 07:04.260
But the way it ends up being presented to the consumer and all the all the top layers of it

07:05.140 --> 07:06.180
Just doesn't work for me

07:06.180 --> 07:10.420
And I don't know like I was never going to get that excited about stadia because even at the in the best use case

07:10.420 --> 07:14.340
How much was I going to really invest in it? It was never going to be fully under my control

07:14.420 --> 07:19.460
I was just going to be depending on internet pipes and uh, you know google to keep running it

07:19.700 --> 07:22.660
yeah, it's even worse than the compromise you make with the steam store where

07:23.300 --> 07:27.140
You know when you buy games through valve, I guess they could technically take them away

07:27.620 --> 07:33.540
but you when you install them you're at least downloading them and installing them locally and you've paid for them and you can put them on

07:33.620 --> 07:38.020
other computers and other devices like the deck when those come out but with stadia

07:38.020 --> 07:43.860
You are always tied to google in a very direct way in a way that made a better experience honestly because i've tried g force

07:44.180 --> 07:49.620
I even tried on live back in the day and none of them were quite as good as google because they chopped off some of that

07:49.780 --> 07:51.940
Uh user interface stuff and just got you right into the game

07:52.420 --> 07:59.940
But classically like microsoft before them and and now how google seems to emulate what they once so much hated they don't

08:01.540 --> 08:04.260
They don't fully embrace a technology like this

08:04.260 --> 08:09.700
I should have been able to look up a game on youtube, you know, destiny 2 or star trek online

08:09.780 --> 08:13.620
Look up that game on youtube watch a gamer and then one click

08:14.180 --> 08:17.780
Inside the youtube ui I should have been able to transform that into a gaming experience

08:18.260 --> 08:22.100
Launch the game in my browser and start playing within seconds. Google has the technology

08:22.180 --> 08:24.580
They even they even talked about doing that at one point

08:24.660 --> 08:29.940
They just never pulled the trigger because you could tell even internally at google. They just didn't have the support

08:30.020 --> 08:33.220
They didn't even believe it themselves. It would stick around and I don't know if that's true

08:33.220 --> 08:39.540
Stick around and I guess the upshot is is the only way they can save face and prevent a controversy is by refunding everybody

08:39.780 --> 08:42.100
Which is probably going to cost them a pretty little penny

08:42.660 --> 08:48.340
Yeah, people are also concerned that all those controllers out there unless google enables bluetooth on them

08:48.340 --> 08:51.700
Which they have the hardware for i'm led to believe but just wasn't ever turned on

08:52.180 --> 08:54.180
Well, that could also be a bunch of e-waste

08:54.740 --> 09:00.020
I guess we should probably make it clear that this isn't actually going into effect until

09:00.020 --> 09:04.600
Until january, I think it is so you still have a few months. Yeah, january 2023

09:04.900 --> 09:08.980
Uh, they they said you have you got some time for quote unquote final play sessions

09:09.700 --> 09:12.980
Yeah, yeah, you know go get your gameplay out now, I guess

09:13.380 --> 09:18.580
But I imagine that if you've spent like I don't know 80 000 hours or so on playing a game

09:18.820 --> 09:25.300
You can't even transfer it out. So what the heck it's so dumb. Yeah that part. I just don't get I don't understand why

09:25.300 --> 09:29.940
Uh, they didn't like give you the option to maybe get a steam key or something. Maybe it's the competitive angle

09:30.420 --> 09:32.420
I don't know what it is

09:32.420 --> 09:35.220
But uh, not good enough chief not good enough

09:35.300 --> 09:39.620
This is disappointing to see and the refund helps but it's not going to make me

09:40.100 --> 09:44.820
Stop thinking everything google launches. They eventually are going to kill now. That's just like they just confirmed it

09:48.820 --> 09:50.820
We are on the road again

09:50.820 --> 09:52.820
On the road again

09:53.780 --> 09:58.660
Just can't wait to get on the road again. This one has been a busy blur

10:00.660 --> 10:02.900
There has been multiple phases of this road trip

10:02.900 --> 10:07.940
I think we're like on the fifth phase right now because we got down to grant's pass like two weeks ago

10:08.660 --> 10:11.540
We had a meet up down there. Then we got down to sacramento

10:11.620 --> 10:16.420
We had another meet up there and we got to park here at listener jeff's house where we've got power and ethernet like

10:16.900 --> 10:18.420
Kings, you know

10:18.420 --> 10:24.900
It's nice over here. Then we uh, we switched from the rv and we switched to the car and we took the car down to pasadena

10:24.980 --> 10:31.460
Which is like another seven hours from sacramento. Yeah, in case you've never been to california. It's obscenely giant. It's huge

10:31.540 --> 10:35.540
It's way too huge. This is definitely it should be two states. There's no doubt about it in my mind

10:35.860 --> 10:38.900
And then you get to pasadena where we had an airbnb as a team

10:38.900 --> 10:43.220
So we flew in some of the team and we hung out there and uh, we did the jpl tour

10:43.220 --> 10:45.860
Which we'll tell you about here in a little bit and then we did the pass

10:45.860 --> 10:50.020
Adena meetup, which was our largest meetup yet and just an absolute blast

10:50.820 --> 10:55.780
And along each of these major five phases of this road trip

10:56.100 --> 11:00.660
We have been dropping geo caches all along the way as little treats for you guys

11:00.980 --> 11:03.940
That could be listening today that could be listening a year down the road

11:04.260 --> 11:07.060
Maybe you couldn't make it to a meetup. Maybe you're not even in that area today

11:07.060 --> 11:12.820
But one day you will be we have little treasures for you that we have stashed throughout the west coast

11:12.820 --> 11:19.780
And brent you did one of the first ones in southern oregon just north of grants pass at that little rest stop that the seven

11:19.860 --> 11:26.100
Feathers casino has yeah hadia and I uh figured we actually talked a long time about like how hard do we make this?

11:26.340 --> 11:31.780
Because we want people to find it. That's definitely true, but we don't want just random people finding it

11:31.860 --> 11:36.420
We want jb listeners to be the ones finding it. So that was a bit of a tricky go

11:36.500 --> 11:38.900
But we did find at this rest stop

11:38.900 --> 11:45.380
A giant wall of boulders that seemed like just the perfect place. So we stashed this little geocache

11:45.460 --> 11:50.980
It's got a bunch of really great stuff in it. It's got some swag t-shirts. It even has a freaking computer in there

11:51.060 --> 11:55.220
So I feel like it's a wonderful to find if you do find it

11:55.540 --> 11:58.180
Well, please work hard to find it because there's some great stuff in there

11:58.180 --> 12:02.580
And if you do find it take some audio and uh, take some video as well send that our way

12:02.660 --> 12:05.300
We would love to hear about how you find it

12:05.300 --> 12:11.380
And um, also feel free to take the stuff and put new stuff in there and even I don't know

12:11.460 --> 12:15.060
Start a journal of all the people that have found it just get creative like that

12:15.060 --> 12:23.540
I like that but but no bsd stuff, right? Right? No kidding. Jeez gross. We like the idea of something that people could

12:23.620 --> 12:29.620
Uh go look for when they're visiting the area. So look in the canyonville, oregon cow creek rest stop area

12:30.180 --> 12:32.180
And hopefully you'll find something that you like

12:32.180 --> 12:35.460
And then the lady and I we stashed the second

12:36.020 --> 12:39.320
Geocache in sacramento in fulsome california

12:39.860 --> 12:46.820
There is a hydro plant that has been retired that's open to the public worth going just for that

12:46.980 --> 12:52.660
I think johnny cash played a really famous concert near there. Okay, nice good little hint, too

12:53.140 --> 12:55.860
And uh at this retired hydro dam

12:55.860 --> 13:02.660
There is a little nice space down by the water a little park area just to hang out and there is some burnt trees

13:03.540 --> 13:10.980
That's your hint. It's in that general facility. We will have gps coordinates for all of these but they only get you within so close

13:11.540 --> 13:17.700
So you're gonna need these hints too and that one so that one's in uh, sacramento in fulsome california area

13:18.260 --> 13:21.220
And uh, also some good stuff in there again a little mini-carousel

13:21.220 --> 13:27.460
In fulsome california area and uh, also some good stuff in there again a little mini computer in there some t-shirts

13:28.100 --> 13:33.140
Some stickers feel free to leave a note and take the note that we've put in there for you and leave something else

13:33.860 --> 13:37.400
Uh, because that's just too much fun. And then wes you got to hide one in pasadena

13:38.260 --> 13:40.260
Yes, I did

13:40.260 --> 13:43.320
Well here I am in beautiful downtown pasadena

13:43.320 --> 13:49.800
The meetup's over the jpl trip is done and it's time to go home but

13:50.440 --> 13:53.480
Before that i've got one last task

13:54.360 --> 13:56.360
I've got a geocache to hide

14:00.200 --> 14:03.420
Ah here we are this looks like a nice little spot

14:03.420 --> 14:08.220
Good luck pasadena wes, I would love to know like give us more hints

14:08.220 --> 14:12.140
I I feel like I need to know kind of what's out there. Was it on a beach?

14:12.140 --> 14:15.020
Was it in a forest? Was it kind of in the middle of the city?

14:15.580 --> 14:19.100
Oh, it's in the middle of the city. All right, and let me just say downtown pasadena

14:19.900 --> 14:24.540
Absolutely, lovely. I hadn't been back there, uh since we went to scale a few years ago

14:24.540 --> 14:27.420
So it was it was nice to get to see the city. It was nice to get to see the city

14:27.420 --> 14:28.860
It was nice to get to see the city

14:28.860 --> 14:33.580
Hopefully I hadn't been back there since we went to scale a few years ago. So it was it was nice to get to

14:33.580 --> 14:35.580
Spend a little bit of time there on my last day

14:36.860 --> 14:38.860
Let's see a hint. Okay

14:39.420 --> 14:43.820
Well, there's a nice little park in downtown pasadena with some beautiful trees

14:44.620 --> 14:46.300
Those trees

14:46.300 --> 14:51.900
They seem they seem to have more than a few nooks and crannies. So maybe start there

14:53.260 --> 14:57.260
All right, that's a good hint. I can I can I can almost kind of picture it already

14:57.260 --> 15:02.300
The sacramento one I think is only hard because there's so many nooks and crannies it could be in

15:03.100 --> 15:06.380
So we'll see the pasadena one. I imagine it's a little tricky too because there's probably a lot of area

15:06.780 --> 15:10.540
There um, you know, well, can you trim it down? Is it in a nook or is it in a crane?

15:11.260 --> 15:14.220
I'm not gonna classify that come on. That's above my pay grade

15:15.420 --> 15:18.700
Okay, fine. This road trip has been a

15:19.580 --> 15:25.900
Blur it feels like it's been one long monday. In fact, do check out office hours 13

15:25.900 --> 15:31.340
We recorded that down at the airbnb and we recounted a lot of the story behind the scene stuff getting down here

15:31.340 --> 15:35.660
So if you're curious about what the trip has been like some of the stories some of the meetup stuff

15:35.980 --> 15:39.740
Do check out office hours 13 office hours dot hair

15:40.460 --> 15:46.380
but I want to get more into some of the history we got to see being made at jpl and some of just

15:46.940 --> 15:49.820
The real world uses of linux, you know, we talk about it here on the show

15:49.820 --> 15:53.520
But to go somewhere and see them using it in these mission critical situations

15:53.520 --> 15:55.520
It's always so educational

15:55.520 --> 15:57.520
So I want to talk about all that seriousness

15:57.520 --> 15:59.520
But before we get there, I want to have a little fun

15:59.920 --> 16:03.920
And there was a moment where listener jeff who's been hosting us here at his house

16:04.480 --> 16:08.400
Took us out to one of his favorite local diners a great staff there

16:08.400 --> 16:12.080
They seemed like a lot of fun and I got myself a nice stack of pancakes

16:12.400 --> 16:14.400
And after I got done eating these pancakes

16:14.400 --> 16:19.360
I wanted to know what our local maple syrup experts opinion was on what I had just eaten

16:19.360 --> 16:22.480
Okay, brent reviews the local syrup

16:23.840 --> 16:28.560
Okay, this is actually a very small mug of syrup presentation is top notch

16:29.520 --> 16:31.520
Fragrance is nice

16:32.000 --> 16:38.880
It's it's it's it seems a little more on the golden side than the that darn kirkland brand we had the other day

16:39.520 --> 16:41.520
ready

16:42.560 --> 16:44.720
Oh my god, okay, so

16:44.720 --> 16:47.360
It's definitely not maple syrup and uh

16:49.360 --> 16:51.360
What do I just eat

16:52.720 --> 16:54.720
It's like corn syrup or something

16:55.280 --> 16:58.480
With a tiny bit of maple in it perhaps but the texture is all wrong

16:59.280 --> 17:03.840
So that's my review with brent. I'm still trying to get that mouth feel out of here

17:03.840 --> 17:08.480
Like I just it was such a bad experience. I I kind of loathe that you put me through that

17:09.120 --> 17:11.280
I thought when I handed it over to him saying I'm not going to do that

17:11.280 --> 17:16.240
So you got to picture it. It's in a mini. Um, what are those mugs called brent like those, uh,

17:16.800 --> 17:20.560
Hmm, it's kind of like one of those mason jars with the handles on it. Yeah, it's a mason jar mug

17:20.560 --> 17:27.440
But it's a smaller one and it's filled with syrup. So they give you a ludicrous amount of syrup. It was just right

17:28.400 --> 17:34.640
Okay. All right canadian. So, uh, I put on the pancakes and I you know, I was hungry and I ate them all up

17:34.640 --> 17:36.640
And i'm like this syrup

17:36.640 --> 17:39.680
It's not so good. And it's not so good. It's not so good

17:39.680 --> 17:42.800
It's not so good. And I wanted to see what his take was

17:44.720 --> 17:47.360
And then you just kind of like tore into it you troll

17:48.560 --> 17:51.200
That was one of my highlights of the trip. So as you can imagine

17:51.760 --> 17:56.800
Um, i've had some fun with brent. We tell it all in office hours 13. So do check that out

18:00.240 --> 18:05.520
Lino dot com slash unplugged go there to get a hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account

18:05.520 --> 18:13.040
And it is a great way to support the show while checking out something awesome because linode is fast reliable cloud hosting with the best

18:13.040 --> 18:20.160
Support in the biz i'm talking about like real humans all day everyday humans that are right there fixing your problems on the first call

18:20.560 --> 18:25.840
Not like this multi-tiered weird support system where you got to start a chat with somebody and then like they can escalate you to a

18:25.840 --> 18:27.840
Phone call but then that person can't no

18:29.040 --> 18:30.480
No

18:30.480 --> 18:32.320
Linode has built their business differently

18:32.320 --> 18:36.580
So that way they can provide you great support while also continually investing in their infrastructure

18:37.980 --> 18:39.360
Linode

18:39.360 --> 18:44.240
Is gonna go crazy crazy. Linode is blowing out the doors and they're adding

18:44.480 --> 18:46.640
I think it's 11 more data centers or something like that

18:46.640 --> 18:50.480
So they got 11 data centers now and I think they're going to like 12 more additional data centers

18:51.440 --> 18:55.040
It's it's wild you guys linode is just really moving these days

18:55.680 --> 19:00.560
They invest back into their infrastructure and just make it better and better since i've been a customer

19:00.560 --> 19:04.480
I have seen mvme hard drives. I have seen new amd epic processors roll out

19:04.480 --> 19:09.760
I've seen upgrades to their infrastructure. I've seen new services come along like managed database services

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
I've seen improvements to their physical servers that you can deploy and of course

19:14.320 --> 19:18.240
I have begun to just use the absolute heck out of their s3 compatible object storage

19:18.720 --> 19:24.000
And they're 30 to 50 cheaper than the hyperscalers that just want to lock you into their crazy esoteric platforms

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
30 to 50 cheaper is no joke

19:26.640 --> 19:28.240
That adds up immediately

19:28.240 --> 19:33.120
And on top of that they got the best performance. That's not chris saying that's not brent sitting over there quietly saying that

19:34.000 --> 19:38.160
You go google it. It's been tested right right see brent's nodding. He knows

19:38.880 --> 19:44.080
He knows he knows and it's just got great features as well easy backups and so much more

19:44.320 --> 19:46.320
So go build something go learn something

19:46.800 --> 19:50.240
And try it for yourself and thank them for supporting us on this road trip, too

19:50.640 --> 19:52.640
Head over to linode.com

19:52.640 --> 19:58.480
Get that hunny dollars and 60 day credit on a new account, you know treat yourself. You deserve it and support the show

19:59.340 --> 20:01.340
linode.com

20:04.320 --> 20:07.840
We have a few things I want to tidy up around here before we get into the rest of the show

20:07.840 --> 20:13.520
We have one more meetup. I want to let you know about friday, october 7th in portland

20:13.600 --> 20:20.320
It's the last meetup of 2022's west coast tour. Come hang with us. We're we're at the brewery

20:20.320 --> 20:22.880
Um, which I cannot remember the name of at the moment

20:22.880 --> 20:26.640
But the details are at meetup.com slash jupiter broadcasting we'd love to see you there

20:26.640 --> 20:29.280
These meetups have been absolutely fantastic and it's the last one

20:30.000 --> 20:32.640
Then we're done talking about it. And if you're in that west coast crew

20:33.840 --> 20:40.640
Stick around you'll hear about future meetups there first bit.ly slash west coast crew for our matrix room migration brewing

20:40.800 --> 20:45.360
Thank you. Look at that west coming in with the hot facts right there migration brewing

20:45.920 --> 20:47.920
Very nice. Thank you west pain

20:47.920 --> 20:52.880
So check it out meetup.com slash jupiter broadcasting for all those details. We'd love to see you there

20:55.440 --> 20:58.880
And we got a baller boost into the show this week so we love getting to your boosts

20:59.040 --> 21:03.360
They're a great way to communicate with the show and the way to exchange a little value for value

21:03.600 --> 21:07.680
And we want to highlight the big boosts that come into the show every single week

21:08.240 --> 21:12.640
And ladies and gentlemen prepare yourselves because he's done it

21:13.360 --> 21:15.360
for a fifth week in a row

21:15.360 --> 21:20.080
John a is our big baller for linux unplugged this week

21:24.460 --> 21:31.520
Unbelievable sir unbelievable. He says, uh, yes, I uh, he because we pre-recorded so he got in on a technicality last week

21:31.520 --> 21:33.040
And he says yes, in fact

21:33.040 --> 21:38.400
That was an accident on my case, but I am more than fine with that. You guys have been on fire lately

21:39.040 --> 21:41.020
He sent in

21:41.020 --> 21:47.360
And one sats into the show this week. So we really appreciate that john. Thank you so much the big ballers

21:47.520 --> 21:51.200
Those are the moments when those come in you're like, okay, this gives me this gives me a little energy

21:51.200 --> 21:56.080
It's like a little hit of like dopamine. Yes. All right. Let's go. Let's keep working and boy. Did we need that?

21:56.640 --> 22:03.680
Today so john a thank you very very much. We appreciate that. Unfortunately, we were not able to stream live this week. So, um,

22:04.160 --> 22:08.160
We uh, we did have some tech issues. We weren't really I actually thought we weren't gonna have an episode

22:08.160 --> 22:12.400
I thought we weren't gonna have an episode then you see boosts like that come in. You're like no we got to keep going

22:12.960 --> 22:15.680
We got to do it. We got to do it for john out there

22:15.760 --> 22:17.200
So thank you very much john

22:17.200 --> 22:19.920
We appreciate it and we have more boosts that we'll get to later in the show

22:20.000 --> 22:23.220
If you'd like to send one and get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com

22:26.800 --> 22:33.440
So let's talk about how we ended up at the jet propulsion laboratory because I think not everyone is familiar with the story

22:33.440 --> 22:37.780
And it starts with a mutual love for linux, doesn't it with listeners?

22:38.560 --> 22:41.760
And brothers that listen to the show and work at jpl

22:42.400 --> 22:47.520
And we started talking with tim who was at the time like the mars helicopter operations leader

22:47.520 --> 22:53.360
I think he's I think he's had a title upgrade since then and we knew tim was a kindred spirit when we started talking

22:53.600 --> 22:55.840
Linux and solaris with him on the show

22:56.320 --> 23:01.280
So jpl for many years was a solaris house, right? You know when I came out of school

23:01.280 --> 23:09.200
Everybody wanted a big solaris workstation. Yep, you know the old spark workstations. They were pretty cool. They were cool

23:10.000 --> 23:15.600
And so I got you know, I kind of came up the you can call it the unix curve learning how to

23:16.320 --> 23:18.800
work on solaris and you know the

23:19.600 --> 23:22.320
the flight project side used solaris a lot

23:23.360 --> 23:24.480
and

23:24.480 --> 23:29.600
Prior to getting on curiosity, which is the the big rover that's still on mars and operating

23:29.600 --> 23:32.960
um, I had been on a project where we were doing a lot of

23:33.600 --> 23:35.680
software technology development and

23:36.560 --> 23:39.360
We could kind of see the writing on the wall that solaris was

23:40.560 --> 23:45.920
starting to decline in the marketplace, so we in our own project we went and started looking at alternatives and

23:47.040 --> 23:50.240
I just bought a pc made out of random parts

23:51.280 --> 23:53.360
You know just commodity parts at the time

23:54.160 --> 23:55.120
and

23:55.120 --> 23:57.120
loaded linux on it

23:57.120 --> 24:01.680
And took the software that we had on that project and compiled all that software on linux

24:02.160 --> 24:08.240
and it was kind of a somewhat comical moment because one of the senior engineers in the project had had gotten his

24:10.140 --> 24:12.140
$15,000 son solaris workstation

24:13.360 --> 24:15.440
That he you know, he wanted as a senior guy

24:16.160 --> 24:18.240
And we had the software compiling on both

24:19.520 --> 24:23.520
And I took my my little commodity level pc and compiled the software

24:23.520 --> 24:26.320
And and it compiled twice as fast

24:27.840 --> 24:31.120
And he just had this look of what do they waste all my money on?

24:31.440 --> 24:35.600
Yes, he just just just look came over his face like I can't believe that

24:36.080 --> 24:38.800
And he ended up pawning off the whole system to an intern and then went out

24:39.920 --> 24:41.200
It was kind of funny

24:41.200 --> 24:45.680
you know when we were talking with tim at the meetup the fat theme kind of came up over and over again about how

24:46.400 --> 24:52.320
things have flipped where jpl and nasa used to be seeding the technology that would then create the

24:52.320 --> 24:59.300
The consumer tech that we all used now things have flipped around and the consumer tech like snapdragon processors

24:59.760 --> 25:01.760
and lithium ion batteries

25:02.000 --> 25:07.440
And blades for drones and whatnot have become so good that they buy the consumer stuff and they can buy it cheaper

25:07.920 --> 25:11.840
And they can tinker with it easier and quicker. Yeah, I think on the on the tour

25:11.840 --> 25:17.360
We heard that back in the old days. They even made their own physical nuts and bolts. Yeah

25:17.360 --> 25:22.720
And it's like a 10x savings when they can buy it just from the market. It's a massive savings

25:22.720 --> 25:25.120
They said but also means they can prototype quicker

25:25.360 --> 25:30.960
And then the other thing that tim mentions later is that you know, it also means that they can find people who already know this stuff

25:31.600 --> 25:36.960
So just having that relationship with tim was great because of what they're working on and that linux copter that they've built

25:37.040 --> 25:39.040
That has just been so incredible and really become

25:39.440 --> 25:46.560
Probably a real future part of all mars exploration that has a rover. I mean just incredible to watch that history and so tim

25:46.560 --> 25:49.920
Tim started chatting with us. He said, you know, I think I could probably arrange

25:51.200 --> 25:56.400
A little bit of a tour for you and some of the listeners if you're interested like well, yeah. Okay. We're interested

25:56.480 --> 26:00.400
Are we not interested? Come on? Yeah, of course we are and so then it was just a matter

26:00.800 --> 26:02.160
Well, how do we get down there?

26:02.160 --> 26:06.560
And so that's when I started talking to linode and I said, hey, what do you think about doing another road trip this year?

26:06.880 --> 26:10.480
We could do a series of meetups and then we get down to jpl and we could do a tour of jpl

26:10.640 --> 26:12.880
And they don't said well, how are we gonna make money on that?

26:12.880 --> 26:17.040
No, they didn't say that they said of course. They said that'd be great. We'd love to support you in the community doing that

26:17.360 --> 26:22.320
and so they worked with us to make it possible to get down here and do this and

26:22.720 --> 26:27.360
I'm telling you guys even as we were walking up to the entrance of the jet propulsion laboratory

26:27.840 --> 26:29.840
It just wasn't feeling

26:30.320 --> 26:32.320
Real until we came around the corner

26:32.960 --> 26:34.960
And we saw everybody there

26:36.160 --> 26:39.760
Hello, sir, good to see you again. Hello. Hello. Hello

26:39.760 --> 26:41.600
Hello

26:41.600 --> 26:45.780
Hello. Hello. Hello everybody. Hello. Welcome to jpl

26:46.880 --> 26:48.960
It's real it's actually happening

26:49.920 --> 26:51.920
And you're all early good job

26:52.320 --> 26:53.600
now we'll just uh

26:53.600 --> 26:57.840
Take over the place because I think we got the numbers. So I see a bsd shirt. Yeah

26:59.040 --> 27:01.040
You're gonna be our frontline guy

27:01.680 --> 27:06.400
How about everybody showing up on time? How great is that? I mean we were on time and I felt late

27:06.400 --> 27:08.080
Right

27:08.080 --> 27:12.080
So, what'd you guys think of the tour wes I didn't capture your thoughts much afterwards

27:12.160 --> 27:15.840
So i'm curious to know your overall take on the tour and if anything surprised you

27:16.320 --> 27:19.600
I was really quite impressed with our tour guide, you know, he he um

27:20.240 --> 27:22.480
Not only related a crazy amount of information

27:22.480 --> 27:26.880
but I think I think did a pretty good job of bridging the gap because you know, you gotta have

27:27.600 --> 27:33.380
You know much like doing podcasts sometimes you gotta be able to accommodate all kinds of different knowledge levels and backgrounds

27:33.380 --> 27:36.500
And even as a science and space nerd myself

27:36.580 --> 27:41.220
I felt like I was getting lots of little tidbits to hang on but it also seemed like like he did a good job

27:41.380 --> 27:46.740
You know engaging some other folks. I'm thinking partially here of of your wife adia here chris in you know

27:46.820 --> 27:52.900
Being interested in the crazy stuff going on in space, even if it feels very far away sometimes I appreciated too that

27:53.460 --> 27:55.060
Especially with our crew that was there

27:55.060 --> 28:00.580
You could throw a few of the technical questions at the tour guide and he had answers for like 99 of them

28:00.580 --> 28:08.180
And which was really really impressive because we do have the best nerds in our audience and they geek out on this stuff

28:08.580 --> 28:16.120
Oh jpl was awesome. Uh, I I really enjoyed seeing the cassini space probe and all the other space probe models in the auditorium

28:16.500 --> 28:18.420
uh, but uh

28:18.420 --> 28:20.580
since I I mentioned galileo before

28:21.140 --> 28:25.540
I I was really happy. They built the entire museum around the galileo ground model

28:25.540 --> 28:31.460
And that they left the high gain antenna deployed in its undeployed arrangement just like in real life

28:32.260 --> 28:35.860
Nice, and then uh, how was it to see the control room because we weren't sure we were going to see that

28:36.420 --> 28:39.620
Oh getting into where the magic happens

28:40.340 --> 28:44.740
It was incredible and i'm glad I was able to sneak a couple peanuts out of one of those tubes, too

28:46.020 --> 28:51.780
Sneaking the peanuts the control room was great. Hey, did either of you get any peanuts? No, I didn't even think of that

28:51.780 --> 28:59.220
Oh, oh, well, I did I was oh really? Yeah. Oh, man. I was so focused on not touching any buttons

29:00.180 --> 29:04.420
Yeah, I sat next to you and it was I mean you did touch a few that you just touched them really lightly

29:04.660 --> 29:09.700
Yeah, and I actually caught my hand once reaching out on its own. But seriously that was that was amazing

29:09.780 --> 29:15.300
I mean i've i've watched so many streams, you know and seen images on the internet of that control room

29:15.300 --> 29:21.720
I reckon, you know, you recognize the little details and to be to be set physically there and watching the little animations

29:21.940 --> 29:23.940
But they're not for show right? Like sure

29:23.940 --> 29:27.060
I mean they're a little for show because they're on big tv screens, but that it's real data

29:27.140 --> 29:33.540
We could see in real time. Like what's the transmission bit bit rate across the deep space network to these probes out in the universe?

29:34.100 --> 29:36.100
i'm, just pausing for a moment because

29:36.820 --> 29:40.420
You're right wes like I I the whole time felt surreal for me

29:40.980 --> 29:42.820
and I

29:42.820 --> 29:44.340
at a few moments

29:44.340 --> 29:50.340
Tried to ground myself and be like wait, but wait, this is actually happening for us. We're in these places that we've

29:50.980 --> 29:53.300
only seen on tv or dreamt of and

29:53.940 --> 29:54.900
uh

29:54.900 --> 29:56.900
That's what stood out for me was

29:56.980 --> 30:00.980
You know everybody who was on the tour with us was super invested in the experience

30:01.620 --> 30:06.740
Super respectful of everyone who was there trying to work really hard. You know, we got into some places that

30:07.380 --> 30:12.180
People were actually working and we were trying to like just shimmy around them while they're working and take photos quietly

30:12.180 --> 30:14.180
and so that we weren't disturbing them and

30:15.140 --> 30:17.140
I I think that's what stood out for me is like

30:17.460 --> 30:21.780
We got an amazing audience who really took everything in and appreciated every bit of it

30:22.340 --> 30:28.840
Yeah, and the other thing that was a lot of fun from a technologist standpoint is just watching the eras of technology

30:29.380 --> 30:33.700
When you go in there you see like oh that was clearly state-of-the-art in the late 70s

30:33.780 --> 30:39.860
And this is the mid 80s and here's the 90s and here's the early aughts and you can see that with everything from like the storage

30:39.860 --> 30:43.700
medium to the operating systems and how the operating systems could get more complex and

30:44.660 --> 30:49.060
That all is extremely fascinating and hearing too about how they're now they're struggling with

30:49.060 --> 30:52.740
Well, we deployed this up into space with an ubuntu 1604 base

30:53.140 --> 30:56.580
And now we can't get modern software to build on an ubuntu 1604 base

30:56.580 --> 31:01.540
but we still need to reproduce production and so they're like discovering kind of

31:02.100 --> 31:06.660
linux specific challenges in a way and hearing a little bit about that was

31:06.660 --> 31:10.740
Um enlightening, you know, these are the real problems that they face out there in the world

31:11.140 --> 31:15.860
It was such a great tour. Unfortunately, they weren't very cool with us recording the tour

31:16.180 --> 31:22.100
They were not okay with any kind of press or professional gear or anything like that

31:22.180 --> 31:26.260
So we did our tour and then we had to say our goodbyes and do the swag giveaway thing

31:27.140 --> 31:29.940
Well, thank you guys for all making it. This is a lot of fun

31:30.260 --> 31:34.980
Okay, so we do have some great swag provided by linode got to tell the lady your t-shirt size

31:34.980 --> 31:37.300
They run a tad small

31:38.420 --> 31:40.180
Not atrociously

31:40.180 --> 31:45.700
But yeah, just a tad nothing too bad. We got updated shirts this year and you know brand's going on right now

31:45.780 --> 31:47.460
Yeah, it's actually really comfortable. I like this

31:47.460 --> 31:52.740
We wanted to get alex's thoughts too from self-hosted because he was able to join us and is also a big space nerd

31:53.220 --> 31:55.220
I think i'm just struck by the fact

31:55.620 --> 31:57.300
of how amazing

31:57.300 --> 32:04.740
This whole experience has been the audience that turned up were fantastic. You know, all interesting people all had stories

32:05.620 --> 32:08.340
Some had driven 25 hours to come and see us

32:09.300 --> 32:11.300
Uh and take the tour too

32:11.380 --> 32:15.860
And I couldn't believe some of the cool stuff. We got to see like the clean room. We actually got to see

32:16.740 --> 32:21.300
The next europa satellite or the next europa mission that's about to happen

32:22.100 --> 32:24.100
uh, we got to see

32:24.100 --> 32:26.900
There was this really cool picture paint by numbers

32:27.780 --> 32:33.140
Picture of a the first image from mars and I used to have that in a textbook from when I was a child

32:33.780 --> 32:36.980
And I got to see it in person. My mind is still processing that

32:37.780 --> 32:39.780
So huge. Thanks to tim

32:39.860 --> 32:41.460
Chris hadia

32:41.460 --> 32:43.460
Everybody at jb that made this happen

32:44.260 --> 32:49.220
But from personal perspective, it was super cool, but I know from talking to several of the audience members as well

32:49.860 --> 32:51.380
That they had a blast as well

32:51.380 --> 32:56.900
Alex probably would have joined us on the show today, but he's flying back home. So he captured that in the airport for us

32:57.460 --> 33:04.340
So we had the jpl tour. It was absolutely fantastic. And then a lot of that crew plus a whole bunch more people

33:04.900 --> 33:06.740
Joined us the next day

33:06.740 --> 33:13.780
For a big meetup at the congregation brewing ale house right here in pasadena. Hi, we're here at the meetup

33:13.940 --> 33:20.900
Uh just after our jpl tour yesterday and uh, there's a bunch of ton of great people here. So, um, hello

33:20.900 --> 33:26.900
How are you both? I'm doing great, man. And uh, tell me your names. Uh, i'm zack. I'm alex

33:27.380 --> 33:31.780
Hello. Hello, and I uh gleaned from our conversation that you've come a long way

33:32.660 --> 33:36.020
Yes, we came from central arkansas in little rock area

33:36.580 --> 33:38.580
That's amazing. And how long did that take?

33:38.580 --> 33:44.900
Uh, so we did it over two days. It's a 24-hour drive. Uh, we left saturday morning. We finally got to la monday

33:45.540 --> 33:46.900
Isn't that something?

33:46.900 --> 33:51.140
You know chris i'm realizing that you and I are not the only ones on a crazy road trip, right?

33:51.460 --> 33:54.660
The audience is definitely making their own road trip to feel like they're here with us

33:54.740 --> 34:00.820
I believe listener optimus gray did about a 24 25 hour one-way drive himself and uh,

34:01.140 --> 34:06.020
Listener steve came from wyoming just to hear people talk about linux. My name is stephen ing

34:06.660 --> 34:12.020
And i'm from lander wyoming and I yeah, I first went to the salt lake city meetup

34:12.500 --> 34:14.260
I happened to be in southern california

34:14.260 --> 34:19.300
So I thought I'd join you guys here and it's really cool, you know, it's a lot of fun to be among

34:20.740 --> 34:24.180
I consider you all to be friends and colleagues because

34:25.300 --> 34:29.380
I don't have friends outside this world who are into things like linux

34:30.340 --> 34:32.340
They kind of look at me with that kind of

34:33.460 --> 34:35.460
Scared stare, you know what I mean?

34:36.260 --> 34:42.420
Well, thanks for coming all this way. Um, tell me something you hate about linux and what you love the most about linux

34:42.420 --> 34:43.780
It's a vibrant bypass

34:43.780 --> 34:50.420
The one thing I hate about linux is that it is so complex and it's so many pieces all over the place

34:51.060 --> 34:54.420
And that's also the thing I like about it because there's just so much there

34:55.380 --> 34:58.340
It's funny how often we got that answer. We asked people that a lot

34:59.040 --> 35:01.220
complexity, uh number of choice

35:01.940 --> 35:03.060
Uh too many options

35:03.060 --> 35:05.620
It was the thing that was the number one thing they hated and the number one thing

35:05.620 --> 35:09.140
They loved people really like a lot of different packaging formats. It turns out

35:09.140 --> 35:11.140
Yeah

35:11.940 --> 35:13.940
Everybody had thoughts on that too

35:14.100 --> 35:18.340
And you know when you're doing a trip like this and you're doing the meetups and you're you're doing these tours and all that

35:18.340 --> 35:22.100
Kind of stuff. There's so many logistics so many and just to give you a taste

35:22.340 --> 35:27.460
one of the many things that has to be solved is somebody has to watch levi the podcast dog like

35:27.780 --> 35:31.700
You can't go to jpl. And while he could go to the meetup, it's probably not ideal

35:31.700 --> 35:38.500
Yeah, my wife and I watched uh, levi during the jpl tour yesterday. This is listener tim

35:39.140 --> 35:41.940
my wife is watching levi right now during the uh,

35:42.820 --> 35:44.260
the meetup

35:44.260 --> 35:47.540
Well, thank you for that. I mean I heard he had a really great time

35:47.700 --> 35:50.020
So he was talking all about it when he got home yesterday

35:50.740 --> 35:53.860
Yeah, it was fun. We enjoyed levi as a wonderful dog

35:54.500 --> 35:56.500
very very chill

35:56.500 --> 36:02.100
And made made himself right at home. That sounds like levi. Yeah. Well, it must mean they don't have any squirrels over there

36:02.580 --> 36:04.580
Right, and they're probably not podcasting

36:04.980 --> 36:09.940
Long-time listener eric who made it to the meetup also attended the jpl tour and we wanted to get his thoughts

36:10.260 --> 36:14.740
It was epic. Um, it was really good like as someone that doesn't follow

36:15.300 --> 36:17.700
nasa or jpl too closely

36:18.260 --> 36:21.860
Um, I was a little bit, you know, like oh, this is gonna be too much

36:21.860 --> 36:27.060
But I knew it was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime and I really I loved it

36:27.060 --> 36:28.820
I loved every minute and as we talked to him

36:28.820 --> 36:32.900
It's like stuff really stuck like stuff. He never knew it really registered with him

36:32.900 --> 36:37.140
And I I think listener eric is slowly turning into a big space nerd now

36:37.220 --> 36:40.260
I don't think he knew too much about it beforehand and it really stuck with him

36:40.420 --> 36:44.580
And I think he's going to be geeking out a whole bunch. This was a pretty fun meetup

36:44.660 --> 36:47.140
We were there for at least five and a half hours

36:47.140 --> 36:53.460
We had so many people come and go we had food we had drink and tim who helped set all this up at jpl

36:53.700 --> 36:58.260
And has you know just been like our tour guide to linux in space

36:58.340 --> 37:00.980
He made it to the meetup as well and he sat down with brent

37:01.380 --> 37:05.940
It's been a great time. It's been great to meet everybody and the hosts and all the other people that come along because

37:06.340 --> 37:08.340
we're all engineers and and uh

37:08.980 --> 37:12.420
Computer geeks and we love space. So it's been a great time to meet everybody great

37:12.420 --> 37:16.340
I saw uh, you brought a little something that you've been showing people. Are you allowed to talk about that?

37:16.340 --> 37:22.760
Yeah, sure. I brought an example of the processor or one of the processors that's on the ingenuity mars helicopter

37:23.300 --> 37:25.300
And it's a tiny little helicopter

37:25.860 --> 37:28.420
Computer it's about the size of a match book box

37:28.820 --> 37:33.220
And it's great to show everybody the kind of computer that we're flying and how small it is something

37:33.220 --> 37:36.420
They could just take a look at yeah previously on linux unplug

37:36.420 --> 37:42.500
We've talked about these things but seeing the scale of it and some of the stories you've been telling about batteries and stuff is

37:42.900 --> 37:44.900
kind of incredible actually

37:44.900 --> 37:49.860
It's incredible, but it's also concepts people can understand right there were people here who did drone development

37:50.260 --> 37:53.620
And they looked at the board and they said hey, that's almost identical to the board

37:53.620 --> 37:58.020
I use and yeah, I understand you're using these sony batteries that i've used before and

37:58.580 --> 38:03.300
Using these sensors and things and you're managing, you know software so I get it

38:03.380 --> 38:05.700
So it's it's the same time. It's exotic

38:05.700 --> 38:11.860
But it's also approachable that a lot of people here who've worked in the industry and or just as hobbyists could understand it

38:11.860 --> 38:15.140
Yeah, is it nice for you to see people out in the world?

38:15.540 --> 38:19.540
Who understand the concepts that you deal with on a daily basis kind of back at work?

38:20.020 --> 38:24.580
Yeah, it's nice to talk to people who understand some of the concepts because often with you know

38:24.580 --> 38:26.580
Being an engineer some of the family and friends

38:26.820 --> 38:30.280
They just kind of stare at you blankly when you try to when you try to explain the technology

38:31.140 --> 38:34.100
And whereas with this crowd they're like, oh, yeah. Yeah, I understand

38:34.100 --> 38:40.020
that's you know, that's linux and you do these kinds of things in linux and you know, that's flash memory and it's

38:40.020 --> 38:45.380
It's running a computer an arm processor. That's like the raspberry pi and so on and so forth

38:45.460 --> 38:48.740
So they get it and they can relate it to things they've done in their own career

38:48.740 --> 38:51.460
So it's in many ways easier to explain it to that crowd

38:52.180 --> 38:54.340
These meetups that we do, you know

38:54.340 --> 38:59.700
We've done a few of them now and it's always a treat because you learn something new you meet people who have these

39:00.020 --> 39:03.140
Wild backgrounds and you know having you here is a special treat

39:03.220 --> 39:08.420
But actually every single one of them is is great to talk to you as well. Yeah, absolutely. It's it's not like i'm some

39:08.420 --> 39:13.540
A special person i'm just a somebody who grew up probably similar to many of the people here

39:13.940 --> 39:16.900
I was just fortunate enough to get a cool job at a place like jpl

39:17.540 --> 39:20.340
And apply the skills that I learned and you know, I always

39:21.060 --> 39:23.060
Take time to step back and just realize

39:24.180 --> 39:30.180
Even though i'm an ordinary person. I've really had a chance to have an extraordinary career at a place like jpl

39:30.260 --> 39:33.780
But you know all these people too have their own special niche

39:33.780 --> 39:39.060
Where they've learned something and they've had fun doing it and they they're enthusiastic about it. That's why they're

39:39.860 --> 39:43.780
Listening to the podcast and coming to events like this because they just enjoy it

39:44.660 --> 39:49.860
Okay, tim i've been asking a few questions of almost everyone. So, uh, hopefully you're ready for this one

39:50.500 --> 39:55.300
The question is what do you hate the most about linux and what do you love the most about linux?

39:56.500 --> 39:59.860
What I love about it is it's a really nice

39:59.860 --> 40:06.420
Stable environment to do software development in it's one of the reasons we picked it for the helicopter. It's very stable

40:06.980 --> 40:08.100
So that part I like about it

40:08.100 --> 40:10.820
I've been living in that world for a long time doing software development

40:11.380 --> 40:16.340
And compared to an environment like windows where you're just it feels like you're always forcing yourself to do

40:17.280 --> 40:22.020
Unnatural ways to do things but linux just has a smoothness to the the whole development

40:22.720 --> 40:26.740
Environment and you know all these tools especially open source you can take advantage of

40:26.740 --> 40:29.860
I think the thing that is the most frustrating is that

40:30.740 --> 40:32.100
even though it

40:32.100 --> 40:39.460
Is in its core really stable a lot of the user facing features just seem fragile at times you try to configure a program

40:39.540 --> 40:43.780
You know or a desktop or try to set up a video card

40:44.340 --> 40:48.660
Or something like that and things just break with mysterious errors and you just don't know why

40:49.460 --> 40:50.660
And so I think

40:50.660 --> 40:54.900
You know, you live with the good and you live with the bad right you live with the nice parts and live with awards

40:54.900 --> 40:56.900
You just got to know how to

40:56.900 --> 41:01.960
How to manage a system like that and use it for its strengths. Yeah, you were talking about using 1604

41:02.580 --> 41:03.380
and uh

41:03.380 --> 41:07.140
Just trying to port a few gooey's and that's actually some of the some of the worst stuff

41:07.220 --> 41:11.060
You're dealing with because it's just super annoying and you want to move to more modern stuff

41:11.300 --> 41:15.860
And uh, that was interesting to hear you talk about that. Yeah, we just had to reconstruct an older environment

41:16.500 --> 41:21.220
And a lot of the hardware has moved on a lot of the software has moved on so kind of rewinding back to that era

41:21.220 --> 41:27.620
You know 1604 would be 20 2016 which is an eternity for something like linux

41:28.260 --> 41:32.580
But having to do that and trying to reconstruct this environment was tripping me up

41:33.220 --> 41:36.980
And so I was gnashing my teeth a little bit trying to do that. But you know

41:37.700 --> 41:41.060
It's still on the on the sum. It's it's a great environment to work with

41:42.180 --> 41:48.500
Uh tim, thank you a for inviting us to jpo and we had an amazing tour yesterday

41:48.500 --> 41:51.540
I know you wanted to join us on the tour, but you didn't quite get a chance

41:51.540 --> 41:53.540
But you were there for a little bit. So thank you for that

41:54.020 --> 41:54.580
You're welcome

41:54.580 --> 41:57.140
And I always love to meet up with people who are kindred spirits

41:57.460 --> 42:00.500
And i'm glad that the group was able to get together and have a really good time

42:01.060 --> 42:05.380
Exploring a place that i've really loved to work at over the years nice and also

42:05.780 --> 42:08.980
Thanks for coming to the meetup as well. I mean, it's been a real treat to have you here

42:09.460 --> 42:16.340
Yeah, it's nice to just kind of sit back and relax. Enjoy the crowd. Enjoy the food and just talk about life

42:16.340 --> 42:20.260
Even apart from technical issues. It's been a great group. Hey, well, thank you

42:20.820 --> 42:21.700
You're welcome

42:21.700 --> 42:25.860
And we really can't say thank you enough because it just gave us a great opportunity for us to come together as a team

42:25.940 --> 42:28.420
And it gave us a great opportunity to do something that will

42:29.220 --> 42:31.620
Last with us forever, right? We created some great memories there

42:32.020 --> 42:37.300
Yeah, and I feel like some great friendships too. Tim has already invited us back. He said anytime you're back. Say hi

42:38.580 --> 42:41.860
Maybe the airbnb could have been a little better. Uh, that was a funky airbnb

42:41.940 --> 42:45.700
We stayed at but I guess it had some gems and it had some rough edges

42:45.700 --> 42:51.060
You're just mad because you started a greets fire. There was the grease fire. I blame barbecue maintenance on that one

42:51.140 --> 42:52.500
I don't blame that on me

42:52.500 --> 42:56.420
Uh, I I am grateful for the star trek the next generation live stream that played the entire time

42:56.500 --> 43:01.300
We were there we made it through 94 episodes of star trek the next generation and we didn't even plan that

43:01.540 --> 43:03.540
No when we walked through the door

43:03.700 --> 43:10.340
Episode one of season one just happened to be playing on the television and when we went out the door cupid was playing

43:10.500 --> 43:13.400
Um, we didn't see all of them obviously because we had to go to bed sometimes

43:13.400 --> 43:15.400
Wesson I tried. Yeah

43:17.480 --> 43:22.440
You got to a lot of them, this is good memories it's good time and it's so exciting to see uh

43:23.000 --> 43:29.800
linux and all of this technology coming together at a point that makes it approachable and accessible for these kinds of missions and then they're

43:29.940 --> 43:35.560
Performing and exceeding expectations like for example those little sony batteries that tim mentioned there

43:35.880 --> 43:40.120
They're holding up in the deeply deeply deeply cold martian winter

43:40.120 --> 43:47.000
Uh, the way tim put it is the lithium batteries are turning into battery cycles every single night and they were paranoid

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
They were they were absolutely afraid that that would destroy the batteries, but they're holding up

43:51.080 --> 43:56.760
It's making it and the linux little copter just had its 33rd flight recently. I mean we've got one planet down

43:57.320 --> 43:59.320
How many more to go for linux, right?

44:01.880 --> 44:07.400
Bit warden dot com slash linux go sign up for yourself or an enterprise account go try it and you know

44:07.400 --> 44:13.480
October is cyber security awareness month and bit warden would like to remind everyone about key actions that the federal agency for cyber

44:13.480 --> 44:21.240
Security recommends that you take and it starts with what I always say use strong passwords bit warden can generate and store strong passwords for you

44:21.560 --> 44:26.200
Enable multi-factor authentication on all your accounts including your password manager

44:26.760 --> 44:29.160
They also recommend that you keep your software up to date

44:29.720 --> 44:32.600
And take steps to recognize and report phishing as well

44:32.600 --> 44:36.920
Remember weaker stolen passwords represent the majority of successful hacking attacks

44:37.240 --> 44:42.360
Using a strong unique password for every account protects you and your business from these attacks

44:42.840 --> 44:50.920
Bit warden can create save and auto fill passwords for you and multi-factor authentication. That's the easiest way to add extra security to your accounts

44:51.480 --> 44:55.960
Enabling two-step login on bit warden improves the security of your password vaults

44:56.200 --> 45:01.240
And there's options like verification through email or an authenticator app that's available for all your accounts

45:01.240 --> 45:04.600
Fido 2 or yubikey odp if you're a premium subscriber

45:05.160 --> 45:10.360
Premium subscribers can also have bit warden generate time-based one-time password authentication codes for your accounts

45:10.600 --> 45:17.960
Adding strength to your passwords and bit warden supports security for all with fully featured free accounts available to everyone

45:18.200 --> 45:24.040
This cyber security awareness month protect yourself and help protect loved ones by educating them about password security

45:24.440 --> 45:26.440
And by starting up a free bit warden account today

45:26.440 --> 45:33.580
So get started today at bit warden.com slash linux. That's bit warden.com slash linux

45:36.680 --> 45:40.680
As always we got some great feedback this week, so thank you very much for sending some in

45:41.240 --> 45:44.700
Sid wrote us about some photo adventures

45:45.000 --> 45:49.160
Sid writes I wanted to add to the discussion around replacing google photos

45:49.320 --> 45:53.400
I've been using image since last week when you mentioned it and it's been working great for me

45:53.400 --> 46:00.200
Regarding storage though. I've written software on top of storage and I plan to use it for automatic off-site backups

46:00.280 --> 46:02.440
Using something like duplicati or restic

46:03.160 --> 46:08.440
However, I found that their documentation is pretty bad and overall it was a headache to implement

46:08.760 --> 46:15.560
I would not recommend it for anything sensitive and I feel like you should definitely use encryption on your end if you're using it

46:15.880 --> 46:20.360
Yeah, I agree on that. It sounds like sid is still pushing ahead with using storage

46:20.360 --> 46:24.840
So it knows those weren't enough of a deal breaker. Yeah, isn't that interesting? I am too

46:25.160 --> 46:29.160
And I think the documentation point that depends on what you're looking for, right?

46:29.160 --> 46:31.880
Like I found pretty good documentation on getting duplicati configured

46:32.200 --> 46:34.920
But I could see if I was trying to write an app that lives on top of storage

46:34.920 --> 46:36.920
Maybe I wouldn't be as happy

46:37.320 --> 46:42.760
And then you got to figure it's kind of early days too in regards to image. I am m I ch which is a google photos alternative

46:43.320 --> 46:46.680
Also early days what I love about image is that it has a local app

46:46.680 --> 46:50.440
So it'll run on your phone and uploads to the server. That's great. It's got a nice ui nice

46:50.920 --> 46:55.320
But it doesn't have all the classifications and search features that something like photoprism has right now

46:55.960 --> 47:01.800
So um in my book photoprism is the further along solution for the problem that needs a solution today

47:02.440 --> 47:05.980
But uh, I am definitely keeping an eye on image and I have a suspicion

47:06.520 --> 47:10.280
That we will do future coverage of image on the self-hosted program

47:10.680 --> 47:14.780
If you'd like to hear more we did talk about some of chris's early investigations

47:14.780 --> 47:21.820
Into some of this photo syncing in a linux unplugged episode 476. Yeah, and shout out to listener tony

47:22.540 --> 47:28.860
Uh, they stayed up to the double up and watched it on jupiter.tube last week. Wow. That was a five hour live stream

47:29.900 --> 47:31.100
so

47:31.100 --> 47:35.180
That is very impressive. I have to say I don't know. I don't think I could watch it

47:35.260 --> 47:37.260
I don't even know how we did it to tell you the truth

47:37.260 --> 47:44.780
I don't even know how we did it to tell you the truth. I don't even know have we mentioned that we have the best listeners?

47:44.780 --> 47:47.580
And now it is time for the boost

47:48.060 --> 47:50.060
Speaking of those best listeners listener

47:50.140 --> 47:55.660
Michael b boosted him with 3000 sats and said I was just listening to your chat about package managers and I wanted to share something

47:56.060 --> 48:01.820
I just recently switched from ubuntu to fedora and now due to work and other reasons. I ended up with four

48:02.600 --> 48:03.660
different

48:03.660 --> 48:08.540
Package managers i've got dnf flatback homebrew and snaps

48:09.100 --> 48:11.340
I admit that sounds crazy, but so far

48:12.060 --> 48:14.380
It's all working without issue. Thanks for the great show

48:15.020 --> 48:18.860
Michael, okay. Now we tell michael about next so we can get to lucky number five

48:19.800 --> 48:24.620
Exactly. There's also pip that can come in handy. Oh, he probably has that he probably does have pip installed

48:24.620 --> 48:26.620
He's just probably not using it very often

48:26.860 --> 48:32.060
I mean michael, I think you could add a couple more to that list. Um, is that a problem or is it a gift?

48:32.060 --> 48:35.740
You tell me because according to our listeners at the meetups is the thing they love the most

48:36.220 --> 48:38.220
And the thing they hate the most so

48:39.020 --> 48:40.940
I don't know what that tells us

48:40.940 --> 48:43.180
Gene being boosted with 2048 sats

48:44.380 --> 48:47.900
Hey chris, if you edit a synced photo on your internet phone

48:48.300 --> 48:53.260
Does that updated image get pushed to your server? Remember reminder i'm using photosync with photoprism

48:53.580 --> 48:55.900
He says for example say all your photos are synced up

48:56.140 --> 48:59.580
Then you decide to crop a picture from full size to a square on the phone

48:59.580 --> 49:05.020
Does that one on your server also now appear cropped? If not, how would you deal with this?

49:05.340 --> 49:10.220
I ask because a lot of my post processing I do as an amateur on my phone

49:11.100 --> 49:14.460
Great question, you know, i've noticed doing this on android

49:15.500 --> 49:23.260
In a variety of different apps that it typically saves a duplicate photograph with the very similar name maybe an extra

49:23.900 --> 49:27.180
Prefix or suffix that means that you just have two files

49:27.180 --> 49:31.420
You have the original and now you have the crop version and I would assume that both of those would get synced

49:31.580 --> 49:35.900
Yeah, I think it would on android. I think on the internet phone. They do like a layered thing of revisions

49:36.380 --> 49:38.380
And so when you crop a photo

49:39.320 --> 49:45.420
Photosync and this is a photosync issue doesn't necessarily see it as a new photo if you saved as a copy it would

49:45.980 --> 49:50.300
But if you crop the original photosync is like what there's no changes. What's the big deal?

49:50.460 --> 49:54.860
Oh, so it doesn't even sync the edit rather than the edits wiping out the original. You just don't get the edit

49:54.860 --> 49:57.180
Yeah, it doesn't see it as a new file as far as I can tell on the iphone

49:57.260 --> 50:01.420
I think it would on android, but if I tap it and manually sync that file

50:02.220 --> 50:05.900
Then it updates on photoprism just fine. It overwrites the one in photoprism the way you'd expect

50:06.620 --> 50:09.420
So i'm going to play around a little bit more with that even these kinds of things

50:09.420 --> 50:12.860
I'm fine with working these out because not only is there all the issue with google

50:13.580 --> 50:15.180
And the things that we talked about recently

50:15.180 --> 50:18.700
But just after we recorded our episode about getting rid of google photos

50:18.780 --> 50:23.820
It turned out that google photos was messing up old backed up images for some users like way back in their archive

50:23.820 --> 50:27.980
and people's images were getting screwed up and they've been rolling out a fix, but

50:28.860 --> 50:32.460
I mean, I just think it's just time to get off google photos and I think that just sort of underscored it

50:33.160 --> 50:35.500
Agreed, we're gonna have a big land this week

50:35.500 --> 50:41.500
So next cloud introduced a new photo feature that I think we got to dig into and try it before this week's land

50:41.820 --> 50:45.020
Because that could be another option could be we'll see

50:45.820 --> 50:50.220
In the meantime sky push boosted in with 1000 sets

50:50.220 --> 50:54.940
I've been running calyx for about a year now after the privacy bug bit

50:55.500 --> 50:58.880
I wanted something that straddled privacy and stock functionality

50:59.580 --> 51:06.300
The majority of my apps come from f-troid while aurora store anonymizes the two proprietary ones. I still need

51:07.100 --> 51:11.900
Calyx is kind of perfect for my use case and clock's creepy uncle google

51:12.460 --> 51:16.540
I commend the devs and at this point we'll never go back

51:16.540 --> 51:22.460
So the number one thing i've heard since i've installed graphene os on my pixel is that I should try out calyx

51:22.620 --> 51:26.060
I had to tell you it's something you know, this happens every time I do an android rom

51:26.380 --> 51:28.860
Whatever rom I didn't try is the one I hear about a whole bunch

51:28.940 --> 51:30.940
Have you heard about stock bro?

51:30.940 --> 51:35.340
At the meetup a lot of people liked calyx again a lot and what i've kind of pieced together

51:35.340 --> 51:37.420
I don't know if this is true or not because i'm new to all this but

51:37.820 --> 51:40.940
It seems like calyx is really popular with the linux community

51:41.020 --> 51:44.460
And it seems like graphene os is really popular with the security community

51:44.460 --> 51:49.340
And i'm kind of going more for the security angle of things and the one thing that graphene os

51:49.740 --> 51:54.060
Has going for it that seems super appealing to me is you can install via their tool

51:54.700 --> 51:56.220
google play

51:56.220 --> 51:59.900
And the play services in a sandbox and then you can restrict

52:00.680 --> 52:06.780
everything the play and uh services can get to and you can run apps that require the play api

52:07.580 --> 52:11.180
Or are only available in the play store or the new one I discovered is a pain in the butt

52:11.180 --> 52:16.700
To require in-app purchases and sometimes then require the play store with graphene os

52:16.940 --> 52:20.700
You can sandbox all of that stuff and that is so appealing to me

52:20.860 --> 52:22.860
So i'd be curious to know what people think about that

52:23.020 --> 52:26.700
What they think about the quality of the sandboxing and how that compares to what calyx offers

52:26.860 --> 52:32.160
Well on that subject bond boosted in with one thousand two hundred and thirty four satoshis

52:32.160 --> 52:39.520
Former iphone user here turned calyx os user for about one and a half years now, and i'm loving it

52:40.560 --> 52:44.000
calyx makes google camera available in the aurora store, but

52:44.800 --> 52:48.800
Turn off network access to it and don't allow any permissions before you open it

52:49.280 --> 52:53.680
Then you get the best phone camera available without the google access

52:54.080 --> 53:00.000
That sounds like a really nice trick and actually fairly simple. Yeah, no sandbox required. It sounds like yeah, but again with

53:00.000 --> 53:04.320
Graphene os. I just installed the play store and I can just get the google camera and it all works pretty well

53:04.320 --> 53:07.600
And now the google google camera is also sandboxed and limited on what it can do

53:08.160 --> 53:10.880
I like it. I like it a lot, but i'm i'm open

53:10.960 --> 53:16.960
I'm i've heard a lot of good things about calyx. Well, we've got a little more for you then four-legged emu boosted in with

53:17.260 --> 53:22.320
3000 sets coming in hot with the boost calyx os is worth looking at for your pixel

53:22.480 --> 53:25.680
I haven't tried graphene, but i'm very happy with calyx

53:25.680 --> 53:29.280
And uh frozier boosts in with 5000 sets

53:30.880 --> 53:34.880
A little representation here because frozier is a three-year graphene os user

53:35.440 --> 53:41.200
Everything works perfectly no paper cuts at all. And then I think they're throwing a little shade at you here chris

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Google play services can be enabled

53:44.640 --> 53:51.360
If you wish I get that I do get that like like I when I mentioned this to people in person like you realized

53:51.440 --> 53:53.440
The point of this was to get away from google

53:53.440 --> 53:56.400
You realized the point of this was to get away from google, right?

53:56.880 --> 53:58.880
Oh, yeah, I know I know

53:58.960 --> 54:02.000
It's just sometimes I want to be able to take pictures that look decent too

54:02.320 --> 54:06.640
true grits wrote in following up on some of chris's questions around listening habits with

54:07.580 --> 54:12.000
2468 sets even live long and prosper

54:12.240 --> 54:14.720
I try to listen to all the episodes as they come out

54:14.800 --> 54:22.160
However, sometimes such as during the summer I get a few weeks behind been slowly catching up and i'm almost there. No worries true grits

54:22.160 --> 54:27.120
Thank you for letting us know i've been curious to hear people's various listening habits and how far behind they are

54:27.520 --> 54:31.440
Just so we have data on that. So, uh, if you want to share that with us, please boost it in

54:31.680 --> 54:37.600
But how how far behind was true? Chris? When did we when we posed that question? I think about three weeks ago

54:38.800 --> 54:41.920
There we go. I just want to I just want to creep a bit on sure gets that's my there you go

54:42.320 --> 54:47.040
Yeah, I feel like listening math is hard. Yeah, because we pre-recorded so it's technically maybe a month

54:47.040 --> 54:51.460
The golden dragon also boosted in with a set of lead sets

54:54.160 --> 54:55.440
Love mascot

54:55.440 --> 55:00.640
Golden dragon writes long time no boost. So gold by imagine dragons seems cool

55:00.960 --> 55:04.080
I'm, not a huge pop rock guy, but that song kind of grooves

55:04.480 --> 55:09.040
I was aiming for something from free music archive, but it's a bit of a mess over there

55:09.520 --> 55:13.760
Also, what do you think of magic wormhole as far as i've researched?

55:13.760 --> 55:19.520
It's a great way to send files across long distances that's encrypted and compressed kind of like bit word and send

55:19.920 --> 55:21.760
Hmm. Yeah, okay

55:21.760 --> 55:25.600
I like wormhole a lot wes and I use it frequently to move files back and forth

55:25.840 --> 55:29.200
And I think the encryption is probably adequate for what you're looking for

55:29.680 --> 55:33.520
Yeah, I mean, you know if you want to you've got something really secure then

55:34.320 --> 55:39.200
Layer something on top but the you know, the fact that it's nice and ephemeral

55:39.200 --> 55:43.760
And it means, you know, you can transfer that file and then once you're done walk away

55:44.160 --> 55:48.160
And one part I really like is just that you know, it's it's a python program. Uh, so

55:48.880 --> 55:52.480
To brent's point earlier. It's really just like a pip install away and that means it can work on

55:52.720 --> 55:55.120
It can work on your mac on your linux or even your windows box

55:55.600 --> 56:00.640
And it does and it's also packaged by everything too. So, you know brew linux packages

56:00.880 --> 56:04.960
They've all got it and the syntax is so easy. It's wormhole send then you point at the file

56:04.960 --> 56:10.240
So if I were a little more paranoid or doing it for myself, I might just use tail scale send since I have that

56:10.240 --> 56:14.880
On all my machines now and that's kind of like airdrop, but using tail scale on the back end

56:15.520 --> 56:20.320
Um, or you know, maybe you could look in a bit word and send I think that'd be another option as well

56:20.480 --> 56:24.160
Just kind of depends on what your security requirements are. I have another one to throw in there as well

56:24.400 --> 56:30.480
Uh simply wormhole dot app and uh, I think what really gets me there is just really the background seems to work fine

56:30.480 --> 56:35.840
And of course with lots of these tools you can uh, host your own little relay server if you need to and that's another way

56:35.840 --> 56:37.840
To add on some layers of security

56:38.800 --> 56:44.880
Oh, whoa, see sneaky double boost this week from frozier with 5 000 additional sats

56:46.620 --> 56:50.320
Dwm was very difficult with nixos for me

56:50.880 --> 56:53.520
Because it's meant to be configured by the user

56:54.080 --> 56:55.840
in the source code

56:55.840 --> 57:00.720
Before it's built so I gave up and I used awesome wn

57:01.200 --> 57:04.880
Here's my config. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, I could see that being a little tricky, you know

57:04.880 --> 57:06.560
I mean nix is great at building stuff

57:06.560 --> 57:10.640
But then you got to kind of maintain your own version and hook that up to everything surely possible

57:10.720 --> 57:13.200
But as a former awesome user myself

57:13.760 --> 57:18.720
Love it and uh, thanks for thanks for sharing the codes and the bits. That's that's great

57:18.960 --> 57:20.400
Yeah, we'll put a link to that in the show notes

57:20.400 --> 57:26.400
So people want to check that out wolfman 2g1 boosts in with 1500 sats. You're doing a good job

57:26.960 --> 57:29.520
Just got my ham license and it got me thinking

57:30.160 --> 57:32.980
Is any of the jb crew amateur radio operators?

57:33.600 --> 57:39.440
Oh, no, another ham question what's happening? I know I think our next boost is about ham radio, too

57:39.520 --> 57:44.160
Ask might as well read that i'll be 1984 boost in with a thousand sats

57:44.800 --> 57:46.480
first boost ever

57:46.480 --> 57:51.600
Hey, oh, hey, congratulations. Hey, you know what you're doing a good job, too. You're doing a good job

57:51.920 --> 57:56.240
Oppie goes on. I also would be interested in a ham radio discussion

57:56.480 --> 58:02.560
Here's a link to a ham site with some dedicated ham linux distros. We'll keep that one in the notes nice

58:03.600 --> 58:04.560
Okay

58:04.560 --> 58:10.880
All right. All right. Well, you know something that we should mention on air and rust a cast of versa boosted with 2000 sats

58:10.880 --> 58:15.120
Linux and ham. Did you know there's a whole podcast around this called linux in the ham shack?

58:15.600 --> 58:20.320
Maybe a little special with noah would be cool. That is the best linux podcast name

58:20.320 --> 58:23.200
I've ever heard it. That is pretty good. And you know what it would be a lot

58:23.200 --> 58:25.200
It would make so much sense to do it with noah

58:25.520 --> 58:28.000
So, uh, I think that's something maybe that's how we'll handle it

58:28.240 --> 58:33.440
We'll talk a little software defined radio because the matrix room has been talking about this quite a bit in the feedback rooms

58:33.760 --> 58:36.160
And they think we should do something around software defined radio

58:36.160 --> 58:41.280
So maybe we bring in a little noah we get a little brown bear going on the topic and we have some fun

58:41.440 --> 58:45.120
I could see that coming down in the future. So keep your radios tuned. You never know

58:45.440 --> 58:47.440
There might be something in the near future

58:47.760 --> 58:50.980
Rasta also boosted with another 2000 sats. It's a dubs

58:52.800 --> 58:59.120
He writes was the dev1 unboxed in the bat cave I swear I hear lots of water running

58:59.760 --> 59:03.440
Yeah, you know I meant to address that when we recorded the dev1 unboxing. Um

59:03.440 --> 59:07.280
Unboxing. Um brent has a urination issue. It's true

59:08.480 --> 59:09.680
It's just all that hydration

59:09.680 --> 59:17.040
So we've rigged the studio up special to handle it because you know, there's sanitation issues. No, I have a frog tank in the studio

59:18.080 --> 59:23.360
In the living room and we were doing the unboxing and it's one of those things that i'm totally used to because it's been in

59:23.360 --> 59:24.480
There forever

59:24.480 --> 59:29.040
But it does sound a little obnoxious in that particular recording. It sounded like you set your

59:29.040 --> 59:33.620
Recorder right on top of the thing. It was so bad. I apologize about that. Um, you know

59:33.700 --> 59:39.140
Just think of it a little ambiance resta, you know picture a little froggy in there swimming around while we're unboxing the dev1

59:39.860 --> 59:41.060
It's pretty great

59:41.060 --> 59:45.940
Also, I just want to say a big thank you to some folks who boosted in but we didn't read their boost on the air

59:46.180 --> 59:49.540
There's so many that come in. We are just selecting some of them now

59:50.100 --> 59:52.660
But a couple of just a couple of quick shout outs here

59:52.660 --> 59:54.660
Here

59:57.060 --> 01:00:01.860
90 sats from retro penguin a long time first time sending in their very first boost

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:07.220
We got 50 sats from couch fox who earned his first sats that day and then sent them into the show

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.380
Absolutely amazing. It's so great. And then we got nine thousand sats from sultros

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.660
Who just got himself an hp x?

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:24.440
360 convertible laptop and he's running Debian testing on that thing with gnome and he says the touchscreen support works

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.920
Well, I like it. I'm loving that. I'm loving that. Keep keep the hardware reports coming in folks

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.120
We can just slowly but surely let people know what's working out there

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.180
So they know what hardware to get if you'd like to boost into the show

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:41.640
Go get a new podcasting app at new podcast apps comm get one that supports podcasting to know like fountain or pod verse

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.480
which is GPL and available for the web Android iOS and

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.280
It's an f-troid. It's right there in f-troid, too

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.480
So go check that out

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.360
And if you really want to nerd out you can use boost CLI or breeze

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.880
That one then you don't got to change your podcast app

01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:00.600
I'll tell you what and we should mention to thank you everybody who's boosted in we've been doing splits with Brent so that way he

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.940
Has some sats for his gas tank in office hours 13

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:09.240
We bought some steaks with those fats too since we had a few extra ones and we grilled up some steaks for everybody and

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.760
Then the barbecue caught fire

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:18.140
Yep, the barbecue caught fire like not intentionally on like like not like we turn the burners on kind of fire

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.680
But like an emergency fire where we were afraid to open the hood because we thought we might get back drafted kind of fire

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.280
Thankfully we saved most

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:33.680
And we talk all about it and officer's pretty great clip if you're curious how we convert the sats into real-life goods

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.200
Well, we just send Brent out on the street and he comes back with cash. I'm not exactly sure what he does

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:43.200
We don't ask we thought about doing that but instead we went for the easier option

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.800
we went with bit refill and

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:51.040
bit refill calm lets you actually use Bitcoin on chain or lightning and then you buy a gift card and then you spend that so

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.820
Like Chevron Texaco instacart the grocery store

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.560
Banks, there's so many gift cards on there

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.880
And so it was actually pretty trivial for us to be able to convert those sats and then you know

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.840
Put them in instacart and we ordered groceries for the Airbnb

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:10.600
That was something else that we were able to do with those sats. So thank you everyone that split worked out fantastic

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.760
Not only did it give us the funds to get Brent down here

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.840
But then we're able to treat the crew to some steaks as well

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.480
And you know, sometimes we did that just kind of on a whim like we weren't even really planning it

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:22.960
But it's like we got a couple of hours tonight. Let's just get this. Let's do it

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.100
And we just had a lot of fun. So thank you everybody. That was really a treat

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.680
We have a pretty special pick I don't know if this is for everybody

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:39.840
but those of you who are into this kind of thing are gonna absolutely love this up on the jet propulsion laboratory github page

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.680
They have the open source Rover project. Yep. That's right

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.960
the open source Rover project and

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:52.600
It has so many goodies on here about the little Rovers out there including just like

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.000
stats and specs and information on how to build your own and

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.200
Even how to emulate one and control it with an Android device an Xbox 360 controller and a Raspberry Pi. That is so incredible

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.800
It's so perfect

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.640
So we'll link to this in the show notes you can go check it out because it looks like a lot of fun

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:15.040
Even if you just want to geek out on the 3d models that they have there in the different parts

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.720
It's really amazing that you can build this with just off-the-shelf stuff now, you know

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.920
If we built one for the studio

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:26.600
We'd have a little company for the days that Levi's not here with us and maybe we could teach this one to bring us a cider

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.420
Hmm, we could just build a little cooler into its back. Oh now you're thinking, you know

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:37.420
I've been pretty impressed at JPL's open source mentality. Tim's mentioned several times how much he loves that

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:44.040
Paradigm and way of working with software and hardware, but they just really prove it with their github page

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.640
There's like projects galore on there that you can dive into Chris you and I had a blast

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.760
Just trying to pick a pic for this episode. And I mean this one's great, but there's a lot of other stuff in there

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.480
So there's a lot we could have picked

01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:01.160
Totally. Yeah, why didn't you pick this automated low latency global glacier flow and elevation change data set?

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.640
I mean, come on, obviously we were saving it for next week spoiler

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.240
You know speaking of next week

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.720
Hopefully we're back in studio. We should be back at our regular live time, which is noon Pacific 3 p.m

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.000
Eastern over at Jupiter dot tube and

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
You know things are just gonna be back to normal. No more on-the-road shows

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.640
Just a call really now that we're back is gonna be trying to start working on the taxis

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.440
But I'll still be on the road. That's true, but you'll be at the studio. Yeah, it's all the way from home

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:34.840
It's like home 2.0 home be for you. You know, I'm telling you what home but with better internet home with benefits

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:42.840
Podcasting benefits. So join us on Jupiter dot tube for that. See you next week same bad time same bad station

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:49.480
and of course links to what we talked about today will be at Linux unplug calm slash four seven eight er and

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.360
Thank you to our members over to unplugged core comm you are still getting a special version of this show
