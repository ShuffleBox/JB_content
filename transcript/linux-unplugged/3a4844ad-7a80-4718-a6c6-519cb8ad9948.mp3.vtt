WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.440
I guess screw the rest of August, it's almost time for Halloween.

00:16.440 --> 00:20.160
So Humble Bundle has got some pretty good priced Linux games out.

00:20.160 --> 00:21.880
Yeah, I'm surprised this isn't coming out in October.

00:21.880 --> 00:22.880
I know.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.840
Well, and weren't you just telling me about a sale for a Steam game on Linux 2?

00:25.840 --> 00:26.840
It's like for sale.

00:26.840 --> 00:27.840
Hell of a sale.

00:27.840 --> 00:28.840
It's like free, right?

00:28.840 --> 00:29.840
Yeah, it's free.

00:29.840 --> 00:30.840
Yeah.

00:30.840 --> 00:31.840
What was it called?

00:31.840 --> 00:32.840
Shadow Warrior?

00:32.840 --> 00:33.840
Yeah, Shadow Warrior.

00:33.840 --> 00:37.920
Yeah, so you have the Humble Spooky Bundle, which is available for 13 days, and then Steam's

00:37.920 --> 00:41.560
got the Shadow Warrior game for free right now for Linux users.

00:41.560 --> 00:46.720
Actually, I think the best game on the Humble Bundle is actually Alien Isolation.

00:46.720 --> 00:47.720
Alien Isolation.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.720
Is that available for Linux?

00:48.720 --> 00:49.720
Yes.

00:49.720 --> 00:50.720
That would be awesome.

00:50.720 --> 00:51.720
Yes, it is.

00:51.720 --> 00:52.720
Alien Isolation, huh?

00:52.720 --> 00:53.720
That sounds cool.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.080
Discover the true meaning of fear in Alien Isolation.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.760
It's based on the Aliens series.

00:57.760 --> 00:58.760
Yeah.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.840
It looks interesting.

01:00.840 --> 01:04.600
Supposedly I saw a review that was saying that the story mode of it is fantastic.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.600
Yeah, it is.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.600
Really?

01:06.600 --> 01:07.600
Oh, guys.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.600
It's pretty intense, too.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.600
Might be worth the bundle right here.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.600
Here, I'm going to watch a little bit of the trailer.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.600
This might be...

01:11.600 --> 01:14.600
Oh, it's a Sega game.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.600
Yep.

01:15.600 --> 01:16.600
Okay.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.600
All right.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.600
I already love it.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.120
The graphics look great.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.120
Good sci-fi graphics.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.120
Yeah, it's a AAA title.

01:25.120 --> 01:29.160
Oh, this looks super creepy.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.160
It's about your mother.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.440
Oh, I'm getting this.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.440
Yeah.

01:36.440 --> 01:40.720
I'm probably going to be playing that on Halloween.

01:40.720 --> 01:57.200
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 211 for August 22nd, 2017.

01:57.200 --> 02:01.620
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that really wished more cars were

02:01.620 --> 02:02.960
running Linux these days.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.120
Yes, I mean it.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.760
My name is Chris.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.760
That's your cue there.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.760
Oh, hello.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.760
Yeah.

02:08.760 --> 02:09.760
Hello, beard.

02:09.760 --> 02:12.520
I thought normally where Wes would jump in, we're going to have the beard jump in.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.520
Now that worked out.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.640
I actually thought you'd be filling in for me sooner than you'd be filling in for Wes.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.160
You know, I can just fill in for everyone and do the show alone.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.160
You probably could.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.940
That's some sort of beard superpower.

02:21.940 --> 02:25.760
Would you cut yourself to reply to the answers or would you just work two mics?

02:25.760 --> 02:26.760
Have you thought that through?

02:26.760 --> 02:31.560
I mean, I figured I'd just put the mics together and have this nice stereo warbly sound.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.960
Well, while I'm still here, I'm going to try to put together a great show for everybody

02:34.960 --> 02:35.960
today.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.680
I'm going to give you just a quick update on the solar eclipse trip I went on, but then

02:39.680 --> 02:44.720
then there is a rumor that some solar is powered.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.720
Maybe maybe actually.

02:45.720 --> 02:46.720
I already don't believe it.

02:46.720 --> 02:47.720
OK, all right.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.400
What about what about rumors about Ubuntu Budgie Edition shipping on hardware?

02:50.400 --> 02:51.400
What about that?

02:51.400 --> 02:53.960
No, that's that's that sounds crazy.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.000
Crash plan users got screwed this week.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
We'll cover what Linux users can do to move off of there.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.040
There is an app based around Electron that, well, it may be a line too far.

03:04.040 --> 03:08.000
Even for me, Chrome OS is coming for Linux in the enterprise.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.360
There's a great way to generate your bash files.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.640
Ubuntu is showing every other distribution how it should be done.

03:13.640 --> 03:18.440
We've got some interesting conundrums from Firefox and Plex, and then we'll wrap it all

03:18.440 --> 03:22.560
up with something that's so amazing.

03:22.560 --> 03:23.640
It's probably going to change your life.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.440
And it's based on the real engine for and it's essentially the Oasis.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.640
If you have a ready player one, prepare to have your entire life sucked away.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.640
You're welcome.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.640
We'll tell you more about that.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.640
Yes, of course, it runs on Linux.

03:33.640 --> 03:34.640
Of course it does.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.680
We'll tell you more about that, though, as this here show goes on.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.560
Beardsley, what's up?

03:38.560 --> 03:40.420
We must go no further.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.080
We must welcome in our virtual lug.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Greetings.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Hello.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Hello.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Pip, pip.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
It is nice to see some of you in there.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.800
We have a lower showing today, and I would imagine it's probably because Wes isn't here.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.440
Since everybody's like, screw it, I'm not showing up.

03:54.440 --> 03:57.600
Well, usually people show up for the beers Wes brings.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.200
Yeah, well, and they knew he wasn't coming somehow, even maybe before we even knew.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.640
Well, he probably matches them first.

04:04.640 --> 04:09.060
So yeah, I just got back hours ago, actually, from going down and seeing the Tote Solar

04:09.060 --> 04:12.080
Eclipse 2017 of the Heart in Oregon.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.400
And it was pretty great.

04:14.400 --> 04:18.120
Bumped into a listener down there who is a Linux user.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.320
Didn't bump into another listener I expected to, but I bumped into somebody that I didn't

04:21.320 --> 04:22.520
expect to, and that was great.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.920
We chatted a little bit about all the crazy things going on in Linux right before the

04:25.920 --> 04:28.200
solar eclipse hit, which was pretty neat.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.840
And drove down there in one long, just crazy six hour, seven hour-ish.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.920
There was a lot of traffic getting down there.

04:34.920 --> 04:42.040
And got down there, slept in the car, woke up, and then we had to take care of a few.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.120
There were some challenges that we faced.

04:44.120 --> 04:47.800
Took care of all that, bumped into the listener, had a good chat, saw the eclipse, then hightailed

04:47.800 --> 04:50.520
it back up here so that way we could do Linux Unplugged this week.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.520
So there you go.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.080
I'll give you, I'm going to give, I'll do the whole story on my vlog, eventually.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.080
Yeah, I was going to say.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.720
I think you can get the full story.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.920
I got to edit it all together.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.320
There was some pretty good stuff going on.

04:59.320 --> 05:02.760
And of course I managed to actually end up with a few of my own really amateur shots

05:02.760 --> 05:04.920
of the eclipse, so that's pretty cool.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.880
And I had the drone up in the sky during the eclipse.

05:06.880 --> 05:07.880
And your eyes still work.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.480
As far as I know, although sometimes I think it takes a while for it to set in, so you

05:11.480 --> 05:12.480
never know.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.600
But having the drone up in the sky during, it wasn't, you know, I wasn't really watching

05:15.600 --> 05:19.440
it because I was watching the eclipse, but it really shows you how dark it got down there.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.440
That's a crazy progression.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.440
Yeah, yeah.

05:21.440 --> 05:25.820
We're showing it in the video version, a progressive shot that was taken down from Oregon.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.720
There is, it was pretty neat.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.080
It was a pretty cool event.

05:29.080 --> 05:32.680
It's so impressive in person to see something like that.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.320
Yeah, I'm really glad I made it.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.520
And I only got to say hi to a couple of people, but I'm glad that we were able to say hi.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.560
So that was, I think our next meetup will be here at the studio again.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.640
I think maybe we'll do like an end of summer barbecue soon.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.200
We're going to do another one of those.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.400
I was thinking too about maybe doing a raffle.

05:47.400 --> 05:51.620
I got to look into the details around that, but maybe taking some Jupiter broadcasting

05:51.620 --> 05:55.160
gear and raffling it off during the next barbecue.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.160
So I got a few ideas.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.420
So that'll be, we'll have another meetup soon.

05:58.420 --> 06:02.280
And then eventually, eventually, so that way I can start prepping for the 2024 eclipse,

06:02.280 --> 06:04.320
I'll make trips over to the East coast.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.060
And if I hold up to my promise, I'll eventually make it across the pond too.

06:08.060 --> 06:09.640
I have one question for you, Chris.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.920
Were the crowds as crazy as you expected?

06:11.920 --> 06:13.840
Yes and no.

06:13.840 --> 06:20.560
So getting down out of Washington was a nightmare and it was super packed and I-5 was all screwed

06:20.560 --> 06:21.560
up.

06:21.560 --> 06:25.720
Once we jumped down the highway 101, which runs along the Pacific coast, the Pacific

06:25.720 --> 06:29.000
ocean coast really was no big deal.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.760
And then we high tailed it out of there.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.000
But for the most part, actually just everybody was cool.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.600
Everybody was super, like there was a lot of people and there was zero issue.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.520
It's all them hippies are going to check out the eclipse.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.720
People came from all over.

06:44.720 --> 06:50.100
Behind us were people from Canada and then in front of us, parked alongside the road

06:50.100 --> 06:52.840
because where we ended up, were people from Utah.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.400
So people just came from all over to see it.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.640
It was pretty neat.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.960
People come all over, from all over to run Ubuntu Budgie 2.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.840
I've been hearing more and more about Ubuntu Budgie Edition.

07:01.840 --> 07:08.600
So it's Ubuntu but with the Budgie desktop from Solus and there are rumors are percolating

07:08.600 --> 07:13.480
that there could be hardware shipping very soon with Ubuntu Budgie Edition pre-installed

07:13.480 --> 07:14.480
on it.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.160
There's a rumor circulating around today.

07:16.160 --> 07:22.440
This is a post over at OMG Ubuntu and it's based on hints that were dropped by Ubuntu

07:22.440 --> 07:28.560
Budgie's social media page, which I noticed that none of them are in the room for today.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.440
Some of them are often in the room but nobody's there today from here.

07:31.440 --> 07:36.040
So if you take the image that they tweeted out, right, right, they did two context-free

07:36.040 --> 07:37.040
images on their Twitter feed.

07:37.040 --> 07:42.280
They just posted like an iMac looking rig and a ultra-thin laptop looking rig with the

07:42.280 --> 07:43.280
lid closed.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.640
So you take those images and you do a reverse image search and you know what you end up

07:46.640 --> 07:47.640
with?

07:47.640 --> 07:48.640
Clevo!

07:48.640 --> 08:00.240
Yeah, you end up with Clevo which is the same hardware ODM that Entraware and System76 use

08:00.240 --> 08:03.360
and Nimbusoft and others use.

08:03.360 --> 08:09.820
And you know, the thing I say with the Clevo is it's like getting a nice midsize sedan

08:09.820 --> 08:10.820
or something.

08:10.820 --> 08:16.720
It's like when you get a mid-level car, it's very reliable like a Camry or like a, you

08:16.720 --> 08:20.280
know, an Accord which I've owned.

08:20.280 --> 08:25.040
Those are great cars but they're not like, they're definitely not Tesla, Teslas and they're

08:25.040 --> 08:28.920
definitely not BMW i-series, you know, they're not like, they're not crazy performance.

08:28.920 --> 08:33.120
And they're not like, you know, super broken down cars either.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.840
Sometimes depending on how the ODM chooses to tweak it though, they can really put together

08:35.840 --> 08:38.980
something that's very, very compelling.

08:38.980 --> 08:43.600
And so if they could get the balance right, you might have something here.

08:43.600 --> 08:47.360
Now there's two laptops it looks like from Clevo that are two different rigs because

08:47.360 --> 08:48.640
one was an iMac.

08:48.640 --> 08:53.000
One's the Bologna laptop and the other is the Neptune all-in-one.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.640
And Nimbusoft, which is a company out of the UK that resells Clevos, already actually sells

08:58.640 --> 09:02.400
both of these devices with Ubuntu Mate, Kubuntu on it.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.400
So you could see them pretty easily adding Ubuntu Budgie for Ubuntu Budgie users who

09:06.400 --> 09:07.400
want to grab that.

09:07.400 --> 09:12.720
Which could be great for people that are looking for something that's still GTK heavy as Canonical

09:12.720 --> 09:15.720
moves away from Unity, but they still want something with an Ubuntu base.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.360
Could be good timing.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.720
I haven't heard anything from Nimbusoft in the past.

09:19.720 --> 09:23.360
I've never reviewed any of their equipment and I'm not very familiar with the company.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.960
I've never heard anybody in the audience has ever bought from them.

09:25.960 --> 09:30.200
But they apparently are also working on their own distribution called Eloquent OS.

09:30.200 --> 09:36.760
There's apparently every hardware OEM except for the ones like Dell and HP and IBM.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.200
Except for the ones that are shipping lots of product.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.440
Yeah except for the one.

09:40.440 --> 09:44.920
Yeah there's an OEM program and then there's roll your own distribution apparently.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.000
And to hell with even bothering being a flavor anymore.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.320
Screw end users.

09:48.320 --> 09:53.160
Speaking of screwing end users, CrashPlan is doing just that and shutting down its consumer

09:53.160 --> 09:55.360
backup service.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.360
And I'm bringing this up on this show because CrashPlan is something I've mentioned as a

09:58.360 --> 10:03.800
very cost effective, unlimited, or close to it backup solution for Linux users.

10:03.800 --> 10:08.880
And one of the things I loved about CrashPlan is A, they actually had a client that worked

10:08.880 --> 10:13.760
on Linux and B, they had command line integration and C, you could ship them a disk.

10:13.760 --> 10:19.240
You could just ship them a four terabyte spinning rust to seed your backup and then just back

10:19.240 --> 10:21.040
up the updates and differentials.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.960
Which was huge for me back in the day.

10:23.960 --> 10:28.320
But unfortunately of course anything too good eventually has to go away.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.320
Yep.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.200
Have you experimented much with online backup?

10:31.200 --> 10:34.800
You just use like Google Drive or what do you, because I know you recently suffered

10:34.800 --> 10:36.040
some pretty serious data loss.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.560
Like have you thought a lot about this?

10:37.560 --> 10:41.520
Yeah, I've mostly been leaning towards actually trying to use TarSnap.

10:41.520 --> 10:42.520
Oh yeah, yeah.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.760
Yeah, that's definitely one of my recommendations.

10:44.760 --> 10:50.800
Because they recently just came out with version 1.0 of the TarSnap GUI apparently.

10:50.800 --> 10:51.800
Oh really?

10:51.800 --> 10:54.080
Which makes it a lot easier I imagine.

10:54.080 --> 10:58.320
Anybody in the mumble room using CrashPlan now or using a competitor to it that they

10:58.320 --> 11:01.360
would give a recommendation to?

11:01.360 --> 11:03.040
I was using CrashPlan.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.040
Oh really?

11:04.040 --> 11:05.040
Yeah.

11:05.040 --> 11:09.560
But I was also, I actually had people who were friends and I had a couple of clients

11:09.560 --> 11:10.880
that were using CrashPlan.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.160
So that's going to suck.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.840
Yeah, I'm definitely in that situation.

11:13.840 --> 11:18.600
Some of my former clients are using CrashPlan and definitely like my mom's on CrashPlan.

11:18.600 --> 11:21.760
I got a few family members on it too because it was so economical.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.880
Which is probably why it's going away.

11:23.880 --> 11:28.760
I was using it because, well I was also, some setups I was using it because it was free.

11:28.760 --> 11:35.560
Because you can do it where you can do an FTP over SFTP over to multiple networks.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.560
I love that feature.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.960
You have your own computers and it was like it was fantastic but then I would still pay

11:40.960 --> 11:47.440
for one of the premiums just because it was so useful but I wasn't going to deploy it

11:47.440 --> 11:48.440
everywhere.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.640
But now, you know, drawing board.

11:50.640 --> 11:51.640
Man.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.480
Yeah, most of the alternatives are really expensive too.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.480
Yeah.

11:55.480 --> 12:01.560
So I've been looking, Backblaze is very competitive but they don't and have no interest in making

12:01.560 --> 12:02.840
a Linux client.

12:02.840 --> 12:07.480
Which really pisses me off because it's not even a matter of, it's not even a matter of,

12:07.480 --> 12:11.160
well we can't be bothered to even write a command line interface which would obviously

12:11.160 --> 12:12.160
be simple.

12:12.160 --> 12:16.820
Which there is a Python way to do this but anyways, let me get back to the main point.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.140
They've been asked about it numerous times and they're very upfront about it.

12:19.140 --> 12:21.760
You can ask them, we asked them today on Twitter.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.680
And they'll just say, yeah, it's not really in our, it's not really in our business priorities

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
right now.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.960
Nothing against Linux, just not really our business priority.

12:27.960 --> 12:33.360
But they do have this B2 cloud storage system and I don't, again, never, I'm not personally

12:33.360 --> 12:37.400
a customer of this, although Angela does use them now after CrashPlan.

12:37.400 --> 12:42.040
But B2 is like a cloud storage service and there's going to be a cost associated with

12:42.040 --> 12:43.040
that.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.040
So keep this in mind.

12:44.040 --> 12:50.360
But there's a tool you can use on Linux that works with B2 storage, it works with Amazon

12:50.360 --> 12:58.320
Drive, obviously S3 Dropbox, Google Cloud Storage, Local Disk, Microsoft OneDrive.

12:58.320 --> 13:04.000
It also will just do SSH and SFTP, it'll do a Yandex disk, which is kind of neat.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.420
It's called rClone.

13:05.420 --> 13:10.920
And rClone is sort of like rSync but it allows you to sync to these cloud storage services

13:10.920 --> 13:15.060
that I just mentioned, including Backblaze's B2.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.920
This might be something you could look into.

13:16.920 --> 13:20.480
rClone might be a good way to move the data around to a new service as well.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.800
So rClone.org is where you find that.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.560
We've talked about it in the past, rSync for cloud storage.

13:25.560 --> 13:30.040
And if you want to know specifically about the Backblaze integration, it's rClone.org

13:30.040 --> 13:31.600
slash B2.

13:31.600 --> 13:36.120
rClone also apparently has support for Amazon Cloud Drive.

13:36.120 --> 13:39.960
Or Google Drive, you could do that as well if you're okay with that or you want to encrypt

13:39.960 --> 13:44.360
your data or Dropbox if you're already paying that monster.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.360
None of these really exciting.

13:45.360 --> 13:49.160
Is it just storage cloning or is it just incremental cloning?

13:49.160 --> 13:52.080
I think it's more file system based, so I don't think it's like doing block images or

13:52.080 --> 13:54.880
anything like that.

13:54.880 --> 14:01.040
Because it's more like rSync than it is like a block backup or something.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.840
And it does support some of the same syntax as rSync too, like the commands to preserve

14:04.840 --> 14:09.920
timestamps and those kinds of things, some of those same flags, like the archive flag

14:09.920 --> 14:13.640
and stuff are the same.

14:13.640 --> 14:20.400
The other thing that I find kind of useful about it is it does support syncing one data

14:20.400 --> 14:24.240
set to multiple cloud storages, which is kind of a neat feature if you think about it.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.560
So you could spread out your risks.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.520
Say you have a locally encrypted set of data or something to that degree and then you could

14:30.520 --> 14:35.140
blast a copy of it on Dropbox, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.720
Now would I really want to do that?

14:37.720 --> 14:43.360
Generally no, however there's something that I feel like we as a society at whole have

14:43.360 --> 14:49.640
not really wrapped our brains around and that is the ephemeral nature of digital media,

14:49.640 --> 14:51.960
specifically our pictures.

14:51.960 --> 14:55.440
And one of the things that stands out for me is a very strong memory from childhood

14:55.440 --> 15:00.020
is going through family photo albums and seeing pictures of grandma and grandpa getting married

15:00.020 --> 15:04.860
and how young they looked and seeing pictures of my mom and dad as kids and how they kind

15:04.860 --> 15:09.360
of looked like me and my cousins and my uncles and my aunts.

15:09.360 --> 15:15.200
These are pretty clear memories I have of going through these old photo albums and those

15:15.200 --> 15:18.880
do not exist anymore for most people that are shooting digitally.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.620
Some people print it out but for most of us they don't and then you move between computers

15:22.620 --> 15:27.480
and you move between phones and all of a sudden you don't have the video of the marriage or

15:27.480 --> 15:32.880
whatever it might be, the kid's birthday that was super important, and it's just gone.

15:32.880 --> 15:37.420
It's just gone forever and there's nothing for your kids to flip through down the road

15:37.420 --> 15:41.000
or your grandparents to flip through down the road because there's no physical object

15:41.000 --> 15:44.840
to represent it and there's no solution to this problem.

15:44.840 --> 15:50.520
There's nothing, you can update and upload all day long to Dropbox and Google Drive and

15:50.520 --> 15:54.600
S3 and there's no way your kids are going to download that or your ancestors are going

15:54.600 --> 15:58.560
to download that and look at it later on but at least it is preserving it in a way that

15:58.560 --> 16:01.440
you could manage it and you can get access to it at some point.

16:01.440 --> 16:06.000
And so spreading that out and the fact that this supports FTP, SFTP, the local file system,

16:06.000 --> 16:10.440
so you could do an NFS mount if you wanted to or it supports multiple cloud storages

16:10.440 --> 16:15.760
and it'll do hashes to make sure everything goes up there, everything's got good integrity.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.320
It does partial syncs if your upload gets canceled.

16:18.320 --> 16:24.740
So if you got to move off of CrashPlan, rClone could be a solution for you.

16:24.740 --> 16:29.000
There's also kind of nice for restorations especially for basic end users is there's

16:29.000 --> 16:33.400
an optional fuse mount called rClone mount and as you'd expect that makes it kind of

16:33.400 --> 16:38.520
easy for regular people to browse through their backup and you could just have this

16:38.520 --> 16:43.400
as an icon on the side of their file manager that they click on, kicks off using the background,

16:43.400 --> 16:48.520
it does a mount and of course you just have to have rClone installed to do that and you

16:48.520 --> 16:57.700
could also even use WinFCP and there is actually a proxy module available for Windows which

16:57.700 --> 17:03.640
uses a combination of rClone and CG GoFuse, I can't remember what it's called because

17:03.640 --> 17:07.880
I have never needed to use it, but there's actually even a way to mount rClone backups

17:07.880 --> 17:11.560
on Windows desktops which could be great for clients or people that you're setting up in

17:11.560 --> 17:15.040
an office that need access to that but you're backing it from a Linux file server.

17:15.040 --> 17:19.240
That's a situation I've been in where I've used a backup system on Linux for Linux file

17:19.240 --> 17:21.360
servers and then guess who needs to restore the data?

17:21.360 --> 17:23.920
Some user on Windows and that has a solution for that.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.360
So links to all of that crap in the show notes.

17:26.360 --> 17:33.400
So I was doing a bit of research while you were talking, apparently Duplicity and by

17:33.400 --> 17:39.720
extension DejaDup, since it's the front end to it, can directly sync or directly backup

17:39.720 --> 17:40.720
to Amazon Cloud Drive.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.680
I am so glad you brought up Duplicity because that's a great one.

17:43.680 --> 17:51.120
On top of that, there's an asynchronous upload flag that will encrypt as it uploads.

17:51.120 --> 17:55.880
So you can encrypt your backups and not have to worry about Amazon looking into your backups.

17:55.880 --> 18:00.840
There's also sort of name collision but there's also Duplicati which is a backup software

18:00.840 --> 18:06.400
for Mac, Windows and Linux they say that does local encryption and then backs up to probably

18:06.400 --> 18:11.680
using rClone on the backend all the same cloud services that rClone supports but this gives

18:11.680 --> 18:17.560
you a big old stinking web GUI for it which makes it nice and easy for people to manage.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.100
So it might be something worth looking at too.

18:19.100 --> 18:22.360
That's Duplicati and Duplicity.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.880
Duplicity is like a GTK based app that you run on Linux desktop.

18:25.880 --> 18:26.880
Duplicity is the command line app.

18:26.880 --> 18:27.880
DejaDup is the GTK app.

18:27.880 --> 18:28.880
Oh, okay.

18:28.880 --> 18:29.880
Oh, right, right.

18:29.880 --> 18:30.880
Thank you.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.880
So DejaDup is the GTK front end.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.840
Duplicati is a web based like a project around rClone.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.120
That's a lot of things we just dropped at you.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.700
I know that's all confusing because all the names sort of collide.

18:40.700 --> 18:44.000
So here's what I'm doing right now is I'm putting links to all of this stuff in the

18:44.000 --> 18:45.880
show notes, jupyterbroadcasting.com.

18:45.880 --> 18:50.440
Go to Linux Unplugged 211s and you'll see the big section on rClone there that lists

18:50.440 --> 18:52.720
all of the cloud services that it features.

18:52.720 --> 18:55.320
Yeah, DejaDup has been an app pick before too.

18:55.320 --> 19:02.080
If you want good advice for data stuff in general, the Data Hoarder subreddit is a great

19:02.080 --> 19:03.080
place to go.

19:03.080 --> 19:04.080
Oh, yeah.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.080
Yeah, I haven't been there in forever.

19:05.080 --> 19:08.560
And also anybody in the mom room, if you have any other like backup apps or tips.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.880
Plus it has some really nice storage porn.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.440
Yeah, it is a great subreddit to hang out in.

19:13.440 --> 19:17.480
And like if you're ever like in the mood to like research and set up like a new NAS.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.520
Yeah, some of the most chill, informative guys on Reddit.

19:20.520 --> 19:21.520
All right.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.040
I think I got links to everything now.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.040
Duplicity, DejaDup.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.040
Go ahead.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.560
DejaDup is also great because it's really easy to use.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.560
Yeah.

19:28.560 --> 19:31.960
And it's like even like, you know, for basic end users that could pick it up.

19:31.960 --> 19:32.960
All right.

19:32.960 --> 19:33.960
So I think that's...

19:33.960 --> 19:34.960
And it has a fun name.

19:34.960 --> 19:35.960
Look at that.

19:35.960 --> 19:36.960
All of that.

19:36.960 --> 19:37.960
Look at that.

19:37.960 --> 19:38.960
Live show note editing right here on the show.

19:38.960 --> 19:39.960
Proud of us.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.960
So those of you that are getting screwed up by CrashPlan, hopefully some of these will

19:41.960 --> 19:42.960
help out.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.000
I feel really bad about that because I've recommended CrashPlan in the past.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I wonder if DejaDup can upload to Tarsnap.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
That'd be interesting.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Yeah.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
I got to play around.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.920
If Tarsnap has a GUI, I got to play around with that too because that would...

19:53.920 --> 19:54.920
That's a slam dunk.

19:54.920 --> 19:58.480
It apparently just like hit 1.0 like this past week.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.480
That's worth it.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.660
That is a slam dunk, I think.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.960
Also feel free to tweet us or leave a comment wherever you're watching this to let us know

20:04.960 --> 20:06.960
how you're doing your offsite backups on Linux.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.160
I am more particularly interested in offsite backups.

20:09.160 --> 20:14.600
Local backups is good too, but offsite is really sort of the sweet spot.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.120
And however you do it, let us know.

20:16.120 --> 20:19.440
Leave a comment where you watch this or go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact

20:19.440 --> 20:22.300
or tweet me at Chris LAS.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.980
Also got the subreddit, linuxunplug.reddit.com.

20:24.980 --> 20:26.160
Let's talk about mobile.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.640
This is my mobile service provider.

20:27.640 --> 20:32.120
It's also Reiki's mobile service provider, and it's a Ting, linux.ting.com.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.480
It's just a better way to do mobile.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.480
There's no contracts, no nationwide coverage.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.040
You just pay for what you use.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.580
This is so nice, especially when new phones are getting released.

20:40.580 --> 20:44.440
You don't have to sit here and try to do the crazy complicated, am I eligible for an upgrade?

20:44.440 --> 20:47.680
Do I have to go into a quote-unquote agreement if I do that?

20:47.680 --> 20:52.720
It's just so straightforward, especially with some of the leasing programs that the iPhone

20:52.720 --> 20:57.360
has, or if you want to go grab a used phone off of Gazelle when the new phones come out

20:57.360 --> 21:02.040
for a crazy great price or eBay, this is the perfect time to bring it over to Ting, because

21:02.040 --> 21:03.040
you can just add a SIM.

21:03.040 --> 21:07.100
You just go get the SIM card from their store, and if you go to linux.ting.com, they'll give

21:07.100 --> 21:11.780
you $25 to play with, either off a device or in service credits.

21:11.780 --> 21:14.760
And if you get that SIM card for nine bucks, they'll probably just give you... I think

21:14.760 --> 21:16.640
they just attribute it all in service credits.

21:16.640 --> 21:19.400
That first month you bring that phone over will probably be paid for.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.400
It's nice.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.240
Do you want to know a secret, Chris?

21:22.240 --> 21:24.000
Sometimes they even cut the price of those SIMs.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Yeah, they do.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
And sometimes they have them on sale on Amazon, too.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.940
I will say, the only time I've ever had to contact Ting was to get my unlocked phone

21:33.940 --> 21:36.920
on Ting, and it only took like five minutes.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.720
I feel like on other carriers, it doesn't take nearly as-

21:39.720 --> 21:41.660
You know what will really sell you on Ting?

21:41.660 --> 21:46.400
If you can do the whole bring your device process online through their website, and

21:46.400 --> 21:50.080
it's done in minutes, and you never even have to talk to... It's so well done.

21:50.080 --> 21:53.280
You start using different aspects of Ting, and it's how you just immediately realize

21:53.280 --> 21:54.600
it's how every carrier should do it.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.040
It's how they would have to do it in the US today to be competitive if the industry was

21:58.040 --> 21:59.040
starting over.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.040
Yeah.

22:00.040 --> 22:02.360
The only reason I even needed to call them is because the other carrier screwed it up.

22:02.360 --> 22:03.360
Yeah.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.360
Yeah.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.720
You can also get some great... Like Rika was just mentioning, when they bring things

22:06.720 --> 22:11.440
up on sale, you can get that kind of information on their Twitter account.

22:11.440 --> 22:12.440
They also have TingTips.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.440
Look at this.

22:13.440 --> 22:14.440
Look at that.

22:14.440 --> 22:15.920
They got TingTips on there.

22:15.920 --> 22:16.920
I didn't know they had TingTips.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.480
That was pretty hip Ting music too.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.040
Oh, I like that.

22:20.040 --> 22:23.360
So they got tips and stuff on their Twitter page, at TingFTW on Twitter, where you can

22:23.360 --> 22:27.220
find out about giveaways, sales, like on the SIM cards and whatnot.

22:27.220 --> 22:32.920
It's no contract, no early termination fees, you only pay for what you use, they don't

22:32.920 --> 22:36.880
play that crazy OEM game where they want to flash a certain experience on your phone,

22:36.880 --> 22:37.880
so they hold back updates.

22:37.880 --> 22:42.440
If you get a device that gets updates from Google or gets updates from Motorola, they

22:42.440 --> 22:43.440
don't get in the way.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.440
They ship it.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.200
It still blows my mind to have an internet savvy phone company.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.200
Yeah.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.200
It is really nice.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.200
It's finally the way it should be.

22:50.200 --> 22:54.360
Linux.ting.com, and thanks to everybody who supports the show by visiting that site and

22:54.360 --> 22:58.600
checking out Ting, and checking out their blog, and signing up, Linux.ting.com.

22:58.600 --> 23:02.080
Now here's something you never thought Electron would be used for, and this is a line that's

23:02.080 --> 23:04.280
just even too far for me.

23:04.280 --> 23:09.000
I can't even with this, guys, a file manager built using Electron.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
I love it.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Check it out.

23:11.000 --> 23:18.680
It's JMPfm, JMP file manager, and it's described as a dual-pane file manager, cross-platform

23:18.680 --> 23:23.360
Qt based, and it has a terminal tool built in that lets you do certain things.

23:23.360 --> 23:28.280
In fact, it takes its key influences from the LS command, it says.

23:28.280 --> 23:35.400
It's a keyboard-driven file manager, and as you might expect, I have it loaded right here.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.120
I've been trying it out, and I'll tell you one thing.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.920
Its main gimmick is pretty cool.

23:39.920 --> 23:45.880
If you type the J key, it brings up the JMP menu, JMPfm is the name, and it shows you

23:45.880 --> 23:49.720
all your favorite directories, and you can just bam right through them super quick.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.720
Bam.

23:50.720 --> 23:56.040
It also, I think, has a flat file mode where it will show you all the files in the directory

23:56.040 --> 23:57.840
you're in, as well as all the subdirectories.

23:57.840 --> 23:58.880
Okay, let's see here.

23:58.880 --> 24:02.040
So it's got a whole series of plug-ins, too.

24:02.040 --> 24:05.720
The configuration's done through a series of text files and whatnot, though.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.720
That's kind of a turn-off.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.720
Well, it's early.

24:07.720 --> 24:08.720
Yeah, it is early.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.720
It is early.

24:09.720 --> 24:14.880
So I've been running this and Nautilus all day, been browsing files in both of them,

24:14.880 --> 24:17.200
so I thought we'd just check in and do a little memory usage.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.880
So how much does an Electron file manager take?

24:19.880 --> 24:21.280
Now I'm not normally this guy.

24:21.280 --> 24:25.480
I just had a whole soapbox on last week's quarter radio about how I think Linux users

24:25.480 --> 24:30.060
are too hard on Electron apps, but I've got to do this.

24:30.060 --> 24:31.060
We have to go here.

24:31.060 --> 24:36.200
So sorting by memory usage, the only thing on my system that's taking more memory is

24:36.200 --> 24:37.320
definitely Chrome.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.440
Chrome's taking a lot more memory.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.440
Geez, look at Chrome.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.000
That is really something.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.360
Well, it's isolating every process.

24:43.360 --> 24:46.920
So Jump FM, if you look at just the...

24:46.920 --> 24:50.520
If you look at just the Jump FM main process, and it has a couple of processes, but if you

24:50.520 --> 24:54.680
look at just the main process right now, this is really remarkable, actually.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.480
This is not the results I had earlier.

24:57.480 --> 25:03.280
Jump FM is currently consuming 27.9 megabytes of RAM, and Nautilus is currently consuming

25:03.280 --> 25:05.120
23.4.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.840
So Nautilus is only a few megabytes lower.

25:07.840 --> 25:12.160
It's 23 megabytes for Nautilus, 27 megabytes for Jump FM.

25:12.160 --> 25:17.920
So if you go back into Jump FM, Chris, and you pick a folder, and you hit R, it'll do

25:17.920 --> 25:18.920
the flat mode.

25:18.920 --> 25:19.920
Oh, okay.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.400
One more thing on the memory usage, though.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.480
So Jump FM's main thread, 27.9 meg.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.220
So essentially 28 megabytes.

25:26.220 --> 25:30.560
But then there's also an app image thread that gets launched when I mount it via app

25:30.560 --> 25:31.560
image.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.200
That takes up five megabytes of RAM.

25:33.200 --> 25:40.720
There's also a dedicated thread for the GPU with no sandbox mode turned on, dual GPU turned

25:40.720 --> 25:47.020
off, and driver bug workarounds enabled, and certain GL extensions disabled.

25:47.020 --> 25:53.000
That thread is taking an astonishing 62 megabytes of RAM, taking more RAM than the main file

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
manager thread.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.640
And then there is a tertiary thread besides the main thread that is taking 5.8 megabytes

25:58.640 --> 26:02.920
of RAM that is just apparently some sort of like no sandbox thing.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.680
Anyways, so that is quite a bit of memory usage.

26:05.680 --> 26:09.800
But if I go into flat mode here, that is kind of great, actually.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.040
Yeah, it shows you all the files in the directory and in all the subdirectories.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.040
Wow, that's a lot of files.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.560
That's a lot of crash files.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.060
And it's really quick, too.

26:17.060 --> 26:18.060
It is quick.

26:18.060 --> 26:19.060
I'll give it that.

26:19.060 --> 26:20.060
It is quick.

26:20.060 --> 26:23.080
Once it's loaded, like all Electron apps, it loads a little awkwardly for a moment.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.560
But then once it's loaded, it is very quick.

26:24.560 --> 26:29.400
And then it's got other crazy stuff like filtering where you can hit F and just type in part

26:29.400 --> 26:31.760
of a file name and it will find the file for you.

26:31.760 --> 26:32.760
All right.

26:32.760 --> 26:33.760
So let's do jump.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.760
Let's see if it helps if I spell it right.

26:36.760 --> 26:37.760
Jump.

26:37.760 --> 26:38.760
Hmm.

26:38.760 --> 26:39.760
I don't know.

26:39.760 --> 26:40.760
You might be searching the directory you're in.

26:40.760 --> 26:43.880
I just feel like this is a line too far for me, dude.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.920
Where do we stop building Electron apps at?

26:45.920 --> 26:50.840
And for coders, if you hit Control-G on a file, it'll instantly make a gist.

26:50.840 --> 26:51.840
Huh.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.840
Okay.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.720
So here was my thought on this is there is some value to just maybe Control-G.

26:56.720 --> 27:00.040
Yeah.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.320
That's pretty great, actually.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.640
It's creating a gist right now.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.360
That's pretty great.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.360
There is some...

27:05.360 --> 27:09.120
Yeah, I guess if I am stuck on Mac, Windows, and Linux...

27:09.120 --> 27:10.120
Yeah, there's my gist.

27:10.120 --> 27:13.680
Of course, I did it out of an image file, so of course it's ass, but it did it.

27:13.680 --> 27:14.680
It did it.

27:14.680 --> 27:18.840
If I'm stuck on Mac or Windows, but my main OS is Linux, maybe then I would want to have

27:18.840 --> 27:20.980
a file manager that's cross-platform like this.

27:20.980 --> 27:21.980
But come on.

27:21.980 --> 27:22.980
Go with me, dude.

27:22.980 --> 27:23.980
Would you ever use this?

27:23.980 --> 27:24.980
Yeah.

27:24.980 --> 27:25.980
Why not?

27:25.980 --> 27:26.980
Well, Explorer sucks.

27:26.980 --> 27:27.980
Maybe that's why.

27:27.980 --> 27:28.980
Nautilus sucks too.

27:28.980 --> 27:29.980
Yeah, but not as bad as...

27:29.980 --> 27:31.200
I mean, I don't know.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.920
Just look at them side by side.

27:32.920 --> 27:37.960
So here is JumpFM, and here, let me bring up Nautilus.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.520
Nautilus looks so much better.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.520
I disagree.

27:41.520 --> 27:44.400
I hate how Nautilus looks.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.840
This looks like a Flash application on my desktop.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.720
It looks like it's weird.

27:48.720 --> 27:52.160
It doesn't follow my desktop convention at all.

27:52.160 --> 27:55.480
Yeah, but that's just a problem with the implementation of the app.

27:55.480 --> 27:58.000
You can make Electron apps follow your desktop.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Man, I don't know.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.120
To me, it seems like Nautilus is way better looking.

28:02.120 --> 28:06.720
It also doesn't help that you're running a cute app in a GDK environment.

28:06.720 --> 28:07.720
Yeah.

28:07.720 --> 28:15.040
Well, I mean, I just tried Jump inside of Plasma, and it looks like...

28:15.040 --> 28:16.040
About the same?

28:16.040 --> 28:17.040
Yeah.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.040
So what are your impressions?

28:18.040 --> 28:23.360
I mean, it looks interesting as far as the speed of its searching.

28:23.360 --> 28:27.280
The find tool is not that useful, it seems so far.

28:27.280 --> 28:35.000
The flat thing is cool, although it's not as effective as you would assume.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.680
It flattens some of the stuff and shows you some files, but it also skips other files.

28:40.680 --> 28:44.520
If I just flatten this, it should be showing me files that are in the main folder, but

28:44.520 --> 28:48.400
it's skipping that and showing other folders, so that's weird.

28:48.400 --> 28:56.080
But overall, I mean, it's interesting, although 200 megs total on my system is not acceptable

28:56.080 --> 28:58.120
for a file manager.

28:58.120 --> 29:01.720
I'm so tired of the whole memory usage argument.

29:01.720 --> 29:04.240
But 200 megs for a file manager?

29:04.240 --> 29:14.400
We're in a world where 32 gigabyte PCs are common.

29:14.400 --> 29:19.480
It's 32 gigabytes for a file manager that is not even that good.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.720
I'm looking at my folder right now.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.720
At this point, I'm just talking about the whole memory usage argument in general, not

29:24.720 --> 29:26.960
specifically for this app.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.520
Okay.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.440
I agree with the argument in general.

29:30.440 --> 29:34.960
There are some Electron apps that manage it very well and even do hibernation in certain

29:34.960 --> 29:37.600
cases and stuff, so those are fine.

29:37.600 --> 29:42.120
It's just the ones that recognize that Electron needs to be managed, I'm okay with those.

29:42.120 --> 29:46.960
Things like this, where the features it's offering are not even implemented very well,

29:46.960 --> 29:52.880
like if you go to the flat mode, it looks cool, but I have stuff in the home folder.

29:52.880 --> 29:57.600
I'm in the home folder just to see what happens if it finds every file.

29:57.600 --> 30:01.480
It finds random files in some folders and it skips the rest.

30:01.480 --> 30:07.440
I feel like if we crapped on every project that didn't work on one of its earlier releases,

30:07.440 --> 30:09.600
then we'd have a lot less projects.

30:09.600 --> 30:14.520
I guess where I go with it is, is there a line?

30:14.520 --> 30:19.080
Is there a line where you say, these things should be native applications on a platform?

30:19.080 --> 30:22.880
Like for a house, you have to have a foundation for your house.

30:22.880 --> 30:26.520
You could build the house materials out of anything, but the house has to be a solid

30:26.520 --> 30:27.520
foundation.

30:27.520 --> 30:28.520
Yeah.

30:28.520 --> 30:33.800
I mean, I don't think that native really matters anymore.

30:33.800 --> 30:34.800
Look at Discord.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.800
It's not native.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.640
You got to have something to launch the web browser.

30:37.640 --> 30:38.640
Well, yeah.

30:38.640 --> 30:48.320
I mean, native is not that necessary, sure, and Discord is a good example, but it is still

30:48.320 --> 30:49.320
important.

30:49.320 --> 30:54.760
In a file manager, native is important and just because it's going to be faster, because

30:54.760 --> 30:59.280
this is fast, but it's also incredibly inaccurate.

30:59.280 --> 31:03.780
If you do the flat system and it shows you these files and it's cool, but it's skipping

31:03.780 --> 31:09.480
files that are in the current folder I'm in and going to other folders, it's not reliable

31:09.480 --> 31:10.480
in any way whatsoever.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.240
For me, it's not fast enough, to be honest.

31:12.240 --> 31:15.960
I mean, it's fast once it's running, but it does that thing that some Electron apps do

31:15.960 --> 31:21.520
where the frame of the application comes up and then the inside of the application flashes

31:21.520 --> 31:28.520
white, and then the UI elements render in, sort of like how a webpage loads, actually.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.520
When I want to just open up my file manager super quick, I've already had to do the mental

31:32.520 --> 31:36.440
gymnastics of, is this something I do on the terminal with LS, or is this something I bother

31:36.440 --> 31:37.840
firing at my file manager?

31:37.840 --> 31:41.280
So I've already made that decision tree, which already takes time, and then I go through

31:41.280 --> 31:46.220
that decision tree and I end up with this app that's taking me, I don't know, noticeably

31:46.220 --> 31:47.440
longer than my native app to load.

31:47.440 --> 31:51.360
The thing is, you guys are making arguments for problems that can be solved by better

31:51.360 --> 31:52.360
code.

31:52.360 --> 31:53.360
Would you...

31:53.360 --> 31:58.280
Yeah, I suppose, like they could do a TSR in the background and leave it always running

31:58.280 --> 31:59.480
to launch faster, I suppose.

31:59.480 --> 32:02.240
Well, no, you can just optimize the code so it launches quicker.

32:02.240 --> 32:07.640
I don't really know any Electron app that launches as quick as a native application.

32:07.640 --> 32:12.840
Once it's up and running, I agree, you can have it pretty competitive, but launch time

32:12.840 --> 32:17.360
seems particularly important for a file manager, like your terminal, too.

32:17.360 --> 32:20.800
That also seems like something you want to launch really fast.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.800
I'm playing around with it.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.080
Discord takes forever and just has little splash messages like these weird, like the

32:25.080 --> 32:26.800
rabbits are loading or something.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.800
That's not a bad way to go.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.280
A splash message isn't a bad way to go, at least then you know it's working.

32:30.280 --> 32:33.360
I think Discord takes long because it's loading all the messages from the server and stuff.

32:33.360 --> 32:37.000
Yeah, and it's checking for updates and every time, too.

32:37.000 --> 32:43.540
I would say that this jump FM is interesting, but it doesn't do what it claims to do.

32:43.540 --> 32:47.160
If it didn't claim these things and say these things are good, that's one thing, but it's

32:47.160 --> 32:53.520
claiming like the flat system doesn't work, the searching isn't useful, it's not finding

32:53.520 --> 32:54.520
any things.

32:54.520 --> 32:59.320
I'm like searching for files that I know are in like one folder, like lower, and it's not

32:59.320 --> 33:00.320
finding that at all.

33:00.320 --> 33:05.240
Have you turned on the syntax highlighting, the quote unquote, where it does different

33:05.240 --> 33:07.120
color coding for different file types?

33:07.120 --> 33:08.120
No.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.120
I think that's useful.

33:09.120 --> 33:13.120
That's actually kind of nice, especially when you're working on like a website, and

33:13.120 --> 33:15.360
they have a screenshot here, and you've got-

33:15.360 --> 33:16.920
You need to skim to the greens.

33:16.920 --> 33:20.880
Yeah, you got your index.html, which is always green, your JSON files are always red, your

33:20.880 --> 33:23.120
CSS is always gray.

33:23.120 --> 33:27.320
It's interesting, but if it doesn't do the rest of the stuff, then what's the point?

33:27.320 --> 33:28.720
Yeah, there's stuff in there I like.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.840
Actually, I think their jump menu is pretty great.

33:30.840 --> 33:34.160
I would like every freaking file manager to do this jump menu thing.

33:34.160 --> 33:38.000
Yeah, I'm not saying the app is great as it is, I'm saying it has potential.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Yeah, I agree with you.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
The jump menu's pretty cool.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Yeah, like the-

33:41.000 --> 33:43.200
It reminds me of Sublime Text.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.200
Yeah, exactly.

33:44.200 --> 33:49.000
It's just like the Sublime, or Gnome do essentially, or whatever.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.640
But the other thing is, is like being able to upload a gist, and files that are displayed

33:53.640 --> 34:00.840
depending on their git status, the jump menu and the git integration is really shit that

34:00.840 --> 34:05.120
every important Linux file manager should be shipping already, if you think about it.

34:05.120 --> 34:09.480
Because we keep talking about on this show and other shows, and obviously Dell and other

34:09.480 --> 34:14.780
companies, and System76 keep talking about focusing on users that are creating software.

34:14.780 --> 34:20.040
People like the Sputnik program, for example, is going really after the web developer, sysadmin

34:20.040 --> 34:25.040
market that is using Linux on production and using Linux on the Sputnik laptops.

34:25.040 --> 34:30.800
And that focus, they have seen 100% year over year growth by focusing on that niche within

34:30.800 --> 34:32.400
a niche of Linux users.

34:32.400 --> 34:36.480
They realized they had to hyper focus at a certain niche of Linux users, which is incredible

34:36.480 --> 34:38.960
if you think about it, because Linux is already such a niche.

34:38.960 --> 34:42.460
And these users, these are kinds of features that they want.

34:42.460 --> 34:44.200
And I feel like our...

34:44.200 --> 34:51.360
This is just a short rant, but I feel like our projects, like GNOME, are so focused on

34:51.360 --> 34:58.400
bringing in the new user that it takes a damn memory eating monster to come along and actually

34:58.400 --> 35:00.440
ship something that's new and innovative.

35:00.440 --> 35:04.520
We haven't had anything interesting happen in our file managers in years.

35:04.520 --> 35:09.320
In fact, on the GNOME side, features have literally just gotten removed year after year.

35:09.320 --> 35:11.560
Some have finally been re-added recently.

35:11.560 --> 35:14.400
And this kind of stuff, meanwhile, has just been sitting out there.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.400
This should be...

35:15.400 --> 35:16.400
This should be...

35:16.400 --> 35:19.360
This GNOME file should have been shipping this a year ago.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.360
Dolphin should be doing this already.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.100
This needs to already be happening.

35:23.100 --> 35:26.960
And this is kind of sad you have to go get it from an Electron app.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.500
Dolphin does have the syntax thing.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.880
Dolphin has everything else like the Git integration and stuff.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.840
Oh, I was specifically talking about Git and the jump thing.

35:34.840 --> 35:38.640
So if it's got that, then I take it back for Dolphin, because that's the thing I really

35:38.640 --> 35:39.640
think.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.120
Can you, does Dolphin do that?

35:42.120 --> 35:43.120
I don't think so, no.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.120
So that would be great.

35:44.120 --> 35:45.120
It does have the Git thing.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.120
The Git stuff is good, too.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.120
That's awesome.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.120
So I've got to play with that.

35:48.120 --> 35:49.120
Dolphin just feels terrible to use.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.880
Is it like the services KIO slave stuff?

35:50.880 --> 35:55.600
Or is it like legit, because the thing about this is you can actually sort the files in

35:55.600 --> 35:57.920
your file browser based on their Git status.

35:57.920 --> 36:01.080
That's a whole other level.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.120
I think it's KIO stuff.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.120
Yeah.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.720
Even having something is nice, though.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.040
And then, of course, it's got plugins and filtering and stuff like that.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.040
So yeah.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.160
There are filterings.

36:10.160 --> 36:14.040
There's the filter in the search bar and stuff like that that does something, but it's not

36:14.040 --> 36:17.840
like automatically loading stuff like the jump thing is doing.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.360
The jump thing, I think, is particularly great.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.680
I think the Git stuff is particularly great.

36:20.680 --> 36:24.000
The plugin stuff, I don't really know if I need that in my file manager.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Filtering stuff, yeah.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
You can basically do that.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
I don't know, Chris.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
You've got plenty of plugins in GIT.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.080
You know, if it let Google finally release a Google Drive client for Linux, maybe that

36:34.080 --> 36:35.080
would be worth it.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.080
Well, I think you need-

36:36.080 --> 36:38.080
There's Google Drive support for Dolphin.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.080
Yeah.

36:39.080 --> 36:41.880
It'd probably be pretty easy to implement in Jump FM.

36:41.880 --> 36:42.880
Yeah.

36:42.880 --> 36:43.880
Oh, gosh.

36:43.880 --> 36:44.880
Yeah, probably.

36:44.880 --> 36:45.880
Nice web extensions.

36:45.880 --> 36:46.880
Yeah, really.

36:46.880 --> 36:47.880
Yeah, no kidding.

36:47.880 --> 36:50.280
Anyways, it's an interesting thing to play around with if you want to play, A, with an

36:50.280 --> 36:54.200
app image, because that's what it is, and, B, with a file manager that's actually trying

36:54.200 --> 36:57.760
to do something different for the first time in a few years, so you could check that out.

36:57.760 --> 37:03.120
I definitely like the thought of being able to just take all of my apps with me on whatever

37:03.120 --> 37:04.120
platform.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.120
Yeah.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.120
I completely agree.

37:06.120 --> 37:08.920
I think one of the things that I've said for a long time is a great way to convert people

37:08.920 --> 37:09.920
to Linux and-

37:09.920 --> 37:12.740
Just have a completely portable workflow.

37:12.740 --> 37:17.120
Put people on LibreOffice, Firefox, and now Jump FM, and they're ready to go.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.920
You put them on Windows and let them run that for six months, then move over to Linux, use

37:19.920 --> 37:22.800
the same apps, nothing changes.

37:22.800 --> 37:26.080
It's legitimately the smoothest way to move people over to Linux, but they're not going

37:26.080 --> 37:27.080
to need to anymore.

37:27.080 --> 37:31.200
That's going to come to an end, because Google is launching Chrome Enterprise subscription

37:31.200 --> 37:36.900
service for Chrome OS, essentially signaling to the entire world that, okay, we're ready

37:36.900 --> 37:39.160
for Chrome OS to take over in the enterprise.

37:39.160 --> 37:43.400
They've experimented with this a little bit, actually, in the past with Chromebooks for

37:43.400 --> 37:47.280
Work was the program, but this is a totally different beast.

37:47.280 --> 37:53.320
First of all, it's $50 per device per year, which for a business is just an unbelievably

37:53.320 --> 37:54.320
low price.

37:54.320 --> 37:57.440
They could have charged legitimately 50 bucks per month, and businesses would have paid

37:57.440 --> 37:58.440
this.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.440
Chrome OS as a service.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.440
Yeah.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.400
So you get a number of nice capabilities.

38:02.400 --> 38:05.040
They have a little chart here.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.040
Holy crap.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.040
Can I zoom in on this?

38:07.040 --> 38:08.040
Because this is quite the chart.

38:08.040 --> 38:14.360
So additional things that you get above and beyond stock Chrome OS with Chrome Enterprise,

38:14.360 --> 38:15.360
and this isn't the browser.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.360
This is the OS.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.360
They just call it Chrome Enterprise.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.000
They dropped the OS for whatever reason.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.600
You get managed Google Play beta support for the apps that can be installed on Chrome OS.

38:23.600 --> 38:27.120
You can manage the browser better that's on Chrome OS.

38:27.120 --> 38:30.800
You get full-fledged remote printer management support, but this is the big one that they're

38:30.800 --> 38:35.960
really marketing right here.

38:35.960 --> 38:42.400
Full-fledged Microsoft Active Directory integration, including single sign-on with their Google

38:42.400 --> 38:45.920
accounts and everything, all authenticated via Active Directory.

38:45.920 --> 38:50.200
You also get kiosk mode and public mode that it automatically delete.

38:50.200 --> 38:54.080
You get managed network and proxies that you can remote push to the devices, which I thought

38:54.080 --> 38:56.540
you could do with regular Chrome, but they say Chrome Enterprise.

38:56.540 --> 39:02.300
You get theft prevention wherever the hell that is, and of course, of course, 24-7 enterprise

39:02.300 --> 39:04.760
support for $50 a year per device.

39:04.760 --> 39:08.040
All at a much cheaper price than Windows licenses.

39:08.040 --> 39:11.440
Much, much, much, much cheaper, and the hardware is cheaper.

39:11.440 --> 39:12.980
It's more interchangeable.

39:12.980 --> 39:16.840
There's this thing that has happened many times, and I bet a lot of you that are in

39:16.840 --> 39:18.880
IT know this story.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.440
There is a thing about the very high levels of a company.

39:21.440 --> 39:26.520
Every now and then, you get one of these employees, it's man or women, who are high enough in

39:26.520 --> 39:30.600
the company where what they do is so damn important that any disruption is immediately

39:30.600 --> 39:35.760
addressed, even if it means they go through computers at least once a year.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.360
I had this client every six months.

39:38.360 --> 39:40.160
It was his computer.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.840
We finally got to the point, I think I talked about this in one of our shows, where we just

39:42.840 --> 39:52.720
built this monster maniac system, when SSDs were still really expensive, and Xeon processors

39:52.720 --> 39:57.760
put this thing in a raid, started doing image snapshot backups every single night, just

39:57.760 --> 40:01.320
went all out, and he burned through that system.

40:01.320 --> 40:03.040
He just burned through that system.

40:03.040 --> 40:08.480
The thing for him was, in a day, he's working with five, six million dollar deals a day,

40:08.480 --> 40:15.200
maybe more, so a $7,000 monster machine was no big deal to him.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.760
There were other employees who would just get some of his hand-me-downs that would still

40:18.760 --> 40:19.760
work.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.760
He was all filtered down.

40:20.760 --> 40:24.600
These things, these things are so cheap to replace that your employees can destroy them.

40:24.600 --> 40:25.600
They can lose them.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.280
You can wipe them.

40:27.280 --> 40:34.560
It's such an enticing business proposition, especially when you look at their other cloud

40:34.560 --> 40:39.320
services that this ties in with, because when you start integrating Microsoft Active Directory

40:39.320 --> 40:44.280
with single sign-on to the Google cloud services, you get the Google App Suite with this thing.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.280
You get Chrome OS.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.280
You get cloud storage.

40:46.280 --> 40:49.360
You can authenticate and manage the permissions via Active Directory.

40:49.360 --> 40:57.160
This is that final piece that clicks Chrome OS into this really ideal position for businesses,

40:57.160 --> 41:02.760
and then, for some really stupid reason, they're only charging $50 a year.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.960
Like I'm saying, people would pay $50 a month for this.

41:05.960 --> 41:11.520
Well, it's a good way to lock them in for all the other services.

41:11.520 --> 41:16.680
You'll also be able to have a managed enterprise app store for just your users.

41:16.680 --> 41:21.720
It's something that's in beta right now, but it's going to use Chrome OS's new ability

41:21.720 --> 41:26.800
to run Android apps, and you'll be able to give them a branded Play Store page that's

41:26.800 --> 41:30.600
the only section of the Play Store they can access that has all of your company apps on

41:30.600 --> 41:34.680
it.

41:34.680 --> 41:39.720
Google is working their ass off to compete with Microsoft.

41:39.720 --> 41:43.280
I sort of set this up as Linux is a little screwed.

41:43.280 --> 41:46.720
All these companies that run Linux are just going to go with this instead, maybe, but

41:46.720 --> 41:47.960
I don't really think that's the case.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.580
I think people that are going to run Linux on the desktop need a more powerful operating

41:50.580 --> 41:55.200
system to begin with, but who this really is going to screw over is Microsoft because

41:55.200 --> 41:59.000
this is not only eating away at their OEM's hardware sales.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.160
It's eating away at the whole office lock-in thing because this also comes with all these

42:03.160 --> 42:08.080
great Google Cloud services.

42:08.080 --> 42:09.400
They're going for it, dude.

42:09.400 --> 42:10.400
Google's going for it.

42:10.400 --> 42:11.400
They're really going for it with this.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.200
Good on them, I suppose.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.200
Good on them.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.240
It does seem like a typical Google thing.

42:17.240 --> 42:21.280
You just have this product that sits there and is a sleeper for half a decade or more,

42:21.280 --> 42:24.280
and then all of a sudden, it just clicks into place.

42:24.280 --> 42:25.280
Yeah, I suppose.

42:25.280 --> 42:28.360
That sounds like how Microsoft used to do things.

42:28.360 --> 42:31.280
Google more and more to me feels like the new Microsoft.

42:31.280 --> 42:36.600
That was a Microsoft move for a long time, and this whole ecosystem lock-in strategy

42:36.600 --> 42:39.040
is a Microsoft one.

42:39.040 --> 42:40.600
Google's just doing it with Cloud services.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.200
Microsoft did it with file formats.

42:43.200 --> 42:46.400
It's the 90s all over again, everybody.

42:46.400 --> 42:49.520
Hey, speaking of the 90s, let's make your Bash prompt even cooler.

42:49.520 --> 42:55.440
Your Bash RC is a handy little place you can go to make your prompt look badass and stuff,

42:55.440 --> 42:58.800
like from the movies and whatnot.

42:58.800 --> 43:03.360
I forgot who passed this along to me, so apologies, but this is EasyPrompt.net.

43:03.360 --> 43:05.160
I think it came from our Discord.

43:05.160 --> 43:06.160
Yeah.

43:06.160 --> 43:09.520
Yeah, I think it was in the content channel in our Discord.

43:09.520 --> 43:12.200
Thank you to whoever did this, because this is so fun.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.720
It lets you pick the elements that you want to show up in your prompt.

43:14.720 --> 43:18.400
Say you want maybe your host name to be in your command prompt, your shell version, the

43:18.400 --> 43:22.600
current directory you're in, or the whole path is actually my favorite one, the shell

43:22.600 --> 43:25.500
release, or date and time information.

43:25.500 --> 43:27.440
Isn't that cool?

43:27.440 --> 43:31.120
What you get here is a webpage, and you pick these blocks that you want.

43:31.120 --> 43:32.760
You have your basic elements.

43:32.760 --> 43:34.520
I like to put in username.

43:34.520 --> 43:40.480
I also like to put in the current path of the directory, and why not also have some

43:40.480 --> 43:41.520
status elements in there?

43:41.520 --> 43:44.500
You could have things like get status, or you could have time.

43:44.500 --> 43:46.680
You could have time or extra characters in there.

43:46.680 --> 43:49.760
Maybe you like to have a few extra ASCII characters in there to make it look badass.

43:49.760 --> 43:50.920
I totally understand.

43:50.920 --> 43:53.000
I totally understand.

43:53.000 --> 43:59.080
What's great about this is as you click these different things, you can move them around

43:59.080 --> 44:03.520
in this web interface, and it gives you a real-time preview output of what your prompt

44:03.520 --> 44:08.320
is going to look like, and then in a fourth box, just four boxes, in the fourth box, it

44:08.320 --> 44:13.640
gives you the code that you copy pasta into your Bash RC file to make your command prompt

44:13.640 --> 44:15.480
look like that.

44:15.480 --> 44:17.760
How cool is that?

44:17.760 --> 44:18.760
I was messing around with this.

44:18.760 --> 44:25.000
I was just deleting stuff and adding new stuff and putting the full DNS name in there, all

44:25.000 --> 44:26.880
that kind of stuff, shell version.

44:26.880 --> 44:30.960
It's really neat, and you can add spaces in there if you want it to look right.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.480
You can mess with all that kind of stuff.

44:32.480 --> 44:35.520
It was CodeChris on Discord.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.520
Thank you, WW.

44:36.520 --> 44:37.520
CodeChris.

44:37.520 --> 44:38.520
CodeChris.

44:38.520 --> 44:39.520
CodeChris.

44:39.520 --> 44:40.520
Thank you, WW.

44:40.520 --> 44:41.520
Thank you to CodeChris, and thank you to WW for pointing it out.

44:41.520 --> 44:45.520
It's easyprompt.net if you want to play around with that and make your RC all cool.

44:45.520 --> 44:49.600
If you want something a bit more advanced, more crazy, there's something called Powerline

44:49.600 --> 44:50.600
Shell.

44:50.600 --> 44:51.600
Oh, yeah.

44:51.600 --> 44:52.600
Oh, yeah.

44:52.600 --> 44:53.600
That is really intense.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.600
We've got to have talked about that.

44:54.600 --> 44:55.600
Right?

44:55.600 --> 44:56.600
Maybe, but it's really damn awesome.

44:56.600 --> 44:57.600
Okay.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.760
In fact, I think it's installed by default in Solus.

44:59.760 --> 45:00.760
Really?

45:00.760 --> 45:01.760
Yeah.

45:01.760 --> 45:02.760
I don't know.

45:02.760 --> 45:03.760
Ike knows what's up.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.720
I don't know if it's turned on by default, but I know it's in there.

45:05.720 --> 45:06.720
Yeah.

45:06.720 --> 45:07.720
So PowerShell gives you...

45:07.720 --> 45:12.760
So if you've ever seen screenshots of people's computers that have the terminal up, and then

45:12.760 --> 45:17.920
they have in the terminal on the command prompt, they have the directory path in these cool,

45:17.920 --> 45:19.920
almost capsule-looking...

45:19.920 --> 45:20.920
How would you describe that?

45:20.920 --> 45:23.080
I don't know.

45:23.080 --> 45:27.600
It's kind of like a graphical representation in your command line.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.600
Yeah.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.600
It's neat.

45:29.600 --> 45:30.600
It's neat-looking.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.880
There's a lot of cool things that it does.

45:32.880 --> 45:33.880
You can...

45:33.880 --> 45:34.880
Yeah, that's really cool.

45:34.880 --> 45:36.600
PowerShell is also a cool way to make your trip.

45:36.600 --> 45:37.600
Okay.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.560
Now, just all of a sudden, we turned it into a cool thing to hack the terminal.

45:39.560 --> 45:40.560
Yeah.

45:40.560 --> 45:49.120
I actually had it on my mind because somebody I know from IRC just rewrote it in Go, and

45:49.120 --> 45:50.680
it's actually way, way faster.

45:50.680 --> 45:51.680
Oh, man.

45:51.680 --> 45:52.680
What?

45:52.680 --> 45:53.680
PowerShell?

45:53.680 --> 45:54.680
Yeah.

45:54.680 --> 45:55.680
Is it available for Linux in Go?

45:55.680 --> 45:56.680
Yeah.

45:56.680 --> 45:57.680
Where do I...

45:57.680 --> 45:58.680
Yeah.

45:58.680 --> 45:59.680
So it's navigation trees, what some people in chatroom call it.

45:59.680 --> 46:00.680
Yeah.

46:00.680 --> 46:03.360
You know, if that's available for Linux, that'd be pretty cool.

46:03.360 --> 46:04.360
Yeah.

46:04.360 --> 46:07.680
It's github.com slash justgen slash powerline-go.

46:07.680 --> 46:08.680
Powerline-go.

46:08.680 --> 46:09.680
Of course.

46:09.680 --> 46:10.680
Of course.

46:10.680 --> 46:11.680
There's...

46:11.680 --> 46:12.680
You know what?

46:12.680 --> 46:13.680
No way.

46:13.680 --> 46:14.680
Okay.

46:14.680 --> 46:15.680
Now, wake me...

46:15.680 --> 46:16.680
You know what?

46:16.680 --> 46:17.680
I'm gonna wait.

46:17.680 --> 46:18.680
You know why?

46:18.680 --> 46:19.680
Because just wake me up when the Rust port comes.

46:19.680 --> 46:20.680
That's when I'll...

46:20.680 --> 46:21.680
DigitalOcean.com.

46:21.680 --> 46:25.840
Go over to DigitalOcean.com, create an account, and use our promo code of absolute power and

46:25.840 --> 46:26.840
performance.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.840
That's D-O Unplugged.

46:27.840 --> 46:31.520
You create your account, then you apply D-O Unplugged, one word, and you get a $10 credit.

46:31.520 --> 46:34.640
Now, keep that in mind, because DigitalOcean's pricing is amazing.

46:34.640 --> 46:37.040
I love their three cents an hour machine.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.520
It's very fast.

46:38.520 --> 46:42.300
It's a great way to try out a project, mess around with something, and then totally economical

46:42.300 --> 46:43.300
to leave in production.

46:43.300 --> 46:46.320
You can get started in less than 55 seconds, you'll be logged in and ready to go.

46:46.320 --> 46:50.440
They got SSDs for all the different types of systems you might want, from the really

46:50.440 --> 46:55.880
high-end CPU systems and the rigs with lots of memory, all the way down to the $5 a month

46:55.880 --> 46:56.880
systems.

46:56.880 --> 46:57.880
They got SSD.

46:57.880 --> 47:01.160
And the hypervisors have super fast 40-gigabit connections coming in.

47:01.160 --> 47:03.760
Of course, they run Linux and KVM for the virtualizer.

47:03.760 --> 47:09.480
And then DigitalOcean has built an API that is really nice, super smooth and simple.

47:09.480 --> 47:10.480
We work with it all the time.

47:10.480 --> 47:13.300
In fact, I think all of their tools use it as well.

47:13.300 --> 47:16.700
And because of that, there's lots of open source projects available using it.

47:16.700 --> 47:18.840
You can just install them on your phone or your Linux desktop.

47:18.840 --> 47:21.520
There's some that work right in your tray that you can manage your droplets.

47:21.520 --> 47:26.020
They have a block storage to make it quick and easy to attach, lots of more storage up

47:26.020 --> 47:28.640
to 16 terabytes to a droplet.

47:28.640 --> 47:31.980
Pre-build open source apps that you can monitor or you can deploy really quick.

47:31.980 --> 47:32.980
And monitoring.

47:32.980 --> 47:35.520
I do like that monitoring too.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.200
We use it mostly on and off.

47:37.200 --> 47:42.080
See, the thing about the monitoring that's really nice is, how do you know how powerful

47:42.080 --> 47:43.600
of a droplet do you need?

47:43.600 --> 47:44.600
How do you know?

47:44.600 --> 47:45.600
So it's...

47:45.600 --> 47:46.600
You monitor it.

47:46.600 --> 47:47.600
Yeah, you monitor it.

47:47.600 --> 47:48.600
And it's easy to expand.

47:48.600 --> 47:51.120
So go with the $5 a month and see if it works for your workload.

47:51.120 --> 47:57.120
A lot of people like to just use it for something like a WordPress site or an email server.

47:57.120 --> 47:59.800
I don't recommend running your own email server, but you definitely can.

47:59.800 --> 48:02.760
And you don't need more than the $5 a month droplet to do that.

48:02.760 --> 48:05.520
I've expanded a couple of droplets.

48:05.520 --> 48:10.200
All you have to do is basically just go into where it asks you how you want to expand it.

48:10.200 --> 48:12.560
You change the things and then you just reload it and it's got the new stuff.

48:12.560 --> 48:13.560
So just try it that way.

48:13.560 --> 48:16.760
So, you know, whatever you're doing, like a Nextcloud system, this is a great example

48:16.760 --> 48:17.760
of that.

48:17.760 --> 48:23.080
I've done this very...with my Nextcloud instance because we uploaded a bunch of pictures.

48:23.080 --> 48:24.080
It grew.

48:24.080 --> 48:26.120
I'm like, I think I want to keep that stuff on there.

48:26.120 --> 48:27.500
So I'll just add more storage.

48:27.500 --> 48:28.500
And it's so economical.

48:28.500 --> 48:29.500
It's seamless, too.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.360
Like you don't have to go and like edit config files.

48:31.360 --> 48:32.360
No, I know.

48:32.360 --> 48:33.360
It's DigitalOcean, dude.

48:33.360 --> 48:34.360
DigitalOcean.

48:34.360 --> 48:35.360
DigitalOcean.com.

48:35.360 --> 48:37.160
Just use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

48:37.160 --> 48:38.160
DOUNPLUGGED.

48:38.160 --> 48:39.160
It's one word.

48:39.160 --> 48:43.920
You apply it to your account after you sign up, DigitalOcean.com.

48:43.920 --> 48:46.800
So this week I got some things to say about Ubuntu.

48:46.800 --> 48:50.840
And we have sort of like a low summer turnout.

48:50.840 --> 48:54.880
I think as the summer wraps up, I'm going to be glad in some ways because I think we'll

48:54.880 --> 48:56.880
have more people show up in the mumble room.

48:56.880 --> 48:59.040
Either that or everybody wants us to switch to Discord.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.140
That could be the subliminal message they're giving us.

49:01.140 --> 49:05.160
By not showing up in mumble, maybe they're saying, switch over to Discord, guys.

49:05.160 --> 49:07.880
Because if they wanted us to stay on mumble, they'd surely be here.

49:07.880 --> 49:09.980
So something to think about.

49:09.980 --> 49:17.360
But in the meantime, this is actually to my advantage because neither Popey nor Wimpy

49:17.360 --> 49:19.540
have joined us for today's episode.

49:19.540 --> 49:25.920
And I have some things to say about Ubuntu.

49:25.920 --> 49:27.660
I don't run Ubuntu.

49:27.660 --> 49:28.960
I'm running Solus on this machine.

49:28.960 --> 49:33.320
I mean, I do run Ubuntu on some of our systems here at JB, but none of my personal daily

49:33.320 --> 49:34.320
use systems.

49:34.320 --> 49:35.320
The mumble room.

49:35.320 --> 49:36.320
Yep.

49:36.320 --> 49:37.320
I know that one does.

49:37.320 --> 49:38.320
But none of my personal daily use systems run Ubuntu.

49:38.320 --> 49:42.440
So I don't have really much of a horse in this race.

49:42.440 --> 49:46.320
So just full disclosure, this doesn't really impact me.

49:46.320 --> 49:49.320
But I was going to save this.

49:49.320 --> 49:52.480
I was going to save this to talk about it with Noah on user error so that way he could

49:52.480 --> 49:53.580
back me up.

49:53.580 --> 49:57.000
So it wouldn't just be me saying this because it's just going to sound like Crazy Chris.

49:57.000 --> 50:03.880
But I think what we are seeing with Ubuntu 17.10 is what happens when an adult makes

50:03.880 --> 50:05.760
a Linux distribution.

50:05.760 --> 50:10.600
And I don't mean to be demeaning to all the other projects out there, but Canonical is

50:10.600 --> 50:17.040
doing things with 17.10 that I simply can't understand why it's taken, frankly, it's taken

50:17.040 --> 50:20.640
until they've come along and made a gnome version for any of this shit to happen.

50:20.640 --> 50:30.560
It's sort of opening my eyes to how this could be done better by all the other Linux distributions.

50:30.560 --> 50:33.440
So there's several different avenues I could take.

50:33.440 --> 50:38.520
I could talk about the thousands of fixes they've now submitted to fix Bluetooth upstream.

50:38.520 --> 50:40.440
I could talk about that for a moment.

50:40.440 --> 50:45.220
I could talk about the fact that they're finally the only distribution that's actually taking

50:45.220 --> 50:50.440
on hardware accelerated video playback and testing it and applying patches and getting

50:50.440 --> 50:54.440
it to work from the web browser down to the video on your screen.

50:54.440 --> 50:58.640
Everybody has claimed they have it, but no one actually got it working until Canonical

50:58.640 --> 50:59.640
came along.

50:59.640 --> 51:03.960
I could talk about that all day.

51:03.960 --> 51:08.320
But today we're going to talk about the new doc.

51:08.320 --> 51:14.720
Because this simple, simple thing that they are doing perfectly illustrates what I'm talking

51:14.720 --> 51:15.720
about.

51:15.720 --> 51:19.360
And I guess maybe for context, I'll give you one more example of something they've done

51:19.360 --> 51:26.480
recently that needs a lot more discussion and no one's talking about it.

51:26.480 --> 51:30.400
Canonical is doing something very unique with the way that they are implementing their GNOME

51:30.400 --> 51:33.120
desktop in Ubuntu 17.10.

51:33.120 --> 51:38.480
They are shipping it as a session option, just like the way that upstream GNOME ships

51:38.480 --> 51:40.660
GNOME Classic.

51:40.660 --> 51:44.200
You choose GNOME Classic and it's like you're in a different version of GNOME Shell, but

51:44.200 --> 51:46.160
you're not in a fork of GNOME Shell.

51:46.160 --> 51:49.440
You're not in something that conflicts with your totally tricked out version of GNOME

51:49.440 --> 51:50.440
Shell.

51:50.440 --> 51:53.120
You're just in a different GNOME Shell environment.

51:53.120 --> 51:58.800
GNOME Shell has been specifically architected to support this.

51:58.800 --> 52:03.480
This was a design intention of GNOME Shell.

52:03.480 --> 52:11.140
But every distribution out there from Fedora to Anagros just cocks up your main GNOME installation

52:11.140 --> 52:16.320
with their extensions that conflict with extensions from the actual publisher.

52:16.320 --> 52:22.120
They'll just install the favorite stock and just say, ah, screw it.

52:22.120 --> 52:24.980
Doesn't matter if it has the same extension ID as the one upstream.

52:24.980 --> 52:29.440
And then you consistently run into issues when you update your system.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.320
They couldn't have just implemented it in its own session.

52:31.320 --> 52:34.480
No, they didn't do any of that stuff.

52:34.480 --> 52:39.640
With 17.10, if you don't like the way Canonical ships GNOME, you log out, you choose the default

52:39.640 --> 52:42.680
option and you've got stock GNOME.

52:42.680 --> 52:44.720
None of their extensions are installed.

52:44.720 --> 52:48.360
Their new custom doc we're about to talk about doesn't pop up.

52:48.360 --> 52:49.880
It's just GNOME.

52:49.880 --> 52:51.480
And it's been built to support this.

52:51.480 --> 52:55.600
And yet it took this company to do it.

52:55.600 --> 52:59.000
The GNOME developers tried to show the way with the classic session is to show you how

52:59.000 --> 53:01.200
it could be done, but nobody did it.

53:01.200 --> 53:07.640
Everybody just had, for some reason, had to just modify the default GNOME session.

53:07.640 --> 53:13.240
But when we see them now doing something as simple as modifying a doc, you really see

53:13.240 --> 53:17.760
the care that's being taken in their approach with 17.10 and the sustainability that they're

53:17.760 --> 53:20.400
building into this distribution now.

53:20.400 --> 53:25.720
And anybody who said that Canonical isn't focused on the desktop, you've got to reevaluate

53:25.720 --> 53:29.840
the facts because this is a great example.

53:29.840 --> 53:37.240
So they're going to launch a doc that's their own doc by default in Ubuntu 17.10.

53:37.240 --> 53:44.540
It is a light fork of sort of the most famous and well-known doc for GNOME, Dash to Dock.

53:44.540 --> 53:47.000
And they've basically made a few tweaks to it.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.720
But it's how they've gone about all of this that really matters.

53:50.720 --> 53:55.200
I'm looking at you, Mint Project, with all of your different fricking forks.

53:55.200 --> 53:56.200
Xapps.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.200
Yeah.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.320
So how did Canonical do this?

53:58.320 --> 54:00.560
And why didn't they just ship Dash to Dock?

54:00.560 --> 54:04.620
This is, I guess you could call it a light fork.

54:04.620 --> 54:06.960
It's a fork done right.

54:06.960 --> 54:10.540
And I think it's really a sustainable approach.

54:10.540 --> 54:14.040
So first of all, let's cover some of the basics here.

54:14.040 --> 54:15.040
Why would they want it?

54:15.040 --> 54:16.320
Why would they want to have their own doc?

54:16.320 --> 54:19.720
Why not just use, if it's so popular, why not just use Dash to Dock?

54:19.720 --> 54:20.720
Why even bother?

54:20.720 --> 54:22.120
Why waste the time?

54:22.120 --> 54:24.000
Why have to invent their own thing?

54:24.000 --> 54:28.200
Well, first of all, this extension is installed by default on Ubuntu, just like I was talking

54:28.200 --> 54:30.200
about how Antigros does it.

54:30.200 --> 54:31.920
It means it comes from a package.

54:31.920 --> 54:35.080
It comes from a deb from the main Ubuntu archive.

54:35.080 --> 54:38.440
So they've got to package it because that's how it's getting installed.

54:38.440 --> 54:43.040
So now they're immediately, instantly, without ever even shipping an ISO, they're in this

54:43.040 --> 54:46.720
problem where Upstream is shipping their own version and publishing on the GNOME extension

54:46.720 --> 54:49.620
site and their version is different.

54:49.620 --> 54:52.880
It's immediately an issue because that is a very popular extension that's under active

54:52.880 --> 54:55.700
development.

54:55.700 --> 55:00.200
If Canonical's extension kept the same GNOME shell extension ID that Dash to Dock had,

55:00.200 --> 55:03.720
it would mean that users couldn't swap them out.

55:03.720 --> 55:07.800
You would either have to use the Ubuntu one or uninstall your doc, which would probably

55:07.800 --> 55:11.360
uninstall a whole bunch of other dependencies and then try to get Dash to Dock installed.

55:11.360 --> 55:14.920
So they've done this, for one reason they've done this, is so they have their own extension

55:14.920 --> 55:17.120
ID so you don't have this conflict.

55:17.120 --> 55:24.680
But what's so badass about their implementation is the settings you tweak, they're schema

55:24.680 --> 55:31.380
overrides so you can actually share settings between the Upstream doc and the Ubuntu doc.

55:31.380 --> 55:35.200
If you install the Upstream doc, the Ubuntu doc automatically gets disabled.

55:35.200 --> 55:39.920
If you uninstall Dash to Dock, the Ubuntu doc automatically comes back on.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.320
Exactly the kind of behavior you would expect.

55:41.320 --> 55:44.680
They tweaked a few other small things about Dash to Dock, like they automatically made

55:44.680 --> 55:49.880
it top to bottom vertical, just like the Unity launcher is, so it looks like Unity.

55:49.880 --> 55:53.120
They tweaked a few things to make it look a little more like Unity, so that way it's

55:53.120 --> 55:56.280
sort of an easier, smoother transition for existing users.

55:56.280 --> 56:01.160
But here's the great thing, too, is they worked with the developers, they're all on board,

56:01.160 --> 56:04.160
they agreed this is a great way to do it, and they've been submitting patches Upstream,

56:04.160 --> 56:08.920
which they are already applying to their code base.

56:08.920 --> 56:16.240
In fact, if I recall, you can actually find canonical, yeah, so they've done an Upstream

56:16.240 --> 56:21.200
branch that has all of their own modifications, and they're gonna regularly rebase on top

56:21.200 --> 56:24.720
of the Upstream Dash to Dock to keep everything basically cozy.

56:24.720 --> 56:28.720
Yeah, so it's a fork that's different but compatible.

56:28.720 --> 56:33.640
It's an Upstream fork, they're working with the developer, and what I love about it, which

56:33.640 --> 56:40.920
I think is so awesome, is the settings are, like you can invest in one Dock and then switch

56:40.920 --> 56:44.640
out and you don't lose all of your special settings.

56:44.640 --> 56:48.960
And they say also the probably most important, unvisible, the thing that you can't really

56:48.960 --> 56:52.880
see is the fact they use a different extension ID, because that makes it possible to swap

56:52.880 --> 56:56.600
between them, you can stay up to date on each of them without having to worry about it.

56:56.600 --> 56:59.620
You don't have to uninstall one to get the other one like you have to do on Anagros.

56:59.620 --> 57:04.200
It's like Ubuntu went to them and said, well, we like what you're doing here, but our vision

57:04.200 --> 57:11.200
is slightly different, but we want to maintain compatibility, so how can we do this so that

57:11.200 --> 57:13.960
our stuff will work with yours, even if we're doing something a bit different?

57:13.960 --> 57:18.740
And then the last piece that I really think is classy, that I think all the other forkers

57:18.740 --> 57:24.040
out there should try to integrate, is it's using two things that make it really respectful

57:24.040 --> 57:25.760
to switching back to Upstream.

57:25.760 --> 57:29.040
If you install and enable Dash to Dock, you don't have to have it enabled, but if you

57:29.040 --> 57:35.040
turn it, when you do turn it on, even if Ubuntu Dock is still turned on, it politely just

57:35.040 --> 57:39.040
vanishes and goes away, and just lets Dash to Dock take over, and then if you change

57:39.040 --> 57:43.880
any settings in Dash to Dock, like anything that would modify DCOM for G settings, those

57:43.880 --> 57:48.240
modifications will be reflected in both, that's super smooth, and then you turn off Dash to

57:48.240 --> 57:50.600
Dock and the Ubuntu Dock comes right back.

57:50.600 --> 57:55.900
And that sort of classy sharing of settings, using schema overrides, and then gracefully

57:55.900 --> 58:00.840
bowing out when the Upstream version comes online, I think is nailing it, it's nailing

58:00.840 --> 58:01.840
it.

58:01.840 --> 58:06.520
I think my only question would be, is there an option to actually disable that sharing?

58:06.520 --> 58:10.840
Because I can see a use case where some people might not want to share between the two.

58:10.840 --> 58:16.720
Probably, I'm looking at it right now, it looks like you can turn off the override mechanism,

58:16.720 --> 58:20.400
so there is a way to turn that off, but I haven't tried it yet, obviously, so I don't

58:20.400 --> 58:22.240
know.

58:22.240 --> 58:28.120
And they talk in this blog post, this is Ubuntu Dome Shell in Artful Day 5, I've been following

58:28.120 --> 58:33.960
these series, and it makes so much sense when you're thinking about moving users over and

58:33.960 --> 58:37.600
how to do this right, and you look at it in the totality, you look at the Upstream fixes

58:37.600 --> 58:42.540
to Bluetooth, why is a thousand things they found in this development cycle for this one

58:42.540 --> 58:44.640
version of their distro?

58:44.640 --> 58:45.640
What's going on?

58:45.640 --> 58:46.640
Why has nobody else done that?

58:46.640 --> 58:49.920
This video acceleration stuff, the Gnome session stuff, and now the way they're handling

58:49.920 --> 58:58.000
this Upstream fork, I mean, this isn't even the LTS release yet.

58:58.000 --> 59:03.240
Well, I mean, they're doing all the heavy lifting now, so the LTS will be nice and stable,

59:03.240 --> 59:04.240
I guess.

59:04.240 --> 59:07.720
It seems like a very sustainable approach, because by encapsulating everything in their

59:07.720 --> 59:11.840
own Gnome session, they don't have to worry about breaking or conflicting stuff that people

59:11.840 --> 59:14.840
want to install different extensions or don't like their configuration but still want an

59:14.840 --> 59:21.760
Ubuntu base, by modifying this dock to sort of bridge the move over from Unity 7, which

59:21.760 --> 59:25.700
is the most visible aspect of Unity 7, and it's legitimately the thing that when I sit

59:25.700 --> 59:29.360
people down in front of Unity 7, they click with immediately, is that sidebar, and to

59:29.360 --> 59:36.800
do it like this, I don't know, I mean, I'm definitely looking forward to trying out 1710.

59:36.800 --> 59:39.800
I am very excited about this release.

59:39.800 --> 59:45.160
I got to say, it's maybe the most excited I've been in eight years of releases.

59:45.160 --> 59:49.920
I mean, I got to go back quite a way to get this excited about an Ubuntu release again,

59:49.920 --> 59:52.840
and it's all going Upstream.

59:52.840 --> 59:58.000
I think it's always been something that I respect about Ubuntu, is that rather than

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.920
look at what is the quickest way to do this, they say what is the best way to do this,

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:08.200
except now it's being applied to other Upstream projects instead of them rolling their own

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.200
stuff.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:16.480
What I was surprised by was how popular the survey was for docks, because I was just saying

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.240
last week, I'm kind of over docks.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:23.880
I'm just sort of done with them, but you look at all of the results, and they're right.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.400
They link to it.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400
People want docks.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.280
People want to use a dock.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.280
I don't know.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.440
For me, you put a bar down at the bottom of the screen, put the clock in there, put the

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.280
tray icons in there, and call it good.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.280
I mean, aren't the bars just really docks without animations?

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.280
I suppose.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.760
One of the things I like about the Budgie desktop is I can now put this bar on my side

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:51.560
screen, and I suppose if you've got extra sides room on these 16 by 9 screens than you

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:58.360
do on the bottom, so there's that reason for it, but anyways, good post.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.640
Lots of other stuff in there.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.760
Link in the show notes, but want to talk about one more thing before we get to something

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.160
that is going to ruin the life of any Star Trek fan.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:14.520
There is a proposal by your good friends over at Mozilla about turning on data collection

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.800
in the Fox.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.120
Now I want to be clear about this.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:26.440
This isn't like creepy data collection, and they are starting very gracefully.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.200
They fully admit that they really don't have enough data on their users right now.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:36.160
They need more data about the types of sites they go to, the type of browsing they do.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.880
Are they using Flash?

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.080
Are they seeing a lot of junk?

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.960
How are the load times?

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:50.920
And so what Firefox wants to do, what Mozilla wants to do, is they want to use a privacy

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:58.780
project that allows them to collect data, but does it in a way that anonymizes essentially

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:02.240
the data using something called differential privacy.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:09.400
So I believe the project is Rappor, Rapper, R-A-P-P-O-R, I think it's spelled.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:16.000
And it's a project that Google works on, and it uses differential privacy, which sends

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.120
bogus data and real data, and then it's just sort of supposed to all work out in the wash

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.000
if you have enough users.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.120
And they would install this, and they would anonymize the reporting, and then you would,

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.100
along with good reports, you would also be sending them completely crap stuff, which

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:31.320
is a weird approach.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:36.000
But the idea is that the average is more good, and then if you look at that data, you get

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
something.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.920
But so the theory behind it is they can't even use your habits to try to narrow down

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.920
who you are.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:51.820
Now, initially, they're thinking about rolling this out as a opt-in to try it, but if they

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:57.960
decide to implement it, it's going to be turned on by default, and that's the part that's

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.720
really getting people pissed off.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:07.320
Yeah, it's interesting that they're bringing this up so soon after the whole, the privacy

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.760
concerns with the plugin stuff.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.840
Yeah, I thought the timing on this was kind of weird for, like that was just a couple

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.840
weeks ago, wasn't it?

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.540
From like a, so when you're down and out, and you know, you're getting your ass kicked

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:24.600
in the, you know, you just get kicked all over, I mean it's bad man, you get your ass

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.840
kicked on the ratings, I mean on the usage numbers, is that the time to launch a hey

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.400
we want to spy on you campaign?

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:36.000
I mean, I guess it depends on whether you consider it spying or not.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.360
I don't, WW, what do you think?

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.120
Differential privacy is kind of the new hotness, Apple says they're going to use it in future

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:49.520
IOSs to anonymize data reporting, Mozilla says they need the data, what do you think

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.520
about this?

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.480
I think this should be an optional thing, it should be popping up when you first set

01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:01.080
up Firefox, it should be hey, we want to do this, and we want your consent, and the thing

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.160
that I don't see with a lot of tools is that they don't give you an option to control the

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.040
data, so like, what's the, like.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.960
You could, you can turn it off, you can turn it off, see.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.160
Yeah, it should be upfront, they should be going, oh we're turning this off by default,

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:23.680
you know, just kind of like when there's telemetry, you know, it's on by default, oh, this patch,

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.360
it's like at what cost, you know.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:31.200
I'm kind of on the opposite side of the fence with that though, because for usage analytics

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.480
to be useful, you need a large amount, and most people are just probably going to click

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.720
no.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:43.960
I think they're going to, I think if they do this, they're going to bury the setting

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.760
probably in like a privacy tab inside settings, I don't think they would give you a pop-up

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:53.080
because of that reason, and I think that's why they, because they say currently we can

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.560
collect this data when the user opts in, but we don't have a way to collect unbiased data

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.100
without explicit consent, and so the problem that they're seeing is they're getting biased

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:04.400
data by people who are willing to opt in, and so they've got to solve that particular

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.760
problem and they're trying to use differential privacy to justify monitoring everyone.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.160
And apparently the project they're using, the Google or whatever, apparently it's the

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:18.040
most widely distributed usage of differential privacy.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.040
Yeah.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.040
Yeah.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:27.960
It probably would vary about config probably if they were to do or have that option though.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:35.680
I mean, I don't really get the objection to truly anonymized usage statistics.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.840
Like I can understand if you can be tied to it, but this seems like a pretty full-fledged

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:46.920
implementation of we're trying to anonymize this as much as humanly possible.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.400
And you know it's data that Google and Apple are getting.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.400
Yeah.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.120
So, and their competitors are getting it.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.120
Yeah.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:58.760
What about, you know, years ago I used to think about this, I don't think about it anymore,

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:03.160
but doesn't collecting all of these metrics and having data collection points at every

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.600
little end of the application slow down the application?

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:10.480
Doesn't collecting this stuff in the background and uploading it constantly slow down the

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.480
network?

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:12.480
I mean, what the hell?

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:15.520
I mean, it can't be a lot, but damn, I mean, I want this shit to be as fast as possible.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.740
It's just so frustrating.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.880
But I know that's neither here nor there.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:19.880
They say they-

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:25.120
Do you remember when Ubuntu had the Amazon scopes and people got obsessed?

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:29.880
It's kind of like that because with that you had the option of totally turning it off and

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.880
that's fine.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:36.720
Or maybe on one system I had it on to if I was looking at Amazon or buying some things,

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.720
you know.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:44.040
I can understand the objection to the Amazon scopes way more though, because it was directly

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.160
tying to individual users.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:49.040
And the initial implementation wasn't all that secure either.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040
Yeah, that too.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.040
So that definitely led to it.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.160
But Minimac, you say it's sort of like equivalent to submitting a crash report.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.160
Yeah.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.880
I think if I remember well, if you first start Firefox with a new profile, you get a little

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:05.160
note at the bottom of the page which says, decide what you share.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.920
And if you click on it, you see that the health and crash report is enabled by default and

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.560
you can disable it.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:17.560
So I guess they just add another option for your personal data collection.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.160
Or it might just be another line in that paragraph even.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.160
Yeah.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:27.040
That to me has way more potential to tell what you're doing with your browser than this

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.560
other stuff because you can get URLs and stuff in crash reports.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.340
So they're validating this right now or they're about to.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:34.340
They're about to.

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:38.600
They're doing an opt-out shield study, they say, to validate the implementation of this

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.440
differential privacy project.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:45.760
The study will collect the value of users' homepage, which is that tile page that they

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.280
think is so important it's worth selling advertising on, the one that I spend exactly half a second

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.280
looking at once a day.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:56.160
So they're gonna collect how much you guys click on those tiles and they're gonna select

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.700
a random group of their release population.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:02.520
And they hope to launch mid-September, which isn't that around the time?

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.960
And then in November, you have 57.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:09.000
You gotta wonder if this isn't gonna ship in 57 because they expect that one to get

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.600
a lot of downloads, I'm sure.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.600
Yeah, maybe.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:17.040
57's the, not only is it gonna, like the accumulation of a lot of their different projects, but

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.040
it's also the new UI.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.040
Yeah.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.040
It's gonna get all the attention.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.320
If it's not in 57, it'll almost definitely be in 58.

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.320
Yeah.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.760
So they're gonna launch their test pilot soon.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.700
Speaking of privacy, Plex really stepped in it over the weekend and they've backpedaled

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:35.320
a bit already since we've recorded this, but they announced that they were going to launch

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:43.040
a data collection process that wouldn't really report on the files in your library, but would

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:49.140
give them all kinds of metrics and you couldn't turn it off.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:53.500
So they're upping their privacy policy and they're retracting on some of that.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:59.020
But I gotta tell you, I saw a lot of angry comments from the audience who said they're

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:02.880
trying out MB after this, so check out some of our past episodes on MB if you're looking

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.880
for an alternative.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:09.520
Honestly, to me it seems kind of like the same situation, because it wasn't about them

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:14.040
collecting data on your files, it was collecting usage statistics again.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.040
Yeah.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.400
Well, a lot of people are watching pirated content on Plex.

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:23.840
And I feel like a lot of people will probably go in there and turn that off specifically,

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.400
so they're not getting the usage statistics that they want.

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.880
So they've been pretty clear now after this release that they have no way of tracking

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:35.160
which files you're playing unless you use a client that talks to a cloud service to

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.740
initiate playback.

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:42.660
So if you're using an Echo or a third-party app that uses the Plex Cloud API to start

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:47.160
a file on your Plex server, in that case they do have logs of which file you're starting.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.880
I like that they actually made that clear.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.640
They said if you're just using the Plex app on your phone or on the TV or on your web

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.920
browser and you're watching the latest episode of Game of Thrones, they didn't say that,

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.560
I'm putting that part in.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.560
They don't know.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.160
They don't know what file you're watching, they just know you're watching content, basically.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.720
Don't know, man.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.240
I'm getting really...

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.240
I feel like I'm getting privacy bankrupt.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.840
That's what it is.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.360
In one or two instances, I'm okay with this.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.680
I made this compromise when I put Echo dots in the studio.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.360
Well, see, the problem is all of-

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.000
But in the totality, I'm getting sick of it.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.320
All of these different developers, they need statistics on how their stuff is used to make

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.320
their products better.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.320
Yeah.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.320
I know.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:33.600
I guess the first 30 years of making software where they didn't have always-on internet-connected

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:38.320
machines constantly sending back metrics, somehow they still managed to make good software.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.800
Do you think software was good?

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.040
Yeah, actually, in some ways, I think it was better than it is today because it didn't

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.200
have so many damn interdependent connections.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.120
I guess I agree.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.960
I understand this is a hard problem.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:56.400
We need to know what episodes are downloaded, although we don't track beyond the number.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.240
I really hate to see Plex going down this path, and I hate them doing it ham-fisted,

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.960
and the fact that they've had to make this big, huge public retraction is embarrassing

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:02.960
for Plex.

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:06.320
And honestly, I think in some ways, because we don't collect more information, we're

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.000
disadvantaging ourselves, but we do that consciously.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Yeah.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.080
Wouldn't it be interesting if we had...

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.080
If there was some way...

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.120
And I don't know how you would have this.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.240
If there was some way we could know exactly how many new users use Linux versus how many

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.000
computer experts use Linux?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.320
Or even stuff like being able to track what part of the show people watch.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.880
Yeah, YouTube gives you that.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.580
Yeah, but that's a limited subset of our audience.

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.760
It's a very small subset, so it's kind of...

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.600
I mean, you can draw some conclusions from it, but it'd be...

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.760
There's so much more data out there if you could get all of it.

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.760
Yeah.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.760
Yeah, that's what...

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.120
You could tell our content to what people want without having to poll them for what

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.120
they want.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.760
That's what big advertisers have been trying to get different podcast apps to start collecting

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.660
data, which is a creepy, slippery slope in my world, because to me, there's other ways

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:58.380
of sussing that out besides getting playback locations.

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:02.220
You can tell by feedback from the audience, what they respond to.

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:03.880
You can tell by all that.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.880
There's all kinds of ways to get that.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.560
But the problem with that is you're gonna get that biased feedback.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.560
I guess.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.680
But really, I mean, built-in metrics to everything we use, it feels like I'm getting nickel and

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.600
dime to death with my privacy.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.760
I mean, you really don't care that every app you almost use today...

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:21.760
Think about it.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.520
Every app we pretty much use today is sending back usage data.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.040
Doesn't really bother me, to be honest.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:33.920
I mean, as long as they're not using something to try to track me down specifically, I don't

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.920
care.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.920
Hmm.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.840
I draw the line at health information or stuff around my house.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.960
I don't really like them collecting when certain things turn on or off.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.560
That kind of stuff feels like it's too far.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.240
That definitely is too far.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.240
That's where things are going, though.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.640
Well, I mean, it depends on what you choose to support.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.640
Yeah.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:57.160
Anyway, Mumbo, any thoughts on the Plex data collection, Firefox data collection, or the

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.600
topic of data collection in general?

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.000
I know it's gotta be on some of your minds, because just everything...

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.400
Are you guys feeling this, like nickel and dimed privacy death here?

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:11.480
The thing is, for me, is I understand that projects have to have some way to monetize

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.760
and some way to get this information.

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:23.460
Going about it like a jealous boyfriend or someone that's gonna key log you to see what

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:26.520
you're doing is not the way to go about it.

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:32.880
You can talk to people, have a discussion with people that use your software, and make

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.840
it so they can actually use the software.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:44.440
I really want companies, or if I had my own company, I would make it so users had an option

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:50.840
to see what data we're using, and when they want, delete it.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.160
You have to have some kind of level of respect for people that are giving up this privacy

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.600
for these services.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.800
Okay.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.000
That's a great point, WW.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.360
Let's take that the next step, say, okay, they need this somehow, plus some of them

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.400
can monetize it, so it's a way to fund future development.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:11.800
If we hold those things true, and for sake of argument, we accept that differential privacy

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:16.560
is legitimate, and that this project that Mozilla's using from Google is also legitimate,

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.160
is that the right compromise then?

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.160
Is the beard right?

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:24.960
Like, okay, you can collect your data, but use differential privacy to fuzz it, and still

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.120
give me the option at the end of the day to turn it off.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:33.600
It's gonna be on by default, but it's fuzzed, and you can turn it off, and is that sort

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:38.640
of a good enough compromise for you, because it gives Firefox the data they need, it lets

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:43.720
them make a better product, it lets them know where to focus development, but it is at least

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.480
using differential privacy.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.840
It depends, like, how is this going...

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:53.400
Like, the thing is, once you're on the slope, how slippery does it get?

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.480
Yeah, that's how I'm feeling.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:15:02.280
Because you have to, like, okay, we know, like, you, me, Rekai, anybody that's mobile

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:09.680
right now and watching, like, we're in techno, like, you're either technologically advocate,

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:15.360
you're technologically inclined, you work in tech, we know that there's DEF CON, there's

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.080
someone out there, like, looking for weakness.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.760
You just know that by default.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:27.400
So to us, we know the covets of such things, but to the average user, they don't know,

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.060
they're not gonna know, they don't care.

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:35.600
That's a lot of what I run into with people I know, or other people, so...

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.600
Default reigns supreme.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:44.480
See, I feel like, especially in the case of Firefox and this differential privacy project,

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:50.440
both of these are open source, so people can go and see exactly what they're collecting.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:56.280
This is actually rare, not probably super common, but thank God.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:00.040
I mean, really, if you're really super worried about it, there is an escape hatch here for

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.040
you.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.040
You're right.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:05.200
And it does look like it's a legitimate project, it does seem to be very popular, it does have

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.920
a lot of contributors, and Google is a main sponsor of it.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:14.360
Google obviously has skin in the game to create ways to monitor people that doesn't get them

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.360
in trouble.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.520
It's probably how they watch students.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.480
Especially with recent EU lawsuits.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:23.080
How much you want to bet this is what they use for Google apps, to say that they're not

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.800
specifically tracking you, but they're still collecting metrics.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.520
That's probably why they...

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.520
They are so creepy.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:33.080
All right, well, let's take a moment, because I'm so excited.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:36.680
In fact, there's something that happened to me this week, besides the solar...

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.680
This might be more...

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.680
Boy, that's...

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.860
Let's see.

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:43.560
Seeing celestial objects line up in the sky in front of me and be in the path of the shadow

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.060
of heavenly bodies is a big event to happen to a person.

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:51.960
But stage nine also happened to me this week, and I'm going to tell you about stage nine,

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:56.000
which may have a more long-lasting impact on me, and more importantly, you.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.960
But first, let's talk about making yourself better before we kill all of your time.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.200
Go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.200
It's a platform to learn all about Linux.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.880
They've just expanded on some of their AWS stuff just recently.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:18.080
And I think for me, I would have killed for something like this, because I really suffered

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:22.320
from anxiety of, I got to go to this client, and I have got to go do this thing that we

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.320
just...

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:27.160
Our sales guy just told them I knew how to do, and I've done it maybe once, two years

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.160
ago.

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.640
And that's where these hands-on labs for me were just...

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.720
Boy, that'd be a game changer.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.480
And now, just giving me just the ability to experience it, such a great feature.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.240
If they only did this, Linux Academy would be worth it.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.320
Of course, they have so many more features.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.400
You know, Chris, I'm going to take a different tack with this.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.400
Go for it.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.840
I mean, you took the whole nice business angle.

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:53.320
Me, I'm going to say that you can become a Linux genius in your underwear.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.800
Well, that's definitely true.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:59.440
I mean, you think about it, what better way to become a genius on something than in your

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.440
underwear?

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.440
Exactly.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.440
Because you're not distracted by all those scratchy clothes.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.960
The best way to learn is no pants.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.480
I completely agree.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:10.320
No pants and just the right temperature, the music you like going, I think it's maybe

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.320
light a candle.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.320
I mean, I'm not going to judge you.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.880
They also have self-paced in-depth video courses in every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:19.800
They have instructor mentoring, you know, humans that are available to help you.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:23.160
In fact, one of those humans is in Seattle right now.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.520
They have a course schedule that works with your busy schedule.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.000
They have flashcards that get forked by the community.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.400
They have cert training that goes right into courses for like a path to get a certification.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:39.600
And I really think that if you want something that is sort of scratching that podcast itch

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:46.240
and that sort of audio book itch, their content you can download and listen to offline is

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.280
perfect for that.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.280
So let me be clear.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:53.680
You're telling me that I can, there's the humans doing this and not Elon Musk style

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:54.680
AI?

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.680
This is what they do.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680
This is what they do.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.680
They're all about it.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.680
They're all about it.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:18:59.680
In fact, if you check out their Twitter feed, you'll see some of that.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.680
Linux Academy com.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:07.540
Also, they were just honored to be one of the companies included on the 5,000 list of

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.440
fastest growing companies.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.120
Have you seen this at Inc 5,000?

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.400
I just saw this on their Twitter feed and I pulled it up right here on the show.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.580
Inc.com, Linux Academy.

01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:18.680
Look at that number 78 on the-

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.240
Wow, top 100.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.240
Yeah.

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.580
That's amazing.

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:23.580
Holy crap.

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:24.580
Holy crap.

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:25.580
Look at those.

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:26.580
Boy, you should go there.

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:27.580
You should go to-

01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:28.580
That must be some pretty big roads to be on top 100.

01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:32.060
Here's what I'm going to tell you to do.

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:36.360
We'll leave it as an exercise to the listener to go to Linux Academy's feed, to a Twitter

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.000
feed, Linux Academy com and then look at this link.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.920
But give me one guess on what you think their three-year growth percentage was.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.920
1,045%.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.920
More.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:49.920
2,800%.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.920
More.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920
10,000%.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.920
Hold on.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.920
I'm not going to give it away.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.800
I'm not going to give it away, but the link is in their Twitter feed if you'd like to

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:57.800
know.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.800
LinuxAcademy.com.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.000
There's a reason why they've grown like crazy in the last three years.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.600
It's probably because they've been sponsoring us.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.620
The Jupyter Broadcasting Effect, LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, a free seven-day trial and

01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:11.600
keep us on the air.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:14.920
Now this is a self-indulgent moment for me, but it is newsworthy.

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:19.540
A version for Linux will be shipping today, a brand new version of Stage 9.

01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:23.260
Now what is Stage 9?

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.920
That sounds like a Microsoft video blog.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.360
Yeah, no, it doesn't, does it?

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:37.560
It is a project to recreate the entire set of the NCC-1701D Enterprise from the Star

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.000
Trek The Next Generation.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.680
And it is using the Unreal Engine 4, which means it works on a lot of graphics systems.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:51.520
And if you have a good graphics system, it's unbelievably gorgeous.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.320
If you're on Windows, it also has VR support.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.560
The Linux version, ironically right now, is just being held up by packaging issues.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.120
So remember how we were saying that packaging isn't a big problem on Linux?

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.120
Yeah, it's, yeah.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.440
I thought they should ship it as an app image.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:10.400
Well, I actually suggested a snap, but yeah, an app image would also be really great.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.760
But they do have the last release for Linux available right now, which is still great,

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.960
still a lot of fun.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.240
And if you're on the Mac platform, they also have a Metal version, if you want to see what

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.240
Metal's like, I guess.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:24.040
Sorry, I don't mean to laugh, but you could do that too, if you wanted to do that.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.640
I think I might have an app to slip in Wimpy's pocket.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:28.640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.360
Well, that may or may not have already happened.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.360
Oh, yeah.

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.720
That may have already been a thing.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.440
So Stage 9 is available for Linux.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:38.200
You can download version 7 very soon, version 0.7.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.480
Right here, I've got version.06.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:45.800
And it's as cool as you would think, even on my NVIDIA GTX 960 here.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:49.800
This is running on Solus with the proprietary NVIDIA driver.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.800
We'll start here.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.300
I'll show you the bridge a little bit, if you're watching the video version.

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:54.300
It looks great.

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:57.880
And I actually have this on medium camera settings, I can actually turn it up a little

01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.880
bit to high.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.880
Hey, Chris.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.880
There we go.

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:01.880
You know what?

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.880
We are under attack.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:03.880
Oh, really?

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:06.880
Do you need me to trigger red alert?

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:07.880
Yes.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:08.880
Okay, standby.

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:09.880
There we go.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:10.880
All right.

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:11.880
There we go.

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:12.880
Battle stations.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.880
We are now at battle stations.

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.880
So this is pretty great.

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.200
And like I was talking about, if you've got a good graphics card, it's a great way to

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.880
really push your Linux right, because one of the things that is a little disappointing

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:24.240
sometimes is some of the games can't really push the high-end video cards.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:29.520
This thing definitely can, and if I had VR set up on Windows, I would definitely be giving

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.520
this a go.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.080
Anyways, stage nine.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.840
A nice way that they hid the loading screens, Chris, was...

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:36.840
Through the turbo lift.

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:39.000
Yeah, the turbo lifts are the loading screens.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.840
I would call out a few things.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:46.040
So this shot, it's just a really simple hallway shot here, but the lighting, and this is on

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.640
a GTX 960 on medium graphics.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.440
It's the last generation.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.440
Yeah.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:56.640
And there's reflections on the metal wall panels that are gorgeous.

01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:01.560
When you come into the main engineering here, there is a little bit of a JJ Abrams lens

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.120
flare effect from the warp drive.

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.400
I don't know if this will come through in the download version, but it supports positional

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.960
audio.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:13.240
So when I move around the engine room, the sound of the warp drive changes depending

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:16.960
on where I'm standing, which is just the coolest thing.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.080
All of the panels that you saw used, everything's accurate.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:22.680
In fact, I've been walking around this ship by memory from the show.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.760
It is remarkably accurate.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.240
It is an incredible recreation.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:29.960
It's one of the coolest Star Trek things I've ever used, and it's on Linux.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:30.960
You know what, Chris?

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.400
You say that, I got to say I'm really disappointed.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.400
Oh yeah?

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.400
What's wrong?

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.400
It's called stage nine.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.400
Yeah.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.480
Where's Deep Space Nine?

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.480
Out right outside the window.

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.480
Yeah.

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.480
Check this out.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.480
Let's go here.

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:43.480
So let's see.

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.480
We'll go to 10 forward.

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.480
I'll take you to 10 forward.

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:46.480
So here's the funny thing.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:52.400
I don't know about this version, but in the version seven I watched in their YouTube video,

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.400
they have a shuttle bay.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:54.400
Hello there.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.400
Hi.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.400
How are you?

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.400
Are you having a good day?

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.120
So are you saying that there might be a possibility someday?

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.120
You can take the shuttle out.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.160
You can take the shuttle out, and you could probably one someday go to Deep Space Nine.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.160
Okay.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.160
I'm in.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.080
So if I go out the window here, I think, oh no, I guess not.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:10.800
You can see Bajor, but just right there is Deep Space Nine, but you can only see the

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.280
bottom of the docking because it's above the ship.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.280
It's all spatially correct.

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.280
This is really cool.

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.280
It's cool.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.360
But really, we want to go and visit Quark's.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.640
Yeah, that would be great.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:26.000
So they have all the different levels on here too, which is just, again, if you're a geek,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.760
it's a lot of fun if you're a Star Trek geek.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.320
But even if you just want to push your Linux rig or play around with an Unreal-based engine

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.480
game on Linux, there's a few of them now, obviously, but this one's a pretty special

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.480
one.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.480
Lots of hidden stuff.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:43.400
All the cool sets, including the Arboretum, data in the worst quarters, the data center

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:47.280
of the Enterprise, which is a particularly great map on this.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.760
It's almost, I wish we could show it.

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.960
If you want to see it, check out the full live stream if you're a patron.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:57.520
I walked through the data center of the Enterprise in the pre-show, so I'll be posting that for

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.520
our patrons.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:01.120
Here's a critical feature question.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.640
Can you sit down like a Riker?

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.640
Yeah.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.640
You mean step over the chair?

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.640
I don't think so.

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:09.040
Yeah, I don't think they've added that yet.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.040
They should.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040
There's a few things.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.680
There's definitely a few nods and stuff like that that are in there, but yeah, so it's

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.160
stage nine.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:21.600
I had a chance to chat with one of the developers on Discord this morning before the show, and

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.280
I was asking him, what's going on with the Linux packaging stuff?

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.280
What's a hard time?

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:29.240
Oh, well, look at that.

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:37.240
He just legitimately, right now as we're recording, wow, four minutes ago, just posted the log.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:42.100
If you might be able to help him get this off the ground, they have a Discord server

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:46.700
where the devs prefer to be reached, and that is linked on the stage nine page, and then

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:53.840
he just posted, and I'll link to this in the show notes, their build log issues, and this

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.480
is what's holding them up from getting the latest version on Linux.

01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:59.480
It looks like he keeps getting a lib curl issue.

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.480
Yeah.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:05.840
Yeah, I'll put a link to that in the show notes, and maybe I'll send that along to some

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:09.960
of our friends that work in packaging, because it'd be really cool to get this available

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:13.440
easily for Linux users, because it's a pretty cutting edge thing, and when VR support comes,

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.360
it's going to be one of the few really nice Unreal 4 things that we can try out.

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.680
I know that's not on everybody's priority list, but something about me, the old Linux

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.840
advocate in me, I just don't want to see a slip behind on this kind of stuff, and it's

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.320
so great to see just some fan project like this that doesn't have a ton of time trying

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:30.400
to make it work on Linux.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:35.200
I really appreciate that, and in big parts because of the Unreal Engine, but sure makes

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.200
it look pretty.

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:41.800
Stage 9, if you want to check it out directly, the website is stage-9.co.uk, and I'll have

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:45.880
a link in the show notes, and that's where you, at their Stage 9 websites, where you

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.760
can find their Discord channel.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:52.120
They also have a subreddit, which, as you would think, which figures Stage 9 on Reddit.

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.320
Anyway, I thought that was kind of a neat thing.

01:26:54.320 --> 01:27:00.600
I know you're not a big Star Trek guy, but if I did manage to get the VR set up here,

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.400
would you give it a go?

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.360
Does it have to have the walking component, because I guess that's part of it, right?

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.000
Well, I mean, you can use the controllers.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
But I don't know.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I really want it.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I want DS9.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Yeah.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:19.480
Boy, the amount of work that it goes to creating this, these are every detail down to the materials

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:24.480
and just like everything, like the stitching to the carpet is accurate, so I can't imagine

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.480
the time.

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:30.040
Just imagine all the time that they had to go through and re-watch all those episodes

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:34.860
and rebuild these scenes and probably look at concept art and all kinds of crazy stuff.

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:38.000
So I asked one of the developers, I said, so is this a license?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Is this a license?

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I'm kind of getting at it.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.520
If this is open source, this is something that people could really kind of get around

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.520
here.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:48.760
And the official answer is they're just distributing it as a binary, and there's no implicit license

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:50.360
they're attaching with that at this time.

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.640
So I would imagine that's all rights reserved.

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.640
Keeping their options open.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.380
Yeah, all rights reserved for the time being.

01:27:55.380 --> 01:28:02.080
But not only is it just an impressive technology demo, because you download this thing on Linux,

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.960
you run it, and now you're in this incredibly gorgeous 3D rendering, which is a lot of fun

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:10.240
to try out on your graphics, different graphics cards, and seeing how they perform, which

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:13.940
for me is just a fun benchmark, and seeing how hot they get and all that kind of stuff.

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:17.560
But then to see such an accurate recreation of something that I'm such a big fan of, it

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.900
was pretty impressive.

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:23.720
And it's been, you know, there's been times, there has been times where as a Linux user

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.720
I was left out, so it was really great that they...

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:30.200
And these, by the way, screenshots that I'm showing, if you're watching the video version,

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.200
are in-game renderings.

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:34.200
They even have the battle bridge.

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:40.240
Speaking of Star Trek and times you were left out, how's Sto going?

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:47.380
So they've moved to DirectX 11 only, and Wine is at a good clip, but Wine is still fully

01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:50.400
implementing DirectX 11 support, so yeah, I've had to take a break.

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.800
That might explain my passion for this.

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:53.800
For jonesing.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:57.220
Yeah, because I've been lacking any Star Trek gameplay on Linux for a while.

01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:00.120
If anybody else out there has Star Trek games that they've played under Wine, let me know

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.800
at ChrisLAS, because I'll definitely kill time while the Wine project gets...

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.800
I know they'll get there eventually.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.800
Yeah.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.800
They'll get there eventually.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.400
Hey, so want a little more Beardsley?

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.600
Want a little more of the Rekai here?

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:11.840
Check out User Air.

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.280
He's on User Air every damn week, and we've got a new episode coming out in a few days.

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:20.720
And my old buddy John, who hasn't been on for a while, joins us and shares some pretty

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:21.720
funny stories.

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:22.880
It was a great episode.

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.000
We also talked about Linux extremism.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Yeah.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.480
Also, just a warning, this episode is probably a little bit more not safe for work than most.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.360
Which is really saying something, actually.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.360
Yeah.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:35.840
Okay, maybe a lot more.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:36.840
Well, it depends.

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:37.840
It depends.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.840
It depends.

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:39.840
I guess it depends on what you're into.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:40.840
Yeah.

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:43.400
So did you have anything you wanted to plug before we ran out of here?

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:49.720
You can just find me on Twitter at RekaiLP or over at Rek.net.

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:50.720
Rek.net.

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:51.720
Yeah.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.720
Or my Twitch.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.120
I've got to come up with a good name for the vlog, because I'm going to be posting our

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.120
clip story.

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:59.000
There were some interesting challenges on our way down to the eclipse, so I'm going

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.840
to post all that on my vlog, which is YouTube.com slash Chris Fisher.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:03.840
You know what, Chris?

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:04.840
It needs a good name.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:10.000
Chris, I can offer you a free subdomain, hair.rek.net, you can forward to YouTube.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
There you go.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
There you go.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.560
I guess one more thing I'll plug, just because it's been pretty popular the last few days

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:21.720
and it just seems to be growing more and more, is our Discord, Discord.me slash Jupiter Colony.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.560
There's a lot of people on there and it's a pretty nice place.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:29.320
And if Telegram is more of your flavor, well guess what?

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.320
We got one of those too.

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:35.720
Go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram and join in the group conversation over there.

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:39.440
I try to pop in all over the place, in and out, but the conversation's always going on

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.000
even when I'm not in there.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.720
You can also find Beardsley in there from time to time.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.400
There's just all kinds of ways to get you.

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.640
It's pretty good.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.800
Alright everybody, well thank you so much for tuning in to this week's episode.

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.720
Hopefully Mr. West's car troubles are all fixed.

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:53.760
We've got to get him a Linux running car, so the Linux powers, it doesn't break down

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:54.760
on him.

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:55.760
Because I'm sure that would solve all of his problems.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:59.480
And for people looking for a tech snap after they finish watching LUP.

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:00.480
Oh, that's coming.

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:01.480
Yeah.

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:02.480
It's just going to be a little bit.

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.480
Yeah, a little bit.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:27.560
Alright, we'll see you next week.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:48.280
Alright, JBtitles.com, let's go pick our title.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:51.920
Mumble Room, we were small in number, but you guys did great.

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.280
Mr. Fax, I never got it.

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:56.360
Or Robo, we have Robo the Arms back too.

01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:00.640
RoboArm, RobotArm, whatever, I never get it right, but it's good to see you guys.

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.680
Thank you for making it two this week.

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.680
Impersonates it.

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:06.360
And now let's go pick our title.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.360
What do you think?

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.680
One more job before we get out of here, gentlemen, before we ride off into the sunset, should

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:10.680
we go pick our title?

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.680
JBtitles.com.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:15.600
Well, Beardsley, I was glad you were able to make it.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.720
Kind of a lower key show, it felt like overall.

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:19.360
It's a lot easier for me to make it.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.360
Yeah, that's true.

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.320
Well, you have less car troubles.

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:25.040
But yeah, it felt like a lower key show, but still good, right?

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:28.040
It still felt good, didn't you think?

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.040
Was I right?

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:32.600
If you have any notes, as they say, chat room on today's episode, or mumble room, feel free

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:33.960
to submit them to us before we get out of here.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.040
But I thought it was a good episode, just a little low key.

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:39.680
I think, as with every week, many people are going to hate me.

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:40.680
Oh, you think?

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.680
And some people are going to love me.

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.020
Geez, I mostly hear all good things.

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:46.940
People like hearing, people call you, you know, the, what do they say?

01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:48.240
The man of the people.

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:49.240
The pragmatist?

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.840
Yeah, the man of the people.

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:57.240
I just think it's like people, like I grew up with a net, like when it was really starting

01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:00.720
to penetrate into the public.

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:05.240
And so my opinions are different than Rekai's, but I love hearing Rekai's and talking to

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.240
him about it.

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:11.160
That's what I love is that I can respect him and talk about him and get more information

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:14.200
or get links and just process him more.

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:16.280
Sometimes you have to just disagree and move on.

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.280
Yeah, I agree.

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.280
Yeah, exactly.

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.280
We need a lot more of that.

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.280
We need a lot more of that.

01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:24.240
How young do you think I am that he doesn't think I was around when the internet was new

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.240
too?

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.240
I mean, thank you.

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:29.520
I'm like five years older than Chris, so.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.280
Fair enough.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:36.200
So what about, so Privacy Bankruptcy by Token Ring is good.

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:40.080
It's in competition with Windcloud's Cry, which is also good.

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:43.560
We could also jazz it up and we could say Mozilla's Privacy Bankruptcy.

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.560
No?

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:45.560
Okay.

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.560
Too jazzed?

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.560
Firefox?

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:52.560
I don't like Privacy Bankruptcy myself.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.560
Wow.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.520
Of course, I was also taking the opposite opinion.

01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.800
JBtitles.com, JBtitles.com.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:04.000
Windcloud's Cry?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
It rains.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.880
What's that in reference to?

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.600
Specifically?

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.240
I would imagine Mozilla not have enough data.

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:15.440
Or maybe the backups.

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:19.160
I think more of the backups.

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:24.120
So I guess it multi.

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.800
It sort of covers both, which is kind of good.

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:29.120
That always kind of, you know, I'm going to toss a boat in for Windcloud's Cry.

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.120
I'm going to give it a boat.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.120
I'm going to give it a, now we're.

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:34.480
I also kind of like Forks Done Right.

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:36.640
Forks Done Right is good too.

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.480
WW coming with it.

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.480
Oh man.

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:40.480
All right.

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:43.400
So we got to do some consolidated voting because we got a bunch of really good contenders

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:44.400
here at the top.

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.400
So everybody head over.

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:46.400
Do me a solids.

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:54.200
Oh, how about how to measure off Fox?

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.520
Windcloud's Cry currently leading.

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:57.520
JBtitles.

01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:58.520
JBtitles.

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:03.120
So now that I'm back on Solus, I have the actual Spotify desktop client installed again

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:06.840
for like the first time in a while because that shit definitely broke at Anagros months

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.840
ago.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:18.280
So yeah, someone earlier was having trouble with tap to click or something in me.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.280
The problem.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.280
What's that?

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:23.000
The tap to click is always a problem.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.360
So Forks Done Right and When Clouds Cry are tied now.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.440
Forks Done Right was probably the most energetic time of the show.

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:36.520
Tell you what, Chris, how to measure a Fox is climbing up there.

01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:37.520
Jeez.

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:40.360
That's I like the way it looks on the screen.

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:41.360
Yeah.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.360
JBtitles.com.

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.360
So we got to break out.

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:44.360
We got to break out.

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.360
Oh, God, you guys.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:48.600
Are you guys are you guys screwing with me because that was happening right now because

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:51.520
we have we have a tie.

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:57.280
Ah, I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:59.800
Forks Done Right pulling ahead with one boat right now.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:02.560
We need like a timer.

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.680
Alexa.

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:09.520
Set a thirty second timer.

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:10.520
Thirty seconds.

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.520
No, just she's too stupid.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.520
She's too stupid.

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:17.360
We need the 24 sound effect for the time counting down.

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.480
What did she set the timer for?

01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:20.480
What?

01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:24.120
This is too stupid timer.

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:28.880
I presume for 30 seconds.

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.120
So she wanted a name for the timer?

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.120
Is that what she meant?

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:37.480
She wanted the time, but then afterwards we named it too stupid.

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:42.080
The thing with the echo is if you don't nail that syntax, it just don't work.

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.080
That's so dumb.

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:46.920
Anyways, Forks Done Right is pulling way ahead now with 12.

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.640
I kind of like it, too.

01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:50.640
Oh, it's done.

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.680
Just do stupid timer.

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:55.880
That's good, dude.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:56.880
Stupid timer is done.

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:57.880
All right.

01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:58.880
Good job, everybody.

01:36:58.880 --> 01:36:59.880
We're gonna go with Forks Done Right.

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:03.640
Why is she still talking?

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:11.320
Apparently she was letting you know again.

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.280
Okay, Alexa, I feel like she's harassing us.

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.280
Alexa, remove timer.

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:21.480
God damn, it's broken.

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:22.480
Alexa.

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.480
Alexa.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.480
Stop.

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:38.720
He's not answering me.
