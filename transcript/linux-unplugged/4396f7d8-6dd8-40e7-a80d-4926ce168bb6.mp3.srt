1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
So, none of us probably are really happy with the state of advertising on the web.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,880
I'm looking at you, Ferronix.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,280
And it seems like adblock isn't quite enough.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,640
So check out this new type of adblock.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,840
It's called adnauseum.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,440
And this not only hides ads using your standard adblock plugin, it also simultaneously clicks

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,600
all of the ads and hides all of the associated windows that come up after they've been clicked

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,720
to send click signals to all the advertising networks to essentially jam their signals.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,720
Bam!

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,240
Yeah, to basically make it like, okay, well fine, you're going to keep trying to get more

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,800
and more invasive with the tracking.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,520
When that first comes out, a bunch of sites, probably like Ferronix, are going to get banned

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,400
from the advertising networks for click fraud.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
I know.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Who is that?

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
That's Alan.

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Hi.

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
Oh, okay.

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
I was going to say, that sounds like Alan.

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,760
That sounds like some handsome Canadian I know.

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,240
I know there's another guy that does sound like Alan.

22
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Have you been talking to other Alans?

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
It really sounded like Alan.

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
No, no, no, no.

25
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
Have you been talking to other Canadians?

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
No, it's another mumble guy.

27
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Hi, Alan.

28
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Really?

29
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Somebody that sounds like me, I must find this person and destroy it.

30
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Right, exactly.

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
So what do you think?

32
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Do you think this is going to cause a problem?

33
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,120
Do you think this is going to cause like a big upset on the web?

34
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,960
This sounds like a gigantic dick move to me.

35
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,280
It's GPL too.

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,920
It seems to me that like, you know, if you were to install it, you're, just you wouldn't,

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
you wouldn't do anything.

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
They'd be like, haha, look at those, look at they're trying to, you know, essentially

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
DDoS, right?

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,120
Well, it's to, I think it's to piss off the advertisers.

41
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,000
What happens if one of the advertising sites is compromised?

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,560
Does that mean you click through some chunky Java thing that compromises your machine?

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,680
Although the way the code works is I guess it immediately kills the window or something

44
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
like that.

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,160
Iamicon brings up a very good point.

46
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,240
What's that, Andrews?

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,960
He says, so are some, well, I think his point is like, if you went to a site where you're

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:09,320
okay with ads, you're, you'd be doing, your dick move gets a dick move, right?

49
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,400
But isn't that true with just using ad block if you're, if you like, say you really liked

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Ferran.

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
No.

52
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Cause that's passive.

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,800
Well, if you really thought, no, this website is aggressive.

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
It's true.

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
You're not.

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Yeah.

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
You're just not displaying them.

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Yeah.

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,280
There is definitely a potential for problems with malicious ads.

60
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
It's Alan.

61
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,680
Also, Iamicon brings up another good point.

62
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,320
Ad block doesn't stop Ferronics.

63
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,640
Yes, it does.

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,240
Really what you should do is, I see no adverts on Ferronics right now.

65
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Neither do I.

66
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,860
Go, go do the tutorial we did on BSD now, and you can block them on your BSD or Linux

67
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,400
based router, and then you just replace all the ads on the websites with a one by one

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,880
pixel GIF file.

69
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,160
I just think that if you don't have a problem with ad block, you really shouldn't have a

70
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
problem with ad nauseam.

71
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,440
I mean ad nauseam, yes, is one step further, but ad block is still robbing the websites

72
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
of view revenue.

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
It is.

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Right.

75
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,960
But that's just not giving viewers, whereas the click fraud is actually, yeah, it causes

76
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
serious issues.

77
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
I mean, I agree.

78
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
It's another step.

79
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,440
I tend to turn it off for sites that I use a lot, so actually I see quite a lot of adverts

80
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,800
on the web because I disable it for a lot of sites.

81
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I do try.

82
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,720
I forget to do that, but I do try to do it for some sites.

83
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,000
At the same time, there are some sites who actually detect that you're running ad blocking

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
software and tell you about it.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, they guilt trip you.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah.

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, exactly.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,680
Well, they not only guilt trip you, but also say, if you don't turn that off, we're going

89
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,720
to do this, this, and this, like cookies and what have you to track you.

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
All right.

91
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Second pre-show topic.

92
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Okay.

93
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
I got a second pre-show topic.

94
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
All right.

95
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,280
Because I think everybody's probably done with this one.

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,720
I'm really excited and I need like a correspondent to keep us posted on new developments because

97
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,560
there is, in the makings, an open source Age of Empires II clone.

98
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Meh.

99
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Nice.

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Really?

101
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
I know.

102
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,920
He like backed away from the microphone to give that silent pause.

103
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
I was excited.

104
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Yeah.

105
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,240
My favorite childhood game.

106
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Yeah.

107
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
This is like...

108
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
I never...

109
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
It was never my favorite.

110
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,440
Oh, Age of Empires is great.

111
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,480
And I've always wanted on Linux and right now, that's one of the reasons I use Crossover

112
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
actually, is to get...

113
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
I use Crossover to play.

114
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Canyon Conqueror was better.

115
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Yeah.

116
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
I like them both.

117
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,880
But as far as a continuation of Age of Empires, Rise of Nations was nice.

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,880
It kind of combined Age of Empires with Sin, but kept the real time aspect.

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Yeah.

120
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,000
My dad's a big fan of that game.

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,080
So it's going to be called Open Age.

122
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:53,080
It's being written in C++ 11 with Python scripting support.

123
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
I don't know.

124
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
I'm pretty excited.

125
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,160
I love the idea of a native Age of Empires on Linux.

126
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,320
Maybe because I currently use Wine to play Age of Empires III.

127
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
So I feel the pain.

128
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
I know.

129
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
It's pretty exciting.

130
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
I love it.

131
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
I love it.

132
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
I love old games come back with a vengeance.

133
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:14,840
That's some good music, but what am I doing on this show?

134
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,360
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by a failed adrenal

135
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
gland.

136
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
My name is Chris.

137
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,480
And my name is Matt.

138
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,640
I just say that because I feel like I've exhausted all adrenal glands in my body, but I'm here.

139
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Adrenal gland.

140
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
It gives you adrenaline?

141
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Really?

142
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Nobody knows about adrenal glands except for me?

143
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
Okay, fine.

144
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Whatever.

145
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
It was a bad intro.

146
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,920
But that's okay, because we're going to make up for it with the rest of the show, Matt,

147
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,360
coming up in this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

148
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,060
We're going to go down to Seagull.

149
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,000
It was going on at the same time as Ohio Linux Fest.

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,800
And producer Eric was there, scoring us some interviews.

151
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
So we're going to do that.

152
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,520
Plus, our follow-up from Ohio Linux Fest will get the crew's take on the trip.

153
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,640
And that's why very special guest Angela Fisher joins us in the studio today.

154
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Here I am, everybody.

155
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
Hello, hello, Angela.

156
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Hello.

157
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Two shows in one day.

158
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
Wow.

159
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Geez, that's pretty impressive.

160
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
I know.

161
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
I don't know what that's like.

162
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
Look at you.

163
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Yeah.

164
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
You don't know what that's like.

165
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Well, I'm glad you're here, because not only did you attend Ohio Linux Fest with us.

166
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
I will.

167
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
So we'll get your take.

168
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,040
But there's actually some great interviews Eric got from Seagull about women getting

169
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,360
involved in technology, the makerspace, and coding, and all of that.

170
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
So we'll chat about some of those things, because I know that's an area of your interest.

171
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,120
But first, we are joined by an excellent mumble group.

172
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,720
Hey, everybody in the mumble room.

173
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Thanks for being here today.

174
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Hello.

175
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Hello, Eric.

176
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Hello.

177
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Greetings.

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
I think my adrenal gland is constantly working.

179
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Yeah.

180
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Yeah, probably.

181
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
See, Eric was on board.

182
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Eric was on board.

183
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
He knew.

184
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Thank you, Eric.

185
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
I have so much energy.

186
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Thank you, Eric.

187
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Thank you.

188
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
OK, so let's start with some feedback this week before we get into all of the conference

189
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
stuff.

190
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,480
So Jor-El wrote in Father of Superman, and he says, hafa'ata, Chris and Matt.

191
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,480
I don't actually know what that means, but I like it.

192
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,000
Is it greetings, maybe?

193
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,360
I saw on last, the one with Ubuntu 14.10 released.

194
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,000
It got me interested enough to check out the changelog myself.

195
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,600
So I head over to the Ubuntu website.

196
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,720
I start to look at the changelog, and I try to find out what's coming up.

197
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,640
However, everything in the changelog seems to be pretty superficial.

198
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,920
In other words, they are giving us words that some people look for, but nothing really specific,

199
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,160
nothing really deep about certain bugs that were fixed or things like that.

200
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
So what do you guys think?

201
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,180
How do you dive deeper when you're trying to make a decision on whether or not to upgrade

202
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,320
to the next Linux distribution?

203
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,960
You want to get down to the meat of the details.

204
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,440
You got to sniff stuff out.

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,200
Matt, when you're trying to figure out the nitty-gritty between releases, do you have

206
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,960
any tricks to do, any sleuthing?

207
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Not necessarily.

208
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,280
I mean, with any distribution, unless it's a rolling distro and then I just don't care,

209
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,360
but with any distro I actually have to upgrade to, I generally never will make that jump

210
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,960
until it's had at least two or three months out in the open a little bit, kind of let

211
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,880
the stink off a little bit, let it air out.

212
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
There you go.

213
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,160
Yeah, that's one way to kind of crowdsource it, in a sense, and let people find stuff.

214
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
What do you think, Popey?

215
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,200
Is there maybe a more distribution-specific resource, like say in the case of Ubuntu you

216
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
could use?

217
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:11,000
So yeah, we do have a mailing list called Release Name Changes, and that opens as soon

218
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,300
as the release opens.

219
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,740
So when Trusty opens, there'll be a mailing list called Trusty Changes, and every single

220
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,560
change is in that mailing list, like every bug, every single change, but nobody reads

221
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
that.

222
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
You wouldn't want to read it.

223
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
I mean, what, you could.

224
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,640
You could search the archive, right?

225
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
You could, yeah.

226
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,400
It's all public.

227
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
You could read that.

228
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,800
Or you could look at the individual change logs for each package.

229
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
You could do that.

230
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
If you go to packages.ubuntu.com, you could do that.

231
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
There you go.

232
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,840
See, I got the sense he was looking for a specific change.

233
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,920
What about like checking the bug tracker?

234
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Is that crazy?

235
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,640
I mean, if he's looking for something specific, right?

236
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,760
Well, the change log links to the bug tracker.

237
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,760
It links to each Launchpad bug that's been fixed, so yeah, you could do that.

238
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,360
So it's a little different distro to distro, so it sounds like that's a good approach for

239
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,580
Ubuntu, and for the most part, there's probably something similar for other distributions

240
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,580
out there.

241
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,320
And I never really think about it that much.

242
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,800
I always do kind of look at the broader changes, but when you get down, when you narrow down,

243
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,240
sometimes you're like, I want to know, is this specific thing solved?

244
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Otherwise, it's not worth my upgrade.

245
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,920
So it was a good question, Joel, and any of you out there in the audience, oh, go ahead.

246
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,920
On FreeBSD, we've actually recently come up with a better solution to this problem, because

247
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,040
nobody's going to read the SVN logs to see every commit that's come in, and so we've

248
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,640
always had release notes, this big document that comes with each version, and it describes

249
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,200
what was changed.

250
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,720
But maintaining that basically ended up with one guy the week before the release going

251
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,280
through the SVN logs, and that became very difficult.

252
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,680
So in our source code control now, when you write your commit message, we have a bunch

253
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,900
of fields that we use by standard in FreeBSD, like approved by this person, or a bug was

254
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,560
found by this person, or this commit was sponsored by this company, or whatever, and there's

255
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,220
now one called release notes, yes.

256
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,080
And when that's there, then you can just compile a list of every change that was significant

257
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,120
enough to need to be noted in the next release notes.

258
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,520
So the developer has to kind of plug in that data?

259
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
And they generally do?

260
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,700
So every time somebody makes a change, they note whether they think it's worthy of going

261
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,240
in the release notes for the next version.

262
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Okay.

263
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,120
So yes, it's not foolproof, but they found it helps a lot, because it helps the documentation

264
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,400
team come up with that list of what has actually changed in this next release.

265
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,800
And so there's still a human then that takes sort of that input and then formats it?

266
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,560
Yes, it iterates it into a nicely English-formatted document and breaks down into sections, like

267
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,840
these are the new drivers we got, and these are the new applications we have.

268
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
We upgraded KDE to this version.

269
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,280
Yeah, getting the drivers and stuff like that broken out is specifically handy.

270
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,560
If you've ever been in that situation where, and I think, Eric, you've been in this position

271
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,440
where a Linux kernel version comes along, and all of a sudden something that worked

272
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,680
on your laptop before is no longer working right, and it really comes down to a driver.

273
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Yeah.

274
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,480
Didn't that kind of happen to you recently?

275
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,880
Yeah, it did, actually.

276
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,360
When 3, I believe it was 3.15 came out, it actually, my computer would not boot.

277
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,960
It would go into a failed state.

278
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
The processor would go into full.

279
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,200
I mean, it would load the kernel and then done.

280
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,600
And part of that, it turned out to be a video driver issue.

281
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,820
They enabled something in the BayTrail video processors, and what they enabled doesn't

282
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,080
work for mine, so it just crashed it.

283
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,840
Luckily, I was able to work with the guys to figure out what happened, and submit a

284
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,160
bug report, and it got fixed with the next version.

285
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,640
So you're okay now?

286
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,840
Oh yeah, everything 3.16, 3.17, no problems.

287
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,520
It was fun talking to folks.

288
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,960
I didn't realize people still play with their Linux kernels.

289
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,080
I met a couple of people at Ohio Linux Fest that kind of, we got on the topic of what

290
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,000
they do to their Linux rigs, and a lot of them were like, yeah, I try out different

291
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,400
stuff, so people are plugging this stuff away just for funsies.

292
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
So I think it is more of a topic than we think, if people want to track this stuff.

293
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Hey, I'll tell you about something I want to track.

294
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
That's Ting.

295
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,800
Go over right now, I want you to go to linux.ting.com, that's our first sponsor this week, linux.ting.com,

296
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,280
linux.ting.com, and that'll take $25 off your first device.

297
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,520
If you've already got a Ting device, they'll give you a $25 credit for service.

298
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,760
And if you're getting something like a Wi-Fi hotspot, you know, like one of those MyFis,

299
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,000
or you don't use a lot of minutes, that might last you more than a month.

300
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But it did for me.

301
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,960
I actually got like, I think it was almost my first two months for free.

302
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,680
And Ting's great, because you only pay for what you use, there's no contract.

303
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
It's $6 a line.

304
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,960
So you want to get a new phone, you want another phone, it's $6, straightforward, and then

305
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
it's just your usage.

306
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,840
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, your megabytes, they add them all up.

307
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,680
You want to turn on hotspot and tethering, it's just your data usage.

308
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,360
If you need customer support, you call them, 1-855-TING-FTW, and a real person answers

309
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
the phone.

310
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,800
And you know, Ange, I'm coming up on my two-year mark with Ting.

311
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
That's pretty awesome.

312
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Yep.

313
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
It's kind of crazy.

314
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,960
You know, if you've been thinking about Ting, you should go over to linux.ting.com right

315
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
now.

316
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Try out their savings calculator.

317
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,840
Plug in your actual usage, what you pay, and see what it would look like for you.

318
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,040
And it's so handy for me, I'm extremely lucky that I have got fantastic Ting service here

319
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
by the studio.

320
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,640
I mean, I did a speed test the other day, I got 18 megabits download on my cell phone.

321
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
Wow.

322
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Yeah.

323
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,600
And to that point, you know, there was a time when Allen had flown in for Linux Fest Northwest,

324
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,760
and Comcast, as Comcast do, went down.

325
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,380
And we were able to continue on by turning the hotspot, the tethering actually was the

326
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,000
Wi-Fi hotspotting, on my Nexus 5 on, and we ran off of the Ting connection for the day.

327
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's crazy.

328
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,600
Got the show prep done, did all of the visuals off our Ting connection.

329
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,880
It really saved the day.

330
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
It's really handy to have.

331
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,040
And the other thing that's great about Ting is that dashboard allows you to turn devices

332
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
on and off.

333
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,180
So if you want to have a travel phone, but you don't necessarily need it all the time,

334
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,840
go in there and deactivate the line for a little while.

335
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
Same with the MiFi adapters.

336
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,600
If you go to linux.ting.com, you're going to get $25 off the device.

337
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,980
So it's a great way to start.

338
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,120
And they've always got interesting stuff, too, on their blog.

339
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,600
Go to linux.ting.com and then click the blog.

340
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,880
They've got a post up about the internet rockstar Robin Chase joining the board of directors

341
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
at Ting.

342
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
It's pretty cool.

343
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,480
Robin's from Zipcar, Netflix, Etsy, Skype, you know, you've probably heard a few of those

344
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
companies.

345
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Oh, wow.

346
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
Yeah, now sitting at the board at Ting.

347
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Geez.

348
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Pretty cool.

349
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Ting's got so many great service.

350
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,600
They've also got a fantastic online community at help.ting.com.

351
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,760
So never again do you have to worry about overages if you go over a date.

352
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
There's no limit.

353
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
It's just what you use.

354
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,280
You don't have to worry about early termination fees.

355
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,240
And if you're stuck in a contract right now, Ting has early termination relief.

356
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,200
Go to ting.com slash ETF and they'll help you get out of your contract by paying up

357
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,680
to $75 in Ting credits for each line you have to cancel.

358
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,280
And that's going to get you a great Ting service, too, because I've got three smartphones right

359
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,340
now on my Ting plan.

360
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,520
It's around 40, 45 bucks a month for me.

361
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,680
It's a great deal.

362
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,300
Linux.ting.com, mobile that finally makes sense.

363
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,240
Stop letting the carriers take advantage of you and go vote with your wallet.

364
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Linux.ting.com.

365
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,440
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

366
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
All right.

367
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, so we have just a couple more bits of emails to get to, and then I want to get to,

368
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,200
we got five really great interviews that Eric grabbed for us.

369
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,840
But Martin wrote in to celebrate the release of SUSE Linux Enterprise desktop 12.

370
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Woo!

371
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
And this is good.

372
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,440
In coming up on this Sunday, we're going to review the new open SUSE.

373
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,360
And I think a lot of this release is going to be influenced by what you see in SLED.

374
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,400
So he says, I'm really excited because SUSE Linux Enterprise desktop 12 just released.

375
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,160
The links he gives us talk about a little bit.

376
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,740
He says, also interesting news.

377
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,360
Just before the open SUSE 3.2 review next Sunday, I'm rocking open SUSE 13.2 for three

378
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
weeks.

379
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
I've had no problems at all.

380
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,840
I have ButterFS for my file system, XFS for my home directory, a rock-solid release in

381
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
my opinion.

382
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,320
Best regards, Martin from the Netherlands.

383
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,400
So there you go.

384
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,840
Pretty exciting.

385
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,600
And one more email before we get to the interviews.

386
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Bruce writes in, and he wants to know something maybe if we can just share a little collective

387
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
wisdom guys.

388
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,400
I've been a LastLup fan for a year or so.

389
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
He says he distro hops.

390
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,600
He's been doing distro hopping since Red Hat 6.

391
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
He loves to have fun.

392
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
He loves to move around.

393
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,540
But he says he's constantly reading and hearing the gospel that the single greatest benefit

394
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,800
of Linux is freedom.

395
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,280
Freedom to slice and dice the way you want to modify it.

396
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,640
To share and distribute.

397
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,520
To change and update.

398
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,840
If that freedom is such a fundamental belief, why are there such protracted and heated debates

399
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,760
on topics like systemd and, before that, canonical immunity?

400
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,720
Where is the respect for the freedom of the people putting their heart and soul into those

401
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
developments?

402
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,040
As I see it, they're doing no more than exercising the very freedom the community shouts from

403
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,560
the rooftops, but they seem to draw a lot of flack for doing so.

404
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,260
If the rest don't like the direction those folks are going in, then like me, they can

405
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,680
exercise their freedom and simply use or not use the distro that included those changes.

406
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Ultimately, wouldn't the market decide?

407
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,720
How can a fraternity that preaches freedom not respect others who exercise that freedom

408
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,900
or is it just that haters are going to hate?

409
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,600
Keep up the good work, Bruce.

410
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:51,480
Does fraternity imply only men?

411
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,400
I think what it comes down to is the Linux community, while it does believe in all of

412
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,960
those things, it also believes in technical merits.

413
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,440
And I think the problem is that when people see technical merits like science facts, it's

414
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,120
hard concrete facts and so to them, if you don't believe in something, you're not accepting

415
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,960
fact and so then people want to try to convince you to accept fact for whatever reason they

416
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
have invested in it.

417
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,520
Do you guys think I'm onto something or is that just cray?

418
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,520
I don't know, I wonder.

419
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,600
So we don't know, Bruce, but we think it's just human nature and don't worry, everywhere

420
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,800
there's a noisy person, there's five or six other people that aren't saying anything at

421
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,880
all that aren't making a big fuss and it's just human nature and it's just part of the

422
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
fun.

423
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Just part of the fun.

424
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
All right.

425
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
So let's move on.

426
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
We'll keep going.

427
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,080
In fact, you know, unless, does anybody in the Mumba room have any thoughts on how to

428
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,560
get people to simmer down?

429
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,120
I know, Popi, this is an old whipping horse of yours, right?

430
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,880
I have no idea what you're talking about.

431
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Yeah, of course.

432
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
All right.

433
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,440
Well, we got a whole batch of interviews to get into, so let's do one more sponsor spot

434
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,560
before we get to those.

435
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
I want to thank DigitalOcean.

436
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,240
Let's go over to DigitalOcean.com right now, everybody, DigitalOcean.com and use the promo

437
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
code unpluggedoctober.

438
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,640
You've got a little bit of time left, so why not go apply to your account right now.

439
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,960
Unpluggedoctober, all one word, lowercase.

440
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
So what is DigitalOcean?

441
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,520
Ange, do you know what DigitalOcean is?

442
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Yeah.

443
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,040
It's DigitalOcean's that make sense.

444
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,760
Here, read that top.

445
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Go for it.

446
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
I want to hear how you do.

447
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,560
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

448
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,600
easy way to spin up a cloud server.

449
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Hey-oh!

450
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
That's right.

451
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,200
And users can get started in less than 55 seconds.

452
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,800
Some of you are doing about 30 seconds or so.

453
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
And guess what?

454
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,360
The cloud hosting plan started only $5 per month, and that's going to get you 512 megabytes

455
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,200
of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, because they're all SSDs.

456
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
What's up?

457
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,920
One CPU and a terabyte of transfer.

458
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,080
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

459
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
and London.

460
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,440
But Ange, I've got to tell you about that interface.

461
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
It's simple.

462
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
It's intuitive.

463
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,160
And power users can replicate it on the straightforward API like you do all the time.

464
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Awesome.

465
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,320
You're always implementing it on that API.

466
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,520
And I want you to go over to DigitalOcean right now and just check out their interface.

467
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,200
They've got a demo on their front page.

468
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,560
Just scroll down a little bit and look at that UI.

469
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
That's not a mock-up.

470
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,440
That's actually what their interface looks like.

471
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,420
That's the UI you use to spin up KVM virtual machines in data centers all over the world

472
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,200
that you can migrate, take snapshots, do DNS management, have HTML5 console access.

473
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,840
It's incredible.

474
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
Just go look at it.

475
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,280
Just go put your face up against the screen and just be amazed.

476
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,440
I am all the time.

477
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
And DigitalOcean's getting even better with their new community tutorials.

478
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,040
In fact, they'll pay you $100, $200 to write a tutorial for DigitalOcean.

479
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,320
And don't even worry.

480
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
They're going to help you hit the easy button.

481
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,720
They've got an editing staff that will work with you to make sure you look smart and that

482
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,440
you don't spell things wrong like I do.

483
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Right?

484
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,500
That's a big problem.

485
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
And I understand.

486
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
And DigitalOcean does too.

487
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,760
So they've got editors that work with you.

488
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,840
You write up a good tutorial, they're going to give you like $200 or something like that.

489
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,280
They're going to pay you appropriately, I'm sure.

490
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,960
If you write crap, I'll personally write in there and ask them not to pay you $200.

491
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,920
I don't know if they'll go for it, but that'll be my mission life, so do a good job.

492
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,520
But they'll work with you, so that way it's great, I'm sure.

493
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,780
Go over to DigitalOcean.com right now.

494
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,640
Buy the promo code UnpluggedOctober, spin up a droplet and try something out.

495
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,720
GitLab, WordPress, BitTorrent Sync, OwnCloud 7, all of these things that we talk about

496
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
all the time.

497
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,780
Docker, CoreOS, anything like that.

498
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,160
Go have some fun and educate yourself because you can do it for two months for absolutely

499
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,360
free when you use our promo code UnpluggedOctober, you're going to get a $10 credit.

500
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
It's a pretty great service.

501
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,440
I've had them for a while now.

502
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,960
They run some of the back end infrastructure for Jupiter Broadcasting, a lot of the back

503
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,720
end infrastructure for Michael Dominic from Quota Radio for all his clients.

504
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,800
It's a really great service, DigitalOcean.com and thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

505
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Linux Unplugged.

506
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Okay, so now that we got our sponsors out of the way, we can get a whole batch of interviews

507
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
done.

508
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
So let's just jump right into them.

509
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,700
So Seagull happened October 24th and the 25th.

510
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,260
It's a grassroots technical conference dedicated to spreading awareness and knowledge about

511
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,600
GNU slash Linux and the community and also free Libre open source software all around

512
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,520
that and even hardware.

513
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,760
So it is kind of new, right, Eric?

514
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
It's like what?

515
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
It's second or third year?

516
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,720
This was his second year, yes.

517
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
Okay, yeah.

518
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
So it's just getting started.

519
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,200
Eric, how many people would you say?

520
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,120
About 200 people there or what?

521
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,080
I would say about 100 to 200, yeah, easily.

522
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
All right.

523
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,600
Well, our first interview is Aaron Peterson.

524
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,400
He's actually a friend of the show.

525
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,520
We met him when we went to our Kubota users meetup and he's the one that put the plasma

526
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,560
cake together.

527
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,880
So we'll start with that and then we'll move right along.

528
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Hi, guys.

529
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm here with Aaron Peterson of FreeGeek Seattle and I would just like him to tell us a little

530
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
bit more about it.

531
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,080
Hi.

532
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,300
FreeGeek Seattle is an organization that will help take old computers and find a good home

533
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,880
for them.

534
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:53,080
We'll install ethical software on it and we'll teach and train people how to do that at some

535
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,680
of our workshops.

536
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,480
So if you need a computer, you can come to our workshops on Saturdays at the Filipino

537
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:08,960
Community Center and we will help you work on a computer and at the end of the program,

538
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,600
you can end up with a computer.

539
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,560
So he specifically goes out there and his community works on these old computers that

540
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,600
people turn in and a lot of times, these people will turn in computers and they'll be missing

541
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,600
the hard drive or they'll be missing RAM which people will gut them and then bring them in

542
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,440
so they kind of rebuild them, repurpose them, they get them loaded up with Linux and Libre

543
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,880
Office and you can come in there and work on these computers and then you get to leave

544
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
with a computer.

545
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,040
That was pretty neat.

546
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
That is really awesome.

547
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Yeah.

548
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,760
So our next interview is Art from Pogo Linux and Eric, if you have anything you want to

549
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,200
say, I need to just jump in but I thought we'd do these first ones kind of quick because

550
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,640
they're kind of our short ones.

551
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Oh yeah, totally.

552
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,840
This is Art from Pogo Linux who we visited a while back for How To Linux.

553
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,440
Now you guys might remember from How To Linux Episode 3, we last spoke to people at Pogo

554
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Linux.

555
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,680
So I'm here with Art from Pogo Linux, here to talk to him about some of the developments

556
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,400
they've had since then.

557
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,360
So Art, what can you tell us?

558
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,920
Well, we've been busy with a lot of stuff, a lot of new marketing things including this

559
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,160
show.

560
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,320
We love Seagull, we love supporting the open source community.

561
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,480
Right, it wasn't too far for you to go across the water either.

562
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,800
So what kind of products can you highlight for us real quick to tell us about people

563
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,720
who might be interested in some servers?

564
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,600
Oh yeah, I mean we have our huge line of servers and storage solutions and all the way up from

565
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,600
a tiny 1U to a full on cluster, whatever you need.

566
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,880
But the fun thing to talk about right now, at least I find it fun so maybe you will too,

567
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,800
is we're working on a silent workstation.

568
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,680
We can't really say it's silent, but it's so close to silent that it might as well be.

569
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,960
Like in terms of decibels, where are we talking about?

570
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,480
Like right around the noise floor of a typical room, like below a conversation level, below

571
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,160
a whisper almost.

572
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,080
So we're talking if sometimes, I'm assuming it's water cooled, is that correct?

573
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Absolutely.

574
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,920
Okay, so in terms of water cooled solutions, sometimes they sound a little bit like a refrigerator.

575
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,080
I've heard that a few times with some very quiet fans on top.

576
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,260
How does it compare to that?

577
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:33,720
It's even quieter because it's a newer setup and it is designed to be as close to silent

578
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,520
as they can possibly manage.

579
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:43,160
And the fans are all specifically designed for that and I think it's pretty impressive.

580
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,360
Hey Ange, I want a water cooled workstation.

581
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,520
Yeah, that would be awesome.

582
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,600
I noticed Linux Fest Northwest was there.

583
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
That's awesome.

584
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Were they?

585
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Did you see them in the background?

586
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Yeah, that was the totem pole right there.

587
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Yeah, that was them, wasn't it?

588
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Yeah, they were there.

589
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,960
They were right next to Pogo Linux and they were there just to support Seagull and try

590
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,200
to help them get going.

591
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,160
Yeah, well you know what else is cool, Eric?

592
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,520
Pogo Linux was in Ohio at the same time.

593
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Yeah, they were.

594
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,080
Yeah, Art was telling me that.

595
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,400
Yeah, they had a booth there.

596
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,440
So they really hustle, I guess.

597
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
Yeah.

598
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,840
So they didn't happen to have that workstation there for demo, did they, Eric?

599
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,480
They did not have it there for demo.

600
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,260
They pretty much just had the table with a bunch of stickers and brochures, but that's

601
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
about it.

602
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,260
I'm all about silent.

603
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,600
I'm all about that silent these days.

604
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,320
So I'll be curious to see how that goes.

605
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,200
And they're in our neck of the woods, so maybe we can go down there and see what's up in

606
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
a little while.

607
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Yeah.

608
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Okay.

609
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,280
So if you know anything about me, you know I love the idea of people taking the power

610
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,560
of the internet on their own, a mesh network.

611
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,000
You don't need the man, you don't need Comcast, we'll all just individually connect to each

612
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,720
other and blanket the world in mesh networking, maybe.

613
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,600
And I guess you got to start somewhere, so why not in Seattle?

614
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,080
So here's Dan from the Seattle MeshNet.

615
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,360
Hi, I'm here with Dan Ryan of the Seattle MeshNet, and he's going to tell us a little

616
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,440
bit more about that.

617
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,880
So Dan, what can you tell us about the Seattle MeshNet, how it works and whatnot?

618
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:19,600
Well, basically the Seattle MeshNet is a community-owned and run network, and we use wireless radios

619
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:28,400
like this one right here to go and create a network between households and office buildings.

620
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,400
We use a routing protocol called CJDNS to hook it all together.

621
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,800
And that's basically what it is, you know?

622
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Cool.

623
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,160
So the way I'm understanding this is it's basically a bunch of networks just kind of

624
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,420
communicating with each other so that you're not having to rely so much on one single

625
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,880
internet service provider, is that correct?

626
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,240
Exactly.

627
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,820
That's basically what we do.

628
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,660
There's multiple gateways to the internet that you can use.

629
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,800
People who offer their business class connections, you know, at no cost, you know.

630
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,320
And the eventual idea is you'll have people, you know, operating their own little, I guess

631
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,720
you could call them ISPs, you know, for a couple bucks a month you can get an IP, you

632
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,880
know, and a certain port speed or something like that, you know.

633
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Okay.

634
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,940
So you're using these devices.

635
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,080
It's honestly just people's household networks and business networks all just kind of combined

636
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,840
into one gigantic network.

637
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,280
Are there any security implications with these?

638
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,320
Well, it's not really routing their current, like, IPv4 or IPv6 network, you know, out

639
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,040
to the general community, you know.

640
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,680
We have a routing application called CJDNS, and it's actually a full network suite.

641
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:43,720
It assigns you an IPv6 address using a public-private key pair, you know.

642
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,960
And it goes and, you know, provides you a secure way to communicate with other nodes

643
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,400
by, you know, using Salsa 20 encryption to, you know, create encrypted links, you know,

644
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,400
between you and whoever you connect to, you know.

645
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:01,840
And so it's encrypted end-to-end, and it's, you know, fairly fast and reliable, you know.

646
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,520
On some of, you know, our worst links, you know, we've tested IPv4 versus CJDNS, and,

647
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,480
you know, the latency difference, you know, one will, you know, take 20 milliseconds,

648
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,040
the other will take two.

649
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Right.

650
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Okay.

651
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,040
So how much would something like this cost to get up and running for the average person,

652
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,520
like average household?

653
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,680
Generally, you know, around $100, you know, right around that mark, yeah.

654
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,040
It's not too bad price-wise, you know, to get set up and running.

655
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Okay.

656
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,720
And if anybody wanted more information, where would they go to find out?

657
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:45,280
Go to seattlemesh.net, you know, and check out our map at seattlemesh.net slash map.

658
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,840
So there might be a drinking game there.

659
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Okay.

660
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,760
Well, let's not troll our guests.

661
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,520
So did you get a good picture of the hardware, Eric?

662
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,280
Like were you able to hold it?

663
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,920
I was able to hold it.

664
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,920
They had some of it right there, and it's just really a white box.

665
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,960
They have two different ones.

666
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,920
One was a small white box, one was a larger white box.

667
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,580
I'm assuming that had to do with whether or not it had more output or not.

668
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,460
So the idea would be I put one in my place, my neighbor puts one in his place, neighbor

669
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,460
down there puts one in her place, and then we just all kind of extend the network down

670
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
there.

671
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,460
Exactly.

672
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,460
I'm ready.

673
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,460
My body is ready for that.

674
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,960
But I feel like we've got to come up with something as an alternative, even if it's

675
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,800
not super great.

676
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,240
The trick with that is making sure that everybody around you is on board with it, otherwise

677
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,800
it doesn't work at all.

678
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Right.

679
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Yes, very much.

680
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,360
But you know, it could be worth it.

681
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,480
If censorship and copyright protection, all this stuff makes the web a mess, even if we

682
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,640
had to have a mesh network that was like two G-speeds by today's standards, I think if

683
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,080
we could send text and audio, it would be totally, totally worth it.

684
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
Well, exactly.

685
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,200
But if you're an RFC or what have you, that doesn't take much bandwidth at all.

686
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,280
Plus, you figure things like torrents and stuff like that, maybe, I don't know how that

687
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,120
would work in a mesh network setup.

688
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,960
I know there's other mesh networking initiatives out there, I just don't know a lot about them.

689
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,520
All you know is a side.

690
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,480
He was really good at speaking.

691
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,800
He didn't seem nervous at all, even though that's a nervous tick.

692
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Sure.

693
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
It was really good.

694
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:17,840
And I can't remember who mentioned it, but there was a meshnet presentation at Ohio Linux

695
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Fest as well.

696
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,240
It's a topic that we continue to poke at, but I don't feel like anything ever really

697
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
gains traction.

698
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,960
I just think it's really crazy that they were in two places at once.

699
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
But I guess we were too.

700
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
Yeah, that's true.

701
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
Technically.

702
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,200
But doesn't it seem like it can't just be something that's in the house, it almost seems

703
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,780
like it has to be something that's on the mobile too, so that way everybody moving around

704
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,880
is contributing to the network.

705
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
I think that helps, yeah, definitely.

706
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,920
Yeah, they didn't really have anything like that, but yeah, definitely.

707
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Okay.

708
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,840
So Eric got a chance to talk to Liz Rush.

709
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,400
She's part of, I think it's called Ada.

710
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,120
It's called the Ada Initiative.

711
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,960
The Ada Initiative, and she's going to tell us about that.

712
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,640
I'm here with Liz Rush of, well, she's going to have to tell you a little bit more about

713
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
it.

714
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,160
It's a really cool program for women getting into technology, so here's Liz to tell you

715
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
more about that.

716
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Hi, yeah.

717
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
I'm Liz.

718
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,180
I'm here from Ada Developers Academy, which is a new program in Seattle.

719
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:22,360
It's a year-long, non-profit, tuition-free code school for women, and it is a program

720
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,000
that's really industry-driven.

721
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,440
We have companies that sponsor students, and what we do is six months of in-classroom intensive

722
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
training.

723
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,440
We work on projects in groups and pairs.

724
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:40,200
We do test-driven development, pair programming, we learn agile methodologies, and then after

725
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,320
six months, we move on to internships at local companies that have sponsored, and when they're

726
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,040
in the internships, the students are working in small development teams writing production

727
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
code.

728
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,800
So, it's kind of like an apprenticeship program where they're actively doing the job that

729
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:02,000
they're being trained to do, and really, what the point of the program is is to be an alternative

730
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,440
hiring pipeline for companies who are facing a shortage of developers and having difficulties

731
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,920
attracting female talent.

732
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Yeah, that's huge.

733
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:16,800
Yeah, and then it's also a great way to get really bright, intelligent women into technology

734
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,760
when it hasn't been something that they've been exposed to before.

735
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,520
So a lot of us, I was in the first cohort of women to go through the ADA program, and

736
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:32,120
a lot of us had interest in technology and clearly the aptitude, but we hadn't ever thought

737
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,400
of it as something that was an option for us, and many of us come from backgrounds in

738
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,080
humanities and liberal arts, and those skills have actually transferred really well into

739
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,240
our new careers as developers because we can bring in these outside skills like public

740
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,740
speaking, understanding users, and really kind of having a different perspective on

741
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,480
technology, and that allows us to be really great developers.

742
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,840
So we're out here today trying to spread the word about ADA and find new women who would

743
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,800
be interested in participating in the program and also companies that would like to sponsor.

744
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Oh, wow.

745
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,280
Yeah, that's a lot of information.

746
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:21,600
So it looks like companies like Expedia, Zillow, I'm seeing on your sponsor sheet there.

747
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,920
So what kind of rate do you have of hiring?

748
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,200
What's your hiring rate?

749
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,120
Well, our first group of women to go through the program is actually finishing their last

750
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:44,160
day at internships today, and we have 100% rate of having job offers before graduating.

751
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,880
So that seems like a pretty neat initiative and 100% success rate.

752
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,240
I wonder what ADA stands for because when you first said it, I was going to say, wait,

753
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,560
American with Disabilities Act?

754
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,880
Because ADA Developers Academy, it's actually a recursive acronym.

755
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
Okay.

756
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Oh, yeah.

757
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Okay.

758
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,640
So yeah, it's almost certainly refers to ADA Lovelace.

759
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
Yeah.

760
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Okay.

761
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
That too.

762
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Yeah.

763
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
So this is interesting.

764
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
You know, it's funny.

765
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
You see mixed results in the chat room.

766
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,080
Some people think, well, it's not necessary to have something specific just to women.

767
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,960
But I would argue against that just based on the track record we have so far.

768
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,440
And are the people who are saying that possibly middle class white men?

769
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Maybe.

770
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
I mean, I don't.

771
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
Does it matter?

772
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
Almost certainly.

773
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Yeah, of course.

774
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
I suppose.

775
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
Yeah.

776
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
I guess so.

777
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,440
I guess so.

778
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
I guess so.

779
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
I guess so.

780
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
I guess so.

781
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,040
I think I think people are worried that by by putting people in separate groups and sort

782
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,880
of and giving them special treatment, that that's almost a form of exclusion itself.

783
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,680
And that's kind of what I wanted to get your opinion on.

784
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,920
What do you think about that?

785
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,800
Well, well, the opposite is already true in that, you know, the the industry is already

786
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,120
dominated by white middle class men.

787
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
So right.

788
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
Yes.

789
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
That is already the case.

790
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
Right.

791
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,120
Yeah.

792
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Yeah.

793
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
That's that's kind of my thing.

794
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,560
And that obviously has failed us dramatically.

795
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,880
So and you're of the fair sex.

796
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,880
What do you think?

797
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:12,240
I think it's cool to have a specific place for women to go to specifically learn code

798
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,760
where and I know, yeah, a lot of people are like, well, everybody should have the opportunity

799
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,100
and everybody does have the opportunity.

800
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:25,320
Women can go into other programs and whatever in colleges, but to have one place.

801
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,560
It's about a peer group, isn't it?

802
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,280
I think so, and in learning and in a safe place.

803
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,360
I think it's I think it's a good idea.

804
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
Yeah.

805
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:39,240
And especially knowing that you sorry, go ahead by knowing that you can go somewhere

806
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,160
at knowing you can go somewhere where you're not going to get laid out, latched out, you

807
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,880
know, chatted up, ask for your phone number where you can just get on and do the right

808
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,680
job and hollered at and stuff.

809
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,680
Yeah, exactly.

810
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,740
But not only that, but, you know, look at me.

811
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,580
So I, I have a knack for technology, not, you know, at some pro level, but I have interest

812
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,580
in it.

813
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:04,200
I've always worked on proprietary software programs, implementation and conversion, you

814
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,440
know, things like that.

815
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,520
I've always done the IT for every company that I've worked for, you know, minor IT troubleshooting.

816
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,200
But I decided when I went to college and got my four year degree, I wanted something that

817
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
I could take anywhere.

818
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
I got an operate operations.

819
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,200
I'm sorry, a business operations, business administration.

820
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,920
Bachelors in business administration because I could go anywhere with that.

821
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,200
But you know, in hindsight, I have a knack for technology.

822
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,200
So this could be like an opportunity where I could go back.

823
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,520
Do you feel like you just didn't even consider the technology for some reason?

824
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,400
Or was it more of a like strategy approach?

825
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:46,320
I tried to sit in a technology class in high school, as you know, and it went way over

826
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
my head.

827
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
And it was a beginning class.

828
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,120
It was like, what, NT4 or something?

829
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Probably back then, yeah.

830
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,360
So, you know, and yeah, and I was the only female in there.

831
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,320
That was a little discouraging.

832
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,520
That did kind of make a difference for you.

833
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Yeah, it did.

834
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
It did.

835
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,160
So if you went into a classroom that was maybe full of females.

836
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,140
Yeah, I think, and particularly in the place that I'm at now, being 30, and already have

837
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,800
my four year bachelors, I could do something like an all women's code school and not feel

838
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
like...

839
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,720
There's an inferior-like mentality.

840
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
Not necessarily...

841
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,720
Inferiority complex.

842
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:27,680
Yeah, not necessarily intentional, but I would feel bad holding up a class of men because

843
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,560
I'm behind, you know?

844
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,440
I feel like, yes, I would have the disadvantage.

845
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:38,520
Do you feel like maybe as parents, we could do more to encourage girls to play more with

846
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
technology?

847
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,200
And I wonder if it's like initial channeling, like, oh no, this is for the boys and girls

848
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
you go...

849
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,340
I'm trying to figure out where it kind of stems from because I think one of the reasons

850
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,440
why when you were in that class in high school, you were behind, is because a lot of the boys

851
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:56,440
in that class had an innate, like, they had self-taught to get themselves kind of to there.

852
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,760
I don't know, because I was a little more advanced than a lot of...

853
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,280
It's really hard because we grew up in a very rapid technology...

854
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,120
Yeah, you were really savvy online and dialed up and managed all that to find.

855
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,040
It changed really fast, too, so it's really hard to know because, yeah, I did have to

856
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,880
keep up with it, but yeah, I wasn't completely interested in it directly.

857
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Yeah.

858
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,800
All right, so another note along these same lines, Eric talked to the Seattle Attic Community

859
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,600
Workshop, and we'll play that.

860
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,980
I am here with the Seattle Attic Community Workshop.

861
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,040
This is a project I've never heard of before, but I know these guys really are excited to

862
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,560
talk to you about what they're doing, so maybe you guys can introduce yourselves.

863
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,680
First of all...

864
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,680
My name is Audra.

865
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,080
I work with the University of Washington in the Genome Sciences Department.

866
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,120
For Linux, we use a lot of Linux on our clusters and everything, and I also do open source

867
00:38:53,120 --> 00:39:00,360
work with DreamWith, which also runs on Linux using Perl.

868
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,840
My name's Anne, and I am currently between jobs, but I do a lot of data analysis work,

869
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,480
so R and those sorts of things.

870
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,480
I'm Frances.

871
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,800
I'm working with the Wikimedia Foundation right now, and yeah, a lot of fun.

872
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,920
Hi, I'm Paul.

873
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,960
I use Linux at home and at work.

874
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,640
I'm DevOps for a company called Climate.com.

875
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,080
We have a Linux suite on Amazon Web Services, and I do my own home stuff too.

876
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
Excellent.

877
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:42,000
Could you guys just tell us a little bit more about this Seattle Addict Community Workshop?

878
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,600
Yeah.

879
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,680
We felt that there was a gap in the makerspace community for an explicitly feminist makerspace,

880
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,520
and so we're all about teaching people to make all sorts of things.

881
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,160
Some of them are physical, but other things are getting women into doing open source coding.

882
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,800
We've done a couple of hackathons for DreamWith, which is an open source fork of live journal

883
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,560
material.

884
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,880
I would like to run a Git workshop at some point and get some people in to Git, because

885
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,640
I know a lot of people want to learn it.

886
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:20,240
They've told me, and it can be tricky to pick up on your own because of the UI, and let's

887
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
see here.

888
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,520
Eventually, if we get the setup right, I would also like to see if I can't get a chapter

889
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,440
of Black Girls Code to run.

890
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:37,840
Yeah, around the community that we want to be working towards here isn't one where RTFM,

891
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,040
it's write a better manual together.

892
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
I like that line.

893
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,000
It's not RTFM, it's write a better manual together, which I think is inclusive.

894
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,680
It's more in the spirit of open source too.

895
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
Yeah, definitely.

896
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,160
I was talking to them a lot afterwards, and they were a pleasure to talk to.

897
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,360
Yeah, so tell me more about them.

898
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:02,640
Well, basically they have a very feminist bent to their organization, so that's one

899
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,160
thing to keep in mind, but also they seem to really be wanting to proactively go out

900
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,840
there and help other communities become more woman friendly, which is great.

901
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,480
I think that's a huge thing.

902
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,660
So they'll work with other established communities and just sort of, what, maybe advise and consult

903
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,660
a little bit?

904
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,660
Yes, exactly.

905
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,660
And promote.

906
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,560
They gave me all sorts of contact information, which I think was great.

907
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
Cool.

908
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,800
So Eric, are you going to go back next year?

909
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Absolutely.

910
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Cool.

911
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,600
I think it was a great experience.

912
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,880
It was a little bit on the smaller side, which was great.

913
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,080
Got to know quite a few people, some of which we'll probably have to make sure is in the

914
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
show notes.

915
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,600
Yes, we have a lot more in the show notes, including Eric recorded some of the talks.

916
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,600
We have the audio recording sessions for those, and he also included the YouTube page where

917
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,240
some of the videos are posted, so there's a lot more of Segal in our show notes this

918
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
week.

919
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
Correct.

920
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,240
Yeah.

921
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,320
And it's going to be, I honestly think it has a lot of potential.

922
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,920
The venue at Seattle Central Community College, not the biggest place, but it has only room

923
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,120
to grow in terms of amount of people getting involved and whatnot.

924
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,280
I feel almost selfish that we have so many great events just in our neck of the woods.

925
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,280
I know.

926
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
I know.

927
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
I know.

928
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
I want to do all the things.

929
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
I know, right?

930
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,280
I kind of want to go to this next year.

931
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,520
I think we need to, well we definitely need to have some swag present.

932
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,120
I didn't realize he was going, I would have sent him with some swag.

933
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,040
Yeah, oh yeah, next year for sure.

934
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,860
And it sounded like maybe they'll try to schedule it so it doesn't happen the same weekend as

935
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,400
Ohio Linux Fest, right Eric?

936
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,160
Yeah, they're thinking about it.

937
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,480
It's definitely something in the works.

938
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:45,040
I did talk to Adam from, he was one of the organizers, and he said that they understand

939
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,920
that there's a timing issue and they do want to do some things to address that.

940
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,920
Very good.

941
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,040
Well, Eric, thank you for going down there and grabbing that for us.

942
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,280
It was great to kind of see how that, and I'm glad we're jumping in on it too while

943
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,360
it's still kind of in the early days so that way we can kind of follow along as they expand,

944
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,360
which we will do.

945
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,840
All right, so we've got the crew here, well some of the crew that was here at Ohio Linux

946
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,840
Fest.

947
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,740
We've got a little more to talk about, plus share some stories and things like that.

948
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,000
So why don't I take a minute and thank Linux Academy.

949
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,760
Go over to Linux Academy right now.

950
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,760
Won't you check them out and get yourself certified.

951
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,560
That's right, go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

952
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,560
Check them out.

953
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,640
They've got all kinds of great courses and features for you to take.

954
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,040
They have step-by-step video courses that you can download and take offline.

955
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,320
Audio as well.

956
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,880
If you're like Seth, you can listen in the shower.

957
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,400
If you're like me, you can listen just on your desktop.

958
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,640
I love the downloadable comprehensive study guides too.

959
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,600
They're manuals you can print out or read on your machine.

960
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,440
You can grab them for Linux, AWS OpenStack, DevOps training, all of that.

961
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,640
Self-paced courses with over 835 videos.

962
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,640
It's kind of nuts.

963
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,840
Linux Academy, in addition to four lab servers, you'll receive access to scenario-based labs

964
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
as well.

965
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,040
And this is something really neat they've recently improved is their lab platform now

966
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,300
allows users to have four running Linux servers at one time.

967
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,360
You can have any distribution you would like.

968
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:06,080
They have over seven and they'll automatically adjust all the courseware to match that distribution.

969
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,240
You get two public host names for each server and you can even assign servers roles.

970
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,920
Let's say you want one to be a DB server and one to be a DNS server for your labs and you

971
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,920
can label the roles in your dashboard to help you remember them.

972
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,440
It's so neat and they spin them up on demand when the courseware requires it.

973
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,080
They've got learning plans so you can automatically select how much availability you have and

974
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,160
they'll generate the courseware with your time budgets, reminders to help you keep on

975
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,800
top of if you're a busy person.

976
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,440
I heard from so many of you out there recently that have really been checking it out and

977
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,160
have been super impressed.

978
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,600
I think the number one thing I hear from folks that check out Linux Academy is, yeah, I heard

979
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
of what you said, Chris.

980
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
It sounded really great.

981
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,040
I went and signed up and now I'm blown away and I'm never leaving.

982
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,560
That's the best part about your Linux Academy subscription.

983
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,040
You're always going to get the new stuff.

984
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,240
They're always adding new courseware constantly.

985
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,600
You have a group of educators, Linux enthusiasts, and programmers that have come together to

986
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,560
create Linux Academy specifically for the Linux and open source community.

987
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,080
Now they're starting to reach out into other areas that you might find yourself.

988
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,800
Perhaps you're what you might consider a, quote, unquote, DevOps.

989
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,080
Well, they've got whole sets of courseware for you.

990
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,000
Or you need to migrate something to AWS to help you scale.

991
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,480
They'll walk you through scenario-based training so at the end of your training, you feel like

992
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,160
you've actually done it because you have.

993
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,240
They'll spin up an EC2 instance, S3, all of it for you.

994
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,080
They've got live streams and videos so you can ask the educators questions directly.

995
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,560
They've got a powerful community that'll help keep you motivated.

996
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,320
There's so much great stuff.

997
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,000
When I'm over there, I'm constantly checking out the new stuff just to see what piques

998
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,400
my interest, to see how far I get, and to see if I still got the skills.

999
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,320
But if I was working for a nine to five, this is what I'd be doing to help check that box

1000
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,440
on my next review to show that I'm progressing.

1001
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,260
And if I was still contracting, this is how I would keep my skills sharp, even when I'm

1002
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,080
not working with a client that's particularly scratching any itch that might be up and coming.

1003
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,600
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, say, why don't you go over to Linux Academy right now,

1004
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,080
check them out.

1005
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,800
I talk to them from time to time about some of the things they have coming up and I cannot

1006
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,000
wait to tell you I'm so impressed.

1007
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,880
So there's never been a better time to go to Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and save

1008
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,760
33% on your quarter.

1009
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
That's a great deal.

1010
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,280
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

1011
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,960
Okay, so, Colonel Linux, you still here, did we, I haven't heard you for a while, are you

1012
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,960
still here?

1013
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,960
I'm still here.

1014
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,960
Good, alright, good.

1015
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,600
And just here, we don't have Producer Q5 or Blaster, so that's too bad.

1016
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,600
Too bad Blaster couldn't join us.

1017
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,920
I see he's up and quiet listening.

1018
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
There you go, hey there Blaster.

1019
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
There he is.

1020
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,920
You have audio with you Blaster?

1021
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,920
Yes I do.

1022
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,920
Okay, very good.

1023
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,160
So, it's not great audio, so we won't talk too much.

1024
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,880
But it's okay, we're glad you're here Blaster.

1025
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,720
Blaster joined us as part of the crew at Ohio Linux Fest and he drove up in style.

1026
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
It was pretty, he was like a boss.

1027
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,720
What?

1028
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,720
What are you going to say?

1029
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,720
The Instagram picture of the crew.

1030
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
Oh, of the crew?

1031
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,720
Yeah, I should totally pull that up, huh?

1032
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,720
Yeah.

1033
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,720
Yeah, that was a great one.

1034
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,840
Yeah, Ange got a group selfie and you know what everybody noticed from that group selfie?

1035
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,840
What?

1036
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,840
Q5's Mohawk.

1037
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Yeah.

1038
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,840
Who couldn't notice that thing?

1039
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,660
That was awesome.

1040
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,360
Noah's of course Google Glass.

1041
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,360
Oh, and his boss.

1042
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,360
Yeah, his boss.

1043
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,360
Boss face.

1044
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,360
Right there.

1045
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:13,000
So, the crew got in throughout a couple of days, but Ange and I got there Friday and

1046
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,840
we immediately went out to the Tilted Skirt, which is, how would you describe the Tilted

1047
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,840
Skirt Ange?

1048
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,320
It is like...

1049
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,960
It's like Hooters but better.

1050
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:28,800
Well, it's the cute little plaid skirt with a matching, not bra.

1051
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,800
Bikini top.

1052
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,800
There you go.

1053
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,440
With the schoolgirl white, you know, Britney Spears.

1054
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,440
Short jacket.

1055
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,680
Yeah, short jacket that ties.

1056
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,680
Tied underneath the bikini.

1057
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,880
Yeah, underneath the bikini.

1058
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,680
But you were pleasantly surprised that also the male wore a similar attire.

1059
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,160
Yeah, the men wore, well, it didn't show as much skin, but yes, they did wear kilts.

1060
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,160
Yeah, yeah.

1061
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,160
So, we get into town and that's where we went.

1062
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,440
That was our first impression of Columbus, Ohio, was the Tilted Kilt.

1063
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,800
I'd never been to one before.

1064
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,800
Me either.

1065
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,800
And the food is actually pretty good.

1066
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,800
Yeah.

1067
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,800
It was a long time ago.

1068
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
No.

1069
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,800
No, they were pretty weak drinks.

1070
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,800
Which is weird.

1071
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,400
We're like, Ange and I, so this was in like six years, the first time we've gotten out

1072
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,120
on just her and I without the kids.

1073
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,120
It wasn't really a vacation.

1074
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,120
It was work, but...

1075
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,120
Let me put another caveat to that.

1076
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,120
Okay.

1077
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,680
I didn't find out that I even really liked alcohol until about three years ago after

1078
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,400
Abby was done breastfeeding.

1079
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,280
That's when I started drinking wine.

1080
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,680
Anyway, so yeah, so six years ago, I wasn't interested in alcohol anyway, but we haven't

1081
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,680
been out.

1082
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,160
So, that was night one.

1083
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,360
Night two was crazy.

1084
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:37,520
Night two, downtown Columbus went Halloween, and I believe all of the adults in the city

1085
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,520
were there.

1086
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
They dressed up.

1087
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,520
There was crazy costumes.

1088
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,600
They shut down streets.

1089
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,160
It ended up making us drive around in circles for a while.

1090
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,160
So that...

1091
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,160
Well, yeah.

1092
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,440
Well, some of that was Noah's fault, I guess.

1093
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,880
But no, no judging, Noah.

1094
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,880
No judging.

1095
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,880
It was all good.

1096
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,480
But it was a really good time.

1097
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,680
Noah, you go to these fests all the time.

1098
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,680
Let's start with you.

1099
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,880
What was your impressions of Ohio Linux Fest overall?

1100
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,760
Well, first of all, we'll start out with saying this.

1101
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,080
I am not shy about admitting that I am, in fact, directionally challenged.

1102
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,080
Who, you?

1103
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:13,440
Eric, you've never been in a car with me, how would you know?

1104
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,440
Have you?

1105
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,440
Yeah, I have.

1106
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
Oh, that's right.

1107
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
Back in Portland.

1108
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,440
OzCon.

1109
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,440
So, I judge every conference.

1110
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,040
I think the guy from the Ohio open source group said it best.

1111
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,720
I judge a conference, its quality, based on how many ThinkPads I see.

1112
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,720
Right.

1113
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:37,440
And I saw very few MacBooks, comparatively speaking, and a ton of ThinkPads, which made

1114
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,440
me really happy.

1115
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,840
And those ThinkPads are running Linux.

1116
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,640
Yeah, a lot of actual Linux users there, which was a nice change.

1117
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,640
You're right.

1118
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,760
And what do you think about the size, Noah?

1119
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,920
So I thought that the size was a little disappointing based on reports that I'd heard from other

1120
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,920
people.

1121
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,640
And it was funny, because all the people that said, oh well, Ohio is this great thing, and

1122
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,120
you have to go to it, and this, that, and the other, were people from Self, who had

1123
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,600
met at Self, who came to Ohio.

1124
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,000
But they're also at Self, in addition to a bunch of other cool people from Self.

1125
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Yeah.

1126
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,320
Yeah, well, in my experience, Linux Fest has anywhere between 40 and 60 or so booths, usually,

1127
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,320
right?

1128
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,000
And this place had like 15.

1129
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,680
But they focused more on talks.

1130
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,720
They had a fairly full talk schedule, at least for Saturday.

1131
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,840
I think Friday was a little sparingly.

1132
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,440
Saturday was pretty good, but Sunday was definitely, yeah.

1133
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,440
Saturday was good.

1134
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,440
Yeah, that's for sure.

1135
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,440
Sunday was spare.

1136
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,440
It was just mostly tests.

1137
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,440
Yeah.

1138
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,860
I concur with everything you guys are saying.

1139
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,760
It was smaller than I expected, based on sort of the feedback I'd gotten from the audience.

1140
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,760
Yep.

1141
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,320
However, a lot of people came because they knew we were there, which is really cool.

1142
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:55,960
That's my point, is to me, it sort of demonstrated a pretty fundamental lack of marketing on

1143
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,960
...

1144
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,960
Absolutely.

1145
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,960
Yeah.

1146
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,440
Because a lot... I would say 250, 300 people told me, I heard about it on Last.

1147
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,320
I didn't know about it until I heard about it on Last.

1148
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,040
Now, when you figure there might have been, I don't know, 600, 700, 800 people there, that

1149
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,560
is a ridiculous number of people that did not know about it before the show.

1150
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,000
And they need to market better.

1151
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yep.

1152
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yep.

1153
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah.

1154
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,560
Some of the people that had booths there saw enough Linux action show jackets, unfiltered

1155
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:31,060
Coder radio shirts, Last 300 shirts, that they know where they need to go now.

1156
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,320
We did have some bugs in our hotel room.

1157
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,320
Lady bugs.

1158
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,320
Yeah.

1159
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,320
Oh, wow.

1160
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,320
It was infested.

1161
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,320
They were our pets.

1162
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,320
It was not infested.

1163
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,320
Well, it was actually infested.

1164
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,320
It was, too.

1165
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,320
There was maybe a-

1166
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,320
Dude.

1167
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,360
Towards our last day, there was maybe a dozen in our room.

1168
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,360
In one area or throughout the entire room?

1169
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,920
Well, you know, kind of all over.

1170
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,480
They were mainly in the window area, but they're on our nightstand and on the mirror, the lamps,

1171
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,480
the ceiling.

1172
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,480
I didn't mind, though.

1173
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,480
I really didn't actually mind.

1174
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,480
Lady bugs, right?

1175
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,480
Oh, yeah.

1176
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,480
I'm with you.

1177
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,480
My wife's got a bad phobia.

1178
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,480
We wouldn't have done it.

1179
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,480
Chris kept trying.

1180
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,480
Chris's idea... You've seen a lampshade, right?

1181
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,480
There's four sides of a lampshade.

1182
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,760
The top and the bottom are open.

1183
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,120
Chris's idea to get rid of the lady bugs was to insert them into the top of the lampshade,

1184
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,200
and I don't know exactly what he thought was happening, but he kept getting continually

1185
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,680
shocked when they fell back out the bottom side, right back to where they were when he

1186
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,680
picked them up.

1187
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,160
I just want them to crawl around on the inside and then see their shadows through the lampshade.

1188
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,160
It didn't work.

1189
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,160
Well, it didn't work.

1190
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,840
They did it on their own from time to time.

1191
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,240
Angie was worried they'd lie in her mouth.

1192
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,240
That's what she was worried about.

1193
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,240
Yeah.

1194
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,720
Thankfully, I was so exhausted from being up at 4 a.m. on Friday, 5 a.m. on Saturday

1195
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,080
that I fell asleep so fast Saturday night.

1196
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,680
I didn't even have time.

1197
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:46,680
Getting back to more on the conference itself, the best thing I think I saw there, other

1198
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:52,120
than the two little 11-year-old kids that I think I got to switch to Linux, was Ruth's

1199
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,120
talk.

1200
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,120
Yes.

1201
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,680
Which I know, and that's coming up a little bit later in a different show or something,

1202
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,680
I'm sure.

1203
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,720
Well, do they want us posting a keynote talk like that?

1204
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,720
Yeah.

1205
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,720
They recorded them themselves.

1206
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,720
Okay.

1207
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,720
All right.

1208
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,720
Do we have a different audio source for that one?

1209
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,720
No, unfortunately.

1210
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,720
Okay.

1211
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,720
All right.

1212
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,720
Sorry.

1213
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,720
Okay.

1214
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,720
We're going to skip across the room, right?

1215
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,720
Yeah.

1216
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,720
I watched it though.

1217
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,720
Ruth gave an incredible talk.

1218
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,720
It was really good.

1219
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,960
Well, and so one of the things that she hit on was that as a community, we go to all these

1220
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:25,640
different conferences like OSCON and LinuxCon, and you can't find an example of somebody

1221
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,000
using Linux or open source.

1222
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,240
Like she actually said in her presentation, I will walk up to a booth and ask, is there

1223
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,480
anything open about your project that you say is open source and is at an open source

1224
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,480
conference?

1225
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,480
And she's a person that actually runs Linux on her laptop, on her desktop.

1226
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,000
She works for a Linux organization, but she believes in the concept of open source.

1227
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,400
It's not just she believes in making money off of open source.

1228
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,480
Right.

1229
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,000
And Ruth, she works at Red Hat and she's part of the PyDora project.

1230
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,960
And she went up there and I thought she gave some...

1231
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,000
You know what I liked about Ruth's talk, and I think this is something that made it really

1232
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,040
connect with me.

1233
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,400
And so I don't know when we're going to play it because it's long.

1234
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,280
It's about 30 minutes, but we will try to play it soon.

1235
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,080
And she talks about, she draws parallels to history.

1236
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,760
And that to me was the most powerful thing is she can kind of demonstrate in some ways

1237
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,600
we've been here before and we have fought these battles.

1238
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,000
They were named different things and they were about different things, but the moral

1239
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,280
of the stories remain the same as they are today.

1240
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,480
And that to me was sort of the most powerful thing about what she did, because when you

1241
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,480
look at these historical things and you see how they resolve, it's so obvious with 2020

1242
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,480
hindsight.

1243
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,680
And so you can apply that same mindset to the problems we're dealing with today.

1244
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,080
And you can see she just nailed it so many times.

1245
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,720
So that was really good.

1246
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,640
And the other thing about Ruth is she was extremely dynamic.

1247
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,040
She had a moment where she had to look something up on her computer, so she engaged the audience

1248
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:57,760
and got them to sort of vamp for her while she was filling time.

1249
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,880
And she just was so good at handling questions.

1250
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,280
She would just ask her a random question about patents and she just had a great answer for

1251
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,280
that, I thought.

1252
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,480
And I was super impressed by that.

1253
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,940
And that was really, I thought, where Ohio Linux Fest shined.

1254
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:16,440
And they also had Ken Starks do a closing talk, which was really interesting as well.

1255
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:23,120
Blaster, did you have anything that you wanted to particularly talk about?

1256
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,120
I don't know.

1257
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:31,560
The streets closing down was kind of annoying, but especially when the only way to get into

1258
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:36,480
your hotel, into the valet parking, is to drive the wrong way on a one-way because they

1259
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,600
close down the only other street you can use to get to your hotel.

1260
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,640
But that also kind of makes you feel like a ninja.

1261
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,640
How about the Fest?

1262
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:50,560
I didn't really experience too much of it.

1263
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,880
Walking around was a little bit, I mean, once you walk four blocks to get directly across

1264
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,840
the street, it's a little bit of a pain to walk everywhere else.

1265
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,920
But no, the booths were cool.

1266
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,600
I checked out most of them.

1267
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:07,400
The swag was nice, especially those little nerve guns.

1268
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,960
And it seemed like everybody was pretty friendly and low-key.

1269
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,960
That was great.

1270
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,960
Oh yeah, everybody was definitely friendly.

1271
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,760
Because there's those conferences that feel a little stressful, a little high-strung like

1272
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:22,840
OSCON versus something like Linux Fest or Ohio Linux Fest that felt a little more relaxed.

1273
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:28,800
One thing that I did notice about a difference between Linux Fest and this Fest is that this

1274
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:35,320
one felt like more people were driving just a couple hours to stop by, see it, and leave.

1275
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,080
Whereas with Linux Fest, people flying in, they're staying in a hotel.

1276
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:44,320
So while there's that, you'd think if you're staying in a hotel by Linux Fest Northwest,

1277
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,080
you'd be casual and not rushed and stressed or whatever.

1278
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:51,560
But I felt like there was less, people were more casual.

1279
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,720
Because they were on their own time, they were on their own schedule or something.

1280
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,480
Yeah, it was really, really interesting.

1281
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,280
But there were a lot of people nearby that just drove anywhere between two and eight

1282
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,280
hours.

1283
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,280
Yeah.

1284
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,920
And it was always a good sign.

1285
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,600
Like you get in there and they're using Linux there at the Fest organizers themselves.

1286
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,960
You check in at a Linux box.

1287
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,440
All of that's always a good sign too for a conference.

1288
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,800
So it was all in all a great trip.

1289
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,880
It was a little smaller than I expected, but once I adjusted that, I appreciated the fact

1290
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,000
that it gave us the time to connect with people.

1291
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,720
I met a lot of people.

1292
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,920
It was really, really neat to meet that many people.

1293
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,020
And I want to do it more often.

1294
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:32,680
So we're already talking about the next conferences we're going to go to, obviously Linux Fest

1295
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,680
Northwest.

1296
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,680
You can put that in your calendar.

1297
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,680
Yep.

1298
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,680
We're talking very seriously about scale.

1299
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,680
I think we want to do that.

1300
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,680
Yep.

1301
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,680
Self.

1302
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,680
Chase might even want to join us for scale.

1303
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,680
Self.

1304
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,040
Self sounds like it's a must do as well.

1305
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,040
More and more events.

1306
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,200
So we're going to just try to get our shows covering more and more of this stuff for those

1307
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,400
of you who can't make it.

1308
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:55,720
I think what I've discovered in these trips is that this aspect is more important than

1309
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,400
I think I've appreciated for an open source community.

1310
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,440
Actually connecting with people, talking about these problems, seeing how people are using

1311
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,240
technology and the amazing, interesting things people are doing.

1312
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,560
I saw a project that was actually running on a Sega Genesis that somebody is making

1313
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,120
software today for a Sega Genesis and running their own custom stuff.

1314
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:19,960
And they're using open source tools to do things that I never even thought people would

1315
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,400
ever have a desire to do.

1316
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,760
And then you see it and you realize why sometimes we have such strange and esoteric things.

1317
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,880
And it was really fun to kind of see practical implementations and uses of Linux, open source,

1318
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,880
talk to people.

1319
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,220
I talked to some sys admins about the things they're struggling with.

1320
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,760
We shared some war stories.

1321
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,760
All of that.

1322
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,480
Just that level of connecting when the community itself is inherently a collaboration community

1323
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,480
I think is super important.

1324
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,320
So I want to attend more of them.

1325
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,160
So I think we're going to do that.

1326
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,200
Any other closing thoughts you guys on Ohio?

1327
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,200
No?

1328
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,720
Were there any biohazard suits?

1329
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,720
Only for Halloween.

1330
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,720
What?

1331
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,720
No?

1332
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,720
Biohazard suits?

1333
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,720
Oh, no.

1334
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,720
We did see...

1335
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,720
No, but you know what?

1336
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,720
Funny story.

1337
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:07,000
When we did have to run to our connecting flight, we both, because we had so much adrenaline

1338
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,920
and we had just gotten off a flight so our legs weren't working super well.

1339
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,920
And we had our bags.

1340
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,200
Yeah, we had our bags.

1341
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,640
We were coughing like crazy once we got on the plane.

1342
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,640
For about an hour.

1343
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,640
Yeah, so...

1344
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,240
And I immediately, in the second cough, I'm like, oh God, I bet the guy next to me thinks

1345
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,080
that I'm contagious or something.

1346
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,320
And so I'm like, look, I'm not sick.

1347
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:32,740
We just had to run and it's causing an asthmatic adrenaline reaction.

1348
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,160
So it'll stop soon, hopefully.

1349
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,160
Yeah.

1350
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,160
It was nuts.

1351
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,120
And then I was glad we had a couple hours to rest on a plane.

1352
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,120
Yeah.

1353
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,120
Four and a half.

1354
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,120
Yeah.

1355
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,120
Yeah, that is true.

1356
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,120
Yeah.

1357
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,600
I'd say if you've considered it, go and if you can make it a business expense, even better.

1358
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,600
Or get your work to pay for it.

1359
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,600
Yeah.

1360
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,600
Exactly.

1361
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,600
There's a lot of people that have done that.

1362
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,600
Yep.

1363
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,600
Especially at OSCON, but even a few here at Ohio.

1364
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,600
Yep.

1365
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,600
And it was neat to see Columbus.

1366
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,600
I don't know what...

1367
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,560
I still don't know what dot in the I in Ohio is, but...

1368
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,560
Faux-Hio.

1369
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,560
Faux-Hio it is.

1370
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,560
And we might have some more.

1371
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,560
Do you think we'll have a little more in the Faux show?

1372
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,560
Speaking of Faux?

1373
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,600
Yeah, because we're doing Jacket Awards on the 2nd, which is this Sunday.

1374
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,880
And yeah, for a second there, I thought I was on last.

1375
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,280
The Linux Action Show Jackets pictures in the Faux show following Linux Action Show

1376
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,280
on Sunday.

1377
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,280
Mm-hmm.

1378
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,240
And we'll show some more pictures and stuff like that from our trip.

1379
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,400
I've got some pictures that aren't on the Instagram feed we could show.

1380
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
Me too.

1381
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,400
Just a couple, but yeah.

1382
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Yeah.

1383
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
So we'll do some more stuff in there too.

1384
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,360
So we'll have a little itsy bitsy more Ohio stuff just from the community aspect in the

1385
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,240
Faux show this Sunday, which will immediately follow the Linux Action Show on the live stream.

1386
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,760
So tune in for that if you want any more goodies.

1387
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,800
I think that's everything we have for today.

1388
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,520
I'm going through our list right now to make sure, but check out the show notes for more

1389
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:47,000
clips from Seagull, including some of the talks, some of the videos of the keynotes,

1390
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,320
and we have two more things in the kitty that I really want to get from Ohio.

1391
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,160
One is Ruth's talk that Noah and I were talking about, and the other is an interview that

1392
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:01,120
Noah did with Ken Moore, who's creating the Lumina desktop for PCBSD.

1393
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:06,540
It's a brand new desktop, and I think we'll probably fit that into this Sunday's Linux

1394
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:09,680
Action Show to get a little tour of the Lumina desktop.

1395
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,520
So we'll have the OpenSUSE review this Sunday, and then I think maybe we'll put at the end

1396
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:19,480
of the show or something like that the walkthrough of the Lumina desktop, which I believe producer

1397
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,080
Q5SIS is currently trying to get to work on Puppy Linux.

1398
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,080
Just a little teaser.

1399
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:28,720
I got to see Ken play around with it a little bit, and he showed me some stuff, and it looks

1400
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,720
really nice.

1401
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,720
Yes.

1402
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,720
Yeah.

1403
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,720
It's very cool.

1404
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,320
And the integration of them ZFS features is super sweet.

1405
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,640
It's going to make us Linux users totally jelly, so be prepared for that.

1406
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,640
All right.

1407
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,160
Well, that'll bring us to the end of today's episode, and we're going to get out of here.

Don't forget to check this week's Fo' Show out for even more coverage, and tune in on

1412
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:03,640
Sunday for the big show for our review of OpenSUSE, and come back next Tuesday for a

1413
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,180
brand new edition of Linux Unplugged.

1414
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:09,560
We do this show at 2 p.m. Pacific, and go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

1415
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,760
to have our robots convert that for you.

1416
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,920
It's the only thing we allow them to do, so please give them a purpose.

1417
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,960
Visit jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar, because every millisecond that goes by is

1418
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,680
an eternity to them, so don't torture them any longer.

1419
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,680
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1420
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,520
All right, Matt, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1421
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,520
Sounds good.

1422
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,520
See you then.

1423
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,520
All right, everyone.

1424
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,960
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1425
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,040
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1426
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:22,120
Chris, you guys should come over to Europe.

1427
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,120
I know.

1428
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,120
I know.

1429
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,120
Boy, yeah.

1430
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,120
You've got to convince the boss here, Poppy.

1431
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,760
I think that might be a milestone.

1432
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:34,800
The biggest European conference is FOSDEM, probably, which is the beginning of February

1433
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,800
next year.

1434
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,800
That's way too soon.

1435
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,800
Okay.

1436
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,800
Darn it.

1437
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,800
I know.

1438
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:45,880
Plus, we have scale and Linux Fest, and- Yeah, we do not have the funds for Europe

1439
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:46,880
that soon.

1440
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,880
Shoot.

1441
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,880
God, I want to.

1442
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,320
I want to so bad, though.

1443
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,320
What is the...

1444
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,320
Can you...

1445
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,320
What is the name of the Fest again?

1446
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,320
Can you type it in the chat?

1447
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,320
FOSDEM.

1448
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,320
F-O-S-D-E-M.

1449
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,320
FOSDEM.

1450
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,320
Oh, okay.

1451
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,320
The biggest.

1452
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,320
The biggest.

1453
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,320
Brussels.

1454
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,320
jb titles.com.

1455
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,320
We're going years and years and years.

1456
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,200
It's a university in Brussels.

1457
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,700
It's a fantastic place.

1458
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:08,700
jb titles.com.

1459
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:09,700
jb titles.com.

1460
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:10,700
So, Angela, I got a question for you.

1461
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:11,700
Yeah.

1462
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,560
I didn't want to bring this up on air, but...

1463
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,560
You are right now.

1464
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,560
You know that, right?

1465
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,560
Well, now the show's over.

1466
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,520
Now you can go cut this stuff out and it won't be weird, right?

1467
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,520
Oh, sure.

1468
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,520
Okay.

1469
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,520
So here's my question.

1470
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:29,700
You said you'd feel uncomfortable leading a group of men in some sort of a technology

1471
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,700
class or something like that, right?

1472
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,700
No, not leading.

1473
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,700
Okay, teaching.

1474
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,700
Holding back.

1475
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,700
Holding back is what she said.

1476
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,700
Yeah, holding...

1477
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,340
Like, yeah, I feel like I...

1478
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,340
They would be ahead of you?

1479
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:43,060
Yeah, that I'm coming in, yeah, without as much knowledge or...

1480
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,060
Oh, okay.

1481
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:49,420
And so I feel better about holding back a group of women because they probably, I don't

1482
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:50,420
know.

1483
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,420
Yeah, I know it's...

1484
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,800
That's what I was getting at, that's what I was getting at.

1485
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,960
So right there, don't you think that that is part of the problem?

1486
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,960
I mean, like...

1487
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,960
No.

1488
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,960
Okay, well, but then how can you say...

1489
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,960
Here's what you're saying.

1490
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:08,120
You're saying that we need a women's group because women are being pushed aside by men

1491
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:12,240
from technology, but at the same time, then you say, well, I wouldn't feel bad holding

1492
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,680
back women because I think that they're less technically inclined.

1493
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,680
No.

1494
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,680
No, no, no, no.

1495
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,680
That's not what she said.

1496
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,680
No.

1497
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,680
You're extrapolating.

1498
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,480
I feel like the environment...

1499
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:30,000
I think that women learn technology at a different pace than men.

1500
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,280
Possibly.

1501
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:36,360
I think, too, there's a difference is that those organizations recognize that a lot of

1502
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,340
women are coming from a beginner position more so than some of the people that are going

1503
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,640
into the more standard educational courses.

1504
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,480
So standard education is geared for people that are further along in the process where

1505
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,040
a lot of women now are going, you know what, this is something I'm interested in, but I'm

1506
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:53,840
starting at more of a square zero, and these organizations are more geared to handle that.

1507
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,720
I understand what you're saying, though, Noah.

1508
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:02,400
It is a hard position to be in to advocate for one thing, and at the same time, you're

1509
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,400
kind of supporting...

1510
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:08,360
Admitting or not admitting, but yeah, sort of like condoning a line of thought.

1511
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:14,720
If you're the only woman in the class, it's quite possible that the men in the room will

1512
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:19,540
be patronizing and condescending towards you if you don't keep up with them, whereas it's

1513
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:24,200
almost certainly the case that if you're in a room full of women, that won't happen.

1514
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,080
I guess my question, Popeye, is why do you assume that she wouldn't be able to keep up

1515
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,080
with them?

1516
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,080
I didn't.

1517
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,080
She did.

1518
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,080
Yeah.

1519
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,080
Okay.

1520
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,080
Okay.

1521
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,080
That's fair, I guess.

1522
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,080
I guess it would be situational, I suppose.

1523
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,080
Yeah.

1524
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:42,480
So the thing is, you know, I know there are ways to advance in classes based on some tests

1525
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:47,360
or like talking to an instructor, but a lot of the guys, I think, that are going into

1526
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:52,280
beginning technology classes have a lot of the knowledge, and I don't.

1527
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,280
Yeah.

1528
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:59,680
You know, maybe in advanced courses or specialized courses, that would be a different story,

1529
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,680
you know?

1530
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:04,520
That can be more mainstream, like once it's a specialty, but yeah.

1531
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,560
All right.

1532
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,240
So Ohio Linux Fest and Segal Roundup are currently...

1533
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,400
That's really long, though.

1534
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,400
When is DST?

1535
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,400
I think it's this Sunday, right?

1536
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,400
Yeah.

1537
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,400
Don't we switch over to this Sunday?

1538
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,400
We fall back?

1539
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,400
That's correct.

1540
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,400
On the 2nd, yes.

1541
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,400
On the 2nd.

1542
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,400
So it always screws with LAS.

1543
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,400
That's my wife's birthday.

1544
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,400
It always...

1545
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,400
So Matt, prepare your brain for that.

1546
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,400
All right.

1547
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,400
Because that always...

1548
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,400
You know, LAS always takes that one because it always happens on the Sunday.

1549
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,400
So I'm going to warn you guys now.

1550
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:32,400
Sunday is my wife's birthday, and she has requested a tech-free day, so I will be incommunicado.

1551
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,400
Aw, the tech-free day.

1552
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,400
Yeah.

1553
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,400
Well, just do what I do when I tell...

1554
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
Oh, never mind.

1555
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,400
Okay.

1556
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,400
Go to the Jupiter Broadcasting Instagram.

1557
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,400
All right.

1558
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,400
JupiterBroadcasting.com, everybody.

1559
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,680
But we got some new late-minute titles coming in while I go look at the Instagram feed here.

1560
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:49,840
You need one of those no phones.

1561
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
Oh, yeah.

1562
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,880
We got some.

1563
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:59,240
So there is our children in a wheelbarrow with my hair, and I think belly looks the

1564
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,240
best.

1565
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,720
I think little belly looks the best there in the middle.

1566
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,720
Oh, my God.

1567
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,720
That's cute.

1568
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,720
That's great.

1569
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,720
There you go.

1570
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,720
They're daddy's hair.

1571
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,720
Although I think you could have got a better hair still, but that's fine.

1572
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,720
The hair doesn't like it.

1573
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,720
It's fine.

1574
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,720
That is awesome.

1575
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,720
That is actually really good.

1576
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,720
Yeah.

1577
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,720
Yeah.

1578
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:17,720
Okay.

1579
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,720
So let's see where the boats.

1580
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,720
Got some last-minute suggests.

1581
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,720
SeaGulf.

1582
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,720
SeaGulf 2014.

1583
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,720
Linux Equality.

1584
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,720
Angela goes open source.

1585
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,720
Guys.

1586
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,720
Ohio Linux and Seagull Coverage.

1587
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,720
Digital Ocean That Makes Sense.

1588
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,720
I like that one.

1589
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,720
Ohio Faux.

1590
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,720
Failed.

1591
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,720
AdrenalGland equals no energy.

1592
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,720
Thank you, Eric.

1593
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,720
You get it still.

1594
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,720
Thank you.

1595
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,720
Yes, I do.

1596
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,720
I took basic health in high school.

1597
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,720
I know.

1598
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,720
I shouldn't have opened the show with a health joke.

1599
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,720
I shouldn't have opened the show with a health joke.

1600
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,720
I just got this look from Angela like, what the hell are you doing?

1601
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,720
Yeah, it was.

1602
01:08:48,720 --> 01:09:10,720
Yeah, it was.
