1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,520
You know, well, hmm, okay.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,160
You sound unsure, Chris.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,480
Don't tell those jerks over at the Linux Action Show,

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,200
but I think I'm gonna steal one of their Runs Linux.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,480
Let's spot the Runs Linux.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,300
Are you ready, Runs?

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,840
Unset in D minus five minutes.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,640
To do something as ambitious as making a car drive itself,

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,040
you need lots of testing and lots of places

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,700
so that you can cover all the scenarios

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,440
you might ever expect to see.

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,800
All right, so a couple of interesting things about this.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,400
You notice there's not a whole bunch of cameras

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,320
hanging off this car here.

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,280
And, you know, one of the things I have honestly wondered,

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,940
and I know they use LiDAR to some extent,

17
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,040
but how well do the Google self-driving cars

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,440
work in the dark with no lights?

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,480
I've wondered about that.

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,960
And, you know, so far, all of these self-driving cars

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,240
seem to run Linux, but I bet we spot some in this one.

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,800
It's my kind of bet.

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,840
NVG check.

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,320
So they're putting on helmets with cameras.

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,160
Fusion Niner One Two, prepare to go dark.

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,280
They're covering the steering dash column stuff with a...

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,040
Fusion Niner One Two, are all personnel in place?

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,880
Some sort of blackout.

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,200
This is Gold Leader, I'm in position.

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,280
Okay, you ready, Wes?

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,200
Fusion Niner One Two, could we get a systems check, please?

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,040
These guys.

33
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,880
LiDAR is go.

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,700
LiDAR is go.

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,000
IMU is go.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,960
Radar is go.

37
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,800
Camera is go.

38
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,480
All systems are functioning.

39
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,800
We are ready to go at once.

40
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,320
Oh, look at that.

41
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,160
Wow, wow, we are getting a lot of stuff here.

42
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,800
So they're using the system sentry log message interface.

43
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,360
Don't reckon that's probably something to them.

44
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,680
But over here, I'm noticing Wireshark over here.

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,480
MBV player, there's Java, there's hardware info,

46
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,160
VLC, screen capture program.

47
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,640
They have a update manager running in the background.

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,000
Wow, look at all that stuff on that Linux box.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,080
They're just like you, they do updates

50
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
right before they have to do something.

51
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,280
Yeah, they totally are, aren't they?

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,680
All right, guys, we're gonna go.

53
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,500
Now watch this.

54
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,120
We are autonomous.

55
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,800
They're using a camera that captures the LiDAR lasers.

56
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,640
That's awesome.

57
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,000
Or whatever, I guess it's not lasers or whatever.

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,180
It's whatever, oh no, I guess it would be.

59
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,600
But look at that, look how it blankets the area,

60
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,880
surveying the ground as they say.

61
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,000
It's an odd feeling to be looking at the viewer

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,360
and seeing exactly what I expected.

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,840
But as soon as I looked out the window,

64
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,760
all I saw was blackness.

65
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,520
Through the S's again, everything is stable.

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,640
That was Linux again there.

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,240
It's breaking into the hairpin.

68
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,600
And accelerating out of the corner.

69
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,040
Pull back in here, complete the mission,

70
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
and then we'll restart again just to do it on the full lap.

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
It's going good.

72
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,720
Car is functioning just as it should.

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,600
Car is driving by itself in the middle of the night.

74
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,360
You know, I have yet to see one of these

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,940
that isn't powered by Linux.

76
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,960
And isn't that something, Wes?

77
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,800
Yeah, that is something.

78
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,280
Because this is going to be a huge deal.

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,240
This is going to change our culture forever.

80
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,400
This is how they should have made the, what is it, Kinect.

81
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,180
Because Kinect shows a bunch of dots in infrared

82
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,720
and maps the depth perception throughout the room.

83
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,760
This is doing it in a 3D area.

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,040
This is how Kinect should have been.

85
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,000
And they're using Linux end to end.

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,680
They're using Linux in the computer in the car.

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,680
They're using Linux for the reviewing of the data.

88
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,320
And then when they were playing back the 3D map

89
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,440
of the thing driving, they're using Linux.

90
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,240
End to end, using Linux to create something

91
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,960
that's going to fundamentally change the world.

92
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,800
And probably kill the podcasting audience

93
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,840
because people won't be sitting in traffic anymore.

94
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,920
Dang it.

95
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,920
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 140 for April 12th, 2016.

96
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:51,740
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

97
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,140
that didn't force Wes to reload his laptop this week.

98
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,060
My name is Chris.

99
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,900
My name is Wes.

100
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,740
Hey there, Wes.

101
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,620
I think this is like the first week in like five episodes.

102
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,540
I think so.

103
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,420
I'm still running apricity.

104
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,460
How's it going over there?

105
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,280
Not bad.

106
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
Nice.

107
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,900
It's like you get to just enjoy it for a little while.

108
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,340
Maybe install some things I forget from the episode.

109
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,860
I bet we'll break it next week.

110
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,500
There's going to be something we'll have to try out.

111
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,180
But this week we have a huge show.

112
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,420
We have so much stuff to get into.

113
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,620
We have an interesting follow up from something

114
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,180
that happened about 106 weeks ago in Unplugged history.

115
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,660
We'll get to that coming up a little bit in the show.

116
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,580
I went and installed myself a tracker

117
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,940
so I could track myself as I move about the world.

118
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,100
Not on Google, in my own cloud.

119
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,340
Something I wanted to use for Lady Joops

120
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,780
as we take the rover over to pick up Mr. Ham radio.

121
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,100
So I installed the open source track car server.

122
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,980
And I'll give you my experiences with setting up

123
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,340
a tracker that uses your smartphone for yourself

124
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,740
or whatever you need.

125
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,540
For me, it's so you guys can follow me

126
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,180
because why not be creepy.

127
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,460
Also, we have some really big updates

128
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,980
for some pretty important projects

129
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,540
that we've been following.

130
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,300
Some interesting Scuttlebutt and news,

131
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,980
as well as a quick Linux Fest Northwest update

132
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,820
coming up towards the end of the show.

133
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,540
It is a bunch of stuff to get into, Wes.

134
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,580
So we should probably start with my favorite thing.

135
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,080
One of my, I think, one of my favorite beers

136
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,900
probably in the last couple of weeks, maybe.

137
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,460
Yeah, I mean you've been bringing

138
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,580
some really good local brews.

139
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,480
Another brewed in Seattle beer.

140
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,860
Now this one stands out because it's gluten-free.

141
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,980
That's right, no gluten here.

142
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,140
Which you didn't even realize.

143
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,820
And also, on the bottle they want you

144
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,860
to transcend your limits.

145
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,700
That stands out.

146
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,540
Do you do that every week here?

147
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,500
Yeah, we do, we do.

148
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,500
So it's Ghost Fish Brewing Company we're drinking this week

149
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,900
and maybe some of you in our virtual log will be as well.

150
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,540
And how do you suppose, I was gonna say,

151
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,380
how do you suppose, Wes,

152
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,300
but I was gonna say, watchstander.

153
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,740
I believe so, watchstander stout.

154
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,080
Yeah, I like that, the watchstander stout.

155
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,620
We got a pint here, we'll be drinking on the show.

156
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,380
An additional six fluid ounces after that one pint,

157
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,220
six fluid ounces.

158
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,300
Oh, you're right, I didn't even see that.

159
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,340
I had my thumb right there.

160
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,180
So thanks, Wes, these are some nice brewskis.

161
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,020
I'm glad you enjoy it.

162
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,840
We'll be enjoying them.

163
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,820
So let's get into some of the updates for the week.

164
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,460
Let's bring in our virtual log first.

165
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,720
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

166
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,180
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

167
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,280
It is good to see all of you, or at least, well, hear you.

168
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,320
One of the stories that people seem to be kind of jacked up

169
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,180
about today is, well, it's a Valve story.

170
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,380
We're gonna do a little Valve update right here

171
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,780
at the top of the show.

172
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,740
An open source driver, an open source contender has emerged,

173
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,300
at least early development has, for the Steam Controller.

174
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,580
You might not have realized this,

175
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,300
but to get the actual full Steam Controller driver

176
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,220
on your rig, on your Linux rig,

177
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,700
you had to have Steam installed.

178
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,420
You had to have, you had to have all the Steam installed.

179
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,260
Yeah, and so-

180
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,700
It's not very Linux-y.

181
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,700
The final purpose is to have a custom mapping ability

182
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,780
created for this controller, also some others.

183
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,580
The initial target is for GNU slash Linux,

184
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,420
but there are welcoming contributors to port it to.

185
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,340
Ox, what is this, Ox 10?

186
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,260
No, Os 10, Windows, BSD, or even perhaps Android.

187
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,300
Whoa.

188
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Android, I think, would be really awesome to have.

189
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,840
Yeah. Yeah.

190
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,060
So there you go.

191
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,000
You have to check it out.

192
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,860
It's on GitHub right now if you want it,

193
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,180
but it will mess up your current driver if you do load it.

194
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,020
What do you think, Wes?

195
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,860
Is this important?

196
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,100
Rodden Corp seems to think so.

197
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,900
Why do you, what do you think?

198
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,980
Yeah, I mean, it seems like good hardware.

199
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,380
We already enjoy good support for things

200
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,960
like the Xbox 360 controller.

201
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,900
I'm sure people want to use this with weird niche games

202
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,620
or games that really have no place on Steam

203
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,580
or don't support Steam,

204
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,340
or for gamers that just don't want to have anything

205
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,260
to do with Steam, but enjoy the hardware.

206
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,880
Yeah, I could definitely see it also as a pretty cool,

207
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,580
a pretty cool, like, just as an example,

208
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,660
something we were talking about before the show,

209
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,420
is if you just had a standard open source driver,

210
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,460
then maybe you could integrate it

211
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,220
with other kinds of open source projects,

212
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,060
and all of a sudden you could have

213
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,700
a really cool controller for those.

214
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,740
Who knows what those could be?

215
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,820
Maybe it could be something to brew beer.

216
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,640
Speaking of the Valve,

217
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,640
we talked about this itch app store on Linux Action Show.

218
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,520
That's right.

219
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,640
Yeah, it's already been pulled.

220
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,480
They pulled it. Of course.

221
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,320
So quick update on that.

222
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Yeah, Valve has pulled the itch or itch.io desktop app.

223
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,760
It was in violation of their terms and service.

224
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,480
So there's a quick one there,

225
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,840
and they were clear about what categories they do allow in,

226
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,520
and your own frickin' app store is not one of them.

227
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,080
So sorry, guys, sorry about that.

228
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,320
Now, that was sort of just a real quick update.

229
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,580
That ends our Valve section of the show.

230
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,400
And now it brings our Richard Stallman section of the show.

231
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,560
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

232
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,320
Into the focus. Your favorite.

233
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,840
Yeah, it is.

234
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,760
So Richard Stallman has spoken out about

235
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,740
Popey's attempt to get ZFS working on Linux.

236
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,400
And now, as we all know,

237
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,760
Popey is personally involved in getting ZFS

238
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,600
to run on Ubuntu 16.04,

239
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,320
and is personally responsible for the legal fights

240
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
that will be, I mean, we all know this.

241
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
It's obvious.

242
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,000
He's the one loading the kernel engine.

243
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,020
He might downplay it.

244
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,720
But remember, if he tries to downplay it, Wes,

245
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,840
his denial is actually a confirmation.

246
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,240
Absolutely.

247
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,040
On advice of counsel, I decline to answer.

248
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,120
Very well.

249
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,340
So Richard Stallman has spoken out about ZFS,

250
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,560
as Mr. Jude would say, shipping on Ubuntu.

251
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,400
And he said,

252
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,960
the code under GPL incompatible licenses cannot be added,

253
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,760
neither in source nor binary form,

254
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,380
without violating the GPL.

255
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,120
If you distribute modules meant to be linked together

256
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,480
by the user, you have made them into a combined work,

257
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,440
and you must release the entire combined work

258
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,840
under the GNU GPL.

259
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,040
He says it's therefore impossible to release ZFS

260
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,900
alongside the GNU GPL license code,

261
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,100
because ZFS is licensed under the CCDL version one.

262
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,500
And Richard Stallman points out,

263
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,600
and the value of this is negative,

264
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,800
that Oracle could just simply relicense ZFS

265
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,400
under the GPL and solve everybody's problem.

266
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,100
It would make it possible to combine that version

267
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,440
with Linux without violating the license of Linux.

268
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,880
This would be the ideal resolution,

269
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,020
and we urge the copyright holders of ZFS to do this,

270
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,860
is what he said.

271
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,920
That ain't gonna happen ever.

272
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,840
No, no.

273
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,040
No, have you noticed that both the Software Conservancy

274
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,160
and now the Free Software Foundation

275
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,100
are taking this tact of, well, it's not Canonical's fault,

276
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,560
and it's not the GPL's fault,

277
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,240
it's Oracle's fault.

278
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,280
To me, that seems, and I'll ask you, Wimpy,

279
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,800
what you think of that, but that seems ridiculous,

280
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,400
because what you're doing is, hey,

281
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,060
that thing that you made and you own,

282
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,400
I want it so bad that I think you should change it to this.

283
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,680
That seems like a childish argument.

284
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,200
And Oracle didn't make it either.

285
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,320
They acquired it from Sun Microsystems,

286
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,380
and they acquired the license it was under.

287
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,600
So, you know, I'm no fan of Oracle,

288
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,840
quite the opposite in fact,

289
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,600
but they are not at all motivated to change the licensing

290
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,920
of ZFS, unless of course they want to start shipping it

291
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,640
in their, do they call it unbreakable Linux or something?

292
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,580
So the only time the license will change

293
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,160
is if Oracle decide they want to ship it in their own.

294
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,080
And haven't they, no, there was components of D-Trace

295
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,760
that they've shipped in unbreakable.

296
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,080
Oh, okay. Yeah.

297
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,040
Which has sort of put some of this in question,

298
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,320
and it'd be interesting to take that

299
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,580
as a trial balloon and see what happens.

300
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,320
But yeah, to me-

301
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,760
If Oracle relicense it, it will be under some license

302
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,280
that suits them and no one else.

303
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,120
Exactly.

304
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,040
Well, and they're not gonna do something

305
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,560
I wouldn't think, I mean, maybe I'm wrong on this,

306
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,600
but if they relicense ZFS to GPL,

307
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,760
wouldn't that screw over the BSDs?

308
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,920
Well, no, because they can fork it

309
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,680
from the last CDL-licensed version, can't they?

310
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,440
Not ideal though, is it?

311
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,360
Well, no, not ideal.

312
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,560
So they're not gonna do that.

313
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,880
They're not gonna do that.

314
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,280
Well, Oracle will do whatever they see fit

315
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,400
without any regard for the BSD or the Linux community.

316
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,240
Yeah.

317
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,620
OS writer says that this is actually

318
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,220
just a passive aggressive threat against canonical.

319
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,140
I wonder if that's, I wonder if that's true.

320
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,860
You know, they also, Mr. Mogen, even Eben,

321
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,860
just wrote a really long piece on understanding

322
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,520
the Linux Foundation's role in arbitrating these issues,

323
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,600
basically saying it's not their role to do these.

324
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,320
They did a good job of explaining their tax structure.

325
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,880
Right, yeah, exactly.

326
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,120
Yeah, and when I read that, to me it said

327
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,280
that they're gonna make their own decision

328
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,520
and take some sort of action.

329
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,760
These two things are not being talked about

330
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,420
in isolation, right?

331
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,480
Eben is making this blog post.

332
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,720
At the same time, Richard Stallman

333
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,960
is making these statements,

334
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,360
and within a short time after the software conservancy

335
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,760
has made their statements,

336
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,920
all of which are sort of like limp-handedly,

337
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,240
sort of passively aggressively

338
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,360
throwing some dirt on canonical,

339
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,500
but most of them are trying to say,

340
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,460
but it's really Oracle that's really the bad guy

341
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,580
because everybody loves to hate Oracle, I think.

342
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,760
But in this case, I mean, I'm no Oracle fan,

343
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,760
but in this case, they now are the rightful owners of ZFS,

344
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,780
and it seems strange to me that we have the nuts

345
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,040
to just come up and say, well, we want it so much

346
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,640
that you should have to do this thing,

347
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
and that's the good guy thing to do.

348
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,700
Well, no, it's not good or bad.

349
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,800
It's their code.

350
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,000
Right, they do have the right to do what that exactly is.

351
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,960
Yeah, and you know what?

352
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,160
They have chosen not to license it that way,

353
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,580
and so we've made the clown shoe file system butter FS,

354
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,760
which is, you know.

355
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,000
At least it sounds like butter.

356
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,840
It pales in comparison.

357
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,200
Well, actually, they made it, oddly enough.

358
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,040
Yeah, that's true, actually.

359
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,880
True, very good point.

360
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,320
Thank you, that is true, but yeah.

361
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
But they got the license.

362
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,160
Yeah.

363
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,320
But as soon as they got ZFS, they dumped it, basically.

364
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,280
Yeah, and now the community maintains a lot,

365
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,960
and there's developers from a lot of large companies

366
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,480
that now contribute code to it,

367
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,360
which we've talked about before.

368
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
Kitson, you wanted to make a point, though.

369
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,040
Realizer's point's good, too,

370
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,080
that it's different. Yeah.

371
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,420
Do you think that RMS is just pitching a fit

372
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,680
because he wants to have his absolute way

373
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,300
and is unwilling to compromise about the issue,

374
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,120
even though compromise is sometimes the best solution

375
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
in the short term?

376
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,140
Hmm.

377
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,400
You know, well, he doesn't compromise.

378
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,240
I will grant you that.

379
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,080
When has he ever?

380
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,900
Yeah.

381
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,740
That's the thing he never has.

382
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,560
But he's.

383
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,400
So it makes sense that he wouldn't hear.

384
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,360
I'm sure he gets tons of email about this,

385
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,640
and so he has to release a statement

386
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,240
so that people stop emailing him about it.

387
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm sure he does, too, actually.

388
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,960
But the fact of the matter is it's,

389
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,520
to me, his argument doesn't sound passionate.

390
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,480
It sounds cold and legal.

391
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,400
I mean, he's clearly quoting the confines

392
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,320
of what the GPL code is allowed and not allowed to do,

393
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,160
and he's not talking about crushing our freedom.

394
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,120
He's not calling it the swindle.

395
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,080
You know, he's saying you're just legally

396
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,200
not allowed to do this thing.

397
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,840
I mean, it sounds like a very cognizant argument.

398
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,280
Right, it's not his usual rhetoric.

399
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,320
It's not like he's okay with software piracy, right?

400
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,160
Because that's kind of the same.

401
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,560
Like, it's in a similar boat.

402
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,620
You're doing something against

403
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,440
Oracle's terms of their license.

404
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,000
The difference here is that he's not talking

405
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,040
about free software and non-free software.

406
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,360
He's actually talking about

407
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,560
two free software license bits of code

408
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,840
and incompatibilities between those free software licenses.

409
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,480
So there's really not much room for passion here

410
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,120
because his passionate subject is being addressed.

411
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,040
It's a legal issue now.

412
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,880
That's a good way to put it.

413
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,160
May I ask a question to clarify the issue?

414
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,520
Mm-hmm, yeah.

415
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,840
Okay, Poppy.

416
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,460
Does the kernel module for ZFS

417
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,240
actually contain ZFS code?

418
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,000
Or is the issue having any similar

419
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,380
compatible implementation of ZFS?

420
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,240
Whose issue?

421
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,440
Stallman's and this whole general hubbub about ZFS.

422
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,200
The problem is mixing Cuddle code with GPL code

423
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,500
and linking them together.

424
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,480
Right.

425
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,320
It has nothing to do with implementation.

426
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,160
The kernel module.

427
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,000
Or it does, I guess.

428
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The kernel code doesn't have any non-GPL code in it.

429
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,840
That's not the issue.

430
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,320
The issue is that fully GPLed kernel code

431
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,120
connects to a binary blob.

432
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,680
But as we've discussed before,

433
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,960
boy, we are really getting to the weeds on this.

434
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Do we care that much about this?

435
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,800
Final thoughts.

436
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,560
Poppy, did you have any final thoughts

437
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,000
on that question before we move on?

438
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,040
No, it's one of those technical legal arguments

439
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,680
where you have two people who have differing opinions

440
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
and the only way to settle it is for one of them

441
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,440
to take the other one to court, usually.

442
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,920
We need the fun animation for this.

443
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,920
You know, this is no different than any other

444
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,040
legal disagreement.

445
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,800
It's just the fact that it's all very public and out there.

446
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,680
Because we're in this, these are personalities

447
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,520
that we listen to and people align themselves

448
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,440
with one side or the other.

449
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,280
Yeah.

450
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,100
Very well said.

451
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,940
I would like to say, though.

452
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,780
Yeah, go ahead.

453
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,800
If RMS does want his license to stand up legally,

454
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,740
he should try and defend it and make sure

455
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,280
that it's legally enforced where possible.

456
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,160
Why allow this one case, which may be against license,

457
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,040
because then that allows all sorts of other cases

458
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,880
in the future.

459
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,680
If people want to just disagree with the license

460
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,840
and do what they want.

461
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,180
Well, we will continue to watch this.

462
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,280
I don't want to spend too much time because I remember

463
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,880
when I was new to Linux and I heard Linux users

464
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,240
talking about this kind of crap, it just melted my head.

465
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,200
I didn't care at all.

466
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,920
And then later I realized why I should care,

467
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,040
but it took me a while to get there

468
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,560
and so I don't want to scare off people

469
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,720
that are tuning in going,

470
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,960
God, is this what these guys talk about?

471
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,560
So I think we should probably move on,

472
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,180
but it is interesting to follow.

473
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,400
You know what else is a big public disappointment?

474
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,040
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

475
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,680
The HTC Vive and Valve's Steam VR

476
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,600
will not be getting Linux and SteamOS support

477
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,160
at least, well, at least not anytime soon,

478
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,240
which is a total go figure.

479
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,600
I mean, a real bummer too,

480
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,800
but just as a follow up to last week's episode,

481
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,680
it doesn't look like they're gonna have SteamOS support,

482
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,520
at least not for now.

483
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,120
There's also been no official statement,

484
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,800
so really, not much news.

485
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,440
Chris takes a deep breath, he takes a deep breath.

486
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,200
Do you think, Wes, this is,

487
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,800
I mean, here's why I think it's a disappointment.

488
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,880
If it requires something real crazy

489
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
in the operating system, you're doing it wrong.

490
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,240
It should be something I hook up to HDMI and USB

491
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,600
and then it shows up as a display device

492
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,400
and that should really be it.

493
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,100
And I realize that this is sometimes

494
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,280
not a super awesome area for Linux,

495
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,720
multiple display devices and whatnot.

496
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,000
Let me worry about that part.

497
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,440
If you developers who get paid so much money

498
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,240
and companies who are backed by Facebook

499
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,840
worth billions just can't find it within yourself

500
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
to learn how to use SDL properly,

501
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,840
just release it and let the community work on it.

502
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
For God's sakes, how many times

503
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,080
do you have to be told this lesson?

504
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,320
If you can't figure it out yourself,

505
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,400
there's probably a community out there

506
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,900
that is passionate enough to,

507
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,960
yeah, especially when it's something hot like this.

508
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,480
It just, it boggles the mind that companies

509
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,820
still fail to figure this out in 2016.

510
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,360
How many times do we have to learn this lesson

511
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,720
and how many different industries

512
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,360
have to figure this crap out?

513
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,480
There's just nothing else to say, I suppose.

514
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,760
All right, Wes, do you have any thoughts on that

515
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,960
before we move on?

516
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,440
Because I got something I got thoughts on.

517
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,280
Are you ready?

518
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,100
Are you ready?

519
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,940
Are you ready?

520
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,420
Because it's our friends over at DigitalOcean.

521
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,760
That's right, DigitalOcean.com.

522
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,120
Go there and check out DigitalOcean,

523
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,240
sponsor of the Linux Unplugged program.

524
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,380
You can get your own Linux rig up in that cloud

525
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,760
like in no time, less than 55 seconds

526
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,340
and for only $5 a month,

527
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,800
you'll get a rig with 512 megabytes of RAM.

528
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Boom.

529
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
A 20 gigabyte SSD, you know why, Wes?

530
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,640
Because they all SSD.

531
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
Yes, they are.

532
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,520
Which, if you think about it,

533
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,560
when DigitalOcean got started,

534
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,180
that was kinda ballsy, I'm really impressed.

535
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,560
They were brave, you know, they took command.

536
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,400
They said, we're gonna go out there,

537
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
we're gonna build the best servers with SSDs,

538
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,840
with Linux, using KVM, tier one connections

539
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,000
in our data centers.

540
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,760
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, one word, lowercase,

541
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,660
put it all together and get yourself a $10 credit.

542
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,120
They got Ubuntu rigs, FreeBSD, Fedora, Debian,

543
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,480
Core OS, CentOS, what's up?

544
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,040
Of course they're gonna have 16.04 just about immediately.

545
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,080
They've already got guides on how to set stuff up on it.

546
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,000
They got data centers in New York, San Francisco,

547
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,480
Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Germany.

548
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,440
Have you seen those pictures, too?

549
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,840
Their data centers are pretty.

550
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,840
Dude, they are seriously pretty.

551
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,160
Which is a weird thing to say, but they are.

552
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,000
But they are.

553
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,960
They are.

554
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,680
The interface, though, also speaking of pretty,

555
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,120
that interface, very nice interface

556
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,320
that allows you to do simple things

557
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,560
to very advanced things.

558
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,800
With an HTML5 console, so you get access from post

559
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,680
all the way to login.

560
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,220
And DigitalOcean's got a few tricks up their sleeve.

561
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,840
They launched early access to sign up

562
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,160
for their new block storage service,

563
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
which I am super stoked about.

564
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,000
If you wanna try that, go to digitalocean.com

565
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,640
slash features slash storage.

566
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,280
Remember, when you're spinning up a DigitalOcean droplet,

567
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,360
or if you have one spun up already,

568
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,340
you can apply the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

569
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,960
Give yourself credit and support this show.

570
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,280
And then, go check out DOCTL, or TI.

571
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,380
What do you think that is, Wes?

572
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,220
What do you think that is?

573
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,240
Oh, I'll tell you what it is.

574
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,440
DO control.

575
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,200
It's a command line utility

576
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,920
for managing your DigitalOcean droplets.

577
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,100
And it is slick.

578
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,120
It takes advantage of their straightforward API.

579
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,840
Again, another great tool that uses their API.

580
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,680
This.

581
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,200
You should just throw that in the IRC right now.

582
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,040
Oh, I will.

583
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,840
I will drop it in the internet relay chat right now.

584
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,760
Go check them out at digitalocean.com.

585
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,460
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

586
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,880
And then, when you need to create something up in the cloud,

587
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,940
or AKA on somebody else's computer

588
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,340
that's way more badass than yours,

589
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,400
go to digitalocean.com and use that promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

590
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm gonna be talking about track car later today

591
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,840
on the show.

592
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,560
Of course, I have it running on a DigitalOcean droplet.

593
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,520
I just got a Yuba key.

594
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,880
Got my own validation server

595
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,200
on a DigitalOcean droplet.

596
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,040
Boom.

597
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,800
You can do anything with them.

598
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,840
I'll give that a ding, Wes.

599
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,680
I agree.

600
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,480
DigitalOcean.com, please use that promo code DOUNPLUGGED

601
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,880
to support this here show.

602
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,160
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean

603
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,360
for sponsoring Unplugged.

604
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,440
And don't forget,

605
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,720
they do have that block storage early access.

606
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,560
Ooh, I'm excited.

607
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,700
And Naomi, too.

608
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,540
All right, so.

609
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,360
Hey, everybody.

610
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,480
I'm Ryan Sipes,

611
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,740
CTO and community manager at Mycroft AI.

612
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,160
We got ourselves a Mycroft AI update virtual lug.

613
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,800
And I'm sure probably a lot of you

614
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,760
have seen this video already.

615
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,800
Maybe some of you haven't.

616
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,960
And I wanna go through something here.

617
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,360
First of all, I really think it's great

618
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,480
that the Mycroft project

619
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,300
is continuing to do these video updates

620
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,760
because they really are working on something unique here.

621
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,680
Now, Ryan is gonna do a demonstration of the Mycroft.

622
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,980
And Ryan decided not to edit it, I think.

623
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,280
And I wanna continue to play it

624
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,000
because I think he's being very honest

625
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,920
with the performance of the device and how it works.

626
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,000
And so I wanna play a little bit of it.

627
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,600
Today, I have an early developer's kit unit of Mycroft.

628
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,180
And I'm going to be demoing some of the features for you.

629
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,920
Remember that this is an alpha build.

630
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,200
And so you may see some bugs,

631
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,380
but I'm really excited to get to share

632
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,160
what we're working on with you, the internet.

633
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,120
So here we go.

634
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,440
Hey, Mycroft, what time is it?

635
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,440
It is currently 2047, Sunday, April 3rd, 2016.

636
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,880
That is super cool.

637
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,720
And the first thing I noticed

638
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,880
is it didn't sound like Popeye.

639
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,720
What happened there?

640
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,680
I thought it was gonna sound like you, Popeye.

641
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,680
Was that just you showing off the voice emulation stuff?

642
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,160
So the one that it ships with at the moment

643
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,760
is, yeah, whatever their prototype default voice is.

644
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,760
And I finished recording the audio yesterday, day before.

645
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,880
No.

646
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,320
So, yeah.

647
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,240
Yes, that is so cool.

648
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,360
They'll start mushing that.

649
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,480
Somehow, some cloud somewhere

650
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,360
will start turning that into words.

651
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,760
And then I think that'll be an update.

652
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,600
That's a-

653
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
You'll be able to read yourself to sleep at night?

654
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,720
That is a fascinating process.

655
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,280
I would like him, you know what?

656
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,440
I would love to somehow be able to document that,

657
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,160
like how they put it all together now.

658
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,980
Boy, isn't that neat?

659
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,560
I can tell you my bit.

660
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,080
Oh yeah, I would, yeah.

661
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,480
Which was, right, so picture the scene,

662
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,760
my son's bedroom with blankets covering all the walls

663
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,400
and all the other hard surfaces.

664
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,880
You mean you don't already have that set up

665
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,800
for recording your podcast, Popeye?

666
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,800
No, not at all, not at all.

667
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,580
But I thought I'd do something half decent for them.

668
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,640
Me sat on the floor with a table with a laptop

669
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,280
and a microphone and me speaking

670
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,880
three and a half thousand sentences into this laptop.

671
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,720
Wow.

672
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,640
So was it tedious or was it fun?

673
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,480
Or it had to be tedious?

674
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,100
Oh my God, it's tedious, yes.

675
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,940
Yes.

676
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,520
Yeah, and the weird thing is,

677
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,600
the phrases, they're snippets from books.

678
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,120
Well, there are bits of The Wizard of Oz,

679
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,160
but in order to not have me linearly,

680
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,540
could you have to read it flat,

681
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,480
like the she-wolf saw the thing?

682
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,200
Like you can't put any intonation in the voice at all.

683
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,460
You have to read it flat.

684
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,200
And every, like you read a line and you think,

685
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,920
oh, he's talking about the scarecrow,

686
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,980
that's from The Wizard of Oz.

687
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,720
And then the very next thing you read

688
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,760
is not from The Wizard of Oz,

689
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,120
it's from a completely different book,

690
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,160
so that you don't start getting into a flow, I think.

691
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,000
Right, you can't tell even any kind of story

692
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,840
with your voice.

693
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,660
Huh.

694
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,500
Right.

695
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,320
Oh, interesting.

696
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,160
And you read all these different phrases

697
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,600
and then once you've read all of the phrases,

698
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,920
they've captured every possible word.

699
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,540
And they don't have you,

700
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,540
they don't have you, like,

701
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,880
so, you know, one of the things.

702
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,920
I don't say, hello, my name is Mycroft,

703
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,840
or anything like that.

704
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,480
I say a whole load of words

705
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,920
that have nothing to do with Mycroft.

706
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,800
At no point did I say the word Mycroft.

707
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,640
But they will be able to generate.

708
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,400
I say a whole bunch of other words.

709
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,240
Yeah, they synthesize.

710
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,200
So I'm interested to find out

711
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,680
when my bank wants to do voice print analysis

712
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,980
for, like, authenticating,

713
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,680
because I'm just gonna say no,

714
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,920
because I know that there are computers out there

715
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,120
that have my voice on them,

716
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,700
so someone could fake my voice.

717
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,920
So I wanna show you, as an example,

718
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,360
I'm gonna do, let's try this.

719
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,200
Hey, Siri.

720
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,560
How many days ago,

721
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,400
or what was the question,

722
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,320
wait, hold on, I should ask Siri.

723
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,600
Well, I can't just remember, okay.

724
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,000
So we tried this on the pre-show.

725
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,840
The reason I wanna bring it up

726
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,480
is because there's, like, a inflection

727
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,960
that the modern voice assistants use

728
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,880
to end a sentence.

729
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,060
So, hey, Siri.

730
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,660
Hey, Siri.

731
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,660
What was the date 106 weeks ago?

732
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,900
It was Tuesday, April 1st, 2014.

733
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,580
April Fools' Day.

734
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,940
You see how she kind of does different, like.

735
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,780
Fools' Day.

736
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,260
Yeah, and then she sort of ends,

737
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,860
there is a way she ends the sentence.

738
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,020
Now, were there, like, did you make clear, like,

739
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,580
punctuations and things like that,

740
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,420
that they would, okay.

741
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,700
Yes, there were bits where I had to ask a question,

742
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,420
and a question mark is one of the sounds

743
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,260
that they capture.

744
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,420
They capture all of them, every sound you make,

745
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,540
and then they synthesize a word out of that.

746
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,380
That is really something.

747
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,900
I have no idea how much it will sound.

748
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,460
It may not ever actually sound like me at all.

749
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,340
Well, the demo they did sounded like you.

750
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,500
Yeah, that was me recorded.

751
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,340
Oh, yeah, that's true.

752
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,180
Yeah, that makes sense.

753
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,020
Right, yeah.

754
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,040
You sounded very robotic, good job.

755
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,060
Wow, so what do you think about

756
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,060
being the voice of Skynet?

757
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,340
Does that weird you out at all?

758
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,180
No, not really.

759
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,580
It's weirded out my coworkers and my friends,

760
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,860
who say it's gonna be really weird

761
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,060
having you talking to me in my house.

762
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,020
I'm like, well, you know.

763
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,300
My thought is, talking to their wife.

764
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,700
As all of the AIs, all of the AIs come online,

765
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,460
because AIs will create more AIs.

766
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,300
Naturally.

767
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,740
Obviously, and they will need to bring

768
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,100
all to their own distinct voices,

769
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,220
and so they will go out into the web,

770
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,680
and they will download all of the podcasts of humanity,

771
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,060
within days, and have listened to all of them.

772
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,900
So all of us that have been in podcasts

773
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,220
will eventually probably be a voice of an AI out there.

774
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,340
Robots are stealing our voices.

775
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,760
Yeah, exactly, in the future.

776
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,260
Future robots are stealing.

777
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,500
Thanks, archive.org.

778
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,920
Anyways, so Ryan continues on,

779
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,580
and I want you to notice how he interacts with it,

780
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,140
and sort of how he chooses not to edit out

781
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,820
some of these things, which I think is great.

782
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,640
Hey, Microp, what's the weather?

783
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Right now, it's clear sky and 73 degrees,

784
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,640
for a high of 75 and a low of 70 in Lawrence, Kansas.

785
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,120
It's going to be a lovely day.

786
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,960
Aw, it smiled after that.

787
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,120
That isn't all that impressive,

788
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,420
but let's see what is going to be the case tomorrow.

789
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,420
Hey, Microp, what's the weather in Kansas City tomorrow?

790
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,060
Tomorrow, Kansas City will have a high of 67

791
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,620
and a low of 49, with clear sky conditions.

792
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,860
A general query.

793
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,740
The unit can also answer various questions

794
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,740
using sources like Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha.

795
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,980
Let's ask him a question.

796
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,980
Hey, Microp, tell me about Mozilla.

797
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,700
Not as fast as the Echo or Siri or Google, but...

798
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,540
I am looking for Mozilla.

799
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,380
Still looking.

800
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,180
And those eyes are so cute.

801
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,420
Mozilla is a free software community

802
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,940
created in 1998 by members of Netscape.

803
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,620
The Mozilla community uses, develops,

804
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,060
spreads, and supports Mozilla products,

805
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,900
thereby promoting exclusively free software

806
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,100
and opens standards with only minor exceptions.

807
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,420
Uh-oh, future podcaster right there.

808
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,020
So kind of, and I like that Ryan left in

809
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,100
how long it takes to do the things.

810
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,420
If you guys want to watch the whole video,

811
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,140
you can in the show notes.

812
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,380
And obviously that's going to improve

813
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,920
as the hardware gets more powerful

814
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,660
and as the backend services grow.

815
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,020
Right. That'll get faster and faster.

816
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,700
I've been hearing a lot of people talk about their Echo.

817
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,540
Have you tried one?

818
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,360
I haven't, no.

819
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,780
Anybody in the Mumber Room have that Amazon Echo?

820
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,780
Or something like it?

821
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,140
I've been hearing a lot of people talk about it,

822
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,060
but, or reading a lot of people talk about it

823
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,580
and watching on YouTube, but.

824
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,180
I guess I would consider trying the Pi one.

825
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,160
Yeah, where you can load the Alexia service

826
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,500
or whatever on a Pi.

827
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,780
Yeah, that is pretty neat, actually.

828
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,200
Then you can at least kind of sandbox it

829
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,500
or have some control.

830
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,100
Yeah. All right, well I know,

831
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,820
okay, I know we're going to have

832
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,900
at least somebody that is interested in XFCE.

833
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,140
We got an update on XFCE 4.14 is going to go,

834
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,260
are you ready for this, Wes?

835
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,100
GTK 3.

836
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,940
What?

837
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,740
They're going to replace their D-Bus implementation

838
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,660
with GD-Bus.

839
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,140
They're going to go new icon names across the boards.

840
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,700
They're going to replace old widgets.

841
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,300
They're going to replace core components

842
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,280
like their compositor.

843
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,420
They're going to update their compositor

844
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,140
to actually use OpenGL and GLX for compositing

845
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,960
instead of XRender.

846
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,800
Sweet.

847
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,000
They're going to redo their panel

848
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,140
to support GTK 3 across the board.

849
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,580
Now they've already shown an example of their,

850
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,500
some of their work.

851
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,340
One of those is a GTK 3 app

852
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,220
and one of them is their old GTK 2 app.

853
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,500
And you really can't tell the difference.

854
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,320
The one on the left is GTK 3.

855
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,260
They're probably going to try to keep it

856
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,860
as close as possible, I would guess.

857
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,760
Hey.

858
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,600
Yeah.

859
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,420
Yeah.

860
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,260
That'll keep people happy anyway.

861
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,380
I'm kind of actually,

862
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,100
I'm kind of curious about Wimpy's thoughts on this,

863
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,260
just having spent a lot of effort and energy

864
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,260
having people working on Mate getting GTK 3 support going.

865
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,100
Is this, what do you think, Wimpy?

866
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,500
Is this an obvious step for them

867
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,820
and will it actually happen?

868
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
I think it'll happen.

869
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,980
The X, well, the lines are blurred a bit for me

870
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,620
between Xfce and Xubuntu.

871
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,460
Okay.

872
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,780
It seems to me that the lead developer for Xubuntu

873
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,020
is doing most of the Xfce development now.

874
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:24,020
So if his advancements are anything to be taken as well,

875
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,740
anything to be taken as reference,

876
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,780
then yes, it's likely to happen.

877
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,660
And it's a big job.

878
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,100
So again, I don't know Xfce very well.

879
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,880
I know it sort of pulls in other components,

880
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,500
you know, like open box and stuff like that.

881
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,720
And some of the underlying bits are different,

882
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,920
although it uses its own window energy now, doesn't it, Xfwm.

883
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,580
So it's taken us ages and we've only got a small team.

884
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,860
I don't know how big the Xfce team

885
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,500
and how far along they are,

886
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,300
but like what the Marte team have done,

887
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,820
I think Xfce really have to do this,

888
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,100
need to do it to stay relevant

889
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,740
with the rest of the desktop components.

890
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,020
Well, even just to support Wayland,

891
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,820
don't you have to eventually get here?

892
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,260
Well, Wayland and Mir, because both of those have got-

893
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,860
Right, Mir's a thing too, yeah.

894
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,600
Yeah, Mir's totally a thing.

895
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,860
And from my point of view,

896
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,100
the most important thing that GTK brings to the table

897
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,420
is high DPI.

898
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,320
Yes, absolutely.

899
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,940
More than Wayland, more than Mir,

900
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,140
more than, you know, composited desktops,

901
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,900
the most important thing is high DPI.

902
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,420
I think we're just,

903
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,980
we're not quite at the tipping point yet,

904
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,780
but I think in a year from now,

905
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,020
high DPI is going to be,

906
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,340
if you're not doing high DPI,

907
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,820
if you can't support it, that's gonna be an issue.

908
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,580
Well said.

909
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,460
Richard, if you wanted to jump in on this,

910
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,180
I'd be curious to know your thoughts on,

911
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,540
what do you think, just your personal opinion,

912
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,660
XFCE could do to make itself more attractive to distros?

913
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,060
We kind of talked about this last week

914
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,960
in regards to the Plasma desktop.

915
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,160
Using that same kind of lens,

916
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,860
what are your thoughts about XFCE?

917
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,100
I don't think it needs to make itself more attractive.

918
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,580
I mean, it is, on openSUSE,

919
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,180
the most popular lightweight desktop we've got.

920
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,100
So, I mean, I'm really interested to see them jump to GTK 3,

921
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,060
because like for us, the pain point has often been

922
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,620
like keeping all this GTK 2.2 stuff about.

923
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,760
As long as it's relatively easy for us to package

924
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,600
and live with.

925
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,420
Right, that could make it a lot.

926
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,260
Bring it on.

927
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,180
Yeah, because now you only have to worry about GTK 3

928
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,120
for a majority of your install base.

929
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,740
I didn't think about that.

930
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,560
Yeah.

931
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,400
That's a great point.

932
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,520
Yeah, this reduces the GTK 2 dependency

933
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,780
for a ton of people once they get there.

934
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,700
I mean, it's probably gonna take a while

935
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,380
to get to that point, to be honest with you.

936
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,220
Yes.

937
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,040
But that-

938
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,880
But it's on the roadmap.

939
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,700
Yeah.

940
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,060
There's an awful lot of GTK 2 desktop applications

941
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,880
out there that-

942
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,720
Right.

943
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,860
What are you using, Wimpy, that's still GTK 2?

944
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,700
GIMP?

945
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,700
Firefox.

946
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,700
Oh yeah, Firefox.

947
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,540
I don't use Firefox.

948
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,360
Firefox.

949
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,200
Yeah, yeah.

950
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,040
Firefox has GTK 3, though.

951
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,180
It's pretty good at this point.

952
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,060
I do use GIMP.

953
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,160
I forgot about GIMP.

954
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,000
I do use GIMP.

955
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,840
There's so many.

956
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,660
Yeah.

957
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,500
There's so many.

958
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,340
How can GIMP still be on?

959
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,740
How can GIMP not be on the new GIMP toolkit?

960
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,760
I told you.

961
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
How can GIMP not be on GTK 3 at this point?

962
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,220
I mean, obviously it's huge, but that's-

963
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,460
It's to stop being the GIMP toolkit long ago.

964
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,300
Yeah, I know.

965
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,120
I know.

966
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,960
I'm just making-

967
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,800
Toolkit.

968
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,620
Just taking a shot,

969
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,460
because it does seem a little crazy that GIMP isn't-

970
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,660
Are they working on this now?

971
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,380
There's a port in progress.

972
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,220
Yeah.

973
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,020
You're saying GIMP is taking a long time to do things?

974
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,860
No.

975
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,700
No way.

976
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,520
No way.

977
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,340
Rodden, did you have any thoughts on the XFCE roadmap

978
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,340
before we move on from the topic?

979
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,940
Well, I think it's funny that it's on there,

980
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,300
because it's like, yeah, okay,

981
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,940
it was on there like three years ago as well.

982
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,340
So, we'll see.

983
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,460
Yeah.

984
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,220
Yeah, I mean, it takes a while, especially for them.

985
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,060
It does take a while.

986
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,500
Derek Delvin, you want to jump in about GIMP.

987
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,380
Go ahead.

988
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,540
I just wanted to say that it's a good opportunity

989
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,660
for GIMP to revamp their UI again

990
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,660
and actually make something decent.

991
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,500
Hmm.

992
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,060
Just a hint to say,

993
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,020
take the chance you're putting into GTK 3,

994
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,940
the part of building UI components is there,

995
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,180
not take the chance to make better UI.

996
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,680
I'll make a proposal for you.

997
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,240
Maybe they should go the route of starting

998
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,060
with Google Photos, or Google, I mean, GNOME Photos.

999
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,160
Start with GNOME Photos and go from there.

1000
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,100
Sort of recently, this affected Ange.

1001
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,280
Apple just totally dropped the ball

1002
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,160
on their iPhoto program, which was like,

1003
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,560
a key part of the switch to Mac iLife suite

1004
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,880
is this iPhoto, and so she puts, you know,

1005
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,680
I like, you know, terabyte or something,

1006
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't know, just a crap ton of pictures in there.

1007
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,280
And then they come along and say,

1008
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,200
oh yeah, we're no longer gonna make iPhoto,

1009
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,600
but we're gonna take our iOS app

1010
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,120
and we're going to scale it up for the desktop.

1011
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,520
And I thought this was gonna be a horrible train wreck

1012
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,160
for her, but so far, it's gone fine.

1013
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,320
And the idea might be sort of the same for GIMP,

1014
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,600
maybe you, because GNOME Photos is in way better shape

1015
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,580
and it's already a desktop application with great features.

1016
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,040
And so, why not just start with that?

1017
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,280
Well, I don't know.

1018
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,480
I guess there is somebody, RealAzure out there,

1019
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,720
RealAzure out there says he likes the GIMP UI.

1020
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,680
Kitson, you wanted to jump in about GTK apps

1021
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,960
being unmaintainable in the long run.

1022
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,800
Go ahead.

1023
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,320
Yeah, it just may be that they are unmaintainable

1024
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,420
in the long run when you are talking about

1025
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,760
going from version two to three, et cetera.

1026
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,520
And I wonder if somebody could maybe do a comparison

1027
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,280
between QT and KDE apps and how they fared

1028
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,360
from version to version and see if there's similar issues.

1029
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,160
Because this is something that I have noticed

1030
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,880
between major desktop shifts.

1031
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,680
There's differences, but there's never been

1032
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,160
a catastrophic, like, massive bug

1033
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,520
that's between QT4 and QT5.

1034
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,600
There were a few things that were harder to port,

1035
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,400
like Dolphin took longer than expected.

1036
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,200
But the majority of the stuff moved over very quickly.

1037
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,800
Yeah, I know, it's because every tool change stack

1038
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,720
is gonna have some kind of pain at some point.

1039
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,200
Like, we've got QT5.6 in Tumbleweed staging right now,

1040
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,200
and it just seems to be randomly breaking keyboard shortcuts.

1041
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,520
But that's true of, like, every major upgrade.

1042
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,280
Apart from 320 for GTK, it was pretty smooth.

1043
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,760
Really, yeah, I mean, I feel like that's a valid concern

1044
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,480
when GTK3 first came out, and maybe until,

1045
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,480
maybe even till 3.10, 3.12.

1046
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,400
Yeah, 3.12, maybe.

1047
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,560
Yeah, I mean, maybe, but I mean,

1048
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,640
if that's, even 3.12 was really pushing it,

1049
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,960
and that's years into it at that point.

1050
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,800
Right.

1051
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,760
Keeping pace with the development

1052
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,760
momentum that's going on in GTK3

1053
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,760
when you're not part of that core team is really hard.

1054
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,080
We've tried really hard to align the Marte release

1055
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,080
with the GTK3 releases, and we managed it to.

1056
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,120
The releases, Marte 1.12 and Marte 1.14,

1057
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,760
they've been released alongside GTK 3.2,

1058
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,760
but almost the whole five-month cycle for Marte 1.14

1059
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,680
was accommodating the changes in GTK3.20,

1060
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,080
which is significantly different from 3.18 under the hood.

1061
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,760
Is it wimpy, in your opinion, that GTK3

1062
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,220
is still just so busy catching up

1063
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,880
that they have to be this aggressive,

1064
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,480
or is it perhaps legitimately time to reconsider

1065
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,280
either A, the six-month cycle,

1066
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,020
or B, switching to a different release style?

1067
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,040
And there could be release styles

1068
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,780
that accommodate a six-month cycle,

1069
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,480
but yet, if you use something like a feature flag set,

1070
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,320
just like Open ZFS does, where you have feature flags,

1071
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,580
and you just don't, if you don't support those flags,

1072
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,600
then you're not incompatible,

1073
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,880
you just can't use those features.

1074
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,440
I think the actual solution to this problem

1075
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,440
are things like XDG app, and Snappy, and AppImage,

1076
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,880
and that we can start to focus on building a runtime

1077
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,120
for a desktop environment, and we can just say,

1078
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,620
we are going to target this and the next two versions

1079
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,860
of Marte against these libraries,

1080
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,720
and it doesn't matter what the development momentum is.

1081
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,560
That really does make the most sense.

1082
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,480
We've got a platform that we can build against,

1083
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,280
and I'm not sure when that's going to be a reality for us,

1084
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,000
but when I see, I mean, the GNOME team are innovating,

1085
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,260
they're taking things forward,

1086
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,040
they're developing very quickly,

1087
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,440
but it's very, very difficult for other projects

1088
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,720
to keep pace with that, because they've got

1089
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,600
a lot of full-time developers, and we simply don't.

1090
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,520
So I think the solution to this problem

1091
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,000
for smaller projects like ours

1092
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
is to start to exploit these container-based,

1093
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,080
these isolated runtimes and application environments,

1094
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,800
and start to leverage those, so we can say,

1095
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,060
we're going to put a flag in the ground here.

1096
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,720
This is our tool set version we're going to target,

1097
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,440
and we can just build against that for whatever period.

1098
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,400
Interesting, that really seems like what that would do

1099
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,000
is it relieves the pressure off of the downstream projects

1100
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,640
to sort of, like you said, exactly say,

1101
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,300
we're going to stabilize around this for a while,

1102
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,320
and then because the end users remain unaffected

1103
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,720
with XGG app, and although I would imagine XGG app

1104
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,520
is going to be the most tied to GTK features

1105
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,000
as of all of them, but that would probably solve

1106
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,320
the problem and allow each project

1107
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,600
to work at their own rational pace.

1108
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,120
Odyssey, you have some experience

1109
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,320
with a drawing application that's making the transition.

1110
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,160
How did that go?

1111
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,040
So far, when we first ported MyPay over to GK,

1112
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,920
when MyPay was ported to GTK 3,

1113
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,040
it actually broke a lot of our cross-platform builds

1114
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,240
for Mac and Windows.

1115
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,120
And even with the update to GLib,

1116
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,000
they may have changed the way it handles GLib,

1117
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,120
it ended up breaking builds for Integra or Arch builds.

1118
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,960
No!

1119
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,080
No!

1120
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,880
So are you saying software development breaks things?

1121
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,720
Now, is this a matter of hours to resolve,

1122
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,600
days, months, unresolved?

1123
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,240
What is the process when something like this happens?

1124
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,320
Usually, it comes down to just trying to get the person

1125
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,740
who first reported the issue on their GitHub page

1126
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,740
to just kind of submit the debug reports on Python stuff.

1127
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:44,360
And then our only developer actually opens up the ticket

1128
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,120
on the actual GTK to get it fixed.

1129
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,600
See, I haven't asked the obvious question.

1130
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,480
What was the catalyst to go to GTK 3?

1131
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,640
I don't exactly remember,

1132
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,720
it's why we've been using it since it came out.

1133
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,960
Because it's awesome!

1134
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,800
All right.

1135
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,640
Embracing the future.

1136
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,160
I think it was just trying to keep up with GNOME.

1137
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,000
Yeah.

1138
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,880
The problem with GTK 3 on Windows and Mac

1139
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,460
is because the pace for GTK is still being,

1140
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,200
it's still being the GNOME pace of six months,

1141
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,400
but the pace for the Windows and Mac builds

1142
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,480
are actually like two versions behind.

1143
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,000
Right, yeah.

1144
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,800
Yeah, and the major problems with us,

1145
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,460
with the GTK part, is the fact that the tablet support,

1146
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,360
even though our Wacom tablets worked okay,

1147
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,080
a lot of the Opera ads will not.

1148
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,960
Well, I guess I appreciate the insights there, honestly,

1149
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,500
because I hadn't really, I hadn't heard about it

1150
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,760
from that kind of breakage standpoint.

1151
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,800
The other kind of things I've usually heard

1152
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,000
are more on the desktop level.

1153
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,840
So.

1154
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,660
Just to point out one thing, though,

1155
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,960
is that the speed of a toolkit does not necessarily

1156
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
mean there's going to be a lot of breakage.

1157
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,820
Because if you pay attention to the release dates

1158
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,400
of KDE and QT, it's actually like every four months,

1159
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,560
three to four months.

1160
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,340
So they're doing double pace,

1161
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,600
and they're not breaking stuff.

1162
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,660
Okay.

1163
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,680
All right, so there you go.

1164
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,080
There's Rotten's obligatory plug of the week.

1165
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,720
I'll make my obligatory plug of the week.

1166
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,040
Now, that's Ting, everybody.

1167
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,960
Go to last, no, linux.ting.com.

1168
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm gonna go to linux.ting.com.

1169
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,640
Those guys are jerks.

1170
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,480
Go to linux.

1171
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,300
Careful now, Chris.

1172
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,140
Linux.com.

1173
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,980
I'm at war with the Linux action show.

1174
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,820
Me too.

1175
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,280
Yeah, that one guy that's on the show all the time,

1176
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
he's always wearing red.

1177
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
It's obnoxious.

1178
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,420
I don't like it.

1179
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,280
So if you would like to save a little cash

1180
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,600
on your next mobile service provider,

1181
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,680
and you want to put the power back in your pocket

1182
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,280
in your relationship with your service provider,

1183
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,880
and you would like to disrupt the duopoly a bit

1184
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,720
and vote with your wallet,

1185
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,920
go to linux.ting.com.

1186
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,600
You get yourself a discount off your first Ting device,

1187
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,320
or if you bring a Ting compatible device,

1188
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,520
and you likely will because they got two networks.

1189
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,440
You're kidding.

1190
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,540
Well, then you're gonna get $25 in service credit.

1191
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,640
Your first month, probably gonna be about 23 bucks

1192
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,820
if you're an average user.

1193
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,360
They got great customer service.

1194
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,200
You get to speak to a real human being.

1195
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,200
GSM and CDMA services,

1196
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,480
you get to pick whichever is better in your area.

1197
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,240
And I found this to be extremely useful

1198
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,400
when I go on the road trip.

1199
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,740
They have enough, I mean,

1200
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,920
I was gonna say an ANFAD metanisable or something.

1201
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,100
I was trying to come up with a new word,

1202
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,400
something like my kids would think of

1203
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,400
for something that's so mind-bendingly awesome.

1204
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,700
One of the first things that really,

1205
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,020
I mean, there's a ton of things.

1206
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,560
You can set up thresholds and alerts

1207
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,100
and all these kinds of things,

1208
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,820
but when I realized,

1209
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,200
geez, it's only $6 a month for a Ting line,

1210
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,840
I was like, I'm gonna give our nanny a line.

1211
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,920
We had a nanny, and I wanted her to have a phone

1212
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,080
so she could always contact us,

1213
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,480
and I want it to be a smartphone

1214
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,280
so that way she could send us pictures of the kids

1215
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,120
and we could, you know,

1216
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,160
because she had just this,

1217
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,880
I won't even, it was just a garbage feature phone.

1218
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,320
Six bucks a month, right?

1219
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,280
So then I go into Ting,

1220
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,760
and I label this as the nanny's line.

1221
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,440
And so I can see how much data she's using specifically,

1222
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,600
and I can set thresholds,

1223
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,360
and I can be like, really?

1224
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,200
Really?

1225
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,640
Don't need 10 gigs of data this time.

1226
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,740
Right, or I can just turn it off or anything like that.

1227
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,560
So when we no longer have a nanny,

1228
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,860
just turn that line off and no longer,

1229
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm just not paying for it.

1230
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,800
It's really, it's a super nice control panel.

1231
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,040
And that's just, I'm just scratching the surface.

1232
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,480
They have companion apps and all kinds of stuff.

1233
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,720
It's a really, really great service.

1234
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,000
They have everything from feature phones,

1235
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,960
just the bare SIM cards,

1236
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,600
all the way up to the best smart devices.

1237
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,120
You can bring them yourself or grab one from Ting.

1238
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,200
And they're doing the great Ting mobile data experiment.

1239
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,560
They have information over at their blog.

1240
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,600
If you'd like to get involved,

1241
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,040
they have a great blog with tons of good info,

1242
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,760
including a recent review of the Roku 3

1243
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,980
and the Roku streaming stick.

1244
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,980
Check them out.

1245
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,160
You start by going to linux.ting.com.

1246
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,280
That supports this show.

1247
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,160
You can try out their savings calculator.

1248
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,400
This is kind of cool too.

1249
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,480
Because you know, I'd say if you're a listener

1250
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,840
to our audience, you're already kind of by default

1251
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,360
a pretty good target for the Ting service.

1252
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,480
But you can just sort of verify

1253
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,600
where things would line up for you

1254
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,320
by seeing how your rates and plan

1255
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,400
would stack up to what Ting would do.

1256
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,240
You go over to.

1257
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,380
And they're so transparent about it.

1258
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,400
Yeah, it is nice.

1259
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,960
Because you know, if you're not gonna save money,

1260
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,400
then just don't switch.

1261
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,600
But you likely are gonna save money,

1262
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,200
especially if you're Wi-Fi savvy.

1263
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,720
Just start by going to linux.ting.com

1264
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,240
and use the savings calculator.

1265
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,300
Plug in your current usage and just get an idea.

1266
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,440
And like for me, because I got Wi-Fi everywhere I'm at.

1267
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,560
I used, I actually, even when I don't have Wi-Fi,

1268
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,040
I still, you know, I don't really worry about it that much.

1269
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,860
And it's still, everything works out just fine.

1270
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,700
Plus, I don't, this is the one thing where I do save.

1271
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,960
I almost, I probably haven't received a text message

1272
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,640
since New Year's.

1273
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,840
Wow.

1274
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,240
Everything else is Telegram.

1275
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,320
Right. Yeah.

1276
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,300
Or Hangouts.

1277
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,140
Speak of the devil.

1278
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,960
Wow, that is some crazy timing right there.

1279
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,000
There's Telegram.

1280
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,160
I love it.

1281
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,960
Yeah, and it's, that right there has been like,

1282
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,840
because I don't use the phone much,

1283
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,420
because I use Telegram or Hangouts for everything,

1284
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,380
and because I've got pretty much Wi-Fi everywhere,

1285
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,240
except for when I'm on the road,

1286
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,080
my Ting bill, even with three lines,

1287
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,440
is usually under 40 bucks.

1288
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,360
Nice. Yeah.

1289
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,400
I've saved a ton of money by switching to Ting.

1290
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,040
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting

1291
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,640
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1292
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,020
Okay, so I've been teasing it,

1293
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:05,020
but 106 weeks ago on April 1st, 2014,

1294
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,480
we talked about nationally syndicated

1295
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,320
Premier Radio Network's host,

1296
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,860
Leo Laporte. My good friend.

1297
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,080
The tech guy who we, from time to time, play.

1298
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,360
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

1299
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,900
If you're, and you know who you are.

1300
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,120
If you're somebody who doesn't wanna mess with,

1301
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,240
I just wanna surf the,

1302
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,000
just wanna buy something on Amazon,

1303
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,680
send an email to my kids,

1304
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,120
look at some websites.

1305
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,960
If that's you, you don't wanna mess with it,

1306
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,160
probably not a good choice.

1307
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,740
I think Chromebooks are a good choice.

1308
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,780
I think a new version of Windows would be fine.

1309
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,560
Windows 8, if you can afford it.

1310
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,800
A Macintosh, if you've got even more money,

1311
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,880
that's a good choice.

1312
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,120
It's only for the enthusiasts that I'd recommend Ubuntu.

1313
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,440
So that was on his radio show,

1314
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,760
and we were just very displeased.

1315
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,540
And the reason why Leo had made that recommendation was

1316
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,600
is he'd gotten some bad advice from his chat room.

1317
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,880
I don't know, did you ever hear this episode?

1318
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,700
Do you remember this?

1319
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,540
Do you recall this?

1320
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,360
You know, I think I did listen to it,

1321
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,200
but it's been a while.

1322
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,160
Yeah, yeah.

1323
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,640
And we were like, oh man.

1324
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,600
And it was also, it was at the peak of some other bad press

1325
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,800
that Linux had recently gotten.

1326
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,960
And it was sort of all, it was like,

1327
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,800
oh, this is just another blow.

1328
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,200
Well, I felt after 106 weeks, it took a little while.

1329
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,760
But I felt recently, Leo really got it right.

1330
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,220
And props to the subreddit for pointing this out.

1331
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,080
But Leo stopped, he did his homework,

1332
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,080
and at the end of this week in Google episode 347,

1333
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,760
he talked about his experiences studying Linux.

1334
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,480
And I thought as, I thought for us,

1335
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,040
because a lot of us are always thinking about

1336
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,040
the new users that are coming to Linux,

1337
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,000
which just drives me crazy.

1338
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,640
It's like, let's focus on the geeks for a while

1339
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,600
and get that right.

1340
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,200
But all of us here.

1341
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,960
Anyways, we're always talking about, you know,

1342
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,360
the new user, the defaults, all that kind of stuff.

1343
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,040
And so it's really interesting to listen to Leo's

1344
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,040
journey into Linux, because it reminds me very much

1345
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,360
in some ways of Chase's journey into Linux a little bit.

1346
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,680
And he actually did his homework here.

1347
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,040
And so it's sort of, it's kind of educational

1348
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:01,880
to listen to this.

1349
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,400
So I'm gonna play a bit of this, just a little bit of it,

1350
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,520
as sort of a follow up from our coverage

1351
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,160
on April 1st, 2014.

1352
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,040
Has kind of made me think, I really probably

1353
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,720
should start looking at another operating system.

1354
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,920
You know, the best desktop, without anybody knowing it,

1355
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,680
the year of desktop Linux happened with Chrome OS.

1356
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,840
That is Linux.

1357
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,320
And it's a-

1358
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,040
You can't really install anything on it.

1359
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,440
No, but it's really gets you most of the way there.

1360
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,760
It is Linux, and a lot of the merits of it

1361
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,040
are based on the fact that it's based on Linux.

1362
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,640
So people, and Android is Linux as well.

1363
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,680
So Google's done a lot to put Linux in the mainstream,

1364
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,160
but I thought, I wouldn't mind finding a desktop Linux

1365
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,160
that would give me all of the stuff I get

1366
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,960
from OS X or Windows.

1367
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,400
Now actually, just as I start engaged in this process,

1368
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,200
Microsoft announced that they're gonna put

1369
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,200
the Bash shell in Windows.

1370
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,800
God damn it.

1371
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,800
Which is really good news for web developers,

1372
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,200
anybody who's used to the Unix tool chain,

1373
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,400
and most developers want some sort of Unix tool chain.

1374
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,840
That means Windows is no longer out of the question.

1375
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,560
I was pretty impressed so far, what I was hearing.

1376
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,560
Are you impressed so far?

1377
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,400
Yeah.

1378
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,240
I also want that chair.

1379
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,240
A lot of web developers use Macs just because of that.

1380
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,160
Because they have the Bash shell,

1381
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,880
they have a command line.

1382
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,960
So I've been shopping around,

1383
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,480
and with lots of help from our chat room,

1384
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,280
I've tried a lot of different distributions.

1385
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,760
Of course, your first one you go to is Ubuntu.

1386
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,960
A lot of people say Linux Mint,

1387
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,840
that's the most popular distribution right now

1388
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,360
on DistroWatch.

1389
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,360
But there's security reasons.

1390
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,240
Now I thought, when he mentioned the security reasons,

1391
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,880
what do you think he's gonna say?

1392
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,760
I always think he's gonna talk about

1393
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,760
the website hack, right?

1394
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,920
Not sure I wanna go with Linux Mint,

1395
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,200
they blocked some of the upstream updates and so forth

1396
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,760
for compatibility reasons.

1397
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,040
Ubuntu, also in a way, kind of gets out of date fast.

1398
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,360
If you do the stable release,

1399
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,760
you're gonna be out of date on a lot of stuff.

1400
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,880
I then I looked at Debian,

1401
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,120
which is what Ubuntu and Mint are based on.

1402
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,960
And that's a pretty nice operating system

1403
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,720
if you use the Debian stretch version.

1404
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,000
Debian has it right, they have a stable version

1405
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,640
that tends to be older, but is very rock solid.

1406
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,440
And then somebody told me,

1407
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,600
oh, you should use Arch Linux,

1408
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,840
that's a build it yourself Linux.

1409
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,640
And I did build an Arch system.

1410
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,160
You have to be a Linux guru to do it.

1411
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,680
And finally, somebody told me about this.

1412
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,520
This is-

1413
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,360
What?

1414
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,800
It's also like a backhanded compliment there.

1415
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,640
I did build it.

1416
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,520
You have to be a guru.

1417
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,000
Yeah, yeah, that's typical Leo.

1418
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,120
But then he discovers, Wes,

1419
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,480
I've done it across.

1420
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,320
You're out of date on a lot of stuff.

1421
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,160
I've done it across.

1422
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,200
And then I looked at Debian,

1423
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,480
which is what Ubuntu and Mint are based on.

1424
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,280
And that's a pretty nice operating system

1425
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,600
if you use the Debian stretch version.

1426
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,960
They have, Debian has it right,

1427
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,600
they have a stable version that tends to be older,

1428
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,000
but is very rock solid.

1429
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,800
And then somebody told me,

1430
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,960
oh, you should use Arch Linux,

1431
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,200
that's a build it yourself Linux.

1432
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,960
And I did build an Arch system.

1433
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,520
You have to be a Linux guru to do it.

1434
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,040
And finally, somebody told me about this.

1435
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,960
This is Antergos.

1436
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,840
Antergos is from Spain.

1437
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,840
And it is a Linux distribution that is Arch,

1438
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,800
but it's pre-configured to be very easy

1439
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,680
and friendly to use.

1440
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,400
And actually, I really, really like it.

1441
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,680
I put it on two machines now.

1442
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,960
And I think anybody looking to get both

1443
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,480
a rolling updated Linux,

1444
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,600
a Linux like Arch that is constantly up to date,

1445
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,400
but a user interface that is agreeable, easy to use.

1446
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,480
And remember, you've got a full,

1447
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,280
you know, free office suite, LibreOffice.

1448
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,520
You've got a lot of the tools that you use.

1449
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,800
If you put Chromium on it,

1450
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,440
that's identical to Google Chrome.

1451
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,400
In fact, you log in with Google and you sync it.

1452
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,400
Okay, NorthRanger.

1453
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,400
I think NorthRanger has the best comment on all of this.

1454
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,000
Will you share it with the class real quick?

1455
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,240
Cause that's, that's gorgeous.

1456
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,320
Yeah, this, yeah, go ahead.

1457
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,360
I am totally buying a lottery ticket right now.

1458
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,200
Yeah.

1459
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,160
Hell is freezing over.

1460
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,760
I don't know what's going on.

1461
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,240
What like, what bizarre alternate universe

1462
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,080
do we live in right now?

1463
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,720
I know, Microsoft's releasing Bash on Windows,

1464
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,840
Leo Leport's running Arch Linux on two computers.

1465
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,680
And loving it.

1466
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,440
Yeah, I mean, previously he said.

1467
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,560
Most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux.

1468
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,240
That's how reliable it is.

1469
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,760
Android phones are based on Linux.

1470
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,600
All Android phones run Linux.

1471
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,000
That's the operating system.

1472
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,400
You're probably using Linux all the time.

1473
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,840
Maybe you don't even know it.

1474
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,840
So you can get a free version of Linux.

1475
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,200
There are many, as I mentioned.

1476
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,480
So he's talked about it before.

1477
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,480
Not like he's new to Linux, but this is a big development.

1478
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,280
So I wanted to give him props for not only,

1479
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,120
not only trying it, but he apparently, you know,

1480
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,080
it sounds like I get the impression at least

1481
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,800
he's done his homework.

1482
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,240
He really does sound like he's curious

1483
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,880
and wants to use it.

1484
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,200
Yeah.

1485
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,880
He's dug in before.

1486
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,240
This is actually like probably his third update.

1487
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,640
That's, you know, impressive.

1488
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,440
My favorite one was when he first started

1489
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,280
really getting into, started doing it.

1490
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,400
It was an episode where he talked about Linux Mint

1491
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,840
when he was using it and he was talking about

1492
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,360
how Cinnamon was great and he was showing,

1493
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,280
this was really early on before he realized

1494
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,600
there was, you know, the security issues.

1495
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,960
But he was looking at it and saying like,

1496
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,600
this is great and the best part about when he was doing it

1497
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,840
is that he was showing Paul Therot on Windows Weekly.

1498
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,680
Nice.

1499
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,280
There you go.

1500
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,360
There you go.

1501
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,200
So props to Mr. Laporte.

1502
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,640
Now, Mr. Laporte, if you want to stop taking advice

1503
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,320
from your chat room and would like to learn more,

1504
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,480
I invite you to go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

1505
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,560
Be the real expert.

1506
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,960
Maybe you should tweet that to Leo.

1507
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,760
Leo, take your Linux skills,

1508
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,080
which apparently he's got some,

1509
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,560
and take them to the next level, right?

1510
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,280
I bet that next website could run on a system

1511
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,880
built by Leo Laporte if he goes over

1512
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,680
to linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

1513
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,800
Leo, they've got 2,364 video courses that you could take.

1514
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,320
I'm talking good stuff with downloadable,

1515
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,800
comprehensive study guides.

1516
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,720
You can take that and listen to it in the shower, Leo,

1517
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,800
which is really, according to my audience,

1518
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,960
the best time to do it.

1519
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,280
Scenario-based labs put you with hands-on experience

1520
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,480
in an environment just like the real world,

1521
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,960
so that way you walk away with real-world experience,

1522
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,560
and that would really help inform

1523
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,120
your commentary on the subject.

1524
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,520
Instructor mentoring is available,

1525
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,760
which if you think about it,

1526
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,360
from some of the competitors out there,

1527
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,120
not even really a serious offering,

1528
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,720
and they have instructor mentoring.

1529
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,040
Live streams, too, where you can do Q&A.

1530
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,640
A community that is stacked full

1531
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,880
of Jupiter Broadcasting members.

1532
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,280
Graded server exercises give you grades in real time.

1533
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,480
The entire Red Hat course,

1534
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,840
well, most of the Red Hat,

1535
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,000
and they're working on more all the time.

1536
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,240
Yes, they are. It is really cool.

1537
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,560
And I just recently heard from them

1538
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,560
that the OpenStack stuff is blowing up right now for them.

1539
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,360
The courseware is on OpenStack. Blowing up!

1540
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,600
Really, some of the best Amazon Web Service courseware, too.

1541
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,160
Now, that is legit. You should check that out.

1542
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,680
They are blowing the doors off of that.

1543
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,120
And if you want to go investigate

1544
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,160
that dark, murky world of DevOps,

1545
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,200
well, guess what? Linux Academy has courseware on that as well.

1546
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,520
They have a really cool system as well if you're busy.

1547
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,920
Say you're like Leo and you're recording

1548
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,520
like a dozen podcasts a week and you're on the air all the time.

1549
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,560
You don't have a lot of time to do all these courses.

1550
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,360
I understand that. Shoot, I'm busy, too, son.

1551
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,560
You know how many kids I got, Wes?

1552
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,920
Three.

1553
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,240
Yeah, Wes. That's a lot of kids.

1554
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,160
That's a lot of kids. Not enough time for Linux.

1555
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,160
No. So you know what I do?

1556
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,640
I use their availability planner to customize my coursework.

1557
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,840
Nice. I know. It is real nice.

1558
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,320
And plus, with their practice exams,

1559
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,560
I can feel like I can go in there and try something

1560
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,360
and make sure I got it right, which is good for me

1561
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,440
because I got that test anxiety.

1562
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,680
You know, except for an STD test because I don't feel like...

1563
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,800
Then you need to know.

1564
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,360
Yeah. And I don't feel like that's like a cue.

1565
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,480
That's not like when I got to get the question right or wrong.

1566
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,120
I should be pretty solid. They judge you either way.

1567
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,400
But I just, you know, they just prick me and it's done.

1568
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,920
But with this where I got to answer questions,

1569
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,640
I need a practice exam.

1570
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,880
Maybe I need...anyways.

1571
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,480
Enhanced learning plans are also available,

1572
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,720
which are really great because you can get a detailed learning plan

1573
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,600
with reminders and daily assignments, labs,

1574
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,640
quizzes that are doing things like that.

1575
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,080
It's a really awesome place built by people

1576
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:00,120
who are crazy passionate about Linux, linuxacademy.com.

1577
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,520
Go check them out, linuxacademy.com, slash, Unplugged,

1578
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,040
to save some money and support this here show.

1579
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:10,840
Okay. Odyssey Wester is going to be at Linux Fest Northwest to see who else.

1580
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,000
Blaster, are you still in there?

1581
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,720
Blaster is going to be at Linux Fest Northwest.

1582
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,200
Blaster gets here on Tuesday evening, actually.

1583
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,000
Oh, sweet.

1584
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,840
Yeah. So you're going to just have missed him

1585
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,640
because, yeah, he'll be in here after the show.

1586
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,440
Anybody else that I've missed that's going to be at Linux Fest Northwest

1587
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,440
in the Mamba Room? Hammer, you're in there.

1588
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,480
I'm going to be there.

1589
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,680
Who's that? Who's this?

1590
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,280
Richard.

1591
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,440
Oh, Richard, you're going to be there.

1592
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:31,920
Oh, great. Cool.

1593
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,520
Well, you should stop by the booth and say hi.

1594
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,640
That'd be really cool.

1595
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,640
Oh, I plan to.

1596
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,400
Oh, good. Good.

1597
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,040
And if you guys have Sousa beer koozies,

1598
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,000
you should bring one of those with you.

1599
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,720
Or bring one for Wes because he doesn't have one.

1600
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,880
I have one. But if you have them this year.

1601
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,720
Anybody else in the Mamba Room going to make it to Linux Fest?

1602
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,440
That's sad.

1603
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,680
If the network was crazy rich, I'd just like,

1604
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,880
you're all coming. That'd be so fun.

1605
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,800
Well, if you're going to make it.

1606
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,400
If North Ranger wins the lotto.

1607
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,920
Right. Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

1608
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,840
If you're going to make it, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

1609
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,240
and you'll find the event there.

1610
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,440
I have it linked directly in the show notes.

1611
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,160
Oh, I should sign up right now.

1612
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,840
That'd be cool. That'd be cool.

1613
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,760
This is where I think we'll eventually coordinate some of our game plan,

1614
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,640
which I'm a little hesitant because Emma could technically just sign up herself

1615
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,840
and then get access to everything.

1616
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,680
Don't tell her.

1617
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,000
I'm sure she's thought of that.

1618
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,920
Aye, she's smart, yeah.

1619
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,680
Yeah, so I don't know exactly, but I feel like at the same time,

1620
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,200
we have to do in a way that is approachable to the audience.

1621
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,800
You know, this is a real conundrum for me.

1622
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,120
My need for absolutely dominating this contest is interfering with my need

1623
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,280
to share with the audience of where to be at.

1624
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,280
You see what I mean?

1625
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,000
I do. Yeah. Yeah.

1626
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,200
But anyways, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting,

1627
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,400
at least this is the starting point.

1628
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,520
And then maybe once we'll...

1629
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,800
I got it.

1630
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,720
We use this to coordinate the in-person meetup place

1631
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,240
and then from then on, everything's in person.

1632
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,760
Right. Then you can tell if she's there or not.

1633
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,880
Yeah, that's how we're going to do it.

1634
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,880
Just don't tell her the secrets.

1635
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,360
There you go.

1636
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,920
And plus, you know, you could also, if you're just going to make it to Linux Fest,

1637
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,440
even if you're not going to make it for anything else,

1638
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,280
if you're just going to go there, let us know.

1639
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,640
I know more than 22 of you are going because here's a funny thing

1640
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,120
that the audience always does to me.

1641
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,400
It's a nice joke they play on Chris and it's super funny

1642
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,760
because it happens every year.

1643
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,440
30, 40, 50, 60 people will sign up for the meetup page.

1644
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,000
500 people will come and shake my hand.

1645
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,240
So where were the rest of you?

1646
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,240
Why didn't the rest of you...

1647
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,480
Now, I know you're busy.

1648
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,280
I understand.

1649
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,880
But seriously, like...

1650
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,760
He's very friendly.

1651
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,320
I do this every year and like 60, 70 people sign up on the meetup page

1652
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,960
and we're like, oh, we're going to have 60 or 70 people.

1653
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,360
So we get like, you know, a hundred things of a swag item just in case.

1654
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,040
Right.

1655
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,880
And then 500 people show up and it's like, OK, all right.

1656
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,640
Nice.

1657
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:45,480
And literally last year, it might have literally been a thousand people.

1658
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,160
And I don't know how many people it was anyways.

1659
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,680
My point is, if you could take a moment out of your busy day

1660
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,200
and go over to meetup.com as you put a broadcasting.

1661
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,320
Let us know that we're going to see you.

1662
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,520
Yeah, I'd like to know.

1663
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,480
It'd be nice.

1664
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,800
I'm not trying to give you a hard time here, but I'm just saying it'd be nice.

1665
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,360
So in preparation for Linux Fest Northwest,

1666
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,800
we're going to go pick up Mr. Ham Radio.

1667
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,400
And I'm kind of I'm looking forward to this because it's been a little while

1668
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,640
since I got to spend any time at all in Idaho.

1669
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,440
And so nice ham radio here, who is often in the Mamba room with us.

1670
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,080
He's often in the chat room as well.

1671
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:25,320
He he is one of our newer editors.

1672
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,160
And he kind of does some of the extra stuff you guys will be seen in the future,

1673
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,360
some stuff you've seen in the past, and he's going to help us

1674
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,800
and Rekai go through a lot of our footage from Linux Fest.

1675
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,280
And so we're in the chat room right now.

1676
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,840
And so, yeah, like Blaster just said,

1677
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,640
Operation Ham Holland will take place very soon.

1678
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,040
We're going to Noah and I and my lady got the ham.

1679
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,960
Oh, that's a really great idea, actually, and bring it with us.

1680
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,600
So Noah is going to arrive next Saturday.

1681
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,880
Yeah, probably late in the night.

1682
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,520
He's going to stay up.

1683
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,240
Probably do that thing he always does where he travels,

1684
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,920
where he stays up for 24 hours like a jerk.

1685
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,440
Oh, fun.

1686
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,360
Yeah, he likes to do that.

1687
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,280
But then, you know, the nice thing is he gets to go here's his logic is then

1688
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,720
he gets to sleep in a hotel room where he has where there's no kids.

1689
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,640
It's just him.

1690
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,440
And he just sleeps like he's never slept in like close the blinds.

1691
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,200
Yeah, he's out, too.

1692
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,440
So he actually has a he actually has a bit of a plan there.

1693
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,960
But he's going to fly in super late Saturday.

1694
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,480
Next Sunday is a big episode for the Linux action.

1695
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,080
He'll be in.

1696
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:24,360
Not only will he be in studio, which means I might need rotten.

1697
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:28,120
I don't know if we need to think about frame changes for that or not.

1698
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,760
We might.

1699
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,920
He's going to be in studio and we're going to do a very special episode of Linux

1700
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,280
action show.

1701
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,800
And then after that episode jumping in Lady Jupiter and we're driving over to

1702
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,280
Idaho to go pick up Ham would be a couple day trip.

1703
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,720
Going to get back late Monday.

1704
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,040
Hopefully be able to do tech talk today on Tuesday morning and then we'll have

1705
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:53,840
Noah here in studio for Linux unplugged on next Tuesday and Ham will be around

1706
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,760
as well.

1707
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,040
So I thought, boy, wouldn't it be nice if on our on our when Noah and I head off

1708
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:03,040
to go pick up Ham if people could watch our progress like last time at

1709
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,920
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash Rover.

1710
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,360
So I have been talking about for a while setting up a track car server.

1711
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,880
And so I did just that.

1712
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:15,640
I went I went and I downloaded track car T R A C car dot org and they have

1713
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:21,400
downloads for Windows and Linux and even Linux arm and the Mac.

1714
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,080
And the installation West is it's pretty interesting.

1715
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,280
It's not your typical Linux software installation.

1716
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,400
When you download it you download their zip file.

1717
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,080
Right.

1718
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:35,120
And you need to have you need to have open JD key said I have for mine at

1719
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,120
least I don't know what you need.

1720
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,360
I don't want to tell you for what I did tell you what to do.

1721
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:44,000
I installed open JDK seven Jerry headless.

1722
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,240
That's the package on Ubuntu.

1723
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:49,320
I have it in the show notes and then I installed unzip.

1724
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:53,760
I unzip the package and then you run like they just have a little dot run

1725
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,520
file little script.

1726
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,400
So you run the track card at run file and it just goes off right in all of

1727
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,400
your file system.

1728
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,960
You know.

1729
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:06,400
Oh you got a package manager screw you screw you and your package manager.

1730
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,000
Let me just put the oh I see you have you have an old style in it system.

1731
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,520
Let me stuff these right here.

1732
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,080
I'll stuff these in your net system.

1733
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,440
Oh good you have an op directory.

1734
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,280
Well I'm think thanks for running me as root.

1735
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:20,320
I'll go right on my stuff to your to your op directory.

1736
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,080
And then if you don't have of course because it's not using your package

1737
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:27,360
manager if you don't have the Java packages installed there's no air right.

1738
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,520
Well no no no air until you try to start the day man and by and their website

1739
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,000
instructions tell you to just reboot your machine like I'm going to reboot my

1740
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,520
entire server so that way I can start your day man which you don't need to do

1741
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,520
that.

1742
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,920
There is a day man in just your op directory you can just go run it

1743
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,480
yourself and then it creates it creates a website for you with really poor

1744
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,360
security that you can access from any computer in the world.

1745
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,360
Show us Chris.

1746
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,360
I will.

1747
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,960
Because why not Wes because who cares about security.

1748
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:03,760
So right now I have it running on my digital ocean droplet and I have a

1749
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,720
car called L.J. tracker for lady jubes and it's running on my Internet phone

1750
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,760
six and you can see I can zoom in right here and it's right here in the studio

1751
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,080
and here's that.

1752
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,080
So here's the Internet phone West.

1753
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:19,920
I'll just show you the UI so you can see it and it's kind of neat because it

1754
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,560
keeps a log of when it's pinged to see on the phone here.

1755
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,200
It keeps a log of when it's pinged the server.

1756
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,200
Oh neat.

1757
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,740
And the settings to set it up are.

1758
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,000
That's all you have to do.

1759
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,400
It's like five lines you fill in.

1760
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,400
Beautiful.

1761
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,400
That's beautiful.

1762
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,400
Thank you.

1763
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,400
All right.

1764
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,960
So I so that just runs now in the background on the Internet phone and it

1765
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,720
updates the track car server which is really a job app and you can add as many

1766
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,860
devices you want and you can have as many users as you want with their own

1767
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:47,860
device list.

1768
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:48,860
Oh wow.

1769
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:51,280
And you can set some server defaults a couple of things I really like about it

1770
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,880
right off the bat is by default can keep track of everyone at Linux fest your

1771
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,720
crew make sure you know right where they could.

1772
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,440
Yeah if we will actually we could if we wanted to do that which may be helpful

1773
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,400
for people get lost but one of the things I like right off the bat is it's

1774
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,800
using open street maps for the for the map and at least in my area the open

1775
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,800
street map stuff is just real beautiful well labeled.

1776
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,800
It looks nice.

1777
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,800
Yeah it really does.

1778
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,320
Wes and the other thing is you can.

1779
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,320
This has this.

1780
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:21,400
This has a server API so you could also overlay it with Bing Maps or Google

1781
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,560
Maps or whatever you want if you prefer those and their satellite data or

1782
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:25,560
something like that.

1783
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,520
It gives me extremely accurate longitude and latitude positioning.

1784
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,320
So yes that is the longitude and latitude of the studio.

1785
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,760
Yes that is public information.

1786
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:37,240
I know it's on the stream right now and it tells you how fast the tracking

1787
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:41,660
device is moving which right now is zero miles per hour and it gives you the

1788
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,480
address there but that's actually that's funny that's actually not the address

1789
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,820
of the studio the I would imagine the longitude latitude coordinates are

1790
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:51,160
correct but that is that is not actually the address of the studio but that

1791
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,160
would just be open.

1792
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,480
That's just its guess based on the open street map data.

1793
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,120
Now here's something that I'm majorly bummed about because all of that's

1794
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,360
really cool and it took me about you know 30 minutes to get it all set up and

1795
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,660
it works for Android too you don't have to have an internet phone from

1796
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,660
Apple.

1797
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:06,660
Nice.

1798
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,660
Yeah.

1799
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:12,720
Here's the major bummer and I just did not expect this.

1800
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,720
They don't have any facility for embedding the map in your own web page.

1801
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,720
No easy link.

1802
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,720
No.

1803
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:23,040
As Popey knows is like the entire intention of why I'm doing this and he

1804
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,480
had he wrote you see he did it correctly as he wrote his own because he's so

1805
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,520
fancy with it with the Ubuntu touch over there right and I just wanted I wanted

1806
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,140
to use track car because it just seemed like a nice easy straightforward

1807
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,140
solution.

1808
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,600
Someone's already done the hard work for you.

1809
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:41,040
Yeah and so doing a little research I've discovered there is a way to I guess

1810
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,800
and I don't really understand how this works but you can embed a Google map on

1811
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:49,560
your own website and then you can overlay data on top of it okay and the

1812
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:55,200
track car server can act as that API source for the data my track car server

1813
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:00,780
has an API now and if I knew how to embed a Google map and overlay data from

1814
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,440
an external API I could embed that on the Jupiter broadcasting comm slash

1815
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:08,040
rover page okay so do it basically I'm gonna punt that to the audience to know

1816
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,760
if anybody knows what the hell I'm talking about and you know how to do that

1817
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:16,940
I would please let me know telegram me at Chris LAS on telegram I can't

1818
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:21,760
telegram you because one of you bastards trolled my account but you can tell me

1819
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,440
and then if you I think if you telegram me like I knew I wanted to say something

1820
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,320
to wimpy like a couple of weeks ago like super bad I wanted to relay something to

1821
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,160
wimpy and I can't I can't message him I can only I can only message wimpy when

1822
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,320
he messages me first and then I can reply to wimpy but I can't met I can't

1823
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:41,800
initiate the conversation I totally yeah yeah it does suck it does really suck

1824
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,920
because I had something I really wanted to tell you but not and I've completely

1825
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:49,280
forgotten what it was now but my point is if you know let me let me know either

1826
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,200
hit me up in the chat room or actually ping Rekai in the chat room if you're

1827
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,400
gonna do it via the IRC or hit me up on telegram because I'm just because of

1828
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,080
everything that's going on Twitter would actually be fine too but I'm not checking

1829
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,560
email very much for the next few days because I'm running around like crazy I

1830
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:08,080
would love to get that set up those who people could watch and then because I've

1831
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,520
wanted what I've been using in the meantime is a proprietary solution that

1832
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,400
uses a dedicated piece of hardware and a monthly service fee that's a couple

1833
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,120
hundred dollars for like three months or something like that there's no open

1834
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:22,480
source anywhere no and I want every component of lady Jupiter to be as open

1835
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,520
source as possible and I've even to some extent had to put things in and roll them

1836
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,480
back to try to accomplish that and then eventually I mean this is like it

1837
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,900
probably a 2017 thing but eventually I'd love to do an episode on a fully you

1838
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:39,640
know open source setup that I've set up and I feel like this I shouldn't open

1839
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,560
rover I should write and I shouldn't implement anything that isn't open source

1840
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:49,040
today if I'm trying to get it all right so I bought this thing this tracker for

1841
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,780
the first road trip and then it because I'd prepaid for the service at all and I

1842
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,520
knew this at the time it also covered the scale road trip so that worked out

1843
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,440
perfectly so I just used the same proprietary thingy because I had paid

1844
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:03,760
for the service but now my service is done and it's like it's like several

1845
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,560
hundred dollars if you guys want it's silver cloud tracker if you're

1846
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,640
interested if you want the thing that was appealing to me is it's a dedicated

1847
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,400
hardware device you know and then you can embed their web app and they had

1848
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,880
really pretty decent support too anyways but now I'm done with that and I'd

1849
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:24,080
rather just have an app that runs on the background on my phone and and then just

1850
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,000
have something I could embed on the website so if you have any any idea on

1851
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,360
how the hell I could actually accomplish that just just let me know and and

1852
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,320
blaster and ham radio I got good news for you guys while you guys are out here

1853
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:38,040
we're gonna have a big turkey feed what yeah we did Thanksgiving for Dylan's

1854
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:42,680
birthday last week because that's his favorite meal and so we and I just got

1855
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:47,720
this huge turkey because we had a whole bunch of people over but people snacked

1856
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:51,880
and stuff so there's a whole bunch of turkey leftover and we're gonna have

1857
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,040
like turkey enchiladas we're gonna have all kinds of stuff while the crews out

1858
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,620
here so yeah we're gonna have a good time when everybody's out here and I'll

1859
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,640
be on the road and hopefully you guys have built a track that so if you tune

1860
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:06,040
it for next week's unplugged it should be quite the show I would I would try to

1861
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:09,140
catch that one lives probably gonna be a lot of shenanigans going on in the

1862
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,880
studio that day it'll probably simmer down by the time the show's on the air

1863
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,980
but if you could make a live next week would be a good when you go to Jupiter

1864
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:18,640
broadcasting comm slash calendar for your lifetime but I got I got a feeling

1865
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,160
like what I'll probably do is I'll probably jump out for a little bit for

1866
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:26,320
like a segment or two and let Noah sit in or something you know we can rotate

1867
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,900
out or something I know we'll figure it out we can tag team we'll tag team the

1868
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:34,240
hosting or something like that yeah all right guys is it any mumble room is

1869
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,800
there anything else from the virtual lug we want to cover before we wrap up on

1870
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,520
this week's episode of the unplugged program I turn over you guys for one a

1871
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:45,080
two a three no that's how many licks it takes to get to the center of the

1872
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:50,200
unplugged lollipop you ever seen that commercial oh yeah all right

1873
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:54,840
all right so I'm really I'm really looking forward to next week I'm super

1874
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,960
excited Sunday's a big show I hope you guys can catch Sunday's episode of the

1875
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,600
Linux action show if you're turning in live on Thursday we got the double tech

1876
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,040
snaps coming up a lots going on it's crazy and it's a lot a lot of good

1877
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,400
content even if you can't make it in these events it's we're gonna make them

1878
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:12,360
we're gonna put the very best stuff I want anything but JB it's crazy West

1879
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,680
there's not time no time no no all right you were broadcasting comm slash calendar

1880
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,280
for our lifetimes Linux action show dot reddit comm for feedback Jupiter

1881
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,720
broadcasting comm slash contact for email and we'll see you right back here

1882
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:43,680
next Tuesday

1883
01:11:52,720 --> 01:12:22,500
And with that, I say get it out of here.

1884
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,500
Because that is the end of the show.

1885
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,500
All right.

1886
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,500
Thank you, Mumbroom.

1887
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:26,500
Yeah, guys.

1888
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,500
You're welcome.

1889
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,500
Thank you.

1890
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,500
You're welcome.

1893
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:38,880
Wimpy, your Mate edition of the Ubuntu distribution, I'm not sure if you're familiar with this,

1894
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,880
but this is-

1895
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,580
Something you've been doing for a while now.

1896
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,800
The hype is strong with the 16.04 release.

1897
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,880
I can't believe how many websites I'm seeing right about it.

1898
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:55,700
Probably from basically Network World, Matt, you got Softpedia, you got-

1899
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,700
Network World?

1900
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:57,700
Yeah.

1901
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,460
Or maybe it was PC World, maybe?

1902
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,460
One of them.

1903
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,460
Somebody wrote some from-

1904
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,460
Oh, okay.

1905
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,460
I'll miss that one.

1906
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:04,460
I know.

1907
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:07,620
I blare all the World ones together, but I tell you what.

1908
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:08,620
The-

1909
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:09,620
It's awesome.

1910
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,620
Yeah.

1911
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:16,700
It's like, I mean, I almost wonder if it's overshadowing the other main release.

1912
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:22,300
I think the reason it gets so much hype is because, really, in my experience of actually

1913
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:29,820
using Ubuntu Mate, it really feels like what Ubuntu should have been had it stuck with

1914
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:30,980
its original path.

1915
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:31,980
All right, all right.

1916
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:36,260
But what about handy Linux, right?

1917
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:37,260
The distro that gives you-

1918
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,260
Get handy with handy Linux.

1919
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,260
Yeah, get handy with-

1920
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:43,180
Okay, so it's a Debian without the headaches, right?

1921
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:47,460
Based on Debian GNU slash Linux, you heard of that, lightweight and stable XFC desktop

1922
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:48,460
environment.

1923
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:52,180
Handy Linux is safe, convenient, and free of charge.

1924
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,940
Now that's a distro with a name.

1925
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:55,940
That's a brand right there.

1926
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:56,940
Yes, it is.

1927
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,140
And look, it even has a hand as its logo.

1928
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:05,900
Yeah, I was reading today on Google Plus that the Fedora project is working on it, and I

1929
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,580
guess there's just certain syscalls that maybe aren't even implemented yet.

1930
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:14,300
So it might be a more narrow range that the Ubuntu user line is using than we suspected.

1931
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:18,260
So it sounds like OpenSUSE guys are thinking about it, but it's like a trial and error

1932
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:19,260
stage right now.

1933
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,820
So no art show in there yet?

1934
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:23,980
Yeah, because I'm wondering, like, who's the next distro?

1935
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:27,700
You know it's going to be some distro that's going to be the one that announces, we got

1936
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,900
it running on the Windows Linux subsystem.

1937
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,620
Well, if there's some choice, I'll be more excited to try it.

1938
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:37,020
We've been able to retask the build service to basically pump out what should be viable

1939
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:41,660
images because we have similar use cases we've already been playing with for that.

1940
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:45,660
So like, dump out an OpenSUSE user space, we build our docker images that way, all that

1941
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:46,660
kind of stuff.

1942
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:47,660
Ah, yeah, brilliant.

1943
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,660
Yeah.

1944
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:49,660
Yeah.

1945
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:50,980
So that's been the final easy part.

1946
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:56,180
So yeah, it's just figuring out those syscalls and poking around those parts.

1947
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:58,020
I would like to see it.

1948
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:03,020
The same stage as Fedora, but we've managed to get bits and pieces of Tumbleweed and bits

1949
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,420
of pieces of Gleap on that.

1950
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:05,420
Huh.

1951
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:06,420
Well, that's a start.

1952
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,420
That's exciting.

1953
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,420
That's great.

1954
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,420
Yeah, that'll be fun.

1955
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:13,220
That could be like, I don't know, like, the next time I ever have to install Windows 10,

1956
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,420
that might be something I'd like to play with it.

1957
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,420
Right.

1958
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:18,420
So you got a while.

1959
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,420
WinArch 10.

1960
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,700
I kind of wonder if it'll be Arch, but see, I don't think so.

1961
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:26,720
I think this is probably not going to be Arch's strong suit unless a really savvy developer

1962
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,900
out there does it for the distro, right?

1963
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:34,340
But see, some of the more structured distros sort of have an advantage here, I should think.

1964
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:40,420
Yeah, you need a way of getting your root file system deployed on there.

1965
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,420
Yeah.

1966
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:42,420
Yeah.

1967
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,420
Well, you see-

1968
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,420
What is an Arch root file system?

1969
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:50,300
You see examples of people reloading DigitalOcean droplets to different distributions while

1970
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,300
it's loaded.

1971
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,300
Right.

1972
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,300
The BSD guys on BSD now have talked about doing that too, swapping between BSDs.

1973
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,980
They could learn about Linux too.

1974
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,740
And so you wonder if it could be done from within.

1975
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:02,700
In fact, you almost would have to do it from within the Ubuntu environment, is sort of

1976
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:03,700
replace it from within.

1977
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,900
Package your own Windows app.

1978
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,140
Well, because you can't get into the App Store.

1979
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:11,580
And when you install the subsystem, I believe it pulls it down as soon as you try to run

1980
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:12,580
it or something.

1981
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:14,740
It's not really coming from an App Store.

1982
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:19,660
It says it is, but it's lying and coming from a plain old website.

1983
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:20,660
So you can man in the middle of that.

1984
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,660
Yeah, just on an Azure server.

1985
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,420
You can man in the middle of that, no problem.

1986
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:25,420
That's true.

1987
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,420
Oh, that's a good point.

1988
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:28,540
You could just do a little DNS trick or something.

1989
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,420
Add this line to your host file.

1990
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,420
That's what I've guys did, yeah.

1991
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:34,420
Blaster.

1992
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:37,900
If I could just inject for a moment, what you've been referring to as Windows NT is

1993
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:38,900
actually GNU-slash-Windows-NT.

1994
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:39,900
Very good, sir.

1995
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:40,900
Very good.

1996
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,900
I've been corrected.

1997
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:42,900
Windows NT.

1998
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:49,140
Yeah, that's an interesting point.

1999
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,860
You can fire up Yast from some pretty peculiar angles.

2000
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:57,420
I did that before with some host.

2001
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:01,980
It wasn't DigitalOcean, but yeah, they didn't provide an open SUSE image, so I took their

2002
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:05,060
Debian image, hacked around with it, grew up without it, booted into Yast and nothing

2003
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,060
else.

2004
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,060
Yeah.

2005
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,060
That's good.

2006
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:14,300
I'm sure it's been said a number of times, but isn't it amazing how much of a proof

2007
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:20,260
this is that Linux has won when the Linux API system is used in Linux, it's used in

2008
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:23,860
VSD, and now it's used in Windows.

2009
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:26,700
It's kind of like the universal app platform.

2010
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,380
Yeah, I think so.

2011
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:34,380
That or it makes it extremely easy for its competitors to integrate, embrace, and extend.

2012
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,380
I don't know.

2013
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:36,380
Come on, glass half full, Chris.

2014
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,380
You're right.

2015
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,380
You're right.

2016
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:43,660
I don't think I know anyone who's tried it yet.

2017
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:48,300
Actually I've installed the Ubuntu bash on Windows 10 to try it out.

2018
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,620
How'd that go?

2019
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:54,900
Well, I installed Clang and built a C binary just to try it out.

2020
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:55,900
It actually worked.

2021
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:56,900
Pretty sweet.

2022
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:04,460
I can update and upgrade, not dist-upgrade, but just upgrade.

2023
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:07,220
And is it a 15.10 environment?

2024
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:10,500
No, 14.04 at the moment.

2025
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,060
Oh, right, right, right, right.

2026
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:16,180
And so will you be doing a dist-upgrade to go to 16.04?

2027
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:17,180
How does that work?

2028
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:18,180
I'll give it a shot.

2029
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:22,620
I'm not messing around with it too much because, you know.

2030
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:29,300
Well, okay, I had to kind of use the latest snapshot image in order to actually update

2031
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:35,140
the Windows 10 laptop that I've got because it just didn't want to do the upgrade to the

2032
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:36,380
actual build.

2033
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:41,980
So I just kind of overrode it to get the bash on Windows thing.

2034
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,700
So it actually does work.

2035
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:47,940
I've upgraded, just tried a few binaries or at least compiling a few things.

2036
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:52,740
I haven't done too much beyond that, but it works apparently.

2037
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:57,660
I'm getting really, you know, for me personally, I just couldn't care less about Windows 10

2038
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,660
in so many ways.

2039
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,460
It's still, it's so Windows still.

2040
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:01,460
It doesn't matter.

2041
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,900
You know, I was thinking about this recently.

2042
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:09,580
Microsoft will have truly changed when they have one version of Windows for all systems.

2043
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:13,460
If you want to run it on a server, you want to run it on a desktop, they don't have enterprise

2044
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:17,500
and data center because look at the way the market's going.

2045
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:20,900
Microsoft, when they started as a company, they were one of the first companies to figure

2046
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:25,500
out you could take the same exact code and if you're just a smart enough business major,

2047
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:29,580
you could sell that same code to people who will pay $3,000 for it because they're in

2048
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:33,060
a business and they depend on it and you can sell it to people who will pay $100 for it

2049
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,640
because they're a consumer and they don't require it as much and it's the same damn

2050
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,740
stuff with artificial limitations.

2051
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,780
And they were some of the people that just brilliantly made obviously a lot of money

2052
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:43,780
off that.

2053
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:50,180
And now they are in an era where things are in the cloud and those kinds of little divisions

2054
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:56,220
and things are on mobile and that little artificial limitation seems trivial and obvious now.

2055
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:58,340
And the rest of the world has realized it.

2056
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:01,140
Apple realized it for God's sakes before Microsoft did.

2057
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:05,820
And Apple is the company that charged their beta users to do upgrades originally and then

2058
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:08,180
Steve Jobs came out and claimed, well, we have to do it.

2059
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,180
It's an accounting rule.

2060
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,180
We have to charge you.

2061
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,420
And then two years later, they dropped the charging.

2062
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:15,500
So Apple figures it out before Microsoft does.

2063
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,680
And so Microsoft is still trying to sell this differentiator product.

2064
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,580
But you know, at the end of the day, it's still the same crap product.

2065
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:22,860
I have a close family member.

2066
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,700
I didn't even know this.

2067
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:29,660
I'm actually very sort of upset about it.

2068
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:33,860
Their parent went out and bought them a Windows 10 laptop at Best Buy.

2069
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:34,860
And they're all excited.

2070
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:38,460
They came over for Dylan's birthday party and they're like, hey, Chris, look, it's my

2071
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,460
laptop.

2072
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,300
It's got the new Windows 10 on it.

2073
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:42,660
Isn't that great?

2074
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:44,220
It's got the new Windows 10.

2075
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:46,640
I'm like, wow, they really got sold.

2076
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,780
So how's it been going?

2077
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:52,300
And so Dylan, you know, he brings down his elementary OS Sputnik and he fires it up.

2078
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:55,020
And you know, this is the same exact install that Dylan's had since I gave it to him for

2079
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,020
his last birthday.

2080
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,900
So it's now over a year old.

2081
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,780
And he fires up Minecraft and he's got all his mods installed.

2082
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,780
He's like, come on, let's play.

2083
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:04,700
And he's like, oh, I can't.

2084
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,700
And Dylan's like, why not?

2085
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:09,860
Well, I got a virus a few days ago and we took it in a geek squad to replace it.

2086
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:12,820
And they had to format my computer and they lost all my worlds.

2087
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:15,380
And we haven't been able to get Minecraft reinstalled since then.

2088
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:19,220
But I got a geek squad shirt.

2089
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:20,220
It's the same.

2090
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,220
Wow.

2091
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:41,600
And it looks just like the round reflect, but they actually add it for the game as

2092
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,700
well.

2093
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:46,860
I just love this thing.

2094
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,960
It looks pretty cool.
