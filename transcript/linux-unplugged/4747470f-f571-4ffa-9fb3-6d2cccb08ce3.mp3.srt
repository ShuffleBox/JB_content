1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Kind of funny this week. I was I was at a bar having a beer

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,920
You know like one like one does occasionally mm-hmm as a responsible adult. I'll pretend

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,400
And I was talking I talked with the very nice guy there. He just drops this bomb on me I

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,120
Grew up in a Linux household

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,680
Was like how is how is someone that I've never met saying this to me. I'm not at a Linux conference

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,460
I'm not in a Linux users. Well. You've got that look apparently look yeah

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,320
Well, he was asking me like I'm in there a lot like I'll just you know be working on something or show notes or whatever

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,600
You probably sell up over your shoulder. He may have yeah anyway

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,760
It turns out he didn't he doesn't use Linux currently

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,720
But I guess one of his parents was in the IT field so when he was growing up

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,400
They switched the whole he told me some stories about like he spelled play Diablo 2 which he liked a lot and then they switched

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,840
The whole house over to Linux, and he couldn't do that anymore, but he got into it

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,800
I guess at one time he was like a regular contributor on some Ubuntu forums

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,600
It was just funny because I had brought back a whole like a whole life ago for him

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,640
He didn't do any of it now totally had different interests

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,600
But yeah, I do think he did say he had some live CDs here live USBs

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,400
He carried around and I was encouraging him. He was curious about hey

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,080
You know what are the what distros might have not heard of that sort of stuff?

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,280
He was actually really interested in solace especially when I told him it wasn't you know it wasn't just a new derivative

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,360
It was its own first-rate distro

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,480
Yeah, so maybe there's a new solace convert out there next time if I see him again. I'll have to ask

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,560
This is a Linux unplugged episode

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,800
206 for July 18th

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
2017

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,000
Welcome to the Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,240
My name is Wes and joining me this week. Oh my it is an oh so special guest

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,400
Oh guys who is that the one the only the beardiest it's our friends Rekai the editor who keeps

28
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,040
everything going around here

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,200
Welcome to today's episode. We've got a you know. It's a special show anytime Chris is away. We've we've convinced him to take a vacation

30
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,400
Finally yeah out of the house out of the studio

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,960
We get to play do whatever we want so you know the show probably be a little bit different

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,900
But I think it's gonna be a lot of fun. We've got we've got some complicated things explained well obviously

33
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,440
I've been convinced that this is a good thing by my bomb the tech snap program by

34
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,000
Deep dive master Dan over there, so we've got some highlights of just some things. I think around the web that

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,720
There's a lot of complicated things that are hard to explain. It's always a great thing when they're explained

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,280
They're explained really well. We're not gonna go as deep as you know it will not be a dandy dive

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,400
Don't worry. We don't want to put them out of a job. We won't even talk about let's encrypt

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
So you just it's fine. It's fine

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
But it should be fun after that we've just got some updates from some of our favorite

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,720
Favorite projects around the web and maybe not so favorites

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,480
But they you know they deserve updates to plus. There's you know as always a couple news a new things to highlight

42
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,760
Enrique, I found a very interesting handheld

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,800
Project over on Indiegogo that it's not every day that I think one of these is actually interesting or that it might happen or that

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
It's worth talking about but

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This one seems kind of unique and had some had some interesting things going for it that hey like maybe some new AMD

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,440
technology

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,440
I like the sounds of that

48
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,400
and after that of course because I'm hosting we're gonna talk about containers and

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,600
about the evolution of containers and how they've gotten a little bit more friendly a little bit more confusing and oh

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
So many more daemons

51
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,040
Plus there's some birthdays for our some of our favorite distros or not so favorites. We'll kind of talk about what does that mean?

52
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,560
What does it mean to be a distro in today's in today's world and what should you reflect on on these birthdays?

53
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,040
And if we have time I'm gonna pick the beards brain about some Linux gaming and maybe some not so

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,960
Linux gaming but before we get there

55
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:59,160
We should really bring in our good friends the people who make this show possible time appropriate greetings mobile room

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,640
Oh, hey guys, I didn't even see you there. I know they were just hiding there in the corner this whole

57
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,380
Time and boy aren't we glad?

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,480
To have them you are you guys how you guys how do you feel about a beard on the show?

59
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,480
I'm pretty stoked about it

60
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Not bad awesome

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,880
Yeah, see there you go nice a warm welcome for his beardiness the beard

62
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,080
Okay, so first up today in our new category probably one time only but complicated things

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,080
Explained well, we've got a real-world guide to web

64
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,200
RTC

65
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:44,160
Talking directly from browser to browser sign me up web RTC just makes so much sense and lets you do many awesome new things

66
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,720
That simply weren't possible before anyway, that's the promise of web RTC

67
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,900
I mean we've certainly played with a lot here at the studio

68
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,740
It kind of promises to be that thing where you don't have to I don't have to super learn all of the ins and outs

69
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,980
of VoIP and SIP and all of that or have an ISDN line between

70
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,020
Studios do they have the part where they explain why it doesn't work half the time. Yes, so

71
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:12,580
That's where the real world aspect comes into this and looking at some of the discussions over it, you know people talking about this

72
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,340
I think that's the key is that web RTC has been talked a lot about how easy it is how simple it is to get started

73
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,820
distributed peer-to-peer all those things but

74
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,460
There's a lot that has to go on there's a lot that has to get right and it turns out yes peer-to-peer is important

75
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,260
But you also still need a server

76
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,740
And there's a lot of things you have to get right things like stun and turn and NAT busting and all those things just to

77
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:41,300
Get two browsers to talk to each other in a way that will work be reliable and provide like acceptable video quality. Mm-hmm

78
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:48,400
I have you had much experience. Do you use any of these, you know conferencing programs or just video chat?

79
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,520
mostly just hangouts

80
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
yeah, that's a

81
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:02,120
That's a good problem because most of the the other options tend to as you pretty much explain not work reliably

82
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,120
Yes, so they talk about here like what do you what do you need to get started two things a reasonably recent browser and drumroll a

83
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,400
Server. Yeah, that's right. So they go on to explain like isn't WebRTC all about peer-to-peer communication

84
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Well, yeah, it is but these peers need to find each other

85
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,240
So they kind of go over like what all this means they talk about ice which is interactive connectivity

86
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,040
Establishment, which is a just a fun way to say

87
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,360
How can you actually get two people maybe behind that to talk to each other?

88
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,720
You think that eventually we'd be able to figure out IPv6 and get through some of these things, but no it's not gonna happen

89
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,200
well, you think you'd also be able to take some of the the

90
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,000
Info that the the browser itself has that where it's able to negotiate various connections to do some of this stuff automatically

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But I wonder if there's security reasons for that. Yeah, that's a good question

92
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,320
So they just got some you know, we're not gonna dive any more into it

93
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,640
But they've got a lot of cool

94
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:03,080
cool details here stuff about data channels mesh connectivity audio and video screen sharing a lot of stuff like if you're just getting started or

95
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,320
maybe you have a pipe dream that you want to

96
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:12,400
You know implement your own WebRTC solution. You kind of just need some JavaScript a back-end server and a lot of time. Yeah talking about

97
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:21,200
The stuff like stun and ice it kind of makes me realize that WebRTC is really just sip in your browser. Yes, exactly

98
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Yeah

99
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
We're not gonna talk about today, but that makes me think about

100
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,640
You know the the matrix project that we've talked a lot about before and I know I've seen them and there's a couple other things

101
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,600
Too free switch does some of it trying to marry that where you can, you know make a WebRTC call through a sip gateway

102
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,360
That goes and talks talks sip to another thing because you got to complicate it more

103
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,880
you've got to complicate it more but we might have a glorious solution where I can be on Wi-Fi on a bus and

104
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,720
Make a WebRTC call that goes through sip and then I can just ask Noah questions on his show whenever I want

105
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,840
Except that the connection will never be established

106
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,360
You'll never be able to have that or it'll be like really distorted and he'll keep asking and then drop me and

107
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,800
Yeah, I'll have to yell at him later. That's no fun or he'll get really angry and confused. Could you talked about Windows?

108
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,840
Oh, you know that happens that happens a lot. Yeah, I think especially with you. Oh, yeah

109
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,720
Mm-hmm. You just like to troll everybody mostly know mostly know that's why if you guys haven't seen it

110
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,960
Make sure you check out the most recent user error cuz that that show there's always something worth listening to there

111
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:27,280
And we try to make it worthwhile plus there's that sweepstakes, right? I think it actually just ended. Ah, I

112
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,400
Think it ended at 11 o'clock actually. Okay. Well, there you go

113
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,460
You were too late if you're hearing about it now

114
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,480
But I bet there'll be some announcements about what's gonna happen with that in the future. Probably in this next episode

115
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,400
excellent

116
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,320
Okay, so you're admittedly someone who spends some time on Windows, right? Yeah, that's true

117
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,120
So maybe maybe you don't know about this, but have you heard about the SS command? No, okay

118
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Well, I've got the article for you beard an introduction to the SS command over at Linux

119
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,440
Dot-com news for the open source professional. That's us. I think right. Yeah, it's gotta be us

120
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,520
So Linux includes a fairly massive array of tools available to meet almost every need

121
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,480
from development to security to productivity to

122
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,360
Administration if you have to get it done Linux is there to serve. Yes. Of course it is. The SS command is a tool

123
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,920
Used to dump socket statistics. You may have heard of this in the past a similar capability was exposed in the netstat tool. Ah

124
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,760
Yeah, see there you go

125
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,320
So there's a lot of people a lot of people end up using the you know

126
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,760
The IP command which is the new new replacement for IF config. These are all part of the IP route to

127
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
library or set of tools rather

128
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,080
but I feel like a lot of people end up missing SS or

129
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:48,160
Actually just don't like it very much a lot of my colleagues kind of it kind of has a bad wrap around them or they're

130
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,840
Just so used to netstat net stats been written in British about every guide everywhere

131
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,160
it has command line arguments that you're used to reading simple to use but

132
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
SS exposes actually a lot more functionality in some ways. It's faster more modern and

133
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,680
It's gonna be here for the future

134
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,280
There's probably a lot of distros that at some point will no longer ship net stat out of the box

135
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,000
You'll have SS. So if you are on the system where you need to troubleshoot something

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,360
Maybe you don't have the ability to install net stat

137
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,520
It's probably a good idea to learn even if it's not, you know your program of choice

138
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,020
I don't know. I tend to use a net stat for for basic

139
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
troubleshooting but then if stuff gets

140
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,580
Much more complicated. I just switched to wire shark

141
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,440
Yeah, that's I mean that's right sometimes you're when you have to get to that level of troubleshooting, you know, you're in trouble

142
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,360
Yeah, all right. Well, I need Kappa packet captures. That's something's wrong here. Is that something you have to do very often?

143
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,320
No, no, I hope not. Although I did use it to figure out why our live stream was getting knocked offline

144
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,880
Because Noah accidentally assigned the same IP to a printer

145
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Yes, I

146
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:57,080
Will refrain from comment, but maybe we already gave him crap. Yeah Linux action show

147
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,740
Excellent, and maybe that's why you should go check out our pre show where we've got a DHCP solution

148
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,440
That might be right up Noah's alley

149
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,520
Anyway, this article, you know, it's not crazy in-depth, but it does have some handy guides if you haven't used it before

150
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,340
I'm sure that's not many of our audience

151
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,240
I just want to throw it out there because you know

152
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,360
It's good to stay with the times and honestly, I've been using SS a lot more just like a conscious effort

153
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,800
It's really not too bad

154
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,360
It makes it pretty easy to choose between IP v6 or 4 if you just want to listen for you know

155
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,480
Listening sockets or UDP connections in the unconnect state pretty simple pretty quick

156
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,360
It shows the you know, it's easy to filter easy to say things like don't you know?

157
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,560
Don't try to resolve all my IP addresses show me the program that owns this socket that sort of thing

158
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,640
So you have some homework to do I think I guess so. Yeah get with the times beard get with the time

159
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,080
Contrary to popular belief. I do have a Linux box

160
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,960
So I can do this stuff. Do you yeah. Hmm. It's just the knock. Okay

161
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,520
So it's not as beefy as the the Windows rig. Well, it doesn't need to be it doesn't need to be right

162
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,600
You're saying that because Linux makes such great use of the system's resources. Yeah

163
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,440
Why are you grinning at me?

164
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Why I never I would never

165
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,960
Okay, so there's still a couple more things

166
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,680
Really? I've just got you know, you haven't heard of SS. Maybe you're a mere BSD convert

167
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,320
You might fall into you know, the target audience of this next piece as well

168
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,600
System D for impatient sysadmins

169
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,800
System deep it's the in its system that some love to hate I think more than some actually

170
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,640
So full disclosure over here at tie blog. I

171
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,960
Find system D a little overbearing although by no means would consider myself militant militantly anti system D

172
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,960
It has obvious advantages and though I'm at philosophical odds with at least some of it

173
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,440
I see no reason why everybody shouldn't understand it a bit better

174
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,600
Especially now that most people will need to deal with it on their favorite distros

175
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,360
This post is sort of just a formalized set of operational notes that I've made frequent use of in my experience with system D

176
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,760
I hope this purse post serves as another tool in your operations sysadmin utility belt

177
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,160
We need to get solutions quickly, but are working with a system that relies on different tools than your normal sys5 toolbox

178
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,120
Just a note the paths and examples here will be drawn from Arch Linux, but

179
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,960
Most of them should carry over to too many other distributions. So really that I mean, I think that's it right there like

180
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,360
We can really get past especially for a lot of people who have to use this stuff at work or on systems

181
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,000
They didn't get to make you know get to set up or dictate all of the software on

182
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,080
Even if you don't like system D or especially if you don't like system D

183
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,320
I don't there's a lot of people who didn't like sys sys5

184
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,640
RC in it kind of thing you still had to use it. You still have to know how to do it

185
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,840
I never loved upstart had to learn how to use it. So from that angle, I think this blog is just a great post

186
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,160
You know, it's like a field guide. It won't teach you all the theory. It's not a man page necessarily

187
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,280
But if you just like I'm on the system, I need to disable services. I need to edit this unit file

188
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,640
Boom, here you go. You don't have to read anything written by Leonard. So you don't have to like

189
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,160
Strangle anyone or erupt into a ball of hatred and confusion

190
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,800
No, my friends just head over to tie blog here. I think it's really handy

191
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,440
I I can think of some people in my life that I will definitely be handing this out to just as like

192
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,680
Don't hate it. I'm not saying it's the best thing ever does come with your system now. Here's the system D cheat sheet. Exactly. Yes

193
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,600
Are you a system D person on your Linux box there? Yeah, I don't have a problem with system D

194
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I actually kind of like it because

195
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,520
It's very easy to look at the unit files and see what what's going on

196
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,040
It's very easy to look at the unit files and see what what the hell is going on

197
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,080
Which I did not find that to be the case with sysv in it. Mm-hmm

198
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,120
because

199
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,560
Sometimes those were very complicated scripts

200
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,840
No, you know, I think I think that's true. There's a lot of the very as as he points out

201
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,520
There's a lot of very legitimate

202
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,200
You know problems with system D things where especially experienced

203
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,160
Sysadmins experience Linux users or developers don't like they lose control

204
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,520
They do things in a stupid way or dangerous way or insecure way, but I will say from the casual user

205
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,600
It's pretty easy, especially when like I have one. I have an executable. I'd like it to run as a service

206
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,980
Done, you know, there are other in systems that I should point out here that can do that

207
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,780
Just as easily as not a unique feature to system D, but it is a it is a benefit

208
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,480
I do also appreciate system, you know system control status on a program

209
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,480
It will actually show you if it's running or not gives you an excerpt from its logs

210
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,120
It's a pretty nice little drill down on a system. If you don't, you know, I will say also from a casual users perspective

211
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,120
The logging system is less straightforward

212
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:44,840
Yeah, that's for sure. Like, you know with sysv. You can just go and look at a log file, but with

213
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,800
System D you you have like six different commands to get different sets of logs that tell you different things

214
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,600
Yeah, yes, that's certainly true. There are there are definitely

215
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,320
Disadvantages and advantages to the journal and I think that's probably one of the most controversial pieces of system D

216
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,280
I will say I think both however are better than upstart. I really do not like upstart

217
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,640
I have there's so many upstart scripts that I've just never gotten to work and gave up on and

218
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,480
Actually reinstall the dis a different distro just so I didn't have to use upstart

219
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,960
Wow, that is dedication. I mean, I think upstart had a lot of good, you know, a lot of good things going for it

220
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,360
It was obvious. It was modernization. It was advancement

221
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,720
Yeah, but at the same time it was very it seemed very easy to break to me

222
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,080
Yeah, and it didn't quite I didn't enjoy the interface to it very much and it was yeah

223
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,920
At least on the systems I used especially around like a 1204

224
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,360
Period and it's kind of awkwardly integrated and confusing and the documentation for it wasn't very clear either

225
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,760
Yeah, I felt like one of those things where it was an awkward stepchild where it could have been the future

226
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,560
But then before it really got to the point of being polished and used widely system

227
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,520
Yes, exactly. I think that's the perfect

228
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,520
phrasing

229
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,500
Okay. Well enough about that because we certainly don't need a flame war today

230
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,480
Well, unless the beard once won he gets what he wants

231
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:09,360
Still in the topic of interesting things complex things explained well or questionably well, perhaps

232
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,600
We've got over on Kushal Das's blog. We've got a piece about

233
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,880
encrypting drives

234
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,720
With Lux. So if you're not familiar, you know encrypting hard drives

235
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,080
It's a common step that you see all the time now, especially on smartphones

236
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:30,040
Maybe on laptops a lot of installers even these days will make it pretty easy for you to get started

237
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,800
And this article I think is just a nice he's got some good pictures here that kind of

238
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,460
Sketch out some of the concepts that you're you're going to run into

239
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,760
Starts off write it off with an X AD X e X K CD. Excuse me comic, which is you know, a

240
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Classics, you know, you know, he knows what he's talking about in that regard, but it's basically just a you know

241
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,280
A breakdown over you know, what is Lux its Linux unified key setup is a disk. It's a disk encryption specification

242
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,280
first introduced by

243
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,080
2004 by Clemens fruit with fruit worth. That's fun to say

244
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,800
notice the word specification instead of trying to implement something of its own

245
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,160
Lux is a standard way of doing drive encryption across tools and distributions

246
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,280
You can even use drives from Windows using the LibreCrypt application that I actually did not know that's near to me

247
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,880
So he kind of just goes through it this in this tutorial. He's using USB sticks

248
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,660
Which may be more practical for you know, a lot of people you're not

249
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,240
Not everyone has a laptop or a computer. They can just like I'm gonna wipe the disk play with encrypting it

250
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,440
I

251
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,400
would suggest maybe stay tuned for some of our sponsors later and we'll have solutions for that as well, but

252
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,600
Virtual machines USB sticks. That's a great. That's a great way to do it

253
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,840
He does have some very diligent notes here about you know, execute things with caution. You will be erasing your hard drives. Watch out

254
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,280
But otherwise, it's just kind of a it's just a great explanation

255
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,360
It walks you through things and hold your hands in ways that things like the arch wiki

256
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,120
Well, it may have more detail may have more technical specifications or examples

257
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,760
it's not necessarily for the first-timer it can be if you're an experienced first-timer, but I

258
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,000
Remember, you know way back in the day when I was first playing with encryption and you're kind of like well

259
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,240
What what's happening here when it's not like one command you're like trying to piece all of the pieces together. I

260
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,300
Don't know it can be complicated. So I think I would have I would have really appreciated a guide like this say eight years ago

261
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:33,840
Do you encrypt much over there? You got BitLocker on all your Windows systems? No, I actually don't encrypt anything

262
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,200
I don't really have much that I feel I need to secure. Mm-hmm

263
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,640
Anything I think needs to be secure is not on a computer

264
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,200
Interesting a hard copy man. Well, I mean

265
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,560
Nobody can hack into your stuff and steal your data if it's not there

266
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,940
That's true. And I suppose you're not you're not too worried about the physical security aspect here

267
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,960
Yeah, no, no one's breaking into the studio for your precious secrets

268
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,060
If they want they got to go through me and if they go through me, I'm probably dead and don't care

269
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,400
Most of it I think they're after is that large photo collection of the beard that you have?

270
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,040
No, yeah, various beard shots profile pictures. It's

271
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,920
It's highly sought after it is highly sought after. All right. What about you guys mumble room?

272
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
You guys have been pretty quiet over there anyone

273
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,440
Play with Lux or any other forms of encryption that they want to talk about. I think it's becoming

274
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,600
Increasingly popular increasingly used and now that people people seem to trust Libre vault at least a little bit

275
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
and

276
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,120
Been using it a fair bit. I mean it'd be more of a solution

277
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,640
I was literally talking someone in IRC last night in the JB IRC about like they wanted something that works on Linux and Windows and

278
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:50,080
Let's would work except for the Windows set apart. So bad. I'm not sure because I just lost some

279
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,880
Some keys, so I'm not sure if I'm gonna be Lux again. I'm debating it

280
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,800
Yeah, no that makes sense, you know, I've I've I've had some friends in that in that position as well where if you don't do

281
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
it all the time if

282
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,600
You're unfamiliar with it. If you aren't, you know, you've got yourself in a situation. We have a system that you don't necessarily understand how to

283
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,800
administer

284
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Well, then you can you can lose data

285
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,720
You can lock yourself out and you know

286
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,640
You don't have a cloud cloud provider that you can call up and be like hey, I lost my key

287
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,400
Can you guys use your back door and get into my stuff for me?

288
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,480
When you do it this way, that's just not an option

289
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
I

290
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,640
Saw some some points here though. I guess no no disks has gotten a lot better in recent days at you know

291
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,160
Including encryption support. So there are a lot of gooey options as well for people who want

292
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,520
Encryption they want the security of it, but they don't necessarily want to master

293
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Running all this stuff to Crip setup

294
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,800
Managing their Crip tab all of that stuff on the command line

295
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,480
I can realize can be done even some people or just extra administrative overhead that you know

296
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
That's not really what they're trying to do

297
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,520
But hopefully and as the author notes, you know, hopefully this post encourages people to use encrypted drives more

298
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,760
All of his drives are encrypted. Most of mine are not on my current system because I just reformat it, but

299
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:12,200
It is something I try to do on sensitive systems or on laptops, especially when I can and you can use Lux encrypted drives

300
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,520
With Windows now, can't you? I believe that's possible via I think it's Libre Crip

301
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,880
Yeah, I believe that's true. Yeah, and that's actually what the author notes here. I have not tried that

302
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,440
Yeah me either, but that would actually be awesome

303
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,280
Yeah, because then you've got a cross-platform solution as long as you don't have a Mac. That's open-source

304
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,520
Well, you can probably get it working on the Mac. Yeah, you probably could yeah, that's that's probably true

305
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Okay

306
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm using BitLocker on Windows, haven't used open-source last year

307
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,840
I had some problems with it, but Microsoft helped me solve it and for Ubuntu

308
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,080
I'm using whatever is standard when you press encrypts in the Ubuntu Mati installer

309
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,640
Oh, see, there you go. I think that might actually be like I would imagine so

310
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,240
Yeah, unless it's only doing the user stuff, but I don't think anything does that anymore

311
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,760
Nah, I know that used to be the styles like you could have your own little encrypted, you know, home dir. Yeah

312
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,680
But I think those technologies were largely proven not to be secure

313
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,320
Makes sense. Okay, so moving on

314
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,680
Do you ever have slow systems, you know systems that you're just not happy with their performance and you're struggling to understand why maybe

315
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
JBots not not

316
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Doing titles as fast as it should

317
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,520
It's that memory leak Wes. Why are you gonna call me out? I'm sorry. It's not your fault. You can blame someone else

318
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,120
It's a Ruby's fault. Yeah, it was whoever coded that part of the code. Yeah

319
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
Just you know, not me. Certainly not me

320
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:44,840
Well, our friend Julia Evans who is maybe the one of the masters of explaining complicated things. Well

321
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Just got a guide for you

322
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,900
Uh linux tracing systems and how they fit together. So everyone knows we don't have detrace

323
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,760
It sucks

324
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,760
It sucked since like the mid-2000s or whenever detrace was first released

325
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,280
We've always wanted it. We haven't quite had it and there just hasn't been

326
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,360
There hasn't been like a you know, the solution for that on linux

327
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,600
But a lot of workloads are on linux a lot of our systems, you know

328
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,920
Especially here at the show like you you want to be able to have insight you want to be able to understand your production system

329
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
You want to be able to troubleshoot them?

330
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,200
So I think this is a great guide. There's been a lot of developments in the recent years

331
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,320
There's a lot of different systems that have a lot of overlap and I think Julia does a great job of talking about

332
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,840
You know, what's what are the things that are going on in Linux that are going on in Linux?

333
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,640
You know, what's what are these? You know, there's strace

334
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,280
ltrace kprobes tracepoints uprobes ftrace perf

335
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,360
ebbf

336
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
That's a lot

337
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
Of things. Mm-hmm

338
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,240
I mean that's kind of that's crazy. So she's been doing some work. She went to uh papers we love

339
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,560
uh and uh

340
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,640
hung out in in montreal where I guess lgtng comes from

341
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,280
And she's been working on trying to understand how all of these can fit together

342
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:12,440
So you can split linux tracing systems into data sources where the tracing data comes from and mechanisms for collecting data

343
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,360
For these sources an example of this would be something like ftrace

344
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,920
And tracing front ends the tool you actually interact with to collect and analyze data

345
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,200
The overall picture is still kind of fragmented and confusing. Amen

346
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,000
Especially since some of these also fit into multiple categories like ftrace. Yes, exactly

347
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,000
But it's at least a more approachable fragmented confusing system

348
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,840
Uh, so here we have a summary in pictures and I just love this. She has great pictures. I really appreciate that

349
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Let's see if we can't

350
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Something like that. There we go. So

351
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,880
Linux tracing systems and how they fit together for data sources over there. You've got kprobes which are basically kernel functions

352
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
You've got kernel tracepoints

353
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:00,920
Uprobes which are user space c functions usdt detrace probes and lttng user space tracing

354
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,880
So these are ways that we can actually collect data inside of the kernel and in linux systems

355
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,880
Then you've got ways to extract data which include perf which actually perf is a great tool

356
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,780
If you haven't used it, you should definitely try it out ftrace lttng system tap sysdig

357
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,560
And ebpf ebpf you may be familiar with it's been worked on. Um

358
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:27,500
A lot by some of the people over at netflix brendan gregg in particular who's done great work on linux profiling and performance

359
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,520
In general, so I definitely recommend checking him out if you haven't already

360
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,880
And then you can see a lot of the overlap right here as as rika was talking about in the front ends category

361
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,000
You've got things like perf ftrace catapult kernel shark. Actually i've never heard of that one trace command

362
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,940
Bcc sysdig lttng and system tap. Well, i'm instantly excited about kernel shark just because yeah shark

363
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
I like that a lot

364
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,220
So, you know this uh, this article goes on and on because it's awesome

365
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,940
And there's a ton of great pictures and they really are worth

366
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,540
Thousands of words in this case and actually the pictures are like 90 words

367
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,980
So you can tell that it's a kind of complicated, uh, but I think if you're at all interested in this stuff

368
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,860
It's a great place to start it can maybe tell you some of the tools that you should look in personally

369
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,780
um

370
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,780
There's a lot of tools that are just not

371
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,900
It feels really inaccessible sometimes I guess

372
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,820
um, but

373
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,100
I've recently been upgrading, you know

374
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,300
Been able to work on more recent systems that have newer kernels and can take advantage of some of these ebpf tools

375
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,820
And it's awesome. And in particular the bcc project has a lot of pre-compiled pre

376
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,300
pre-built scripts that you can use to measure things like

377
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,500
Like um run queue latency or you can you know, see where see where things are blocking you can

378
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,980
Chart mysql long running queries based on query execution time

379
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,580
Or even one of the ones i've used just to troubleshoot some systems that I was you know

380
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,540
A system I didn't build but I had to go in and diagnose

381
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,980
Uh, they've got one called exec snoop, which is great and you just run it

382
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,940
And it reports everything that gets executed on your system

383
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Well, they specifically say here that one of the newest and most powerful ways is to write a small ebpf program

384
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,820
Then ask linux to attach it to a kprobe

385
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,980
Slash u probe slash tracepoint and then the ep

386
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:18,460
Or ebpf program will send the data to user space with ftrace perf or bpf maps

387
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,660
Yeah, exactly. So I mean I think that exactly covers how

388
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,060
Confusing that is and why i'm glad there are guides like this

389
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,620
But like it's getting a lot better and there's a lot more options

390
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,940
Especially like just between perf and ebpf

391
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,580
Like there's just a lot of ways that you can get information that will help you

392
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,460
Start on this path. It does seem like a lot of them

393
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:44,620
End up glomming around ebpf. So maybe that's where you should start

394
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,420
Yeah, I think so and I think that's where a lot of the more recent uh momentum has been um

395
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,300
So definitely worth checking out brendan gregg

396
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,500
This article links to there's got a ton of there's got a ton of great stuff there continual development

397
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,140
So go check it out go profile some of your uh systems. Let us know how that goes

398
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,620
I think i'd be curious to see this evolve and it's great that we're finally

399
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:11,900
You know with ebpf and some of these more recent developments. We're finally in the place where we can build things that

400
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,020
Olumos and solaris have had for a long time and and freebsd and osx even

401
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,380
So we can finally be in that category and hopefully that goes a long way to

402
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,900
Making people more confident to run serious workloads on linux systems

403
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,140
I don't think there's any dearth of that now, but you know

404
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,380
There's old school admins and holdouts that are rightfully so or like well, I don't have the same kind of insight that i've had

405
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,820
on other systems, but

406
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,380
Uh on recent kernels, that's finally changing

407
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,260
All right, well keeping with this theme

408
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,500
You like complicated things but you need them you need them explained well

409
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,020
Just pop on over to our first sponsor tonight

410
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,740
And that's our friends over at linux academy. Head on over to linux academy dot com slash unplugged

411
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,180
There you will find basically the premiere place

412
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:03,020
To learn about linux and related technologies. They do it differently than pretty much anywhere else

413
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,340
They're not going to teach you how to maintain your garden

414
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,580
You're not going to learn how to repair your car, but you are going to learn from linux

415
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,380
Experts industry insiders people who've been doing this for years and who are passionate about linux

416
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:20,700
You're going to learn what you need to know to to get a job to pass exams and to be prepared to use linux

417
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,420
In the real world. Yeah, I will say I haven't used linux academy personally

418
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,740
But I have recommended it to some people that were looking to get into the it field

419
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,540
And they took some courses and ended up getting a job. That's awesome

420
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,100
I'm i'm kind of consistently

421
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,420
impressed that

422
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:44,160
People that you know, I don't that don't watch these shows that uh don't seem particularly

423
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,220
hip or even you know

424
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,300
They've been doing this for years. That doesn't seem like they really necessarily even need linux training necessarily

425
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,020
but

426
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:58,220
linux academy has gotten a great reputation and and totally deserves it because it's a great reference and it's

427
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,340
Employees are starting to employers are starting to recognize that linux

428
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:07,420
Linux academy is serious serious business if you can go get some certifications or go take some courses and show that off

429
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:15,020
Employers understand that that means something that means that you're a passionate about this and b you've gotten really good instruction up-to-date instruction

430
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,660
You didn't learn on some outdated six years ago distro that just won't apply anymore

431
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:25,900
You already know about system d you can do that and it supports some of the latest stuff like go check out their courses

432
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,380
It's awesome

433
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,060
They make it super easy to get started

434
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,780
They have things like a you know a scheduler so you can understand how long some of these things are going to take for you

435
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,820
If you don't have a lot of time, they've got nuggets which are just little tiny things little facts

436
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,700
I mean some of them are a little bit long. Some of them are like five minutes of them are like an hour

437
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,540
They're fascinating and it's a great way to just you know, you have a little time to kill you got stuck in the train

438
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:55,260
You're on your way to work and someone else is driving a nugget is perfect to increase your linux knowledge get things started

439
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,260
If you take a look at all their courses

440
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,380
you'll see that they really have pretty much any linux thing that you want to know and what makes them so different is

441
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,500
You don't have to do this on your system. You don't have to set up all this stuff

442
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,520
You don't have to worry about paying for that. It's all included and when you go to linuxacademy.com

443
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,560
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged you'll get a seven day free trial

444
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,840
Well, and even if you're trying to get hired at an employer

445
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,640
For example that doesn't know about linux academy because they're old and behind the times and they they suck

446
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
But you're trying to get hired there. Anyway

447
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,280
You still get the certifications and on top of that

448
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,760
It it becomes pretty obvious that you have a good foundation of knowledge

449
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,960
Even if they don't know what linux academy is. Yeah, right exactly and it shows that

450
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,720
It shows that you know what you're what you're doing and I think it makes it, you know

451
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,840
You'll be backed up because employers can go to linux academy and check out

452
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,280
What they teach and it'll I think it'll instantly show them that oh these guys know what they're doing

453
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,120
Plus they do things like, you know, they customize it. You're trying to learn about a red hat system

454
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,440
They'll make sure that the the vms they spin up for you

455
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,560
Are they the the distribution that you want and all the courseware automatically customizes for that?

456
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,960
So you'll be running the right packaging commands. You'll be running the right, you know, init commands. It doesn't matter

457
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,400
They've accounted for that. They make it super easy. And I know for me. I use it a lot both learning chef and

458
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,760
working with aws resources I hadn't used before because

459
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,040
I mean sometimes to model some of this aws stuff you have to spin up your a whole vpc for yourself

460
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,080
You've got a ton of stuff. You're getting databases. You're getting load balancers

461
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,280
That's a lot of money to spend just to learn how to do something

462
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,760
On your own time with linux academy you pay them. They manage all those resources

463
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,640
They help you do it and they make sure you don't waste your time

464
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,320
You don't waste your money and you just get the best educational bang for your buck

465
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,800
So go on over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

466
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,360
Get your learn on

467
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,400
I agree

468
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
beautiful

469
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,040
Oh linux academy, you really do make things a lot

470
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,040
Easier i'm glad they exist. It's kind of funny to think about like a couple years ago. They didn't and

471
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,920
What what would you do?

472
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:57,360
I don't know. You'd have to you'd have to go learn from some some worse resource. I think I don't I don't want that

473
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,600
all right, so

474
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,120
Now we move on

475
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,640
Yeah, read man pages. I think that's about it

476
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,120
ww

477
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,920
You read man pages, which is not a bad way to do it if you have the stomach for that

478
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,800
But I think it you know, it helps lower the boundaries. It makes it more digestible more digestible. Mmm

479
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,200
tasty

480
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,920
Plus you can't deny. There's some man pages that are pretty crappy. Yeah

481
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,080
Like I love man pages, but some of them not so great. Yeah, exactly could could be info pages

482
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Oh, I like that irc room colonel panic. You're brilliant

483
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
okay, so

484
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,480
Up next we've got our updates section and this is just I thought we'd just take you know

485
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,120
Not nothing crazy long, but we just talked about a couple things we've talked about before on the show. So first up

486
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,840
How microsoft brought sql server to linux now sql server is not something I actually have had to use

487
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,520
Very much. What about you? Nope, I've thankfully managed to avoid very much investment in the

488
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,960
You know in the dot net stack, but I know a lot of people who do maybe that's what they learned in school

489
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,200
Um sql server is actually I mean legitimately a really good product

490
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,400
It's a great sql server if you have the money to pay for it or you work somewhere that does

491
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,080
um

492
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,960
And I know for a long time

493
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
They've had a lot of features that people have relied on

494
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,040
So it's interesting this article just kind of explains some of the explains some of the history

495
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,360
You know back in 2016 when microsoft announced that sql server would run on linux

496
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,160
The news came kind of as a major surprise to users and pundits alike. But over the course of last year

497
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
microsoft support for linux

498
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
And some would say open source in general

499
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,640
Has come into clear focus and the company's mission now seems to be all about bringing its tools to wherever

500
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,080
Its users are so they first launched this back in

501
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,600
Sorry, excuse me. They today launched the first release of sql server 2017

502
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,960
Which will be the first version to run on windows linux and in docker containers. I

503
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,680
It I think that kind of shows that microsoft's really they are trying to pivot to this cloud first mentality containers

504
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,880
They they use the word docker all the time

505
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,120
Now the docker container alone has already seen more than one million polls and I think they get like, you know

506
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,000
they really are trying to target developers with that like if I can just

507
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,120
I can already go like docker run mongo db if I can do the same thing for sql server

508
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,520
Maybe i'll start considering it. Yeah, exactly

509
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,160
Do you use docker much at all in your development work? Uh, not really. I I just run it in vpss

510
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah

511
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,400
I think I think a lot of this too like they they talk here like, you know talking to enterprises

512
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:33,360
It became clear that doing this it was necessary, you know, we were forcing customers to use windows as their platform of choice

513
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,640
um

514
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,920
And it's funny to think about because in another incarnation of microsoft that probably would have been seen as something positive

515
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,000
But the company's strategy today, you know, it's it's quite different

516
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,800
It's it's interesting to see them actually think about you know

517
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,040
They acknowledge now that linux kind of dominates the server world and they have to

518
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,240
They have to play ball if they want to get a piece of that money, which they really do

519
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,600
Um, so this article kind of just continues on they've got some some nice graphics here kind of explaining how they managed to

520
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,020
You know change the abstraction layers change the architecture or work with the existing architecture

521
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,580
Of sql server to make it run on windows and linux and to do so really well

522
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,020
I mean, I think it shows like microsoft's got a lot of developer muscle

523
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,820
And when they actually pour it into something like this or similarly like the windows subsystem

524
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,580
They produce some interesting things even if i'm not personally using them

525
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,500
Have you used that uh subsystem much? Do you use that on your your windows hosts?

526
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,020
I've used a little bit

527
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:36,500
But I ended up not using as much as I would like because since I do do a lot of my development on vps's

528
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,300
It would be nice to have the linux subsystem there

529
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,820
but

530
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,180
I can't

531
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,940
Do sshfs because it requires a kernel module. Oh

532
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,860
so

533
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,860
It became pretty useless. Yeah

534
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:57,220
Your like existing workflows no longer really worked. Well if you're interested sql server for linux should reach general availability later this year

535
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:03,300
Um, but even today there are some people using it in production. So i'm sure we'll hear some more about this story soon

536
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,900
Speaking of another somewhat foreigner in our in our midst. Did you know rikai that

537
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,260
Zfs is the best file system at least for now. Yeah

538
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:21,300
Okay, well i'm not this is not this is not news news to you at all. No, is it?

539
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,900
Zfs is it's the best option. It's just too bad that we have to use it via dkms on linux

540
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,740
Because that makes it a lot worse. Hey, unless you're running the most recent abundance true

541
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:38,500
They've got that should compiled already for you, but i've also not seen that work. So

542
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
I haven't messed with it much admittedly, but

543
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,940
Yeah, no, that's fair. Well, uh, stephen foskett

544
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,660
over at foskets.net

545
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:55,780
He acknowledges zfs is the best file system, but he starts out with zfs should have been great, but I kind of hate it

546
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:01,460
Zfs seems to be trapped in the past before it was sidelined. It is the cool storage project of choice

547
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:07,300
It's it's inflexible. It lacks modern flash integration and it's not directly supported by most operating systems

548
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,580
But I put all of my valuable data on zfs because it simply offers

549
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,180
The best level of data protection in a small home

550
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,680
Small office or home office environment

551
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,620
Here's why

552
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,700
One does not simply return zero

553
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:29,460
Instead of one. Yeah, I mean that that that is that is pretty much pretty much how it works, right?

554
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,500
I mean you need a file system that has checksums you need file systems that

555
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,780
are designed with failure in mind and plan for that ahead of time and zfs is really the

556
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,940
Ultimate example of a file system with those kind of thinkings designed right into it

557
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,280
Right into it. Uh, so he goes in, you know talks about the zfs revolution circa 2006

558
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,340
um

559
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,020
When it first appeared in like 2005

560
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:55,220
It was absolutely with the times right copy on copy on riot had been a research thing that was now starting to see

561
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,460
general deployment

562
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,580
um, but he does kind of talk about some of the things he'd like to see be improved with zfs or

563
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:07,860
Things he'd like to see in a you know an even newer more modern file system. Mm-hmm

564
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,420
I know there's a lot of complaints about

565
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,100
It's not that you can't expand it. You just have to be a little bit careful or plan with how you'll be

566
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,740
You know expanding your arrays, um or building them. It's certainly not necessarily for the

567
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:24,660
Casual admin if you're going to be administering a lot of storage, I think you can use zfs just fine

568
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:30,340
There's a lot of fud out there about memory consumption or difficult, you know difficulty to administer

569
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,420
I think really actually the tools are really good

570
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,460
but

571
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,700
There are just you get to a point where you have enough data and you have to or enough redundancy or not enough redundancy

572
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,660
And you have to do things, you know appropriately zfs does have somewhat high memory consumption

573
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,420
But that's because it's doing a lot more than pretty much any other file system out there

574
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Yeah, yeah, exactly

575
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,820
So they kind of talk about you know 2017 to 2010 zfs is to derailed and then talk a little bit about the

576
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,260
sun to oracle transition and the changes there

577
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,660
How that all goes wrong then he gets into what's wrong with zfs

578
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,300
today

579
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:10,660
So, uh, he talks about money remains skeptical of deduplication which hogs expensive ram in the best case scenario

580
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,220
And I do mean expensive. Um

581
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:19,780
And and goes on a little bit about how you know, he'd like to see a more first clash notion of flash storage

582
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,420
um, you know, there are things you can do things with the zil and l2r caches, but um

583
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,060
There are some limitations there which he gets into so I think it's just an interesting article

584
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,400
He may not agree with all of it. I think his conclusions

585
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,520
Are uh are reasonable for his use cases

586
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,280
But maybe a little bit over exaggerated the point I kind of took away was like look at all the things that zfs has

587
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,000
Got right here the things that we should focus on in the future

588
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,640
Where should we be taking what should we be thinking about for the future file system development because like it's not like we need

589
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
the next file system today, but

590
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,680
10 years from now. Are we still going to be able to use zfs?

591
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,000
Will it be feeling a little bit stale? Is it the kind of stuff that we can change especially in the way?

592
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,600
You know incremental change without breaking things but getting new features or at some point

593
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,960
Are we going to actually have to have you know, a new file system design not from scratch necessarily, but you know what I mean?

594
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,520
yeah, I think that the

595
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,960
Your willingness to learn zfs is directly reportionable

596
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,720
Proportional to how much you care about your data

597
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,760
The more you care about your data the more willing you're going to be to learn zfs

598
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,560
yeah, I think that's uh

599
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:30,200
That's entirely accurate. That's yeah, if you take it seriously, that's kind of it's kind of what you need to know. Yeah

600
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,040
So maybe maybe zfs isn't anything. Um, I will say even you know as the irc rightly points out

601
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,800
It's really not that hard to set up even on linux

602
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,160
You do on a lot of distributions have to compile the kernel module dkms tries to make that nice and easy for you

603
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,000
If I was running it in production, I think I would almost certainly compile

604
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,600
That myself and then ship my own repo that had those pre-built

605
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,720
I know on entergos you can just use zfs as part of the install process

606
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,400
Yeah, you can even install on root. I would not recommend that it often breaks systems

607
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,440
Which it's like you can certainly make it work

608
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,080
Um, but that's the category where it's like, all right

609
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,000
Well, you are now administering this be prepared for failure know how the command line works

610
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,160
Also, I hear that if you want to learn about zfs or if you're having issues with zfs

611
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,880
There's a guy named alan in the jupyter broadcast and chat room

612
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,160
He has no problem receiving any pms

613
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,560
About zfs. You're right like pretty much at any hour of the evening

614
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,320
Zfs problem 24 7. He's like a zfs helpline. Mm-hmm, but then you do have to say

615
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:37,640
Alan switched me to zfs, right? I think that you have to say that. Yeah when when you go to buy your file system

616
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,760
Is that how it works? Yeah, exactly. Yes

617
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,320
Oh beard

618
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,600
Okay, so maybe maybe zfs isn't your thing. Maybe you're not

619
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,700
You just missed the boat on that one. You're like zfs. That's so 2006

620
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,080
I want something new but obviously butter fs. I just don't it leaves a bad taste on my mouth. I'm not going to talk about it

621
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,840
Really? The only thing we've got going for us. Actually, there's a lot I shouldn't say the only thing but in the linux world

622
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,560
It's our friend kent overstreet

623
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,880
working

624
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
On bcash fs. So we've talked about this

625
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,760
It's kind of something we like to highlight occasionally just not not because I think it's going to be necessarily be great

626
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,720
Not because that's necessarily the future but it's one possible future and its development that I like to see

627
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,400
um

628
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,520
There's probably better ways to do it. I'm not saying this is optimal or

629
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,120
Going to be perfect

630
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:32,200
But kent overstreet has a has a great history of writing good code bcash has proved very fruitful and useful in the kernel

631
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,400
um

632
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,760
And it's just exciting to kind of stay up

633
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:41,080
You know, I I contribute to his patreon if you guys want to as well. I think linux needs to get over this butter fs thing

634
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,400
There's just so much

635
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,120
The license issue with zfs. We'll see what happens with the bun too

636
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:53,080
I'm not confident that we'll actually see easy to use or at least as easy as in kernel solutions to zfs anytime soon

637
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,800
But we do need a file system that we can use that's modern

638
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:02,600
Um, hopefully bcash fs can go at least part of the way there some developments here that I thought were kind of interesting

639
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,960
He's been asked a few times about the potential for porting bcash fs to other operating systems, right?

640
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,480
We were just talking about like, you know

641
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,640
If you can use lux or you know zfs is sometimes something that you can actually use that's very portable

642
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,200
If you can use it on mac and linux for instance

643
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,480
um

644
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,200
but

645
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:24,440
Nearly about 90 of the bcash fs code already built and runs in user space and is used by bcash fs tools

646
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,480
So the core file system code is more or less structured as a library

647
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,480
And bcash fs tools mostly just implements command line interfaces to it

648
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:37,400
So what this means is that most of the code is not actually particularly tried tied to the linux kernel

649
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,960
Uh, you know if most of the code already works and where's our space?

650
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,560
We're just we're kind of most of the way there to be able to run it on other operating systems

651
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,440
Well, the problem is the other operating systems

652
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,400
Outside of windows, which will probably never be able to use bcash fs anyway

653
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:58,520
They already have file systems with these features like apple is starting to roll out apfs or whatever the hell it's called

654
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,560
yep, and which has most of the features of zfs and

655
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,760
The bsds and salaris they already have zfs. So

656
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,760
Why do they care?

657
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:14,280
I mean not to be mean linux could definitely use it but it's true the portability. Not really

658
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,360
No, I think that would only be you know

659
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:21,640
If if eventually there were some open source projects that that took up that banner, you know

660
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,640
And then let you I mean it would be nice to have a you know, a nice file system

661
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,680
Yeah cross-platform that wasn't ntfs or fat

662
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah, that makes sense or xfat or ufs all of which have issues

663
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I mean there isn't really a great

664
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,920
A colonel panic in the chat room says that net bsd could potentially use bcash fs

665
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,920
I guess they don't use zfs for some reason. I don't know. Yeah, that's a good question

666
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,160
We'll have to look into that. I'm not i'm not sure

667
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:50,440
That would be interesting. I would also love to see more, you know development of the linux of uh, you know

668
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,280
bsc file systems hammer 2 in particular see that used or at least

669
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:02,520
The potential of it being used on linux. Do you know what license the abfs is under? You know, I don't that's a good question

670
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,560
Let's find out. It'd be interesting if it were open and it could be ported to linux. Yeah

671
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,880
I'm not an apple fanboy by any means but

672
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,680
It's a good technology, right? I mean and they're paying talented developers to work on it

673
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,640
So you can't you can't really ignore that some of which are former zfs developers if I remember correctly. Yeah

674
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,400
Yeah

675
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:30,200
I don't see. Okay. Well wikipedia doesn't mention the license. Okay, so it's probably proprietary. Yes, I think so

676
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,920
That's unfortunate

677
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,160
We'll see what happens with that. I mean apple definitely does a uh, I mean they open source swift

678
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,720
They open source a lot of stuff. I think they're picking up on

679
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,240
On that this is an important thing to do. So yeah, we'll stay tuned. Um,

680
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:51,000
Um, hey, there we go. Hey tech map. Thank you. Okay, so there's there's some licensing link there

681
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,640
We'll check that out and have to update the show that seems to be for apfs cloning though

682
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,400
I don't know what that is or how it relates to the direct apfs code base

683
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,720
So it seems to be some sort of example code. Yeah, that makes sense

684
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:11,640
Yeah f2fs is another contender flash focused. I've used it a little bit but I haven't played with any

685
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,080
You know any of its necessary any any of its features to a large extent that something we'll have to play with more here

686
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,640
Okay, so another update from a project we've talked about before on the show

687
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,700
Wire guard has just gone through formal verification

688
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,960
Of their protocol. So I should stress here. This is not a verification of

689
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,840
Implementations not saying that the code that you run that runs wire guard

690
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,480
Has been verified. No, but it's still important

691
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:49,240
Um, if you're not familiar with wire guard, it's a you know, a new intended to be hoped to be in kernel vpn solution

692
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,880
for linux, um

693
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,360
There's a lot of issues with the

694
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,960
Complexity of current solutions open vpn is a huge project

695
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,600
Um that has has some known problems

696
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,680
And performance issues ipsec is pretty is pretty great and and reasonably well trusted

697
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,120
But is also very complicated has a large formal spec

698
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,680
uh and

699
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,720
Doesn't deal with key exchange and the key exchange itself is actually quite complicated in many cases. Um, and

700
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,040
It doesn't have easy user land support in linux anyway

701
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,040
Uh, so wire guard aims to have a lot have lower overhead have high performance be simple be built on modern crypto

702
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,080
And work. So this is a first step here. Um,

703
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,200
It's based on noise, which is a modern cryptography framework that you may be familiar with from

704
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,640
um, some some of the other podcasts here as well as

705
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,520
It's used in some of the stuff like from signal

706
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,240
uh, so what they've done here is uh

707
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:53,800
Yeah, they've they've used a software called a symbolic modeler called tamarin which I had not heard of before but it's called the tamarin prover

708
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,800
It's a security protocol verification tool. It sounds like a spice

709
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:03,500
It sounds like a spice. It does sound like a spice, but it supports both falsification and unbounded verification

710
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:11,720
In the symbolic model. So what they were working on here is proving that if implemented correctly the security model around the protocol

711
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,120
Is actually secure. Um, so the paper is a work in pro

712
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:22,360
Progress, but they are using you know computer aided proof here to try to show that the wire guard protocol is secure

713
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,240
When done properly and that's kind of the first step

714
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:32,120
Um, it will help audit and conformance of the actual implementation and then it it opens the future for you know, if you want to build

715
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,320
a um a verifiable in like a verifiable programming language something like f star

716
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:43,800
Um, you could build a wire guard that would be provably correct. Um, this is obviously very important, especially in

717
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,740
Times we see china cracking down on personal vpns

718
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:53,640
The internet at large is you know more government interest more surveillance more corporate surveillance all of those problems

719
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,640
It's important to have an easy to use

720
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,000
Vpn where you can get security, right or at least understand the security of it or have others understand it

721
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:07,160
Yeah, that's been designed from the ground up to be easily audible. Yes, exactly not have to go back on this

722
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:13,000
You know large thing that's been developed for years and try to figure out if it's proved open vpn code base. Yeah

723
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,040
So what do you think of wire guard? Have you used it at all? No

724
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,320
I don't have any uses for a vpn really

725
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,840
Yeah, that's fair. Yeah

726
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:28,040
I gotta say i'm i'm excited about it. I don't know but it's super easy to set up. I enjoy that it's

727
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,360
They make it really easy to implement with standard linux user space tools

728
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,120
um

729
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:39,080
And i've got great performance. I mean nothing i'm doing is like super performance critical where open vpn wouldn't work

730
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,640
But this is easier to set up by far than open vpn

731
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:47,560
Um, yeah, they say that they specifically wanted it to be as easy to set up as ssh. Yeah, exactly

732
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:53,880
I would say it's it's approximately in that category. Um, and so I think i'll I it's not in the kernel yet

733
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,160
Um, but they do have an up-to-date repo dkms builds it really quick. It's actually a very small module

734
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,160
So it doesn't take ages to build or anything

735
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:06,520
They say it's even capable of roaming between ip addresses just like mosh. Yeah, and that's the thing

736
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,640
It's like it's really nice. I've been using it for a while now on my laptop and it's

737
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,080
It's one of the better vpn experiences i've had because you don't have to worry about it

738
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:17,080
I don't have to worry about it. It comes back up wi-fi comes back up. I connect back up to the server

739
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:22,520
It's kind of amazing how it can handle so much while being so small compared to all the other ones. Yes

740
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,440
I don't I guess they do have the the bonus of being able to

741
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,160
Start much later than the other ones and learn from all their mistakes. Yes, it seems thoroughly modern and

742
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,880
You know, I don't advise production use of it

743
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,720
I'm not saying that you should go ahead and deploy it everywhere

744
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:41,640
But it's definitely something i'm i'm trying to keep track of and i'm excited to see future development. They do say that they

745
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,560
Make conservative and reasonable choices and that they've already been reviewed by cryptographers. Yes. So there's already been some work

746
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:53,000
They're trying it's it feels really like they're trying to do it trying to get to that the right part where you can trust them

747
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,480
Yes, exactly

748
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:02,360
We'll see though. So while i'm using this project, of course, I need somewhere to like put the end of my vpn, right?

749
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:07,160
That's like a thing that you need or I hear is great at tor, you know tor works pretty well. I could use my house

750
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:12,600
Uh, but a lot of times I choose digital ocean. So, uh, head on over to

751
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,000
Digital ocean.com there you will find

752
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:23,320
I'm, pretty sure your future cloud provider because it's cloud computer designed for developers. I mean really it's designed for admins linux

753
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,940
Enthusiasts anyone who's tired of complicated apis

754
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:33,320
Inane user interfaces or just paying too much or paying an unknown amount for a questionable

755
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:38,120
Service if you go on over to digital ocean.com, you can use our promo code do unplugged

756
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:44,360
Oh, yeah, that'll get you a ten dollar credit and when you find out that prices for their awesome droplets

757
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah, what what's a droplet you might say that is a vps in the cloud on real kvm hypervisors with incredible

758
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:57,420
40 gigabit e networking right to that hypervisor. It's like the rain cloud. It's just a series of droplets

759
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,760
I think that's exactly right

760
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,480
And the droplets contain little bundles of linux goodness or bsd goodness

761
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:11,480
It's all honey badger on digital ocean like an actual clouds where they only just contain water. Yes much better on the internet

762
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,040
Yeah, much better on the internet. That's why we recommend it so much

763
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,600
So you get like a ton

764
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,920
For that five dollars a month, right when you go on over to their pricing page, they make it super clear that

765
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,720
You don't know. There's not you're not like wondering about how much you're going to be spending each month

766
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,600
I I never I never worry about that at digital ocean

767
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:34,360
They make it super easy to do and it's it's kind of a bargain. I mean for okay you get the ten dollars

768
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,280
So maybe you just want to use that you're like, all right. Okay one free month. I'm sure I won't need it anymore

769
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,480
Actually, you're going to be hooked. So we're two months for two months. Yeah, it doesn't matter

770
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,720
If you go with the ten dollar you get a whole gig of memory

771
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:50,520
One virtual cpu which these are some nice cpus too. So don't don't think that that's some skimpy arm thing

772
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:55,320
No, no, certainly not 30 gigs of all ssd

773
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,000
Disc and a whopping two terabytes of transfer

774
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:06,200
Plus receive free access to services including monitoring cloud firewalls and more maybe that's not enough for you though

775
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,360
Maybe you're like, oh, I really need more from my provider. They've just rolled out

776
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,000
high cpu

777
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:19,160
Droplets, so if you're crunching tons of data really putting the cloud to work for your projects digital ocean is now totally viable

778
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,960
And they've done a ton of stuff like adding monitoring load balancers

779
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,120
Attachable block storage. They're working on object storage, which i'm super excited for

780
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:31,080
There's a ton of things that you can get that you can find at other cloud providers that don't have nearly the same kind of

781
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,840
ease of use

782
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:39,400
Simplicity of digital ocean. They've got an incredible api. They use it to build their awesome. Super clean super easy to use ui

783
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,200
We use it here. The api is super easy to use all the all the apps are super easy to use

784
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,200
It's just it's simple. It's no nonsense

785
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,520
It's easy to get started with and when you use it, you're going to be able to do a lot of different things

786
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,640
Easy to get started with and when you use our promo code do unplugged

787
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,200
You get a ten dollar discount. We wanted

788
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,600
To be able to turn droplets on and off via the irc

789
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,360
To control the live stream to youtube

790
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:05,800
and

791
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,240
So I asked one of the people that was helping me develop j-bot. Can you?

792
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,600
Find a way to hook up these commands

793
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,400
To j-bot to be able to turn the droplets on and off within

794
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,120
In 20 minutes he had finished the plugin

795
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,840
Because the api is that good? Wow?

796
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:29,240
That's kind of incredible. Yeah, I I like I I was talking to chris and noah about it and they're like

797
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,600
Yeah, that'd be cool if you could do that

798
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,120
So I went upstairs I messaged him and I came back downstairs and I checked a little bit later

799
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,200
I'm like, oh, I guess it's done

800
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:42,600
Wow, yeah, that's awesome and we use it like every day here. I mean all the all the freaking time

801
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,560
It's pretty reliable. It yeah, I think it is pretty reliable

802
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,000
so

803
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,440
Awesome. All right. We'll go check that out

804
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:53,960
Thank you very much to digital ocean for sponsoring the linux on program unplugged program and that promo code one more time. It's do

805
00:56:54,600 --> 00:57:00,760
Unplugged all one word all over case. Oh and all those vpss that I was saying I was doing development on digital ocean droplets

806
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:06,280
Of course, so sly that's your secret sauce super cheap and no effort to set up

807
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,200
that is

808
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,880
Awesome. All right. Well, okay, but to set that all up right you do need

809
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:17,800
You do need internet right? Like you got to be able to get to digital ocean. Yes. I don't think they have

810
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,000
IP over paper yet. Mm-hmm

811
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,640
And you know a lot of these people a lot of people today. They don't

812
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,280
They've heard a lot about security problems

813
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,960
They want to secure secure wi-fi router

814
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,800
Maybe they maybe they went with the google wi-fi router, you know

815
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:40,040
It's been pretty popular these days a lot of people buy it for maybe loved ones or family members without looking at the chatter

816
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:46,280
Right now i'm going to say that they're probably saying that anybody that thought that google would be secure is

817
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,920
kind of dumb, but

818
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,760
And I would agree

819
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,680
I don't know if I agree

820
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,720
Yeah, I mean it depends on there on the product line, I suppose. Um, anyway, you may have had one of these

821
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:03,160
I know some people who got them or uh, you know, inherit them or are troubleshooting to family members

822
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,360
And I know for me, it's always frustrating when you're on like, uh, you know

823
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,960
Stupid proprietary router and you can't troubleshoot things. You don't have access to a console

824
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,560
You can't use all this linux knowledge that you've just gained or i've always had

825
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,840
Especially on super lockdown things

826
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,520
but

827
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:23,640
If you're on google hardware my friends, there is a new open source project called gale force

828
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,200
Which allows you to customize your google wi-fi

829
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,800
Router like the wind. Yeah, like the wind

830
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,640
So I guess the hardware name for google's wi-fi is gale

831
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,600
You know much like they have the hammerhead for the nexus 5 or for all those fun names that they have

832
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,840
So I don't I don't expect anyone to go out here and buy google wi-fi necessarily

833
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,720
But if you are already administering one

834
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,600
Gale force is kind of the best of both worlds

835
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:56,280
It lets you run your own vpn server customize your gateway ip address or do any other system administration sort of thing that linux makes possible

836
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,920
the bad news

837
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,400
You do have to get your hands dirty to put the router in development mode

838
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,960
You'll need a screwdriver a usb-c adapter with

839
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,360
power delivery

840
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:13,080
And some very precise button presses. So, you know fat-fingered people out there. Maybe this is the one for you get a helper

841
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,480
Don't let noah set it up. Don't let noah

842
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,880
Set it up

843
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:24,120
But this is pretty fun. Actually, I think it's uh, it's neat what's nice about gale force. Uh, it's that it's gonna keep working

844
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,840
Even if you get updates so it's not some sort of thing where you you know flash your router with alternative firmware

845
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:34,280
You're stuck. No, they've just kind of they figured out a way to

846
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:41,160
Unlock down things so that if you want root access you want to get things going you can but you still get security updates

847
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,000
You still get feature updates

848
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,200
It still has a nice ui that your parents can use. They just probably replace user space stuff. Yeah, exactly

849
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,600
So you can go check it out. Um has a github project

850
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,240
And that makes it really easy to get started

851
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,560
Basically enables you to get root ssh access so I have anything any extra features you want

852
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:03,320
And they keep mentioning this apparently with the stock firmware stuff. You can't customize the gateway ip address

853
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,800
Which personally that would frustrate me at least a little bit

854
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,920
it actually makes uh google wi-fi more appealing to me because i've been doing research because

855
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:17,720
As some people might know i've been planning on moving eventually and I was looking at uh, what the best way to do

856
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,360
Whole house wi-fi is yeah

857
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:26,760
And apparently google wi-fi is one of the easiest ways to just get repeaters and coverage without really having to deal with it

858
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:32,280
So maybe that combined with some of this more open stuff would be really nice

859
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Interesting. Yeah, that that's what I kind of thought too

860
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:40,680
Is that yeah, maybe this is suddenly like we'll open it up to enthusiasts in a way where it didn't didn't have any interest

861
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,120
there before

862
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,080
um

863
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,040
I'll have to look into that. I actually hadn't looked at the hardware at all kind of for those reasons

864
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:50,920
I was like, well, I don't need that like i'd rather run something that I can actually, you know play with or or mess with

865
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,720
Interesting. When are you looking at moving or is this kind of just off in the future off in the future?

866
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,560
Yeah, that makes sense

867
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,560
Hopefully next year. Yeah

868
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,920
So i'm running my linux router still which has been working really well

869
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,280
And then I just this year just added a ubiquity ac pro which has been performing quite well nice

870
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,200
But I live in an apartment so it's not like I have crazy wi-fi needs

871
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,560
It's just like, you know a couple hundred square feet and then i'm set. Yeah

872
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,680
okay, so

873
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,920
Speaking of things the beard is interested in

874
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:25,180
You pointed this out to me and it's not all the time that we talk about an indiegogo

875
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:30,860
Indiegogo or kickstarter project because it's actually on both. I don't understand how that works interesting

876
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,640
but uh, yeah, so

877
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:37,560
There's this project. Uh, what's the name of it again? You have it up there? Yes

878
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:45,480
Smach smach smach z. Yeah, I think it's smock smock. Yeah, that makes more sense. So essentially it's a

879
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:51,560
A desktop pc in a handheld form factor

880
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,320
That's what the the pitch seems to be anyway

881
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,400
So basically it's based. Well originally it was based on

882
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,420
one of the the amd mobile processors

883
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,120
and

884
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:15,720
Some sort of amd gpu now they're saying actually i'll just read it. Yeah, please do. Uh, where is it?

885
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,680
It is over here

886
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,880
Uh, they they posted an update to their exclusively to their backers

887
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,520
But I happen to have a way to see that post outside of there. We won't talk about how

888
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:34,600
Uh, they said amd has kindly agreed to let us inform backers about their new soc upgrade

889
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:40,760
We can officially confirm that we are moving to the latest generation amd technology, which will be based on ryzen and vega

890
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:45,400
We are working together with amd to bring the best performance to smac z

891
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,760
So it will be the most powerful handheld console on the market

892
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:55,480
The new generation looks amazing and we want to thank amd for all their support and efforts contributed to our project

893
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,120
At this point we can't say anymore, but we hope that will alleviate the long wait

894
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:06,440
Because uh, this kickstarter happened like sometime last year. Oh, okay. Yeah, and then they they had a

895
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:11,960
um a partner that they were partnering with for the the soc technology back out

896
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:19,960
And because they backed out that caused delays but on the other side that let them work with amd to get this new tech in there

897
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,640
so it's kind of a handheld that's basically

898
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,400
a

899
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,400
low to mid-range pc in a

900
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,920
Uh handheld form factor so you can basically run

901
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:37,640
All your windows or linux games because you can install either os on there. Wow, and it ships out of the box with linux

902
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,280
Out of the box assuming it ever comes out. Yeah, assuming it ever comes out, of course and to me

903
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:51,800
That's the kind of handheld although admittedly still way too bulky for my taste. It is pretty big. Yeah, I will still probably get one

904
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:55,880
But uh, that's the handheld i've been waiting for a lot of the people, you know

905
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,480
They're like you should get the pyra or you should get the the pie top

906
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,720
Or all those mini boxes and laptops, but to me

907
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,840
This is the one i've been waiting for because it's got

908
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,600
new

909
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,600
recent hardware in it

910
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,880
rather than something that's like several generations old like the

911
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:20,040
The pyre for example has a resistive touch screen, which is very old technology. Yes, totally. This has a

912
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,040
six inch 1080p

913
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,840
Capacitive touch touch screen. Ooh, and look at those like uh, those big

914
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,680
But I don't even know what to call those the pads there for controlling it. Those look nice

915
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:36,280
Oh, yeah, it's it's it reminded me a lot of the um, the steam controller. It does remind me. Yeah, exactly definitely. Um,

916
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:42,760
Interesting. So yeah, look at that like powerful enough to play almost any game on steam portal to dota left for dead 2

917
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,720
To portress 2 they've got benchmarks there somewhere haptic touch pads the evolution of the mouse

918
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,360
Like it's you're not going to get like top-end performance out of it

919
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:54,360
But at least from the the benchmarks they did on their prototype you can play

920
01:04:54,840 --> 01:05:01,480
Most games with medium to high settings on 720p for serious gamers. This looks like maybe something where you know

921
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:07,720
Yeah, it's not it's not your pixel perfect 60 frames per second that you get on your desktop with your sli card, but

922
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:14,840
You still have to take the bus to work sometimes and you can keep gaming. Yeah, so for people wondering the tech specs, um,

923
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:22,440
The the old setup that they were using they haven't updated with the new information yet was the merlin falcon rx421 bd

924
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:29,480
Which is like a 12 to 15 watt soc. Okay. Yeah that had four cores and an iradeon r7

925
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:35,320
Nice the 4gz ram. That sounds actually pretty sweet. Mm-hmm

926
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:40,440
I like that a lot. They claimed at the time that it would get five hours of battery life

927
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:45,880
I don't know if I believe that but maybe if most of that bulk was the battery I could believe that

928
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:50,840
I mean it is it is sizable. I mean we should be we should be clear about that

929
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,240
But it does have a micro sd slot a usb type c

930
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:01,240
connection and hdmi port and wi-fi or

931
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,040
4g lte connectivity

932
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,240
Wow, and apparently a front facing 5 mAh battery

933
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:14,760
Wow, and apparently a front-facing five megapixel camera because everything that is portable has to have a camera

934
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,640
Yes, exactly

935
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,880
Interesting. All right. Well, that's pretty exciting and

936
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:26,840
The multi os support comes with linux right out of the box. Yeah, and yes, I do believe it has a headphone jack

937
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,000
Somebody in the chat unfortunately, you have to ask these kinds of questions today

938
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,840
But does it work with my air pods? It's it's not a phone. Well, it does have bluetooth. There we go. Alrighty then

939
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,320
That's awesome

940
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,320
Yeah, so i'm kind of excited for that

941
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,120
So what do you think about vulkan then?

942
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:51,560
Are you excited for vulkan? Uh, i'm excited for when I actually start seeing games that are shipping with vulkan

943
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:58,920
So I do think I've I found two things around the net this week that maybe will help the first one was just some

944
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:05,880
Beginner friendly vulkan tutorials. So I right out of the bout i'd say you probably don't want to learn vulkan first

945
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:12,520
It probably shouldn't be your first intro to graphics programming. Um, just because it's you know, it's it's a lower level library

946
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,240
Maybe you experiment with some higher level stuff get your fundamentals down

947
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:19,080
There's a lot of math that you likely need to understand as well as you know hardware specifics

948
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:23,720
Uh, but if we want to have vulkan roll out and be successful and be adopted we need

949
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,720
pipelines to get devs involved trained up and be able to you know, make

950
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,520
Make new games with this stuff or new tools or you know, i'm sure also machine learning stuff. So

951
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,640
uh, stephanie hurlbutt

952
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:41,480
Recently put out a call for beginner friendly ways to learn vulkan for those who don't know vulkan is a new graphics

953
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,840
Api in other words a fresh new way to talk to your gpu and make it do things

954
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:48,600
It's managed by the kronos group, which means no one corporation controls it

955
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:53,640
It's pretty cool. Anyone wants to do work on gpus not restricted to graphics programmers

956
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:59,320
That's an important point in today's world should at least have a high level knowledge of what it is by beginner friendly

957
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:04,360
I mean that a total newbie should be able to at least understand what vulkan is and after some programming knowledge is assumed

958
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,400
You know, of course, no graphics api knowledge should be assumed

959
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,960
So this is just kind of a you know, it it talks about a little bit about what what this should be

960
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,960
um

961
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:21,080
And just provide some some really good links and it talks about how vulkan has actually kind of helped people, you know, like, uh,

962
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,560
Her friend dustin has writes that

963
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:30,280
So, how did I finally break through that wall of understanding? I'll give you a hint. It begins with a v and ends with vulkan

964
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:37,160
But vulkan is the hards. I hear you saying shouldn't I start with something easy like open gl and actually

965
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,720
No

966
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:43,320
Maybe you shouldn't the point is that vulkan removes the mystery

967
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:48,200
It spells things out plain as day and for a programmer. This is awesome

968
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:51,560
It's intellectually honest about what it needs and what it's doing

969
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,680
It will teach you what it really means to program a gpu

970
01:08:54,920 --> 01:09:01,160
Don't think of all the extra code as a mountain to climb but instead as a clearly articulated set of instructions to help you get

971
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,920
Where you need?

972
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,280
To go so go forth friends and enjoy learning some vulkan

973
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:10,920
So they've got some links down here at the bottom that can uh, that can help you out. Um, you know

974
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:15,000
It's not top of my list of things to learn but uh, I think there are a lot of people that are and i'm really

975
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,680
excited to see what happens

976
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:22,200
And you know, maybe you try out some of these tutorials. You probably want to go benchmark your results

977
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:28,360
We've got some news there too introducing vk mark more than a vulkan benchmark

978
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,800
Ever since vulkan was first announced a few years ago the idea of creating a vulkan benchmark

979
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,440
In the spirit of you know, gl mark 2 for example

980
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,680
It's been kind of floating around

981
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,920
Recently, thanks to alexandros's employer

982
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,840
Collabora

983
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:46,440
Collabora, I don't know. How do you actually say that? It's the people they do. I think it's collabora. Yeah

984
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,120
Okay, that's what I thought as well, but you know, you got to explore especially i'm in chris's chair today

985
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:54,760
So i'm callabora. I'm kind of obligated to mispronounce things. I think that's how it works

986
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:59,800
I feel like that's a combination chris. No, uh mispronunciation. Yeah. Well, i'm trying to channel them

987
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:04,120
Yeah for inspiration you see anyway, thanks to them

988
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:10,440
This idea has materialized. It's now on gintub github. And the result is the vk mark vulkan benchmark

989
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:15,640
Like its sibling gl mark 2 sibling project vk mark's goals are different from the goals of big

990
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:21,320
monolithic and proprietary benchmarks instead of providing a single complex benchmark vk mark aims to provide an

991
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:25,640
Extensible suite of targeted and configurable benchmarking scenes

992
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:30,600
So just kind of a new tool set as you're learning vulkan. You can kind of go see what what does the performance?

993
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,960
Actually look like so I thought that was kind of fun

994
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,920
And since we're already talking about games, I thought we'd just touch on real quick

995
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,400
Something that we'd been discussing earlier today

996
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,960
Which is the pterodactyl?

997
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,040
panel

998
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,520
pterodactyl panel, it's a free open source game agnostic

999
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,360
game

1000
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,360
management portal, what is pterodactyl?

1001
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,240
It's a free open source game agnostic

1002
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,240
game

1003
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,520
Management portal. What did you think of this? I'd be curious for your opinion

1004
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:05,880
Well, it seemed to me like it was a super easy way to set up game servers if I understood correctly

1005
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:09,800
which appeals to me because I am a lazy sob

1006
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,040
no, you don't say and

1007
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:16,040
Anything that makes that easier is good in my book especially I don't know

1008
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,200
Does it handle like uh steam games like steam servers?

1009
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:25,200
If it did, that would be amazing, because Steam servers are notoriously difficult to

1010
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,200
set up.

1011
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,200
Yeah, that's true.

1012
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,800
It does mention Team Fortress 2 and CSGO here.

1013
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,800
Oh, so then yes.

1014
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,300
It sounds like yes, yeah.

1015
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:36,920
So Teradactyl Panel is a free, open-source, game-agnostic, self-hosted control panel for

1016
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,280
users, networks, and game service providers.

1017
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:44,280
Teradactyl supports games and servers such as Minecraft, ARK Evolution Evolved, CSGO,

1018
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,240
Team Fortress 2, Insurgency, Team Spike 3, Mumble, and many more.

1019
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,400
Some of those aren't games, oh, they're servers, yeah, that makes sense.

1020
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,080
If you're a Linux gamer, you probably don't know, we don't mention ARK.

1021
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,760
ARK is a bad thing these days.

1022
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,760
You're okay.

1023
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:55,760
Yeah.

1024
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,760
You're right, I didn't know.

1025
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:04,400
They did very bad things, like early access DLC and raising their price from $30 to $80.

1026
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,400
Ouch.

1027
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:09,400
See, this is why we need you here, for context, I really appreciate that.

1028
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,920
You'll notice that it looks like you can even use the web UI on a Mac, so even though you're

1029
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,480
not gaming on your Mac, probably you can administer from it.

1030
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,480
Well yeah, you have your Macbook that you're not using off to the side running the website.

1031
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,800
And then Linux is on the server, and then you have your Windows gaming machine, that's

1032
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,800
how it works.

1033
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,680
Or your Linux gaming machine, a lot of those are available on Linux.

1034
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:28,840
That's a very good point.

1035
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,680
So it looks pretty sweet, it's got a nice looking web UI.

1036
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,760
The other thing I like about it is that since it's open source, you know, if you want to

1037
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,920
see support for a new game, you can probably just go open an issue.

1038
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,080
Yeah, exactly, right, like this is something we can do.

1039
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:46,320
It's secure, it's themeable, Docker based, which is maybe a plus or a minus, but I should

1040
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,920
hopefully mean it's really easy to get started with, that's kind of the whole idea.

1041
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,160
It's free, open source, user friendly, and scalable.

1042
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,280
So they've got a bunch of screenshots, I've not had a chance to play with it yet, but

1043
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:03,120
as someone who does like to casual game, but is not always an expert at running the server

1044
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,560
necessarily, just because I don't do it a lot, this looks awesome.

1045
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:11,280
What I would like to actually try is see what, yeah, what does adding a new game look like?

1046
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,760
If it doesn't have out of the box support, what are the hooks there, what is the interface,

1047
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,920
how do I get that started and have it understand the new game?

1048
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:24,720
How can I set this up myself, or maybe see if I could get somebody else to write that

1049
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,720
for me?

1050
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,720
Exactly.

1051
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:27,720
Yeah.

1052
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:32,360
So anyway, I thought that was a great development, might make things a little bit more accessible,

1053
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:36,640
and maybe this is the final drop in the bucket where you've wanted to run your own game server,

1054
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,200
you want to have a game server for you and your friends to play on, but you're not a

1055
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:43,120
great admin, you're a little wary of having that all work.

1056
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,120
Go check out Pterodactyl.

1057
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,120
Yeah.

1058
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,800
So I'm going back to smock for a minute.

1059
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,800
Yeah, sure.

1060
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,720
Somebody in the IRC chat room asked how much it was.

1061
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:56,880
They don't have retail pricing yet, but at least when they did on IndieGoGo, the price

1062
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:03,800
for the original version was $350 for the Wi-Fi version or 550 for the 4G version.

1063
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:10,880
Also supposedly from what I was reading, some of the, or all of the parts are replaceable.

1064
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:16,720
So potentially there could be upgrades in the future to like the GPU and CPU.

1065
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,720
That's awesome.

1066
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,720
Yeah.

1067
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:24,360
And just as an aside, it's a group of Spanish people doing this particular project, which

1068
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,120
is something you don't often see.

1069
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,120
No, totally.

1070
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,120
So go support it.

1071
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,120
Yeah.

1072
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,560
We need a nice diverse community of people making these awesome handhelds.

1073
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,960
So does our very quiet mumble room have anything to say about any of this stuff?

1074
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,960
That's a good question.

1075
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:38,960
Yeah.

1076
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,000
I guess that's enough.

1077
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,240
I was about to say about the VKMark.

1078
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:48,880
It sounds like a wonderful set of tools to develop Vulkan based games, just to continuously

1079
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:55,200
figure out how to get away all the things that are stunting performance and just streamlining

1080
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,200
development.

1081
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,200
Yeah, exactly.

1082
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,880
And maybe something you can set up and maybe not quite continuous, but some sort of pipeline

1083
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,620
that as you're going, you can keep track of what does this look like?

1084
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:07,400
Make sure you don't have any performance regressions or get an idea as you're experimenting with

1085
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,400
new techniques.

1086
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,400
Sure.

1087
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,200
If it's something we'll see integrated into the Ferronics test suite at some point.

1088
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,200
Oh, that's a good question.

1089
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,720
So they can test more Vulkan-y things.

1090
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:19,320
Yeah, as that continues to roll out, interesting.

1091
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,320
Anyone else have any thoughts?

1092
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:25,840
None of these guys are gamers.

1093
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,840
That's true.

1094
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:31,000
It's not something we always talk about, but yeah.

1095
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:37,320
Also Vulkan actually had an update last week, so I'm surprised you guys didn't see that

1096
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:44,200
with new extensions and some parts of it are promoted to stable, so that's also good.

1097
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:51,360
So hopefully they'll announce some more stuff at SIGGRAPH 2017 in a little while, but outside

1098
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,960
of that, not much else.

1099
01:15:53,960 --> 01:16:03,040
I'm just waiting to see the first breakout hit game that runs on Vulkan primarily.

1100
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,800
That still hasn't really happened.

1101
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:12,360
I know it's still like everything has Vulkan as an option, so you kind of really want just

1102
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,560
something that runs on Vulkan.

1103
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,440
It's easy to port over so that it can run on Linux.

1104
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,920
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1105
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:27,320
Well, so we were just talking about trying to make these things easy, trying to make

1106
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,680
them simple to use.

1107
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:33,160
I think that just leads us right into our final sponsor this evening, which is our friends

1108
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,160
over at Ting.

1109
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:39,680
Head on over to linux.ting.com to discover a smarter way to do mobile.

1110
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:45,240
Did you know, Rekai, that the average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month?

1111
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,720
Seems unbelievable, right?

1112
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,480
That seems crazy.

1113
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:53,640
Have you ever been on any of those big name carriers with their unlimited data plans?

1114
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,480
Yeah, especially T-Mobile.

1115
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,440
I'm not a fan of T-Mobile.

1116
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:02,680
They charge a lot of money for not a lot of stuff.

1117
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,240
And it puts you in the position of trying to figure that out, right?

1118
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:09,720
You're like, okay, well, the cheapest plan I can get is X, and I assure you X is more

1119
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,880
than $23.

1120
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:16,040
I have to make sure that I stay within that limit, otherwise I'll get charged a boatload

1121
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,040
more.

1122
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,040
Yeah, either you get charged a ton more.

1123
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,640
Ten kilobytes over.

1124
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:24,160
Or you're in the position of like, I got to try to use my data because I paid for this

1125
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,160
much.

1126
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,240
I'm just not getting the good deal with it.

1127
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:31,560
Or you want only data, but all of the plans tack on minutes and messages that cost a bunch

1128
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,560
of money.

1129
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,400
My friends, this is just a bad way to do mobile.

1130
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,800
Go on over to linux.ting.com and find mobile that just makes sense.

1131
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,280
It's mobile a la carte.

1132
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:46,160
So if you're curious what the beard's talking about here, just go on over to the rates page

1133
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,920
and you will see exactly.

1134
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,880
Turns out you only pay for what you use.

1135
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,280
Each line starts at $6 a month.

1136
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,040
Now there may be some taxes and fees.

1137
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,400
That depends on your locality.

1138
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,920
Ting can't do anything about that.

1139
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,400
That's just a fact of life.

1140
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,480
But they'll charge you $6 per line.

1141
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,740
Two lines, just $12.

1142
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,000
It scales just like that.

1143
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
It's so simple.

1144
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
It's easy to understand.

1145
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,960
And if you have a line you just want to hang around, you're not sure if you're going to

1146
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,800
need it or not, $6 is like nothing.

1147
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,800
That's less than a sandwich.

1148
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,960
I could be wrong, but I think that $6 is actually to cover those taxes and fees.

1149
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,140
That may be true.

1150
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:22,140
Even better.

1151
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,140
But don't quote me on that.

1152
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,140
I could be wrong.

1153
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,140
Don't quote us on anything.

1154
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,180
That's just not cool.

1155
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:30,640
But after that, you just tally up how many minutes you've used, how many megabytes and

1156
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:31,640
how many messages.

1157
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,640
Probably no messages.

1158
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,640
Maybe a few minutes.

1159
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,640
It depends.

1160
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,640
Sometimes people call you.

1161
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:36,760
Nothing you can do about that.

1162
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:41,240
But it doesn't matter because you just pay for what you use.

1163
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,200
So let's say you just, you know, a little bit of messages or a little bit of minutes,

1164
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,200
you know, just to cover it.

1165
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,680
A little bit of messages, same reason.

1166
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:48,880
And then a whole bunch of data.

1167
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,760
You're still only using $32 a month.

1168
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,760
And that's all of it.

1169
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,760
You get three-way calling, tethering.

1170
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,760
That's included.

1171
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,760
You don't have to pay extra.

1172
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:57,760
There's no limits.

1173
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,760
There's no special tethering budget.

1174
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:05,560
And there's no early termination fees, no overages, no weird, strange extra fees.

1175
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,160
It just is simple.

1176
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,360
You can bring your own device.

1177
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:14,260
They support both CDMA and GSM, which is pretty much all of your options here in the U.S.

1178
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:15,500
So you'll be covered.

1179
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:19,920
And honestly, that's great because I know at my parents' house, CDMA is king.

1180
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,840
But in the city, for whatever reason, GSM ends up being a lot better.

1181
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:28,560
So it's super simple to keep those, you know, we can all be on Ting.

1182
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,560
It doesn't matter.

1183
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,920
It's the thing that works for where you're at the most.

1184
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,400
Or for just $6 a month, maybe you have an extra phone or an extra SIM hanging around.

1185
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,760
Totally worth it for $6 a month.

1186
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,080
You can bring your own device or shop their devices.

1187
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,080
Did I mention?

1188
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,080
No, I did not.

1189
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:48,380
But I should have, when you go to linux.ting.com, you'll get a $25 service credit.

1190
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:52,640
So that will probably pay for the majority, if not all, of your first month.

1191
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,720
Or you can use it on one of these shiny new phones.

1192
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:59,100
It's cheap enough that you could have like an emergency backup phone for when you lose

1193
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:02,240
your main phone, tossed away in a drawer.

1194
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,800
And if you lose your phone, well, here's your other phone already ready and ready to go.

1195
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,280
And the Ting interface is so easy.

1196
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:12,600
Whether you're using their app or their web interface, it's just super simple to do that.

1197
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,240
It's super simple to activate or deactivate or register a new phone.

1198
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:22,480
I will say that if you use Ting smartly, your boss that has your phone on a business line

1199
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:30,200
because I have my phone on a business line because I don't use my phone much, he'll forget

1200
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:35,160
that he even has, that he's even paying for your phone because it's that cheap.

1201
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:40,960
Like I mostly use my phone on Wi-Fi, so there's not much data and I make like maybe a dozen

1202
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,960
calls a year at most.

1203
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,960
Yep.

1204
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,760
Mostly to harass me because I didn't finish the text snapshot notes.

1205
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,760
Yeah.

1206
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,760
Well, no, those are usually text messages.

1207
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,760
True.

1208
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,000
When you don't have weird blocking things that don't let me talk to you.

1209
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:57,040
But yeah, I barely hit 10 bucks a month at most.

1210
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,040
That's awesome.

1211
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,920
And that's not something you could do on like any other carrier.

1212
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:01,920
That's the thing.

1213
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,920
Yeah.

1214
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:06,280
And Ting doesn't have to focus on like building new poles or lines or anything.

1215
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:10,040
They can focus on keeping things simple and customer service.

1216
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:16,000
So whether you want to pick up the new Samsung Galaxy 8 or just bring your crappy burner phone,

1217
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
it doesn't matter.

1218
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:23,760
It's super simple, linux.ting.com and thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged

1219
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:24,760
program.

1220
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:25,760
Ting's pretty great.

1221
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,760
Yeah.

1222
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,040
I mean, it's just so easy.

1223
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:35,040
The only time Chris notices that I'm even on the JB Ting account is when I go home for

1224
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:41,280
a week and I actually have to use the data because Maine has no internet.

1225
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,320
Maine has no internet.

1226
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,320
Yikes.

1227
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:49,120
All right, well, I guess it'll be time for tech snap soon so we should probably get out

1228
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,120
of here.

1229
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:53,920
But before we do, I just wanted to talk about a couple of things real quick on our way out.

1230
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,120
The first of which is it's a little bit late now, I know.

1231
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:03,240
Happy birthday, Slackware, 24 years of awesomeness.

1232
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,840
That's pretty cool.

1233
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,720
Something I learned about Chris last week because he's never used Slackware.

1234
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,720
Never?

1235
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,720
Never.

1236
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:10,720
Really?

1237
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,720
Apparently he skipped that phase.

1238
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:12,720
Just wasn't a Slackware person.

1239
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,760
He ended up on Gentoo, but he's never tried Slackware.

1240
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,760
That's hilarious.

1241
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:20,320
He was going to try Slackware at some point, but then he took the Arch challenge and started

1242
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,120
using Arch and never used it.

1243
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,120
Never got back to Slack, huh?

1244
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,120
Yeah.

1245
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,120
What about you?

1246
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:29,880
I used it in the 90s and not since then.

1247
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,560
But I respect people that use Slackware.

1248
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,120
Yeah, I think you have to really.

1249
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,040
It's a very different kind of distribution.

1250
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,040
It is.

1251
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:40,320
And it's the kind of thing that, especially in the Linux community, we shouldn't be focused

1252
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,280
on conformity or trying to press people into our favorite boxes.

1253
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,400
So like you're saying, it's great.

1254
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,040
Slackware offers a particular thing.

1255
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,180
It's a different kind of minimalism.

1256
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:54,960
It's a different kind of minimalism, but I think one that I can certainly respect.

1257
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,280
People who use it know what they're doing and understand the distribution that they're

1258
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,280
using.

1259
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,560
And I think that's great.

1260
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,360
Anyone in the moment room want to chime in about Slackware?

1261
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:07,200
We got any Slack fans here or people who got some good stories?

1262
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,160
Still haven't used it.

1263
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,160
So I'm with Chris.

1264
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,440
Magic was popular in my day.

1265
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,440
So you know.

1266
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:21,040
I feel like if you haven't used Slackware, you're missing a bit of the Linux experience.

1267
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,680
Yeah, you know, that may be true.

1268
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:30,080
It is the first distro, if I remember correctly.

1269
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,080
Is that right?

1270
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,840
I think that's right.

1271
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,120
Let's just find out, folks.

1272
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,160
Or at least the oldest still existing distro.

1273
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,160
Yeah.

1274
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,160
Okay.

1275
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,360
I think it's 2015, which is slightly out of date.

1276
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:43,200
But I don't see how that would change because Slackware is still around.

1277
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:47,760
So the oldest currently existing Linux distribution is Slackware.

1278
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:48,760
Awesome.

1279
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:55,800
I haven't used it that much myself, but my web hoster is using it.

1280
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:03,440
So whenever SFTP files, PHP and HTML files, the web hoster company is using it.

1281
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:08,040
And I have a couple of friends that use it, but I haven't used it myself as a client

1282
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,040
or server.

1283
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,040
That's interesting.

1284
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,840
Other than using it on other servers.

1285
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,920
I would not have expected a web host to use Slackware.

1286
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,880
That seems peculiar.

1287
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,880
I like it, but it's peculiar.

1288
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:20,880
Yeah.

1289
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:21,880
Yeah.

1290
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,680
The Swedish web hosting company FS Data from Skåne using Slackware.

1291
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:30,520
I found out what they're doing, like cat etc. and catting files and stuff.

1292
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,520
Interesting.

1293
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,240
I wonder why they chose Slackware.

1294
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:36,840
You know, I could see it from some, you know, it's kind of like some people who use this,

1295
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:40,920
like Gentoo, for instance, where if you really, if you're doing something special or you have

1296
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,240
a particular way or you're really knowledgeable and you know what you're doing, you know,

1297
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:48,000
it might be customized enough that you can get what you need without all the bloat.

1298
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,540
Or it just might be that web host.

1299
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:51,540
That's what they know.

1300
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:52,540
Yeah.

1301
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:53,540
Yeah.

1302
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:54,540
Might be comfortable with it.

1303
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:55,540
All right.

1304
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,540
Well, then Slack is great.

1305
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:57,540
Keep using Slackware.

1306
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:01,080
Some, another birthday, not really a birthday, but a release that we should talk about just

1307
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:04,200
real quick on the way out here, Magia 6.

1308
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,140
It's finally ready to shine.

1309
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:11,600
The whole Magia community is extremely happy to announce the release of Magia 6, the shining

1310
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,720
result of our longest release cycle so far.

1311
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,020
Comes with many new and exciting features, a new range of installation media and the

1312
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:22,720
usability and stability that can be expected from any Magia release.

1313
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,880
So are you excited?

1314
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:31,600
I have not heard about Magia in so long that I forgot everything about it.

1315
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,760
So I will have to say no.

1316
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,980
Luckily for you, if you're a little concerned, we do in the show notes, we will have a link

1317
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:44,080
back to an article from 2010 called Forking Mandriva Linux.

1318
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,080
The birth of Magia.

1319
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,080
Oh, right.

1320
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,080
It's the Mandriva fork.

1321
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,080
Yep.

1322
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,420
Mandriva, one of my favorite Linux distributions has been forked and the new distribution is

1323
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:51,420
named Magia.

1324
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,940
Mandriva is no longer around, right?

1325
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,880
I believe that is the case.

1326
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:56,880
Yes.

1327
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,740
And so Magia is what lives on.

1328
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,420
It's a fork that's outlived.

1329
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,920
It's fork-y?

1330
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,920
Yes.

1331
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,480
Before that time, there was Mandrake.

1332
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,480
And then Mandrake before that.

1333
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,480
Yeah.

1334
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,880
And before that, that was forked from the Red Hat stuff.

1335
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:10,880
Yeah.

1336
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,840
There is a fork called Open Mandriva.

1337
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,840
Oh, nice.

1338
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,840
Oh, nice.

1339
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,840
Interesting.

1340
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,840
I haven't checked on it.

1341
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,120
That's much other than seeing it on Distro Watch.

1342
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,120
So some of Magia's gold...

1343
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,120
This is Rosa Laff.

1344
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,120
Oh, go on.

1345
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,120
Oh, Rosa Laff.

1346
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,120
Got it.

1347
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,120
So some of Magia's gold...

1348
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,120
Rosa Laff.

1349
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,120
Yeah.

1350
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,880
So some of Magia's gold when they launched...

1351
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:31,880
That makes sense.

1352
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:36,920
We're to make Linux and free software straightforward to use for everyone, provide integrated system

1353
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:41,320
configuration tools, keep a high level of integration between the base system, the desktop

1354
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:47,000
and applications, especially to improve third-party integration, be it free or proprietary, target

1355
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,700
new architectures and form factors, and improve our understanding of computers and electronic

1356
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:52,900
device users.

1357
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:59,600
So the thing with that list is it sounds like the same list that every other fork has.

1358
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,600
It does kind of.

1359
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:08,840
So my question is, I've lately become kind of an anti more distros, more forking kind

1360
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:09,840
of guy.

1361
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:10,840
Understandable.

1362
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:14,440
As you can hear on user.

1363
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:18,840
What sets Magia apart that would make me ever want to use it?

1364
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,440
Do you know?

1365
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,440
I'm not really sure.

1366
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,160
I'm going to throw this to the mumble room.

1367
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,800
Do you guys have any insights here?

1368
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,040
I kind of put this in the show because I wasn't super familiar.

1369
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,040
I did download the ISO.

1370
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:34,200
I didn't have a chance to try it today, but I will try it later this week.

1371
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,560
I never was on the Mandrake, Mandriva lines.

1372
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,720
I don't have a lot of insight there.

1373
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:42,720
I assume it's RPM based because of where it came from.

1374
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:46,160
But at that point, why wouldn't I just use something like Fedora?

1375
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,160
Yeah.

1376
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,160
They do have...

1377
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,760
This new release does have Plasma 5.

1378
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,880
They've got DNF in there.

1379
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,440
They support AppStream and Gnome software and Plasma Discover.

1380
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,280
They've support Copper and the open series build service.

1381
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:03,700
And they've got a new DNF Dragora GUI tool for package management.

1382
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:10,200
So it sounds like Fedora with a couple more GUI apps and open build service.

1383
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,200
Right.

1384
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:15,120
And I guess more focus on providing good integration with third party services.

1385
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:19,400
So maybe this is a Fedora you can install on your friend's computer.

1386
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:25,360
Yeah, but that third party integration, isn't it just a matter of adding a text line to

1387
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,360
something?

1388
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:34,000
See, once again, I don't see the point of having a fork just for that.

1389
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,360
I think that may be true.

1390
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:40,880
But I will say congrats on their sixth release.

1391
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:41,880
That's awesome.

1392
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:42,880
I'm sure they're doing lots of hard work.

1393
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,640
I just personally don't understand why it exists.

1394
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,640
Yeah.

1395
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:49,080
So I think this is a great way to provide feedback if there are people out there either

1396
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:52,200
right now in the Mumble Room or who want to write in and give us feedback to the show.

1397
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,200
I would be curious as well.

1398
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,800
I think that's something ongoing.

1399
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,600
What does it take for a distribution to really carve out its own way and exist?

1400
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,680
Well it should have a consistent release because I'm kind of with the Rekai with this, but

1401
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,680
I thought it was dead.

1402
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:12,560
So you're saying Magia is around, I'm like, wait, they're around?

1403
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,360
I think that's what a lot of people thought.

1404
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:15,360
All right.

1405
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,360
Anyone else?

1406
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,360
Yeah.

1407
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,440
Please chime in.

1408
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,880
Don't break when I update.

1409
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,440
Yeah.

1410
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,440
Don't break when I update.

1411
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,560
Have the software that I want.

1412
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:31,200
That would actually be something in its corner is if they have the third party integrations

1413
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,600
and when you update it doesn't break because that is a problem that some people have with

1414
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:39,880
Fedora when you enable things like copper and they try to go do the DNF update to the

1415
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:44,240
next version or whatever and their system basically breaks.

1416
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,240
Exactly.

1417
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:48,440
So if Magia could handle that, that would be a differentiator.

1418
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,920
I think you've hit the nail on the head.

1419
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:56,360
And with that, I think it's time to bring this episode of Linux Unplugged, episode 206,

1420
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:57,360
to a close.

1421
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,780
Thank you very much for guest hosting, Mr. Rekai.

1422
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:01,120
It has been an absolute pleasure.

1423
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:05,480
If you want to see more of this show, you can head on over to jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1424
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,120
There's the archives, a ton of other shows.

1425
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,280
If you want to see more of me, I'm at Westpain on Twitter.

1426
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,360
And where can they find more of you, Dear Beard?

1427
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:16,960
Well, they can find me on Twitter at twitter.com slash RekaiLP.

1428
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:22,280
Or they can find me on Twitch, streaming usually almost every day.

1429
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,280
Hey-o!

1430
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:27,880
The short URL is R-E-K-D dot net, Rek.net.

1431
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:32,000
Or if that doesn't work for some reason because I screwed something up, it would be twitch.tv

1432
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
slash RekaiLP.

1433
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Perfect.

1434
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,120
Well, thank you very much for joining me.

1435
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,040
Thank you everyone who joined us in today's Mumble Room.

1436
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:40,080
You really make the show, as well as the IRC.

1437
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,040
And hey, we'll see you next week.

1438
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:29,760
Alrighty, thanks everyone, that was a fun show.

1439
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:33,600
Hopefully you guys enjoyed it as well.

1440
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:38,820
So now it's time to go on over to JBtitles.com and get your vote on.

1441
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:41,160
So we have a bit of a problem with the titles here, Wes.

1442
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,560
Do we?

1443
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:47,680
All these titles are about me.

1444
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:50,440
Of course they are.

1445
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:53,400
So you want something filed under B for Beard?

1446
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,400
That's what you want?

1447
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,400
I don't know, Wes.

1448
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:57,240
I'm going to leave it up to you.

1449
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:02,300
I think we leave it up to our dear friends, the voters out there.

1450
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,300
The voting public.

1451
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:10,600
The way this works, though, it's kind of like it's, you might call it an electoral college

1452
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:16,040
where there's the public that votes, but then there's these mysterious people in the background

1453
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,040
that make the final decision.

1454
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,040
We don't speak of them.

1455
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,040
No.

1456
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,040
We can't actually.

1457
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,040
Forbidden.

1458
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,040
And then one of our titles is President.

1459
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,240
For the whole next year.

1460
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:32,040
Ooh, Linux Unshaved, that's kind of fun.

1461
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:43,360
I'm kind of partial to Beardy McBeardface, but at the same time, I feel like having the

1462
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:47,400
title be about me is really self-serving.

1463
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,160
But it's a special episode.

1464
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,160
I guess.

1465
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,160
But what happens next time?

1466
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,160
I'm on.

1467
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,160
Exactly.

1468
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:56,960
Kind of like the Dubstep Alan thing.

1469
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,560
It'll have to be even more creative then.

1470
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:03,280
We named an episode of last Dubstep Alan, and then we had to end last.

1471
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,680
Yeah, that's true.

1472
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:05,680
So think of the show, people.

1473
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,680
We couldn't top that title.

1474
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:07,680
Think of the show.

1475
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:12,600
Man, we just had so much stuff today, I didn't even get to ramble about containers at all.

1476
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,400
You didn't get to ramble about containers.

1477
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:18,880
You didn't get to piss off everybody that was listening by talking about Windows games

1478
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:19,880
like you wanted to.

1479
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:20,880
That's true, yeah.

1480
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,000
Wes wanted to do that, by the way, not me.

1481
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Not you.

1482
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,040
You were a willing participant.

1483
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,720
I said we could do whatever you wanted, but I wasn't going to take responsibility.

1484
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,720
That's what you always say.

1485
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:33,360
No one wants to take responsibility.

1486
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,480
I've been too busy with file systems to even game.

1487
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,480
Hey, that's not a bad thing.

1488
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:42,080
I'm going to rat Wes out here.

1489
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,080
Wes has been gaming on a Windows box, I'm told.

1490
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:48,200
There is now one in my house, yeah, it's true.

1491
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,200
It's true.

1492
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,200
Last fever.

1493
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,200
Yeah, pretty much.

1494
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,200
You're losing quite a bit.

1495
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,200
Oh, come on, Wes.

1496
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,520
I'm still also gaming on a Windows box.

1497
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:56,520
It has both.

1498
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,720
Wait, wait, you're gaming on a Windows box and also a Windows box?

1499
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,720
I mean Linux box.

1500
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,160
God, Windows has infected me.

1501
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:02,160
What am I going to do?

1502
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:05,280
This is what happens, Wes, that's what I'm told.

1503
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,560
Windows isn't good for anything.

1504
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:12,200
So in full disclosure, it's not like it's a shared system that is dual boots, Linux

1505
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:13,200
and Windows.

1506
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:17,580
It just also now boots Windows for some games that other people in my household would like

1507
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:21,660
to play, but it does open the possibility of if there is a Windows game that I want

1508
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:25,120
to play or have wanted to play or should be playing, I now can.

1509
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,120
Not saying I will.

1510
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:30,800
I still keep it booted into Linux most of the time, but it's a new world.

1511
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:31,800
Some games that I don't like.

1512
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:32,800
Or an old world that I'm back to.

1513
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,680
Are available for Linux that you might be interested in, Factorio.

1514
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,280
Oh, yeah, I've seen you stream in that.

1515
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,280
And Rimworld.

1516
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,280
Oh, okay.

1517
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,280
I'll check those out.

1518
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,280
Yeah.

1519
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,160
Yeah, I tried the beta of Lore Breaker.

1520
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,160
That's kind of fun.

1521
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:51,880
New FPS by the guy that did some UT stuff, Cliff V. Also the Battlefield games doesn't

1522
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,560
work on Linux.

1523
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,760
One of my most entertaining games.

1524
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,680
I've been watching a lot of it.

1525
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:04,880
I'm not playing it much because I'm really bad at it, but it's Player Unknown's Battlegrounds.

1526
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:11,320
It's kind of a battle royale game with more of a realistic bent.

1527
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:16,200
So you just have like a hundred people that are dropped from a plane all across a map

1528
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:21,680
and you kill everybody until there's only one person left and they're the winner.

1529
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,800
Yeah, it's similar to DayZ, right?

1530
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:29,880
But instead of having like that eternal continuous map, you have a closing in map.

1531
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:34,160
So you have to stay within certain bounds of a certain radius or else you'll die.

1532
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:38,160
That way it keeps it interesting because people have to continuously get closer to each other.

1533
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:42,880
Yeah, because you start with the full map and then as time progresses, you have a circle

1534
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:46,920
on the map that gets smaller and smaller and people that are outside of that slowly take

1535
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:51,880
damage and later in the game, they take more damage until basically, if you're outside

1536
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:54,800
that circle, you'll die within a couple of seconds.

1537
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,800
Wow.

1538
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:56,800
Okay.

1539
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,640
So it kind of forces PvP until there's only one person left.

1540
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:01,640
Cool.

1541
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:04,320
I've seen a coworker played some of that.

1542
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,880
It's a lot of fun.

1543
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:10,120
Even when you're bad at it, it's still fun.

1544
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,320
I might have to give that a shot.

1545
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,880
There's a lot of good suggestions here.

1546
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,360
There we go.

1547
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:15,360
All right.

1548
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:22,400
There's a humble bundle of some Telltale games, but I don't think they run on Linux.

1549
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,600
Some of them do.

1550
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,600
I believe.

1551
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:29,200
I thought I saw a Linux icon on there.

1552
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,720
I could be wrong.

1553
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:34,840
But even if they don't, if you happen to have a Windows box, I would highly recommend any

1554
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:35,840
of the Telltale games.

1555
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,480
They're almost all great games.

1556
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:38,480
That's awesome.

1557
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:44,160
They're all point and click games, but they are very story heavy and most of them are

1558
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:50,960
based on existing franchises like The Walking Dead or Back to the Future or Batman or Minecraft.

1559
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,640
Borderlands.

1560
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,560
The Borderlands one is actually really funny.

1561
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,560
Nice.

1562
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:56,560
It is.

1563
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,560
I've played the entire thing.

1564
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:58,560
It's so awesome.

1565
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,760
Even if you don't traditionally like point and click games, I would still recommend trying

1566
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:02,760
them.

1567
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:06,760
My favorite one, I think, is The Walking Dead series, which if you're a fan of The Walking

1568
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,720
Dead, it's amazing.

1569
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:13,360
If you're not a fan of The Walking Dead, it's still a fun zombie story.

1570
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,360
Huh.

1571
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:21,040
Here's a classic, basically Beneath a Steel Sky is available as a flat pack or a snap,

1572
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,040
I think.

1573
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,040
Oh, that's nice.

1574
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,440
That's a really old school point and click game.

1575
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:25,440
It's really fun to play.

1576
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:29,360
Once you've got the audio working too and it works, so it's nice.

1577
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,360
That's awesome.

1578
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:31,360
Here's another tip.

1579
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:34,920
I used to play Monkey Island on Linux when I was younger.

1580
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,200
You can play the older adventure games in SCUMVM.

1581
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,520
Is that right?

1582
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:45,160
That's something too, one of the JBLives in the chatroom said you could probably play

1583
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:51,280
most of the tailgates via Wine because they're on the simpler end of the technology scale.

1584
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,320
Yeah, you know, that's nice.

1585
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:59,520
Also hitting back on, you had two machines, one that's Windows and one that's Linux.

1586
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:06,920
I don't know how good Windows 10 supports IOMMUs, but maybe you could just bypass hardware

1587
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:12,800
to your Windows install on the partition and play those games on Linux.

1588
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,240
Oh, virtualize it?

1589
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,040
Yeah, that's totally worth investigating.

1590
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:19,960
I'll have to see what that hardware supports.

1591
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:24,040
The slightly older system with a modern GPU, so I'll have to look into that.

1592
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:28,800
Okay, so I guess we should pick a title and get out of here because we've got a live tech

1593
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,800
snap coming up next.

1594
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,720
I've got to go edit a show.

1595
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,160
And you've got to edit a show.

1596
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:38,400
So Linux Unshaved or Beardy McBeardface.

1597
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:41,640
As the guest, I think it's up to you, Mr. Beard.

1598
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,200
Or Unplugging the Beard or the Bold in the Beardy Fool.

1599
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,300
Those are all hilarious.

1600
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:47,300
Not that SS.

1601
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:50,080
I like that too.

1602
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,080
What do you think?

1603
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:54,480
I think we're going to stay away from the SS status.

1604
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,920
Yeah, I agree.

1605
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:00,960
Let me refresh here.

1606
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:01,960
Yeah.

1607
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:03,440
Doesn't it auto refresh?

1608
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:04,440
Didn't you make this?

1609
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:07,920
Well, it doesn't seem to be working on mobile, so that's a bug.

1610
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:08,920
File a bug.

1611
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:12,960
Yeah, it hasn't been working on desktop for me.

1612
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:19,280
Also, you had to restart JBot earlier, so that might be a thing.

1613
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:23,720
Yeah, that might have been it.

1614
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:24,720
Yeah, that's fair.

1615
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:32,400
Yeah, as I mentioned in the show, JBot has a memory leak that I can't really track down,

1616
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:37,640
and it only happens on certain distributions, which makes it even weirder.

1617
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:38,640
Weird.

1618
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:43,240
Yeah, by the way, I'm looking for people to help me with JBot because I have no time to

1619
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:44,240
develop it.

1620
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:45,240
That's fair.

1621
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:47,240
So if anybody knows Ruby and wants to help out.

1622
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,800
Jim and I know Ruby now.

1623
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,800
I should help.

1624
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:50,800
All right.

1625
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,800
I'll help.

1626
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:52,800
I'll help.

1627
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:53,800
Stop twisting my arm.

1628
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:58,440
I guess we're going to go with the beard title, since that's all the top-rode titles.

1629
01:39:58,440 --> 01:39:59,440
Yeah.

1630
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:03,240
Well, I do kind of like init it to win it.

1631
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:04,240
I also like that.

1632
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:05,240
Or init to win it.

1633
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,240
Init to win it.

1634
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:09,920
I'd be okay with that if that's what you want to choose.

1635
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,840
Colonel Panic offers to rewrite it in a real programming language.

1636
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,880
I mean, if you want to support it, then yes, do it.

1637
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:16,880
Do it.

1638
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:22,000
No, don't, because I won't use it.

1639
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Ruby or not.

1640
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:28,000
The problem is I'm the one at the end of the day that has to maintain it and make sure

1641
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,560
it's running for JB.

1642
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:31,120
And if something breaks, I have to fix it.

1643
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:33,360
So I still have to know the language.

1644
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,940
And the only language I'm really comfortable in is Ruby.

1645
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:36,940
That's fair then.

1646
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:40,360
I think that's how a lot of things get made.

1647
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:45,520
One last gaming thing is there's a game called a survival game called The Long Dark that

1648
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,520
I've been playing.

1649
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:47,520
It's a good game.

1650
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:55,320
It's got 205 hours played in it and it's coming out of early access in August 1st.

1651
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:58,920
So the story mode will finally be coming out.

1652
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:05,200
So maybe once I've played that, I can say whether it's good or not for someone to buy.

1653
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:09,800
Well if we're going to talk about games where there's thousands of hours in games, I can

1654
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,600
recommend a couple.

1655
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,520
Civilization 5, great game.

1656
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:17,720
I have like 600 hours in that game.

1657
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:25,800
Path of Exile which is kind of like a Diablo 2 clone with a much more extensive skill tree.

1658
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:30,680
We're talking like hundreds of different variations on skills.

1659
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:34,240
That's something if you like action RPG kind of stuff.

1660
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:40,040
And one that I'll probably get a lot of crap for from some gamers, Final Fantasy XIV

1661
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:44,640
Online is an amazing story based MMO.

1662
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:48,240
I hate most MMOs because they all feel like fetch quests.

1663
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:51,760
But Final Fantasy XIV, it has a crap ton of stories.

1664
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:57,120
So it kind of just feels like a regular RPG where you happen to be playing with other

1665
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,120
people.

1666
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,120
Nice.

1667
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,880
That actually kind of sounds exactly like what I want.

1668
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:06,800
I think I have like $3,500 in that game.

1669
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,760
I'm impressed.

1670
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:10,920
I think Path of Exile is like $1,500.

1671
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,040
I game a lot.

1672
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,040
You sure do.

1673
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,840
And that's why we love you.

1674
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:17,400
All right, we should probably get out of here.

1675
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,520
Thank you everyone for an awesome show.

1676
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:23,640
Your feedback and input has been very much appreciated and a lot of fun chatting about

1677
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:25,580
games too surprisingly.

1678
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:26,580
So this is awesome.

1679
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:27,580
Thank you very much.

1680
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:28,580
Stay tuned.

1681
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:32,880
We'll have a live tech snap coming right up.

1682
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:33,880
Lots to come.

1683
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:34,880
Yeah.

1684
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:35,880
Awesome.

1685
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:39,080
So streams will blip, et cetera, et cetera.

1686
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,920
Hey, Elixir's actually kind of fun there, Colonel Panic.

1687
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,920
Anyway.

1688
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:48,120
I actually have an article I can link about how Discord used Elixir to scale to millions

1689
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,120
of people.

1690
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,080
I'll put that in the charm later.

1691
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:56,600
And don't worry, the Beam VM is written in old school ADC so everyone can be happy.

1692
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:57,600
Nice.

1693
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,200
Okay, with that, let's get things switched over.

1694
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:00,200
Beard, thank you so much.

1695
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,200
This has been a lot of fun.

1696
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,200
We'll have to do more shows again.

1697
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,200
Let's get rid of that Chris guy.

1698
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,200
We'll just post all the shows together.

1699
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:05,200
Yeah, who needs it?

1700
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:06,720
It's Jay in Montana.

1701
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:12,120
I'll take over on LAN and then we'll host this together.

1702
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:15,040
I don't gotta do anything for tech stuff because you got that under control.

1703
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,960
I guess I have to do on filter?

1704
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:17,960
Yes, you do.

1705
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:18,960
Or do you want to do that?

1706
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,920
Well, we can switch back and forth or bring Noah on.

1707
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:27,240
I guess I'm going to have to replace you with Chris on user error since I'm already on there.

1708
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:28,760
Or Chase does user error?

1709
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:29,760
I don't know.

1710
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,520
We'll replace Noah with Chase.

1711
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:32,520
There we go.

1712
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:33,520
Yeah.

1713
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:34,520
Okay, I think we've got it settled.

1714
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:37,520
And we'll never speak about the hair again.

1715
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,520
Yeah.

1716
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:39,520
Woo!

1717
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,520
Alrighty.

1718
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:41,520
He can just stay in that Montana place.

1719
01:43:41,520 --> 01:44:08,340
Hopefully.
