WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
Since we're in pre-show mode, we should crack open our beers and talk a little open source

00:05.120 --> 00:06.760
retro gaming hardware.

00:06.760 --> 00:08.600
It's called the Game Shell.

00:08.600 --> 00:12.920
And I think Poby was saying on the Ubuntu podcast that he's a backer of this thing.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.360
It looks just like a Game Boy with a few more buttons on it.

00:16.360 --> 00:22.040
And of course, it's a modular open source hardware that is meant to run classic games.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.320
And the price is pretty reasonable.

00:24.320 --> 00:29.320
You can get the early bird price at 108 bucks.

00:29.320 --> 00:34.560
And they have real like already built hardware playing Doom, of course.

00:34.560 --> 00:35.560
That's the handheld one.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.560
Yeah.

00:36.560 --> 00:37.560
Yeah.

00:37.560 --> 00:38.560
It looks just like an old retro Game Boy.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.560
The old black and white Game Boy.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.640
Well, see, the problem with that is how likely is it going to be that Nintendo shuts this

00:43.640 --> 00:45.920
down because it looks too similar?

00:45.920 --> 00:46.920
Maybe you think.

00:46.920 --> 00:47.920
Boy, that would be pretty awful.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.440
Nintendo is pretty heavy handed with their confidence.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.800
They are pretty litigious.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.940
The thing is, is you have seen other products kind of like this.

00:54.940 --> 00:57.440
This is the most Game Boy looking.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.160
It is colored screen that one of the pictures they show it being black and white, but it

01:00.160 --> 01:01.740
does have a colored screen.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.400
And of course, it runs different emulators.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.080
It's got support for Lua and Python.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.780
Of course, it's an open source operating system.

01:07.780 --> 01:10.400
The hardware is open, of course, of course, of course.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.200
Yeah, I think it's pretty neat.

01:12.200 --> 01:17.520
They got a pretty reasonable like set of goals and stretch goals and they're doing well on

01:17.520 --> 01:18.520
funding.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.960
They wanted $50,000.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.160
And as we record this episode, they've raised $252,509.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.160
Hey-oh.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.160
Yeah.

01:26.160 --> 01:30.000
They've got 2,280 backers.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Not too shabby.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
No, they're doing great.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
So this is a game show.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
It's a Kickstarter.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.300
So, you know, the usual Kickstarter disclaimers apply.

01:36.300 --> 01:53.520
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 226 for December 5th, 2017.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.580
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's counting down the days to

01:57.580 --> 01:58.680
the new year.

01:58.680 --> 01:59.680
My name is Chris.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.680
My name is Wes.

02:00.680 --> 02:01.680
Hello, Wes.

02:01.680 --> 02:02.680
And hello, Beard.

02:02.680 --> 02:03.680
Hello.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.680
Guys, today's a big episode on the show.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.680
Yeah.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.680
You know, we do that from time to time.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.680
Just sneak them in.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
It happens.

02:08.680 --> 02:13.120
I don't know how this happens for an unplugged show, but coming up on today's humble podcast.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.520
That's right.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.480
We're going to kick things off with a new Runs Linux this week, just for old time's

02:17.480 --> 02:18.480
sake.

02:18.480 --> 02:22.140
We'll get into that, then some local community news, and then something that Google's doing

02:22.140 --> 02:24.160
to get people into open source.

02:24.160 --> 02:27.960
Those of you looking for the perfect remote desktop solution, we may have you covered.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.360
Say it's not so.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.360
It could be so.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.360
It could be.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.360
Ugh.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.320
And then we have some great news for you VLC lovers.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.440
I think really, really great news.

02:36.440 --> 02:43.240
And then, before we get to the Gentoo challenge this week, I want to take a moment, if I could,

02:43.240 --> 02:48.800
carve out a little bit of your time, and tell you a little bit why Linux users, more than

02:48.800 --> 02:54.800
just about any other segment of the internet, should probably care a little bit about Bitcoin.

02:54.800 --> 02:59.480
So Bitcoin for Linux users, why you should care about it, and specifically, I'm going

02:59.480 --> 03:02.800
to answer a couple of common questions that I think Bitcoin doubters have.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.640
Not that I'm trying to convince anybody, but I just want to give you a different perspective

03:06.640 --> 03:11.280
and maybe help put some context into why the hell, as we record this episode, one single

03:11.280 --> 03:16.600
Bitcoin is over 11,000 green US BACs.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.000
What is going on?

03:19.000 --> 03:23.600
Well, there is an expert in the Bitcoin community who I have pulled a few quotes from that'll

03:23.600 --> 03:29.280
explain how Bitcoin compares to services like PayPal, how to think about all these other

03:29.280 --> 03:33.760
cryptocurrencies, these altcoins that are coming out and what they mean, and is this

03:33.760 --> 03:35.840
going to be an open source mess?

03:35.840 --> 03:40.680
And then the potentials that Bitcoin has for charity, as well as why, without question,

03:40.680 --> 03:44.760
even if it's not Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies are 100% here.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.880
They're never going back in the bottle.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.640
They are here forever.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.680
And I'll kind of give you the ironclad reasoning behind all of that, too.

03:51.680 --> 03:55.680
So this is really the pitch on why you should care as a Linux user, because it's an open

03:55.680 --> 03:58.120
source money protocol.

03:58.120 --> 04:03.760
And it's going to take over the world in one degree, not like the way Linux has.

04:03.760 --> 04:04.760
Right.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.600
It's easy to overstate, but it's also potentially serious.

04:07.600 --> 04:11.820
If you were back in the early 90s right now looking at Linux, that's what Bitcoin is.

04:11.820 --> 04:15.920
And so it's going to be an implementation detail that is incredibly valuable, just like

04:15.920 --> 04:20.040
Linux is for Android and a bunch of set top boxes.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.040
And I'm going to explain why.

04:21.040 --> 04:24.200
And so that's why you should care about Bitcoin, because it's at the early stage that Linux

04:24.200 --> 04:25.200
was.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.960
And it's also an open source project that's going to change people's lives, it's going

04:27.960 --> 04:29.560
to create new work.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.520
And the thing you're going to see a lot of is tons and tons and tons of hype.

04:33.520 --> 04:38.000
In fact, you're already starting to see blockchain apps coming out.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.040
Did you see this CryptoKitties app that everybody's talking about?

04:41.040 --> 04:42.320
CryptoKitties.

04:42.320 --> 04:48.040
And there's a bunch of other ones that are coming out now that help you invest in Bitcoin.

04:48.040 --> 04:54.560
And Joe and I recently talked about one that's partying up with Yala for Sailfish.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.560
Is that right?

04:55.560 --> 04:59.000
And they're creating a Zip currency that developers will use inside the development community

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
and bug testers.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.640
And they're going to create their own cryptocurrency for development on Sailfish.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.640
All kinds of interesting things are happening.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.720
And we'll give you some of the background, but we won't take too much of your time, because

05:10.720 --> 05:14.280
nominally today, we are going to get into the Bitcoin challenge.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.520
We're going to kick it off officially here in a few minutes.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.520
So get your systems ready.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.080
Then we're going to check in with folks in the virtual lug and see how they're doing.

05:21.080 --> 05:27.040
And then we'll reveal the desktop environment that the audience voted on for West to build

05:27.040 --> 05:29.040
in our Gen 2 challenge.

05:29.040 --> 05:33.240
So without going any further, let's stop right now and bring in that virtual lug.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Hello.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Howdy.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I love it, every.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Every.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Single.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Time.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Hello, guys.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
It is good to hear from you.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.760
So let's kick it off with a little community news.

05:47.760 --> 05:51.840
And this one just sort of, I don't know if you could really classify this as community,

05:51.840 --> 05:56.100
but for nostalgia purposes, for old time's sake, I wanted to start off with Arun's Linux

05:56.100 --> 05:57.100
this week.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.080
And this one's a little odd.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.080
It is a little odd.

06:00.080 --> 06:06.780
Amazon has released an Ubuntu driven AWS deep lens cam.

06:06.780 --> 06:11.440
And it's got a four megapixel machine learning camera with AWS hooks that runs Ubuntu on

06:11.440 --> 06:14.200
an Intel Cherry Trail system on a chip.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.640
So it's an Atom processor.

06:15.640 --> 06:21.200
It's got a HD ready AWS deep lens development camera, is for machine learning, available

06:21.200 --> 06:23.640
for $250 and a pre-order.

06:23.640 --> 06:32.480
And to describe the look of it is like a big boxy webcam bolted on top of like a gigabyte

06:32.480 --> 06:33.480
nook, like a tiny nook.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.240
Yeah, it does look like that.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.160
And this thing's running Ubuntu 16.04.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.880
Or maybe like a cute robot with no hands and legs.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.760
Yeah, like the beginnings of it.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.360
One that is aware of its environment but can't interact in any way.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.140
Right, it's just watching and brooding.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.140
With a nice howl circle.

06:47.140 --> 06:51.200
Yeah, it does have a circle, oh man.

06:51.200 --> 06:55.480
So it's billed as the world's first video camera optimized to run machine learning models

06:55.480 --> 07:00.460
and perform inference on the device, inference from the images.

07:00.460 --> 07:05.360
It's Wi-Fi enabled and it's working with the Amazon SageMaker development framework for

07:05.360 --> 07:07.820
managing machine learning models.

07:07.820 --> 07:11.040
Now that's something that I'm just sort of tossing in there, but that's kind of a big

07:11.040 --> 07:12.040
deal.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.480
Like the models around machine learning are sort of like the recipes, right?

07:15.480 --> 07:19.760
And so if you have a marketplace to share these recipes, then you can take your hardware

07:19.760 --> 07:23.160
and you can go grab a recipe and all of a sudden you can take your box and you can start

07:23.160 --> 07:25.720
doing machine learning, just any average Joe.

07:25.720 --> 07:31.400
And so we got the SageMaker development framework for managing machine learning model processing

07:31.400 --> 07:33.240
on this thing.

07:33.240 --> 07:37.600
And some of the things that it can detect, there's like I think a category of 30 different

07:37.600 --> 07:39.760
activities that this thing is aware of.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.440
It obviously has face detection and object detection, it can detect the difference between

07:43.440 --> 07:49.600
a cat and a dog, which is similar to Google's TensorFlow AI vision kit, which is available

07:49.600 --> 07:51.560
for the Raspberry Pi Zero.

07:51.560 --> 07:56.640
But this thing can also detect different activities that you're doing, ranging from brushing your

07:56.640 --> 08:00.360
teeth to playing guitar, probably baiting and other things I would imagine this thing

08:00.360 --> 08:02.880
is going to be able to recognize.

08:02.880 --> 08:07.080
And you'll be able to train it to learn new behaviors as well.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.080
And then it all can talk back up to AWS.

08:10.080 --> 08:19.480
1604 LTS on an Intel Atom, the thing has 106 gigaflops of performance.

08:19.480 --> 08:25.560
The Cherry Trail Atom processor with 8 gigs of RAM, a micro SD slot, 16 gigabytes of flash,

08:25.560 --> 08:31.520
which can be expanded as dual band Wi-Fi, USB ports, HDMI out, an audio jack, reset

08:31.520 --> 08:37.320
buttons and a power jack, it's pretty well spec'd, does 14 images a second by default.

08:37.320 --> 08:40.800
So it's not like it's, it also does have a video mode, but by default has taken 14 images

08:40.800 --> 08:41.800
a second.

08:41.800 --> 08:42.800
Yeah.

08:42.800 --> 08:47.680
I mean, but it does bring machine learning down to a price point for an individual because

08:47.680 --> 08:49.160
it's only 250 bucks.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.400
So that's what this is for.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.360
This is, this isn't a consumer product.

08:52.360 --> 08:57.560
This is for people at home, enthusiasts or developers to learn machine learning.

08:57.560 --> 09:01.440
Is that because I'm trying, I am, I'm struggling to understand why the hell anybody would ever

09:01.440 --> 09:02.440
want a product like this.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.440
Well, yeah.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.960
In traditional AWS fashion, they've made it as confusing as possible for someone who isn't

09:06.960 --> 09:10.960
already invested in their ecosystem to understand what the heck is going on.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.840
So if I'm leveraging the rest of their machine learning infrastructure, this thing could

09:13.840 --> 09:14.840
be extremely handy.

09:14.840 --> 09:15.840
Yeah.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.360
Well, if you like to read their, yeah, if you read their like PR announcement, you'll

09:17.360 --> 09:19.640
see they reference their own products like 17 times.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.760
So that'll give you a sense of how interconnected it can be.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.760
Yeah.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.760
You're right.

09:24.760 --> 09:29.560
It's a cheap way of leveraging AWS to do machine learning interfacing with the real world.

09:29.560 --> 09:30.560
Yeah.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.560
Okay.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.560
All right.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.560
Was somebody in the mumble room going to chime in?

09:33.560 --> 09:34.560
Yeah.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.560
Yeah.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
Actually he covered it all.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.560
Yeah.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.560
I guess.

09:38.560 --> 09:39.560
Okay.

09:39.560 --> 09:43.640
I can see in that context, it doesn't creep me out as bad in that context.

09:43.640 --> 09:44.640
Yeah.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.080
Just where's this going eventually?

09:46.080 --> 09:49.480
Is this going in echoes eventually?

09:49.480 --> 09:53.460
In some regards, I wouldn't mind my echo telling me when Dylan's come home from school versus

09:53.460 --> 09:54.460
when Abby's come home.

09:54.460 --> 09:57.320
You got the video echo, so it's already like 60% of the way there.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.920
I also see it as their cloud play.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.440
They're launching more and more products to help like, the more machine learning you do,

10:03.440 --> 10:06.200
that's a lot of math, a lot of numbers that end up being crunched somewhere.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.560
AWS obviously wants you to crunch those numbers on its cloud.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.200
So if they can make like development kits, that's why they have all these other things

10:12.200 --> 10:16.000
like cloud nine, they're like cloud desktop, anything they can get you to like, if it's

10:16.000 --> 10:20.040
easier to integrate with them, and then when you go to production and spend real money,

10:20.040 --> 10:21.040
that's where you go.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.040
Right.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.040
You're already there.

10:23.040 --> 10:27.800
And I think they are having a better strategy vision on this than Google at this moment

10:27.800 --> 10:32.400
because of that point, precisely, that actually you will get to see the data yourself.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.040
It doesn't just get crunched on their servers, but you actually get to be able to get the

10:36.040 --> 10:40.120
data back because of how their services are modeled.

10:40.120 --> 10:43.420
And in comparison, the Google is not doing that, it's doing the Google Assistant that

10:43.420 --> 10:48.800
you can just put it in any place and you can just use their service as a whole package.

10:48.800 --> 10:55.600
It is easier to bury entry, but you don't have the control there.

10:55.600 --> 11:00.800
The other thing it underscores just though is that Amazon sure uses the heck out of Linux.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.160
It's here, it's in their data centers, it's all over the place.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.840
Yeah, and they're putting 1604 Ubuntu on there, it's the next 86 box.

11:05.840 --> 11:10.920
I do think this is also kind of a thing where they are giving a cheap product to get developers

11:10.920 --> 11:14.840
to expand the capabilities of their framework for them.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.840
Yeah.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.320
I mean, they can probably take advantage of those models too, right?

11:18.320 --> 11:19.720
So that makes sense.

11:19.720 --> 11:24.280
And if it's a price point that's around the cost of a high-end Echo or Kindle that you

11:24.280 --> 11:28.920
can use to get into machine learning and then it plugs into the AWS infrastructure, it makes

11:28.920 --> 11:29.920
sense.

11:29.920 --> 11:34.800
Plus, they also get feedback on what developers doing this kind of stuff actually want for

11:34.800 --> 11:35.800
basically free.

11:35.800 --> 11:36.800
Yeah.

11:36.800 --> 11:37.800
Oh, clever, Amazon.

11:37.800 --> 11:41.200
So let's talk about something else that's clever.

11:41.200 --> 11:46.760
Linux Fest Northwest, April 28th and 29th, 2018, coming up pretty soon, surprisingly.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.360
Yeah, the April 28th and 29th.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.520
They move it around from time to time.

11:50.520 --> 11:51.520
They sure do.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.800
This is the 19th year of Linux Fest.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.800
Wow.

11:54.800 --> 11:58.920
Yeah, and I feel like they're at a transition point because different conferences have come

11:58.920 --> 12:00.920
up over those years, obviously.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.560
A lot of commercial conferences in the last 19 years have come up.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.840
So they're trying something a little new.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.720
They're doing a message in a bottle theme, which I think is interesting.

12:08.720 --> 12:12.880
They say they're encouraging but not requiring that presenters touch on a theme, message

12:12.880 --> 12:16.960
in a bottle, security, containerization, and personal data.

12:16.960 --> 12:20.040
They don't have to follow that, but they do have a call out for papers right now if you're

12:20.040 --> 12:22.440
going to be at Linux Fest Northwest or call out for presenters.

12:22.440 --> 12:27.860
Why not help them make it a good 19 years because it is a transition point for them

12:27.860 --> 12:31.240
where they can become a slightly different style conference and it'll be interesting

12:31.240 --> 12:32.800
to see which direction they go.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.160
I would also say it's just such a friendly event.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.920
Like if you haven't spoke before, you want to speak, you're not sure like, well, what

12:37.920 --> 12:38.920
is this?

12:38.920 --> 12:39.920
You will have a great audience.

12:39.920 --> 12:44.160
You'll have lots of people at your talk, most likely, if it's Linux or anything close to

12:44.160 --> 12:45.160
that.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.560
And everyone's just in a happy, sharing, open source mood.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.560
Yeah.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.640
And it's a good town in the Pacific Northwest to visit.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.640
Yeah.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.360
And even if your talk goes terribly, just go get some delicious food in Bellingham.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.900
Yeah, Bellingham's got some great restaurants, got a great vibe going, and it's got tons

12:57.900 --> 12:58.900
of beer.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.180
Now, it's a little busy during Linux Fest Northwest weekend, so you got to plan for

13:01.180 --> 13:02.480
that a little bit.

13:02.480 --> 13:06.280
But there's also just a lot of social events going on at the hotels, there's game nights

13:06.280 --> 13:09.920
going on, people sitting around talking about Linux and all that stuff.

13:09.920 --> 13:15.480
LinuxFestNorthwest.org, if you want to know more, if you want to maybe submit a paper,

13:15.480 --> 13:16.480
we're going to be there.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.680
We're going to be doing something different than we've ever done, too.

13:18.680 --> 13:22.480
I think we may have a live stream going, but I think we'll be doing something different.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.920
Instead of us sitting there like emceeing the booth, it'll be different productions

13:25.920 --> 13:29.080
happening live at Linux Fest that people can tune in for.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.240
Maybe some shows that aren't traditionally live.

13:31.240 --> 13:32.240
Yeah.

13:32.240 --> 13:40.440
But while those shows are being recorded, if it's one that not you or I or Noah is on,

13:40.440 --> 13:43.760
we'll be out on the floor going to the sessions talking to people.

13:43.760 --> 13:44.760
We'll be out and about.

13:44.760 --> 13:45.760
The whole experience.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.760
Yeah, it's going to be really good, I think.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.920
But Chris, how are we going to get JB into a bottle?

13:49.920 --> 13:54.400
Well, I could talk about security and personal data.

13:54.400 --> 13:59.280
Containerization, I feel like that just sort of turns me off a little bit when I hear that,

13:59.280 --> 14:03.120
because it's almost like it's like it's slabbed in there like now.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.340
You got to talk about containerization, and you got to talk about Docker.

14:06.340 --> 14:08.840
We got to talk about containers, because that's mandatory.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.840
You got a conference, you got to talk about containers.

14:10.840 --> 14:11.840
Absolutely.

14:11.840 --> 14:12.840
In fact, we should even create ContainerCon.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.640
That's the only reason to have a conference is to talk about containers.

14:15.640 --> 14:16.640
It's OK, Chris.

14:16.640 --> 14:17.640
You can just go to DockerCon.

14:17.640 --> 14:21.720
Well, I've been to ContainerCon, and I've been to DockerCon, and I've been to LinuxCon,

14:21.720 --> 14:27.640
and I've been to all of these where they just go all in on containerization.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.520
It sort of defocuses it instead of just putting it all in one place.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.160
It sort of diffuses it, and it's not as useful.

14:33.160 --> 14:39.600
It could be different with a convention like Linux Fest Northwest, though, because it's

14:39.600 --> 14:40.600
more community focused.

14:40.600 --> 14:41.600
Right.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.280
Yeah, you got people in the industry coming to do talks.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.280
It's a different thing.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.280
So I'm curious to see how it goes.

14:45.280 --> 14:50.520
I like that they're trying a theme, and if anybody was going to do it right, and you're

14:50.520 --> 14:54.880
going to get the right voices in the conversation, it's going to be at Linux Fest, at least around

14:54.880 --> 14:55.880
here.

14:55.880 --> 14:59.000
LinuxFestNorthwest.org.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.200
And now we have just a little bit of hardware news to get to.

15:02.200 --> 15:07.000
This is sort of the last breaking news, really, in the last couple of days.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.160
And this story is getting more and more traction, and it seems to be a good way to get attention

15:11.160 --> 15:12.160
these days.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.280
And it's disabling the Intel management engine.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.880
So we first start out with Purism.

15:15.880 --> 15:20.520
They announced that they'd be disabling the management engine on future computers going

15:20.520 --> 15:21.520
forward.

15:21.520 --> 15:26.080
And then a few weeks after that, System76 announced that they'll be rolling out firmware

15:26.080 --> 15:33.960
updates to disable the Intel management engine on some of the laptops sold in the last year.

15:33.960 --> 15:41.160
And then some eagle-eyed Redditors noticed that Dell has begun selling computers that

15:41.160 --> 15:46.360
can be configured with an Intel vPro ME inoperable custom order config.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.360
Is that right?

15:47.360 --> 15:49.080
Yeah, no Intel ME on the Dells, too.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.080
So it seems-

15:50.080 --> 15:51.080
Sort of subtly.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.080
Yeah.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.080
Not without much fanfare.

15:53.080 --> 15:58.480
Now, the interesting difference between Purism, System76, and Dell is the Dell one is the

15:58.480 --> 16:01.640
only one that's actually shipping.

16:01.640 --> 16:07.400
What System76 and Purism have done is have announced, which is funny because that's not

16:07.400 --> 16:08.880
how the news articles read.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.360
They read like if you were to buy a laptop today from either one of them, it would be

16:12.360 --> 16:14.640
shipped without Intel ME.

16:14.640 --> 16:19.440
And so you see that sort of propagate in the different blogs, and Ferronics did this, and

16:19.440 --> 16:24.360
all the different outlets just ran with the headlines as it just spreads out.

16:24.360 --> 16:29.640
And now, I've actually seen in common threads that, well, PopOS has custom code to disable

16:29.640 --> 16:30.640
Intel ME.

16:30.640 --> 16:35.360
Now, it goes from they haven't even shipped it yet to PopOS has been custom engineered

16:35.360 --> 16:36.360
to disable ME.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.860
That's what the pop is for.

16:38.860 --> 16:41.920
I'm really curious to see how the System76 solution plays out because they're going to

16:41.920 --> 16:45.040
be delivering it through their PPA, which means you'll have to be running Ubuntu.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.520
So if you're putting a different distribution than a modern Ubuntu on your hardware right

16:48.520 --> 16:50.040
now, you're going to have to switch back.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.600
And I think they're still yet to announce exactly which models and which versions of

16:53.600 --> 16:55.940
the models will be getting the firmware updates.

16:55.940 --> 16:57.960
So that's also to be developed.

16:57.960 --> 17:01.440
And I think Purism has also said that they'll be working potentially on updating some of

17:01.440 --> 17:03.280
their previous models.

17:03.280 --> 17:08.680
But I really don't think anybody gives a shit.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.240
I mean, I know some people do.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.640
I mean, I kind of care.

17:11.640 --> 17:15.320
I care on a obviously on a technical level, I think it's shit.

17:15.320 --> 17:18.240
And I care that it could be vulnerable.

17:18.240 --> 17:23.240
But just even seeing the sloppy, inaccurate coverage of these announcements and how people

17:23.240 --> 17:29.760
just propagate it around as if it's now done, it's just happened and it's fact.

17:29.760 --> 17:36.040
It all reeks of armchair technologists who are taking a moral high ground position.

17:36.040 --> 17:39.640
But at the end of the day, when it comes time to buy a new rig, they're going to get a ThinkPad,

17:39.640 --> 17:42.900
they're going to get something, they're going to get a MacBook, they're going to get a machine

17:42.900 --> 17:46.040
that Intel and management engine would be a factor.

17:46.040 --> 17:50.640
And I don't think it's really more than a small percentage of people really care.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.640
And those people are probably already buying ThinkPads with core boots that are two or

17:53.640 --> 17:55.320
three years old that have been retrofitted.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.800
Yeah, the people that are covering it, they were they just found a story that would get

17:58.800 --> 18:02.520
them clicks and then they found a nice bow to tie it.

18:02.520 --> 18:07.140
I'm not saying that if I could buy a computer and the computer that I wanted had an option

18:07.140 --> 18:10.940
to disable management engine, I would choose that option every single time.

18:10.940 --> 18:14.200
But it's not going to move the needle on which computer I buy.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.920
I'm going to I'm going to pick a computer that best suits my needs.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.760
And the management engine thing is it's happened.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.240
It's just like the baseband.

18:21.240 --> 18:25.100
If this was a problem, then everybody who is on Twitter and on Reddit making a big deal

18:25.100 --> 18:29.720
about this wouldn't be using cell phones because of the baseband.

18:29.720 --> 18:33.080
We will just it'll become the new normal, just like the Equifax breach becomes the new

18:33.080 --> 18:34.080
normal.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.640
All these things just become the new normal and we make a big stink about it.

18:37.640 --> 18:41.760
But it actually reflects in our accuracy because all these armchair technologists and all

18:41.760 --> 18:45.960
these armchair Linux enthusiasts on the R-Linux subreddit, they're kicking around like it's

18:45.960 --> 18:47.160
already come and gone.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.840
You can buy a computer today.

18:48.840 --> 18:52.320
Operating systems have been custom fitted to disable the management firmware as if that's

18:52.320 --> 18:54.120
even possible.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.440
Nobody really cares.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.520
It's just like this something, hurrah, we're better at kind of thing.

18:58.520 --> 18:59.520
Yeah.

18:59.520 --> 19:03.040
The way it felt to me was that before all of this, before that recent vulnerability,

19:03.040 --> 19:06.100
you had people that were concerned about it and this is a small niche market that has

19:06.100 --> 19:07.100
valid concerns.

19:07.100 --> 19:09.820
Maybe they're journalists or other people that are really concerned about this and are

19:09.820 --> 19:11.920
probably the people running Coreboot or as you say.

19:11.920 --> 19:12.920
Exactly.

19:12.920 --> 19:13.920
There's definitely a market for it.

19:13.920 --> 19:14.920
Right.

19:14.920 --> 19:15.920
And then there's this.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.400
But then you had these people that were previously like, yeah, whatever, it's not a big deal.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.920
Suddenly for like a split second, they're concerned about it.

19:20.920 --> 19:24.800
But you know that in six months from now, everyone in that camp is just going to be

19:24.800 --> 19:25.800
back.

19:25.800 --> 19:29.000
It feels like the Linux user equivalent of changing your avatar.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.560
I think there's actually slightly more to that.

19:31.560 --> 19:36.440
I mean, when you think about that, we're moving to and touching a topic that was mentioned

19:36.440 --> 19:43.040
in the beginning of the show, that Bitcoin and you're going to carry your money now yourself.

19:43.040 --> 19:47.120
So far you trust on an institution to do it, your bank.

19:47.120 --> 19:51.000
And the more you start doing that, the more you care about that security, the control

19:51.000 --> 19:53.040
you do have on your device.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.360
And it always starts with a nurse like us.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.360
Yep.

19:56.360 --> 19:57.360
Yeah, I do.

19:57.360 --> 20:01.160
The research thing, do it, it kind of evolves and then all of a sudden it's needed.

20:01.160 --> 20:04.920
But there are other products on the market.

20:04.920 --> 20:08.600
So there are other products to support this use case of having like completely open firmware.

20:08.600 --> 20:13.200
Like if you look at the Talos 2 workstation, they're taking IBM's new power CPUs and they're

20:13.200 --> 20:18.200
going to build a workstation and that has entirely open firmware for the entire chain.

20:18.200 --> 20:22.280
And so if you are interested in going that route, it is expensive, but you can do it.

20:22.280 --> 20:26.920
Unfortunately, it's not a mobile solution, but it's like a step in the right direction

20:26.920 --> 20:27.920
I suppose.

20:27.920 --> 20:28.920
Yeah, yeah.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.360
Yeah, I mean, see the thing about all this stuff about disabling the management engine,

20:32.360 --> 20:36.360
I do think it's a good thing and I'm really glad that researchers are pushing that and

20:36.360 --> 20:39.440
making the discoveries that they're making.

20:39.440 --> 20:42.240
But it isn't a guaranteed solution.

20:42.240 --> 20:46.040
See they're flying blind and what they've managed to do is they've managed to take out

20:46.040 --> 20:49.840
chunks of the management engine, but still get the CPU to boot.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.080
And that's where we're at right now.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.720
That doesn't necessarily, it's a black box, am I wrong?

20:53.720 --> 20:57.920
You do need parts of the management engine or in AMD's case, the PSP in order to boot

20:57.920 --> 20:59.400
because they are actually critical.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.000
They do bootstrap the processor to some extent.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
That's what I'm saying.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.160
It's like they've taken out a chunk of it, but it's not completely gone.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.160
It's still there.

21:06.160 --> 21:10.160
No, but it is modularized enough that you're basically eliminating anything that's not

21:10.160 --> 21:13.080
needed to boot or is not needed to keep the system running.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.080
Okay.

21:14.080 --> 21:17.640
I mean, it feels like you're not necessarily objecting to any of the ongoing, like two

21:17.640 --> 21:21.680
months ago as Purism in particular, they've done some good work, you know, continually

21:21.680 --> 21:23.120
to explore this space.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.400
There was like a reasonable amount of coverage.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.280
I did not object to any of that.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.480
It's just more, I think more like this, the inaccurate and recent explosion of coverage

21:30.480 --> 21:33.920
without really understanding or by people who aren't really invested in that effort.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.920
Yeah, I think that's probably a good summary of it.

21:35.920 --> 21:40.440
Not to mention, Dell is getting credit for already having this stuff shipping, but my

21:40.440 --> 21:44.360
guess would be that they already had that option many, many, many months ago for the

21:44.360 --> 21:48.200
small sector of the market that is very security focused.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.200
Or the Chinese sector.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.200
Yeah.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.200
And it's a huge sector potentially.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.200
It could be the other way around.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.960
It could be because if I'm a non-US, if I'm like a company in Iran that's buying a bunch

21:55.960 --> 22:01.920
of Dell laptops or Syria or China, anywhere where the US government might want to peek

22:01.920 --> 22:02.920
in on what I'm doing.

22:02.920 --> 22:03.920
Yeah.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.200
You don't want an American company being able to look into your CPU.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.880
That's why they don't like Microsoft either.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.000
So Mr. Payne, what do you think?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.440
Are you ready to officially kick off the Gentoo challenge?

22:11.440 --> 22:12.440
Let's do it.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.440
Fascinating.

22:13.440 --> 22:14.440
Oh boy.

22:14.440 --> 22:19.840
All right, Wes.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.360
We're officially going into the Gentoo den.

22:22.360 --> 22:23.640
The virtual machine is spun up.

22:23.640 --> 22:24.640
It smells weird in here.

22:24.640 --> 22:25.640
What's going on over there?

22:25.640 --> 22:28.800
Well, we're getting ready to build ourselves a kernel.

22:28.800 --> 22:29.800
You've heard about it.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.840
The one, the only Linux.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.520
All right.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.480
So now Wes is off to the races.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.000
He'll be building his system.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
So it's not yet bootable.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
No.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Not yet bootable.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
You think we might get bootable?

22:41.000 --> 22:44.880
Because the kernel is going to take a while to build unless you build a really lean one.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.480
It might take the rest of the episode just to get to the kernel.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.480
We're about to find out.

22:47.480 --> 22:48.480
All right.

22:48.480 --> 22:49.480
We'll check back in on you.

22:49.480 --> 22:50.480
Okay.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.480
All right.

22:51.480 --> 22:52.480
So there you go.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.480
The Gentoo challenge has officially kicked off.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.480
Fascinating.

22:54.480 --> 22:57.920
Is he going to do any like special things with the kernel compiling options?

22:57.920 --> 22:58.920
Are you there yet?

22:58.920 --> 22:59.920
No.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.880
I'm in the menu config right now.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.080
So if there's people who have some opinions about how this kernel should go, we can also

23:05.080 --> 23:06.080
fix it up later.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.520
I mean, we just got to get to booting first.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.520
Well, all right.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.520
Yeah.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.520
We got to get a booting.

23:10.520 --> 23:11.520
That's true.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.520
That is true.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.520
But if we have any quick tips from the...

23:13.520 --> 23:14.520
Chris.

23:14.520 --> 23:15.520
Yeah.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.520
Go ahead.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.520
I have an idea for Wes, for his kernel.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.520
Okay.

23:18.520 --> 23:23.360
I have my kernel backup on my Google Drive and I'm willing to share...

23:23.360 --> 23:24.360
Let me just finish.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.360
Let me just finish.

23:25.360 --> 23:29.840
I have it saved and I can help him with it if he wants me to.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.880
That would be an interesting cheat.

23:32.880 --> 23:37.240
But would it take more time to rig up a way to transfer that thing and then get it in

23:37.240 --> 23:40.720
your VM than it would to just config and build it?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.400
Well, here's the thing.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.200
It's almost fully set up.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.200
You would just have to edit it for virtual option.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.200
It still kind of feels like cheating though.

23:46.200 --> 23:47.680
It feels like cheating a bit.

23:47.680 --> 23:48.680
Dude.

23:48.680 --> 23:49.680
It might be.

23:49.680 --> 23:50.680
It's not cheating.

23:50.680 --> 24:01.600
It's like he downloads the.config file and puts it in his user SRC Linux folder and he

24:01.600 --> 24:03.560
can just change it to his hardware.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.560
It's not that hard.

24:04.560 --> 24:05.560
Yeah.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.880
I say we wing it and the mistakes are show content.

24:08.880 --> 24:09.880
We build it live.

24:09.880 --> 24:10.880
I mean, we got to build it live.

24:10.880 --> 24:11.880
We got to build it.

24:11.880 --> 24:12.880
We got to build it.

24:12.880 --> 24:13.880
Yeah.

24:13.880 --> 24:14.880
That's probably true.

24:14.880 --> 24:15.880
If you build it, they will come.

24:15.880 --> 24:16.880
Because part of the problem, right?

24:16.880 --> 24:17.880
Yeah.

24:17.880 --> 24:18.880
That's part of the fun of this thing.

24:18.880 --> 24:21.560
You know, having a good time building a beautiful system.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.560
It's sort of like we're doing the show.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.560
We're doing the experience here.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.560
Trying to build some Gentoo on the side.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.560
Yeah.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.560
Yeah.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.560
All right.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.560
I kind of like it.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.560
It's exciting.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.560
So Wes is off to the races right now.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.560
Yeah.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.560
It won't be the prettiest kernel I've ever built.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.800
That's for sure.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.160
But it will be a kernel.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.160
All right.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.600
We will check in, say, towards the end of the show.

24:38.600 --> 24:41.040
See how it's going over here in the Gentoo corner, okay?

24:41.040 --> 24:42.160
We're leaving the Gentoo corner now.

24:42.160 --> 24:46.960
And with that, let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy this week, linuxacademy.com

24:46.960 --> 24:48.440
slash unplug.

24:48.440 --> 24:51.280
That's where you go to sign up for a free seven-day trial.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.280
I am super jealous.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.280
I think it's DeBill.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.280
Wasn't it Ja-bill?

24:54.280 --> 24:55.280
DeBill?

24:55.280 --> 24:57.160
Yes, I believe so.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.880
Check this out, Wes.

24:58.880 --> 25:02.980
DeBill, now the place he works, when you sign up and you start working there, they hand

25:02.980 --> 25:05.760
out Linux Academy subscriptions to get the team up to speed.

25:05.760 --> 25:06.760
How brilliant is that?

25:06.760 --> 25:07.760
What?

25:07.760 --> 25:11.040
I think a lot of businesses should look into this because there was always training budgets.

25:11.040 --> 25:15.620
And this is something that is going to snap in perfectly with that kind of system.

25:15.620 --> 25:19.560
It's a great platform to learn more about every Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic with

25:19.560 --> 25:24.040
hands-on scenario-based labs with instructors that can help you whenever you get stuck.

25:24.040 --> 25:28.120
And Learning Pass, if you want to go down for specific types of content, like a very

25:28.120 --> 25:30.980
specific track that you just need to get up to speed on.

25:30.980 --> 25:35.920
Or if you're going for certifications, they got training that's dedicated to really immerse

25:35.920 --> 25:36.920
yourself.

25:36.920 --> 25:40.520
And they also have the whizbang sort of practice exam and quizzes approach, so whatever works

25:40.520 --> 25:41.640
better for you.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.960
And they have cloud servers they'll spin up on demand when you need them, a course schedule

25:44.960 --> 25:47.560
if you're busy, especially with the fricking holidays coming up.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.960
Trust me, this is the best thing ever.

25:49.960 --> 25:53.640
They'll help you pick a course instead of time frame to fit to your schedule and your

25:53.640 --> 25:54.640
learning goals.

25:54.640 --> 25:58.920
And then they have a public profile where you or your employer or a potential employer

25:58.920 --> 26:03.080
can see the courses that you've completed, iOS and Android apps so you can study on the

26:03.080 --> 26:08.260
fricking go and study tools that you can take with you, like the guides or the lesson audio

26:08.260 --> 26:12.920
and your personal notebook and different tools that are offline that you can just use as

26:12.920 --> 26:14.800
reference or study as you need.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.480
And they're always adding new stuff.

26:16.480 --> 26:21.280
That's what makes the subscription valuable, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

26:21.280 --> 26:26.200
That's where you go to sign up for a free seven day trial.

26:26.200 --> 26:30.560
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

26:30.560 --> 26:36.480
the unplugged program.

26:36.480 --> 26:42.500
So we noticed that the elementary project has been keeping the public up to date on

26:42.500 --> 26:47.200
their endeavors with the app center and other things that are happening over there.

26:47.200 --> 26:51.200
And we just happened to have Mr. Daniel Fore from the elementary OS project in the mumble

26:51.200 --> 26:52.200
room again this week.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.840
Daniel, good to see you again.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.840
And what the heck is going on over there?

26:55.840 --> 26:58.720
You guys are just on top of it with this stuff.

26:58.720 --> 27:02.800
Yeah, well, you know, people have been asking about stats.

27:02.800 --> 27:07.280
And so I kind of poked everybody and we pulled together some some fun numbers if you want

27:07.280 --> 27:08.280
to take a look at them.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.280
Yeah, I was OK.

27:09.280 --> 27:13.760
I noticed right out of it that the new version of calendar close was 28 reported issues.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.760
Sounds pretty good.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.520
So it's like it's like these are the core apps and these are the things we've been doing

27:17.520 --> 27:18.520
to them.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.520
What's your what's your highlights here?

27:20.520 --> 27:24.920
OK, so this.

27:24.920 --> 27:29.600
This represents our this last blog post was our updates for November.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.000
So we've got a calendar update app.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.120
We got a few little bugs fixing here, but the big the big ticket items actually are

27:37.120 --> 27:39.840
still app center is where we're putting huge amounts of focus.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.200
Yeah, it looks like it looks like new automated tests were added.

27:43.200 --> 27:45.400
Is that like automated for what?

27:45.400 --> 27:47.400
What are you testing with these new automated tests in the app center?

27:47.400 --> 27:49.040
This sounds really fancy.

27:49.040 --> 27:54.120
Yeah, so when a developer submits their application to app center, the first thing it does is

27:54.120 --> 27:56.200
it goes through an automated test suite.

27:56.200 --> 28:00.000
So before it ever gets to a human reviewer, we run all these tests on it.

28:00.000 --> 28:05.040
And since you're connected with GitHub, then we can kick back issues to you automatically

28:05.040 --> 28:06.620
from the test suite.

28:06.620 --> 28:12.040
So it might take a while of robot testing for a while before you even really get to

28:12.040 --> 28:15.760
human reviewer so we can do reviews really quickly with this way.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.760
That is really great.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.060
Wow, I love it.

28:18.060 --> 28:21.900
And I notice then you do have the OK, alright, OK, OK, here we go.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.560
We got some real numbers here we got.

28:23.560 --> 28:27.080
So 70,000 downloads from the app center.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.080
Wow.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.040
Is that the whole run of the app center?

28:30.040 --> 28:31.040
70,000?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.040
Is that the whole thing?

28:32.040 --> 28:35.760
That's that's just this month, what?

28:35.760 --> 28:36.760
That is crazy.

28:36.760 --> 28:37.760
Oh, that is.

28:37.760 --> 28:38.760
That's fantastic.

28:38.760 --> 28:39.760
That is amazing.

28:39.760 --> 28:45.280
elementary OS was downloaded 61,000 times, with about 77% of those coming from closed

28:45.280 --> 28:48.620
platforms, which I think is always the goal of the project there is to convert a bunch

28:48.620 --> 28:55.420
of those users over and $132 were paid out to developers this month, 70 app releases

28:55.420 --> 28:56.420
this month.

28:56.420 --> 28:57.420
Holy crap.

28:57.420 --> 28:58.420
Wow.

28:58.420 --> 28:59.600
That's really taken off, Dan.

28:59.600 --> 29:03.080
I mean, I think this gets it's, it's kind of a hit.

29:03.080 --> 29:08.840
Yeah, it's been pretty crazy to see, you know, that's the 7070 releases a release is either

29:08.840 --> 29:10.360
a new app or an update.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.380
We've got 65 total apps in the store right now.

29:13.380 --> 29:19.160
So that means some apps updated more than more than once this month.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.480
So we're getting regular app dates up to users.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.680
And I think I think it's pretty neat.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.680
Geez.

29:24.680 --> 29:29.600
Well, I'm every time we talk about this after afterwards, I walk away from the show and

29:29.600 --> 29:30.720
go, I kind of want to try this out.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.040
I want to just give it a go again.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.320
It's been, it's been a little while since I didn't, I haven't checked it out since it

29:34.320 --> 29:35.320
first launched.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.840
Um, I like it.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.240
How do you guys handle firmware updates and stuff like that?

29:39.240 --> 29:42.640
How does, how does that get like these Intel ME stuff through, say some firmware update

29:42.640 --> 29:45.200
that came around to fix stuff like we've seen in the past?

29:45.200 --> 29:46.200
What happens in elementary?

29:46.200 --> 29:47.200
I was for that.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.960
Um, we don't have a GUI yet hooked up for that.

29:50.960 --> 29:55.280
I think the plan is to use a whooped, right?

29:55.280 --> 29:56.760
Is the kind of standard.

29:56.760 --> 29:57.760
So.

29:57.760 --> 29:58.760
Yeah.

29:58.760 --> 30:03.160
Well, I will link to the post lots of nice screenshots too.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.920
I really like the design of these apps.

30:04.920 --> 30:05.920
Just all good stuff.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.560
I got, I got nothing but good stuff to say.

30:07.560 --> 30:10.920
This has got to be one of the best distributions that I'm not currently running.

30:10.920 --> 30:15.880
I kind of, I got to put it, I got to, I had a laptop, my, my, it goes so well on my XPS

30:15.880 --> 30:16.880
13 laptop.

30:16.880 --> 30:17.880
Oh yeah.

30:17.880 --> 30:18.880
I bet it's just beautiful.

30:18.880 --> 30:19.880
Edge to edge.

30:19.880 --> 30:20.880
High EPI.

30:20.880 --> 30:21.880
Oh man.

30:21.880 --> 30:22.880
It's nice.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.360
So I think that's the laptop I'm going to put this back on and try this stuff out.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.360
Wow.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.360
I can't believe that.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.400
70,000 downloads in the month.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.400
That's great.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.160
That is really, that's a really solid number and shows you that your users are going in

30:32.160 --> 30:33.160
there and really trying it out.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.160
I think that's pretty good.

30:34.160 --> 30:39.400
It really makes me think too that if you introduce some new users into the elementary ecosystem,

30:39.400 --> 30:43.020
they would get a really nice idea about what this Linux world can be.

30:43.020 --> 30:46.640
So Dan, what about the possibility of something like one day I could go in there and install

30:46.640 --> 30:47.880
telegram or Chrome?

30:47.880 --> 30:49.120
Is that, is that possible?

30:49.120 --> 30:53.040
Like with flat packs or snaps, is that somewhere this could go or is it always going to be

30:53.040 --> 30:58.520
a just stuff that's been built specifically for the platform?

30:58.520 --> 31:02.760
We want to keep it to just stuff that's been specifically built for the platform and we've

31:02.760 --> 31:09.080
actually seen in our Reddit and other places that our users want this too and without even

31:09.080 --> 31:13.260
us suggesting it, we constantly get suggestions of, I want to be able to hide apps that come

31:13.260 --> 31:14.440
from Ubuntu and Debian.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.440
I don't want to see them.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.920
I just want App Center apps.

31:16.920 --> 31:17.920
Yeah.

31:17.920 --> 31:18.920
Yeah.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.600
Cause they wanted them to match the aesthetic and fit in with the overall design theme.

31:21.600 --> 31:22.600
So that makes sense.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.600
Yeah.

31:23.600 --> 31:27.040
And they know that these apps have been tested and work on the platform.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.040
Right.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.040
So what would be the solution?

31:29.040 --> 31:32.360
Say I'm running, say I want to switch over to elementary OS for a bit and I want to get

31:32.360 --> 31:35.400
a telegram and Chrome and some of those things set up.

31:35.400 --> 31:39.960
What would be my, what would be my best solution on elementary OS?

31:39.960 --> 31:45.760
Our stance on, on sideloading outside apps, you know, not from the store is that you should

31:45.760 --> 31:47.400
use flat pack or snap.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.160
And because it's, you know, we were built on the same Ubuntu 16.04 base.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.640
So snap works great.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.640
Flat packs works great.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.700
It's the same stuff you're used to on other Linux systems.

31:55.700 --> 31:58.800
So how do you install Chrome?

31:58.800 --> 32:02.440
Me personally, I still grab the, the, the Deb.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.440
Yeah.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.440
And it's not a PPA.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.440
It's a repository.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.440
Yeah.

32:06.440 --> 32:07.440
Yeah.

32:07.440 --> 32:10.600
And they set all that up for you for future updates for your convenience.

32:10.600 --> 32:11.600
Yeah.

32:11.600 --> 32:12.600
Okay.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.600
I'm going to give it a go.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.600
I think pretty soon.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.440
I really liked the aesthetic of it and I think that App Center has got to, I got to check

32:17.440 --> 32:18.440
that out.

32:18.440 --> 32:19.440
There's some cool stuff.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.560
There's some weird distribution to get that right.

32:22.560 --> 32:27.480
Since before the software center was everything on Ubuntu and since maybe click and run.

32:27.480 --> 32:28.480
Right.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.480
Oh gosh.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.480
Yeah.

32:30.480 --> 32:31.480
I think it's since click and run.

32:31.480 --> 32:32.480
I've been waiting for this to get done right.

32:32.480 --> 32:33.480
So I'm really pleased to see this.

32:33.480 --> 32:34.480
Good work, Dan.

32:34.480 --> 32:35.480
Thanks, man.

32:35.480 --> 32:36.480
All right.

32:36.480 --> 32:40.260
Was there anything else from the lug there before we move on to something kind of cool?

32:40.260 --> 32:41.260
Something getting young people involved?

32:41.260 --> 32:42.880
I have a quick question.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.680
Go for it, Ben.

32:44.680 --> 32:47.360
Can you use App to get on this distro or can you not?

32:47.360 --> 32:48.420
Sure you can.

32:48.420 --> 32:51.040
It's Ubuntu LTS on the, under the, underneath the.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.040
Okay.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.040
I was just curious.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.040
That's all I had to ask.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.040
Yeah.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.040
You can go to town.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.040
If you want to go that direction.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.040
I don't know.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.040
Yeah.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.040
Well, that's what I'm used to.

33:00.040 --> 33:01.040
So if I did install it, that's what I would probably end up using personally.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.040
That's just me.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.880
So Wes, are you familiar with Google Coden?

33:04.880 --> 33:05.880
I am not.

33:05.880 --> 33:10.000
I wasn't really super familiar with it either, but it's been going on since 2010 and they've

33:10.000 --> 33:14.080
had over 4,500 students from 99 countries involved in a contest.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.240
Now it's for kids.

33:15.240 --> 33:17.200
So maybe that's why you, you know, I didn't get it.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.360
It's like the kid version of the summer of code.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.360
Exactly.

33:20.360 --> 33:21.360
Yeah.

33:21.360 --> 33:25.200
So it's running, it's running right now until January 17th, 2008.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.460
And I think they're still accepting submissions.

33:27.460 --> 33:30.680
So I'm kind of putting this out there just in case anybody, anybody that's younger in

33:30.680 --> 33:33.840
our audience might be interested in something like that.

33:33.840 --> 33:36.920
Students choose the tasks that they wish to work on from the following categories, which

33:36.920 --> 33:43.400
are coding, documentation, training, outreach, research, quality assurance, and user interface.

33:43.400 --> 33:48.040
And students will earn prizes for a successful completion of tasks.

33:48.040 --> 33:54.640
And one of the organizations that's participating in Google Coden this year is Ubuntu.

33:54.640 --> 33:59.720
So this could be a great opportunity if you want to work with Python or JavaScript or

33:59.720 --> 34:04.700
snap craft or work on the gnome desktop environment or UC or C++.

34:04.700 --> 34:07.440
There are tasks that are available for people that want to do this.

34:07.440 --> 34:11.600
And so you just subscribe, you get in there and then you can go look at the tasks that

34:11.600 --> 34:14.680
Ubuntu has put up there.

34:14.680 --> 34:18.240
And some of them are not even really to necessarily go directly into Ubuntu.

34:18.240 --> 34:22.240
Like this one's just package and publish your first Node.js step.

34:22.240 --> 34:26.040
Install the Ubuntu 1710 desktop.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.360
I think that's pretty doable.

34:27.360 --> 34:28.360
Translate Ubuntu components.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.840
And there's some ones that would generally get a student involved in creating open source.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.680
And this work goes upstream and Google's flipping the bill here for this.

34:34.680 --> 34:35.680
That's great.

34:35.680 --> 34:36.680
Yeah.

34:36.680 --> 34:42.040
So this is a Google Coden and it's going right now, November 28th through January 17th.

34:42.040 --> 34:46.920
And I will link to the Ubuntu entry if you want to get involved there.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.240
There's a few other organizations that are in there.

34:49.240 --> 34:50.480
But this is pretty cool.

34:50.480 --> 34:54.680
And it's a great chance to get some work on some legitimate open source software and have

34:54.680 --> 34:57.200
Google behind the whole thing and orchestrating it all.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.280
You know what I'd like to see?

34:59.280 --> 35:01.140
They have this for the kids.

35:01.140 --> 35:03.600
They have Summer of Code for the university students.

35:03.600 --> 35:10.360
What about something just to connect people that have free time to projects?

35:10.360 --> 35:11.360
Like a bug?

35:11.360 --> 35:12.360
Well, there's bug bounties.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.800
But yeah, there's nothing that's really taken off.

35:14.800 --> 35:15.800
Yeah.

35:15.800 --> 35:16.800
Yeah.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.680
Different projects have different solutions.

35:18.680 --> 35:21.800
But like us, we need somebody to help us with our bots.

35:21.800 --> 35:26.840
I think one of the benefits of things like Coden and Summer of Code is that there's a

35:26.840 --> 35:30.440
central place to look at all these different projects that want all these different things

35:30.440 --> 35:31.440
done.

35:31.440 --> 35:32.440
Yes, exactly.

35:32.440 --> 35:33.440
That's the value.

35:33.440 --> 35:37.240
There's like 500 organizations that are involved in Summer of Code now.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.240
Yes.

35:38.240 --> 35:42.040
You can just go to one place and go through whatever projects might interest you.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.040
Organizations and projects.

35:43.040 --> 35:46.800
And now, the Coden is kind of getting, it's not the same scale, but it's getting more

35:46.800 --> 35:47.800
and more popular.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.040
I mean, they've been going for a few years.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.040
Yeah.

35:50.040 --> 35:54.040
Plus something like Summer of Code offers sometimes monetary incentives as well.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.040
Yeah.

35:55.040 --> 35:58.840
I didn't look to see what the monetary incentives were for Coden, but they did say prices and

35:58.840 --> 35:59.840
whatnot.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.720
I imagine it gets a little different when you're...

36:01.720 --> 36:05.160
So here's a, upon successful completion of tasks, eligible students can earn prizes.

36:05.160 --> 36:09.120
Digital certificates, t-shirts, and hoodies, and grand prize winners will receive a trip

36:09.120 --> 36:12.280
to Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California for themselves and a parent or

36:12.280 --> 36:15.280
legal guardian for four nights in June of 2018.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.000
Plus, that's pretty great.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.480
You know, it probably could maybe be a stand in for some homework if it's involved with

36:20.480 --> 36:21.480
school.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.480
Well, imagine if you're like a high school student.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.360
What a great addition to your resume.

36:24.360 --> 36:28.600
Talk about getting some real, putting, you know, Ubuntu on there and working with Google.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.720
Those are things that go on a resume.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.880
That was, I think, the real value there.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.520
Just one last quick Ubuntu little community news item.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.520
Just an update here.

36:36.520 --> 36:43.080
If you're a fan of all-in-one boot CD that that project, you know, the Linux AIO, is

36:43.080 --> 36:48.200
the ISO image that you download and it's like all of the versions of Debian or it's all

36:48.200 --> 36:49.840
of the versions of Ubuntu.

36:49.840 --> 36:57.120
So they just updated for Ubuntu 17.10 Linux AIO so you can grab one single ISO and get

36:57.120 --> 37:06.440
Ubuntu Gnome, Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu LXDE, Ubuntu Mate, and proper Ubuntu, Kubuntu, all

37:06.440 --> 37:07.920
in one ISO image.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.320
And then you just choose.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.760
I'm really glad those guys are still doing that.

37:12.760 --> 37:13.760
Yeah, 10.0 gone and dead.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.280
I was involved with the project earlier on.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.800
Yeah, I could, you know, you never know.

37:16.800 --> 37:17.880
They could have gone the other way.

37:17.880 --> 37:19.440
You could have, it could have faded away.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.440
But now they've expanded.

37:20.440 --> 37:21.440
They have Linux Mint now.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.440
They have LMDE.

37:22.440 --> 37:27.400
They have, so you can get different, you know, like, anyway, it's Debian Live, Fedora, and

37:27.400 --> 37:29.440
then they have what they call secondary releases, which I didn't look at.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.120
They also have Ubuntu, which you didn't mention.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.440
Yeah, well, yeah, it's just all of the different Ubuntu's.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.640
You can get LTS when they just did 17.10.

37:35.640 --> 37:40.080
So it's like you can have, you can write, the reason why I mention it, if it's not obvious,

37:40.080 --> 37:45.040
is you download this one ISO, you DD it to a thumb drive, and then you've got all of

37:45.040 --> 37:47.960
the different versions of Debian or you've got all the different versions of Ubuntu

37:47.960 --> 37:49.200
for that release.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.320
Something I also noticed that is becoming somewhat of a rarity is that they still do

37:52.320 --> 37:53.320
a 32-bit version.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.320
Oh yeah, right.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.320
Huh.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.320
Hmm.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.880
I wonder if that's true for all of the distros.

37:57.880 --> 37:58.880
So yeah.

37:58.880 --> 38:01.760
So there's a little update and then, go ahead.

38:01.760 --> 38:06.560
Manjaro and our other Arch-based systems including Arch themselves have dropped 32-bit.

38:06.560 --> 38:10.480
Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Gentoo eventually drops it too.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.480
Yeah.

38:11.480 --> 38:12.480
Yeah.

38:12.480 --> 38:13.480
Just, you know.

38:13.480 --> 38:14.480
Good news.

38:14.480 --> 38:17.560
For those of you looking for a remote desktop solution and have been avoiding TeamViewer

38:17.560 --> 38:20.720
forever like I have, maybe we can look at it again.

38:20.720 --> 38:21.720
This could be really great news.

38:21.720 --> 38:24.680
And they drop a little Wayland tidbit in here too.

38:24.680 --> 38:30.160
TeamViewer 13 preview is out for Linux and it's no longer based on Wine.

38:30.160 --> 38:31.680
Yay!

38:31.680 --> 38:32.680
Is that right?

38:32.680 --> 38:33.680
Yeah.

38:33.680 --> 38:34.680
That's big news, kind of.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.680
Wow.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.680
It is.

38:36.680 --> 38:37.680
It is.

38:37.680 --> 38:38.680
Native 64 bit.

38:38.680 --> 38:39.680
Yep.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.680
It's cute.

38:40.680 --> 38:41.680
Be still my heart.

38:41.680 --> 38:42.680
Yep.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.560
They started by building a new back end for the host and then from there they built out

38:44.560 --> 38:51.600
the front end, it's the front ends in Qt, and they say that we just decided at one point

38:51.600 --> 38:55.360
when we started building the new host that we needed to start over due to technical limitations

38:55.360 --> 39:01.720
of our Wine port and increasing user, they note here in their blog that more and more

39:01.720 --> 39:05.320
users that are doing technical support are doing it from Linux hosts and that their Wine

39:05.320 --> 39:09.860
version just wasn't up to the task anymore, which I think is, this is just terrific news

39:09.860 --> 39:15.840
because it's another company saying customer demand is making us release this for Linux

39:15.840 --> 39:17.800
and write a native version.

39:17.800 --> 39:20.400
Hallelujah for that, right?

39:20.400 --> 39:25.420
And they're writing one sort of TeamViewer and TeamViewer host common code base to make

39:25.420 --> 39:26.420
it...

39:26.420 --> 39:27.420
Oh, see, that's awesome.

39:27.420 --> 39:28.420
It is.

39:28.420 --> 39:30.560
That means we can probably rely on Linux support to continue.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.560
Exactly.

39:31.560 --> 39:33.880
And they say that they're going to continue iterating on it and that they're going to

39:33.880 --> 39:38.160
continue to make it seamless to work with modern Linux desktop environments too.

39:38.160 --> 39:44.680
Now, there is a big disclaimer, or as they say, a note on Wayland.

39:44.680 --> 39:50.660
On Wayland currently, only outgoing remote control and incoming file transfer are supported.

39:50.660 --> 39:56.400
If you need incoming remote control, you have to sign into classic Xorg.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.200
This is a funny part of the blog too.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.480
This is like really frank.

39:59.480 --> 40:03.920
From a developer perspective, we'd be more than happy to leave the archaic X11 technology

40:03.920 --> 40:09.440
stack behind and jump on the new and shiny Wayland train, however, it is not as simple

40:09.440 --> 40:10.440
as it may seem.

40:10.440 --> 40:14.960
Now, if you've been listening to this show for a while, you are very aware of this conundrum

40:14.960 --> 40:16.000
that they're facing.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.400
This is, who else but TeamViewer is going to get, I mean, like this company is going

40:19.400 --> 40:20.520
to get screwed by this.

40:20.520 --> 40:25.480
By design, Wayland does not provide an interface to do remote control.

40:25.480 --> 40:29.160
We're talking screen capture, mouse and keyboard emulation.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.160
It's not in there.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.440
It's to keep Wayland core lean.

40:32.440 --> 40:38.360
The idea is that the compositor provides these interfaces, which could mean that TeamViewer

40:38.360 --> 40:45.040
would have to implement different interfaces for every desktop environment we want to support.

40:45.040 --> 40:49.520
This is what I've been talking about and why having like a common API like Mir or something

40:49.520 --> 40:54.120
in between there that can implement these feature sets could be extremely useful.

40:54.120 --> 40:58.760
So they write, this is unfortunate, but even more unsatisfying that these interfaces are

40:58.760 --> 41:01.300
not even available yet.

41:01.300 --> 41:05.320
The closest to having something useful is Gnome, they're talking about PipeWire.

41:05.320 --> 41:09.120
So it's likely that it will be the first desktop we can support in Wayland.

41:09.120 --> 41:14.120
We want Wayland support as much as you, and we're working on it, but it's a bit complicated

41:14.120 --> 41:16.040
than just make it work.

41:16.040 --> 41:19.000
But they have a native cute version of TeamViewer.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
It's in preview right now for Linux, 64-bit versions.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.960
They have devs and RPMs available and no more wine.

41:27.960 --> 41:29.960
I am so happy to hear all this.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.440
Thank you, Lord.

41:31.440 --> 41:32.440
Okay.

41:32.440 --> 41:37.080
As much as I want to be excited for them and that I understand their pain, I'm not feeling

41:37.080 --> 41:39.680
bad for them having all this work.

41:39.680 --> 41:40.680
With Wayland, you mean?

41:40.680 --> 41:41.680
With Wayland support?

41:41.680 --> 41:42.680
With Wayland, yes.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.440
And I'm going to give you a reason.

41:44.440 --> 41:50.320
TeamViewer as a company has actually to a member of the community requested payment

41:50.320 --> 41:53.880
where he was not using for more than a month just because he didn't went to the panel and

41:53.880 --> 41:57.640
cancel, but he actually canceled the actual payment.

41:57.640 --> 42:03.120
So the member had to pay for an extra full year because the terms say that if you don't

42:03.120 --> 42:07.800
cancel, it gets automatically renewed and you're due to pay even if you're not using

42:07.800 --> 42:09.400
the service at all.

42:09.400 --> 42:12.200
And there's proof of that because he didn't log in at all.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.200
Yeah.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.720
I have my qualms there too.

42:15.720 --> 42:16.720
Yeah.

42:16.720 --> 42:24.200
But at that point, you're kind of giving crap to the development part of TeamViewer for

42:24.200 --> 42:25.920
the billing department's issues.

42:25.920 --> 42:28.720
Well, it's just that, you know, over the years-

42:28.720 --> 42:32.480
It's the company's overall approach to a customer base.

42:32.480 --> 42:35.920
Like if you were paying a customer and you treat it like this, I don't expect better

42:35.920 --> 42:38.480
treatment because I'm an open source project.

42:38.480 --> 42:43.320
And I am concerned about the Wayland developments for the open source alternatives, not for

42:43.320 --> 42:44.320
TeamViewer in particular.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.320
Yeah.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.440
It's interesting that they're suffering and they're having to pay the bug.

42:47.440 --> 42:48.800
Stooge, you had a take on this.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.800
Go ahead.

42:49.800 --> 42:54.200
Oh, I'm kind of reminded of your rant at Chrome last week.

42:54.200 --> 43:00.000
Yay, we have more proprietary programs now we're a feature party with Windows.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.800
Yeah.

43:01.800 --> 43:04.560
This is one of those applications where I completely agree.

43:04.560 --> 43:10.520
I'd like guacamole or some other remote desktop solution that just becomes the industry norm.

43:10.520 --> 43:17.040
But having worked in IT for many a years, watching TeamViewer in production, I can say

43:17.040 --> 43:22.880
it is, when you have it set up right, generally fairly bulletproof and easy for a basic user

43:22.880 --> 43:26.840
to get set up and they can read a number to you and you can connect to that.

43:26.840 --> 43:32.600
And it's very compelling from just a pragmatic remote support, get the job done.

43:32.600 --> 43:37.720
I know I installed this TeamViewer host once and I know I'm going to be able to remote

43:37.720 --> 43:42.460
support that user and IT shops have full dashboards with all their TeamViewers categorized by

43:42.460 --> 43:43.460
different companies.

43:43.460 --> 43:47.460
And I mean, I've really seen this thing produced at scale and it seemed like a pretty valuable

43:47.460 --> 43:48.460
tool for them.

43:48.460 --> 43:52.120
So having support on Linux is definitely a good thing.

43:52.120 --> 43:56.840
But I do feel like for most of us that aren't working in corporate IT or doing IT support

43:56.840 --> 44:00.360
for large groups of people, it'd be nice to have something that's just 100% free and open

44:00.360 --> 44:01.720
but offers similar functionality.

44:01.720 --> 44:02.720
Yeah.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.720
I've never used TeamViewer.

44:03.720 --> 44:04.720
I probably won't.

44:04.720 --> 44:05.720
Yeah.

44:05.720 --> 44:06.720
Google Chrome just works.

44:06.720 --> 44:10.760
I mean, Google remote desktop, you really want something that just gets inserted and

44:10.760 --> 44:11.760
works.

44:11.760 --> 44:12.920
I've used a little bit.

44:12.920 --> 44:19.440
On the flip side, there is something to be said for not having to punch something in

44:19.440 --> 44:24.040
your firewall even as an individual user and then on top of that, somehow still getting

44:24.040 --> 44:25.560
like insanely awesome performance.

44:25.560 --> 44:26.560
Yeah.

44:26.560 --> 44:30.080
I mean, you and I have used it, both of us, when we're remote and we need to get something

44:30.080 --> 44:33.360
out production wise, you and I, TeamViewer was the one that ended up just working for

44:33.360 --> 44:38.480
us when like we're moving desktop environments or we're switching different distros.

44:38.480 --> 44:40.620
TeamViewer was the one we could just kind of hit the button and it did work.

44:40.620 --> 44:44.880
When I was in Long Beach, I edited and released user error over TeamViewer.

44:44.880 --> 44:45.880
Nice.

44:45.880 --> 44:46.880
Okay.

44:46.880 --> 44:47.880
Go ahead.

44:47.880 --> 44:55.600
I have been using TeamViewer forever to help my family out and it always seems to work.

44:55.600 --> 44:56.600
Yeah.

44:56.600 --> 44:57.600
It is a good one for that too.

44:57.600 --> 45:01.320
And there was a time that it worked for the people who just could break the pin codes

45:01.320 --> 45:02.320
too.

45:02.320 --> 45:03.320
Remember that time?

45:03.320 --> 45:04.320
Yes.

45:04.320 --> 45:05.320
Yes.

45:05.320 --> 45:06.320
So this is just a preview.

45:06.320 --> 45:10.960
It's still early days, but the rewriting with the user interface in Qt, I think it's a good

45:10.960 --> 45:11.960
move.

45:11.960 --> 45:12.960
We'll keep an eye on it.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.400
We'll probably end up trying it out here.

45:14.400 --> 45:17.200
I'd like to pick Noah's brain about it too because I know he's been a big TeamViewer

45:17.200 --> 45:18.200
fan in the past.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.200
He's moved to other things.

45:19.200 --> 45:20.200
Yeah.

45:20.200 --> 45:21.200
Symbol help.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.200
Yeah.

45:22.200 --> 45:23.200
But I'd still like to talk to him about it as well.

45:23.200 --> 45:26.760
And then one last note, just community news-wise for folks that are big fans of VLC, some

45:26.760 --> 45:28.560
great news.

45:28.560 --> 45:34.720
The European Parliament has approved a budget to essentially allocate funds for bug bounties

45:34.720 --> 45:39.400
around VLC and they're doing it through the HackerOne project, which I am a huge fan of.

45:39.400 --> 45:43.440
I've been covering that since TechSnap days and I just think it's a great way for companies

45:43.440 --> 45:52.040
to get one central arbiter to act as sort of escrow and arbiter between the company

45:52.040 --> 45:55.480
and the people that have made disclosures about vulnerabilities that they've discovered.

45:55.480 --> 45:56.960
That's sort of the role that HackerOne can play.

45:56.960 --> 45:57.960
Make it easy on both sides.

45:57.960 --> 46:02.480
And it's a directory of this is what we are looking for, this is what our bounties are.

46:02.480 --> 46:06.720
It's sort of one centralized location like we were talking about earlier for other things.

46:06.720 --> 46:11.260
And the European Parliament is, I don't know exactly how much money in total, but we do

46:11.260 --> 46:14.040
have an idea in terms of bounties.

46:14.040 --> 46:17.360
And so looking at this, they're looking for all kinds of different issues.

46:17.360 --> 46:19.800
I'm assuming they must use VLC.

46:19.800 --> 46:26.200
And the nice thing is the core developer of VLC is one of these guys who has been approached

46:26.200 --> 46:32.840
several times with very lucrative offers to install advertising into VLC and he's declined

46:32.840 --> 46:35.600
it every single time.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.240
So I love to see...

46:37.240 --> 46:40.420
This is a great use of public funds in my personal opinion.

46:40.420 --> 46:45.400
So they don't have really huge, huge, huge bounties.

46:45.400 --> 46:48.240
But again, you're doing open source development here, so you're getting some money.

46:48.240 --> 46:52.420
In fact, the top bounty isn't even worth a single Bitcoin.

46:52.420 --> 46:59.440
It's only $2,000 for critical, 750 for high, 300 for medium, and 100 for low is what you

46:59.440 --> 47:00.440
get.

47:00.440 --> 47:02.040
And these are all based on like the CVSS score.

47:02.040 --> 47:06.540
So if you find something that's like a 7.0, you get 750 bucks, which would be like code

47:06.540 --> 47:08.760
execution without user intervention.

47:08.760 --> 47:12.960
And then if you get remote code execution, you get $2,000.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.720
These are all in US.

47:14.720 --> 47:15.720
It's interesting.

47:15.720 --> 47:21.360
I've never really thought of VLC as being like an attack vector for a system.

47:21.360 --> 47:22.800
What if we could like...

47:22.800 --> 47:25.680
What if we knew about a vulnerability when somebody connected to our RTMP stream?

47:25.680 --> 47:28.680
We could do like some sort of buffer overflow with our stream and get access to their box

47:28.680 --> 47:29.680
through VLC.

47:29.680 --> 47:30.680
Yeah.

47:30.680 --> 47:32.040
That would be a pretty amazing hack.

47:32.040 --> 47:33.040
We should do this.

47:33.040 --> 47:34.040
This would be a good revenue source for Jupiter broadcasting.

47:34.040 --> 47:35.040
We can use it to mine Bitcoins.

47:35.040 --> 47:36.040
Yeah.

47:36.040 --> 47:39.880
We'll start remote Bitcoin miners on people's machines.

47:39.880 --> 47:41.240
So yeah.

47:41.240 --> 47:42.240
That's that HackerOne.

47:42.240 --> 47:45.680
You can go to hackerone.com.vlc if you want to read the details on that.

47:45.680 --> 47:46.680
I think that's great.

47:46.680 --> 47:49.880
I'd like to see the US government get in that.

47:49.880 --> 47:55.120
Because the truth is this situation sucks as bad as it does because these governments

47:55.120 --> 47:58.640
are buying up zero-day exploits on the black market to stockpile.

47:58.640 --> 48:03.560
And they're giving them an extremely high value, which is driving people to break software

48:03.560 --> 48:05.720
at a rate we've never seen before.

48:05.720 --> 48:09.600
So it's about damn time they use some of that money to also pay for public bounties too.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.600
Yeah.

48:10.600 --> 48:11.600
Right?

48:11.600 --> 48:12.600
And it helps.

48:12.600 --> 48:13.600
You may not use VLC personally.

48:13.600 --> 48:14.840
There may be media players that you prefer.

48:14.840 --> 48:20.080
But it's part of this open ecosystem of there is a free and open source video player you

48:20.080 --> 48:21.720
can use that will probably meet your needs.

48:21.720 --> 48:24.000
And it's nice to see that reflected in the comments.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
I agree, Wes.

48:25.000 --> 48:31.240
So hey, while we're over in the Gen 2 corner, let's check in and let's go over to the corner.

48:31.240 --> 48:32.240
How is the build going?

48:32.240 --> 48:33.240
How's the kernel?

48:33.240 --> 48:34.240
What are you doing right now?

48:34.240 --> 48:35.240
Oh, it's compiling.

48:35.240 --> 48:36.240
Oh, is it?

48:36.240 --> 48:37.240
Oh, yeah.

48:37.240 --> 48:38.240
So you've selected your options.

48:38.240 --> 48:39.240
I've selected my options.

48:39.240 --> 48:40.240
Anything interesting and noteworthy?

48:40.240 --> 48:41.240
Well, I made sure to choose ButterFS support.

48:41.240 --> 48:42.240
Did you?

48:42.240 --> 48:43.240
Just for you.

48:43.240 --> 48:44.240
Did you really?

48:44.240 --> 48:45.240
You're going to spend time building ButterFS support?

48:45.240 --> 48:46.240
No, of course not.

48:46.240 --> 48:47.240
Oh, that's funny.

48:47.240 --> 48:48.240
I did throw XFS.

48:48.240 --> 48:49.240
Oh, good man.

48:49.240 --> 48:50.240
That's worth building.

48:50.240 --> 48:51.240
Yeah.

48:51.240 --> 48:52.240
I wanted to make you smile.

48:52.240 --> 48:53.240
So you're off to the races over there.

48:53.240 --> 48:54.240
Yeah.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.240
You'll probably be building for almost the rest of the show.

48:55.240 --> 48:59.000
Well, that's good, because coming up here in a second, I'm going to play some clips

48:59.000 --> 49:06.640
of Andreas Andonopoulos, who is, I think, one of the best thinkers and speakers on Bitcoin.

49:06.640 --> 49:10.720
If you're a Bitcoin skeptic, and I've been hearing from some of you, stay tuned, because

49:10.720 --> 49:12.120
we're going to get the Bitcoin out of our systems.

49:12.120 --> 49:14.880
We're going to talk about it, and then we're just going to move on for a while.

49:14.880 --> 49:18.120
But it is an open source issue.

49:18.120 --> 49:22.560
It's not even like a Beanie Babies kind of tulips.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.800
It is an open source issue.

49:24.800 --> 49:25.800
And I want to talk about that.

49:25.800 --> 49:27.760
So first, let's talk about DigitalOcean.

49:27.760 --> 49:31.440
Oh, DigitalOcean.com, you go over there, you create an account.

49:31.440 --> 49:33.720
Once your account's set up, you use the promo code DOUNPLUGED.

49:33.720 --> 49:34.720
It's magic.

49:34.720 --> 49:35.720
Then you get a $10 credit.

49:35.720 --> 49:39.980
And the next thing you know, you're spinning about infrastructure in less than 55 seconds.

49:39.980 --> 49:41.200
Everything is SSD powered.

49:41.200 --> 49:42.840
They're all SSDs.

49:42.840 --> 49:47.080
They have a gorgeous, simple, elegant interface to manage all of it.

49:47.080 --> 49:50.200
And it's not simple like in like the per her dumb way.

49:50.200 --> 49:53.940
It's simple in, of course, it should work like this, which is the sweet spot.

49:53.940 --> 49:57.960
They have all kinds of storage options from built in storage to your droplets, object

49:57.960 --> 50:03.000
storage, which is simple object storage, block storage, which is one of the easiest ways

50:03.000 --> 50:05.840
to go because it just shows up as a dev SD device.

50:05.840 --> 50:08.400
And they have monitoring and alerting that collects metrics.

50:08.400 --> 50:11.080
And you can receive alerts when things go down.

50:11.080 --> 50:15.020
Load balancing is a service that are fully managed out of the box and distribute incoming

50:15.020 --> 50:21.280
traffic and 40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors with data centers all over the

50:21.280 --> 50:22.280
world.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.840
And they have a lot of information.com, go spin up a Linux rig of your choosing.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.440
They got a bunch of distros to choose from.

50:26.440 --> 50:32.280
Use the promo code do unplugged and apply some of that to a future project.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.620
And amazingly, you can use that on BSD.

50:34.620 --> 50:36.240
You could, you could, you really could.

50:36.240 --> 50:41.160
You could go all in or you could do, I've been doing a lot of LTS for like even just

50:41.160 --> 50:42.160
like a half hour.

50:42.160 --> 50:45.880
I'll spin something up, try it out and be like, and just destroy it.

50:45.880 --> 50:46.880
Why would you do that, Chris?

50:46.880 --> 50:47.880
You got Portsons EFS.

50:47.880 --> 50:48.880
You don't need none of that stuff.

50:48.880 --> 50:51.080
You know, the other thing too is like when I'm doing this, like I start working, I'm

50:51.080 --> 50:52.920
like, Oh, this is something I'm keeping around.

50:52.920 --> 50:55.240
It takes like two seconds to set up the DNS.

50:55.240 --> 50:57.140
It's really easy.

50:57.140 --> 50:58.840
And then you can also attach your SSH key.

50:58.840 --> 51:02.920
So you don't have to like even like mess around with like changing passwords after the machine

51:02.920 --> 51:03.920
spun up.

51:03.920 --> 51:04.920
It's just, it's aces.

51:04.920 --> 51:10.400
I like the portability of storage between different droplets.

51:10.400 --> 51:16.080
DigitalOcean.com use our promo code do unplugged and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

51:16.080 --> 51:17.480
the unplugged program.

51:17.480 --> 51:23.440
Now let's talk a little about Bitcoin here and Andreas Antonopoulos was on the Kevin

51:23.440 --> 51:24.840
Rose show, which apparently is a thing.

51:24.840 --> 51:25.840
Didn't even really know this.

51:25.840 --> 51:26.840
Is that right?

51:26.840 --> 51:27.840
Yeah.

51:27.840 --> 51:28.840
Okay.

51:28.840 --> 51:29.840
From the Ashes of Dig.

51:29.840 --> 51:30.840
I am.

51:30.840 --> 51:31.840
Yeah.

51:31.840 --> 51:32.840
I'm a big fan of Andreas and I've read some of his books.

51:32.840 --> 51:33.840
I'm going to recommend them to you right now.

51:33.840 --> 51:37.680
Mastering Bitcoin, The Internet of Money and his one that hasn't been released yet, but

51:37.680 --> 51:42.360
I think it's going to be the one I read, Mastering Ethereum, which we'll talk more about at some

51:42.360 --> 51:43.720
point in the future.

51:43.720 --> 51:47.440
And there's several issues that I want to talk about today on the show that I think

51:47.440 --> 51:50.680
probably apply the most to Linux users.

51:50.680 --> 51:57.280
And it's the idea of closed services, centralized services versus distributed services, open

51:57.280 --> 52:00.180
protocols and community efforts.

52:00.180 --> 52:04.480
And it's in this context, I think it's where we could start talking about Bitcoin versus

52:04.480 --> 52:09.120
things like PayPal or other payment services.

52:09.120 --> 52:11.560
There's lots of payment services now.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.520
Everybody's got a payment service it seems like.

52:13.520 --> 52:16.560
So what's the difference between being able to send money with Bitcoin and be able to

52:16.560 --> 52:21.320
use these payment services that actually use like your local currency?

52:21.320 --> 52:26.560
And it's sort of the same difference between Linux and a commercial operating system.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.440
PayPal, Venmo, they're services.

52:29.440 --> 52:33.480
Bitcoin is a protocol and there's a very big difference between those two.

52:33.480 --> 52:37.760
Bitcoin is a protocol that allows you to do trusted transactions with people you don't

52:37.760 --> 52:44.800
trust and to independently verify the authority of those transactions without trusting anybody

52:44.800 --> 52:45.800
else.

52:45.800 --> 52:48.920
And that's really the magic behind it.

52:48.920 --> 52:53.880
By turning money and other trusted transactions into an internet protocol, it opens the door

52:53.880 --> 52:58.120
for all of the internet related goodies to happen.

52:58.120 --> 53:01.600
When you're talking about Bitcoin, you can't really talk about Bitcoin without talking

53:01.600 --> 53:07.160
about the technology of the blockchain, which is sort of that trust guarantee system.

53:07.160 --> 53:12.980
And I think that's one of the unique aspects of Bitcoin that you can't really rely on PayPal,

53:12.980 --> 53:16.800
you can't really rely on your bank and these two organizations have to be competing with

53:16.800 --> 53:17.800
each other.

53:17.800 --> 53:20.440
They don't even necessarily trust themselves and the entire relationship is awkward for

53:20.440 --> 53:21.440
the customer.

53:21.440 --> 53:23.760
All of that goes away with a public ledger.

53:23.760 --> 53:27.920
So that is one of the true core values of Bitcoin outside of the currency that you can

53:27.920 --> 53:29.680
spend itself.

53:29.680 --> 53:33.080
But I know one of the other things people are getting confused about these days and

53:33.080 --> 53:36.920
it is really confusing is all of these other currencies.

53:36.920 --> 53:38.960
There's tons of other crypto currencies.

53:38.960 --> 53:43.960
Back during Plan B, there was a couple, you know, you had Dogecoin, you had Litecoin.

53:43.960 --> 53:44.960
Now there's...

53:44.960 --> 53:46.960
It was simple, clean, easy world.

53:46.960 --> 53:52.880
Now from that has emerged great complexity and there's many crypto currencies.

53:52.880 --> 53:56.240
And this is something that people often point to and say, well, obviously Bitcoin is going

53:56.240 --> 54:00.620
to fall apart and disappear one day because there's all these other crypto currencies

54:00.620 --> 54:04.000
out there and it's just a mess.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.200
Well, what does that sound like?

54:07.200 --> 54:08.200
Money.

54:08.200 --> 54:09.200
Yeah, it does.

54:09.200 --> 54:12.080
And it sounds like there's a lot of Linux distributions out there.

54:12.080 --> 54:14.380
There's all these different Linux distributions out there.

54:14.380 --> 54:17.760
There are thousands of Linux distributions out there.

54:17.760 --> 54:19.640
How will you ever be able to pick?

54:19.640 --> 54:23.080
But just because there's thousands of Linux distributions doesn't mean that people don't

54:23.080 --> 54:25.320
install CentOS or Ubuntu.

54:25.320 --> 54:27.960
So you have to think about these as niche products.

54:27.960 --> 54:31.760
I think there are a lot of promising things happening across the entire ecosystem and

54:31.760 --> 54:37.440
I think part of the adaptation that we're having to go through is this idea that we've

54:37.440 --> 54:43.600
grown up having monopoly currencies that are national flag currencies that exist in a zero

54:43.600 --> 54:49.520
sum geopolitical chess game where one only wins if it beats the other and all of that

54:49.520 --> 54:50.520
attitude.

54:50.520 --> 54:56.080
Very much like in the past we used to have five national newspapers, they existed in

54:56.080 --> 55:00.400
direct competition, the space was limited, the market share was fixed.

55:00.400 --> 55:02.320
And then bloggers happened.

55:02.320 --> 55:05.280
And then you have to ask, well, how many bloggers can possibly exist?

55:05.280 --> 55:13.080
And the answer is all of us and it doesn't diminish or change the value of mainstream

55:13.080 --> 55:17.200
news if they had value in the first place, if they retained value in the first place.

55:17.200 --> 55:19.480
And it doesn't mean that all of them are good.

55:19.480 --> 55:22.800
Most of them are not, but some of them are great.

55:22.800 --> 55:25.320
And so the same thing has now happened with currencies.

55:25.320 --> 55:30.480
We have to get used to a world in which there are now thousands of currencies, there will

55:30.480 --> 55:37.240
be tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands, then millions, and then billions of digital

55:37.240 --> 55:43.720
currencies that can be created and destroyed in moments that can be created by anyone for

55:43.720 --> 55:52.480
reasons as silly as a loyalty currency that's created by Joey the five-year-old in order

55:52.480 --> 56:00.480
to socially engage with their primary school friends versus a global reserve currency that

56:00.480 --> 56:02.680
China is using to buy oil.

56:02.680 --> 56:04.320
Both of those are digital currencies.

56:04.320 --> 56:08.240
Both exist on the same spectrum of continuum, have nothing to do with each other.

56:08.240 --> 56:12.760
Once you get comfortable with that idea, you start realizing that all of these currencies

56:12.760 --> 56:18.560
effectively are now playing an evolutionary game where as programmable currencies they

56:18.560 --> 56:23.520
fit into specific niches and they compete for those niches.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.760
And some are successful and some are not.

56:25.760 --> 56:28.860
And they emerge to occupy new niches.

56:28.860 --> 56:34.800
And they may be designed to do one thing and then somehow the market twists them into doing

56:34.800 --> 56:37.240
something else, et cetera, et cetera.

56:37.240 --> 56:41.520
Now one of the things I think that is hard for people in the States in particular, I

56:41.520 --> 56:46.240
think people outside the States maybe don't suffer this problem as much, but in the US

56:46.240 --> 56:49.840
a lot of people, a lot of the people that don't get Bitcoin at all, they don't get the

56:49.840 --> 56:55.120
value of it because they have the benefit of using the US dollar, which happens to be

56:55.120 --> 56:56.960
the world reserve currency.

56:56.960 --> 57:00.980
It happens to be very well established, very good value.

57:00.980 --> 57:06.120
So Bitcoin doesn't really have as much of a, there's not as much of a need, there's

57:06.120 --> 57:08.440
not as much of a market demand here.

57:08.440 --> 57:12.040
But we've all heard of countries like Zimbabwe and other places where currencies are going

57:12.040 --> 57:16.920
like crazy or countries where they're using it to control the citizens in a very oppressive

57:16.920 --> 57:23.480
way that are outside the US, you start seeing where a worldwide accepted internet based

57:23.480 --> 57:26.200
currency could be extremely useful.

57:26.200 --> 57:31.160
But there are uses even in the West, even though our governments are fairly stable and

57:31.160 --> 57:36.440
our currencies are accepted for paying taxes and we're all pretty happy with this arrangement.

57:36.440 --> 57:42.960
Think about how open source software development brought an entirely new level of transparency

57:42.960 --> 57:48.060
to the software development process and there's aspects of it we still suffer from today.

57:48.060 --> 57:52.440
Like when Linus yells at somebody, we go, oh my gosh, somebody said something hostile

57:52.440 --> 57:58.320
in the workplace, as if that doesn't happen at every major company like HP and Dell and

57:58.320 --> 58:03.260
Apple and Amazon, as if there aren't tyrants in all of those companies that are the iron

58:03.260 --> 58:07.240
hand that actually get the project done, but we don't see it.

58:07.240 --> 58:11.800
Open source development brought a level of transparency to software development that

58:11.800 --> 58:13.220
we'd never seen before.

58:13.220 --> 58:18.120
In fact, it would make companies like Microsoft back in the 80s extremely uncomfortable and

58:18.120 --> 58:24.480
Bill Gates famously penned a letter to a computer society just talking about all of the downsides

58:24.480 --> 58:27.580
of free and shareware and open source software.

58:27.580 --> 58:32.080
It was a big warning piece because this would expose the way software was developed and

58:32.080 --> 58:34.040
it did and it has.

58:34.040 --> 58:35.880
The development history is in the public.

58:35.880 --> 58:36.960
We can review it.

58:36.960 --> 58:39.320
The mailing lists are in the public.

58:39.320 --> 58:44.380
That kind of transparency fundamentally changed software development, just like open source

58:44.380 --> 58:49.620
money and a public blockchain with a public ledger can fundamentally change money and

58:49.620 --> 58:53.800
fundamentally change trust and think about it in the context of charities.

58:53.800 --> 58:59.680
Part of the difficulty we have in the area of charity is that a lot of the need is in

58:59.680 --> 59:01.640
places far away across borders.

59:01.640 --> 59:07.420
A lot of the resources is on the other side of these borders and getting the money across

59:07.420 --> 59:13.320
the borders and distributed to people without 99% of it disappearing in the cracks is a

59:13.320 --> 59:14.880
big problem with charities.

59:14.880 --> 59:21.960
So there's a favorite charity of mine called BitGive that's doing, it's a Bitcoin foundation,

59:21.960 --> 59:30.400
it's a Bitcoin charity that is a charitable foundation and it uses this technology to

59:30.400 --> 59:34.240
re-envision how charity can be done and they have a project called Giftrack and what this

59:34.240 --> 59:40.280
allows you to do is watch on the blockchain and track the money you sent in all the way

59:40.280 --> 59:46.000
down to the money that got spent to buy the bricks to build the well for the water project

59:46.000 --> 59:49.920
in Kenya and so you can actually see all of the flows of money.

59:49.920 --> 59:53.420
It's not an accounting report that's sent to you.

59:53.420 --> 59:59.200
Every single contributor to the charity can in real time and without asking anyone audit

59:59.200 --> 01:00:05.680
the charity online and just looking at the blockchain track all of the information.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.760
That seems really like a very compelling use and you could, charity is one example I think

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.640
we could all sort of wrap our heads around but there's so many others.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.400
I mean what about public broadcasting?

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.040
Think about that for a second.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.760
It's just real or open source development where you could see exactly how the Gnome

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:28.000
foundation spent every single mil a bit down to like you know the the forks if you wanted

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.800
to which would just totally change transparency and you know the trust level that end users

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.600
would have by giving and you could stand out as a brand if you participated in that level

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.160
of transparency and cryptocurrency isn't just Bitcoin.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:47.680
It's all and you can have all these other crazy currencies but this concept, cryptographically

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.680
verified transactions with a public ledger, it's already a huge source of application

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.680
development.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.320
There's a lot of different stuff come out companies like Bank of America, IBM, the Linux

01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.320
Foundation.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.160
I was about to say we've talked about the Linux Foundation's hyper ledger several times.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.560
Yep they're all working on like their hyper ledger there which is a blockchain based technology.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.300
Cryptocurrencies are here to stay forever.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.360
There is no putting this genie back in the box.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:18.560
This idea of a network based open and decentralized currency and all of the other applications

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.900
that happen, that has happened.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:26.120
The recipe was created, it's repeatable, it can be recreated as many times as needed until

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.480
it succeeds.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:33.600
If it has flaws those flaws can be fixed in various evolutionary iterations, some continuous

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.240
some discontinuous and disruptive.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.720
The bottom line is the world needs that.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:44.800
The world needs an open public neutral economy that's not you know being kicked around because

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.200
of geopolitics or used as a tool for surveillance and control.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:54.400
That is needed and it's needed so much that I have no doubt in my mind that it will be

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.200
wildly successful and it will completely transform the way we do commerce in the next 20 years

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.200
absolutely.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:08.320
And it's going to transform in ways we can't even expect and that thing will underpin trillions

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:13.120
of dollars of economic activity whether it's Bitcoin and we still call it that I don't

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.120
know.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.800
I know that such a thing will exist there's no going away from that.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.360
You know I think I agree I don't know if it's Bitcoin either.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.280
You know in a year Bitcoin could be could totally crash or it could be worth a hundred

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.280
thousand dollars.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.960
And I think what you were talking you know like it really is the 1990s in the Linux world

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.160
in the in the public ledger world there's a lot more that we haven't yet seen.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.220
Ethereum is still pretty niche like there's just there's a lot of potential application.

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:43.320
If you're going to be stuck in a cash controlled society then if that's going to be the real

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:48.120
master that we all are obeying then why not have it be something that's open source that's

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:52.760
publicly trackable that's cryptographically verified that's detached from the state.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.880
So we've you know you always hear about the divorce of church and state the separation

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.080
of church and state.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:02.240
Well how about the separation of state and money.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:07.480
That's what that's what cryptocurrency represents is money and state becoming separated.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.040
And even I mean all the actors that are involved right because like right now it's really just

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.600
a good old boys network of places that are deemed on the trustworthy list that get with

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.160
algorithms that we never see that get to handle how these digits and accounts work.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.080
And if you if you follow the unfiltered show there's been lots of manipulating of things

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:27.080
of like light all and or whatever it's called the yeah.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:33.560
So anyways I haven't I have a bunch of additional resources in the show notes including the

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:38.320
link to the Kevin Rose show that has the entire interview with Andreas it's it's it's it's

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.320
good.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:42.120
Kevin Rose is a really good speaker and he's really good.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.440
He's thought a lot about this and it's episode 16 of the Kevin Rose show.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.080
I got a link in the show notes if you want to catch that it's a it's pretty good because

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.840
Kevin's a Bitcoin investor himself so he's got a lot of questions like what about quantum

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.560
computing is that going to screw up Bitcoin.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.700
And Andreas answers that also have links to a couple of the wallets that go on your phone

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:06.240
that he likes the best that bit give foundation that he mentioned and a link that was provided

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.240
in our discord.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.240
That is so cool.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.320
There is a command line utility that you throw on your good news slash Linux box and it's

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:18.640
called Coinmon and it spits out after you install it's like if you have MPM it's MPM

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:24.400
install dash G coinmon and then you run coinmon and you could tell what currencies you want

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.240
what not and you get look at that screen there with you get this you get this like like there's

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:34.240
a dump of BTC value and the theory of all the different coins and it's a you know me

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.960
I love a nice sort of anchors style it's not actually it's all ASCII.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:41.160
But I just love that in a terminal especially when you can put it in like a quake drop down

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.960
exactly just your nerd fix right there.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.960
That's coinmon we'll have a link in the show notes just a great way to track different

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.280
crypto currencies.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:55.120
You know we just we just kind of had to get out of our system I feel like because people

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.280
been asking when it gets when it gets to these new price milestones more and more people

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:03.080
either come out as skeptics or more and more people come out as interested all of a sudden.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:08.960
But I really do think it's a Linux you I think more than say your average tech enthusiast.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:14.320
I think Linux users should be more keen to recognize the values of something this important

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.320
being open source.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:21.080
It's an old open culture sort of from the aspect of even aside from the technology aspect.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.640
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.320
Daredevil wants to jump in I think on it.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.200
So before we wrap up on the Bitcoin topic Daredevil and you want to do a shoot.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.200
Go ahead.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.960
Yeah I actually see a couple of issues with these existing everybody that is optimistic

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:35.720
and especially people that are invested want to see it succeed.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:40.520
I understand that perfectly sure I understand the value of having the transparency which

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.520
is great.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:45.720
But there is the other point of now certain governments like Venezuela's government that

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.680
is actually issuing their own currency Russia that is issuing their own currency cryptocurrency.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:56.200
The idea is that then they are able to avoid sanctions so you lose a little bit of the

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.960
equilibrium that exists politically and you might think that that's not important but

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:04.000
I personally actually believe that there is actually great importance right there as if

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.320
it wasn't for the new strategies of war really putting in words as they are the political

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:16.860
spectrum sanctions being a form of not actually investing in physical aggression you start

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:22.560
actually having again a lose of an ability that you currently have.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:25.840
What is the difference between honestly I'm asking what would be the difference between

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:32.560
that or them choosing you know another currency that's not Bitcoin that's like it's gold.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.720
So it's not so much that is Bitcoin they're using they're actually created right.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:42.400
The purpose here for me and that I feel is this will lead to another imminent problem

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:46.560
but don't you feel like that would be the same if they use any other currency like even

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.800
if it wasn't crypto.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.520
No I don't think actually no because so when it's not crypto because there is an actual

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:56.840
institution behind it you actually when people talk about the PayPal being a service and

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:59.240
Bitcoin is a protocol not quite.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.000
There's actually an international service how trade needs to work.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.120
You actually have to set up other countries have to believe that they can actually buy

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:10.040
and have some balance on your currency so they can actually trade with you.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.120
It's actually a protocol.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.640
Now they put a name to it and then there's an institution in the government they can

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.560
look and say it's your fault you did it wrong.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.160
So the argument though the core of the argument is that if they go to an uncontrollable currency

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:29.560
that doesn't have an organization behind it then other governments lose levers of negotiation.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.320
Yes and not so much not only that actually there's actually another piece a little bit

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:39.760
which makes it worse is we're moving towards a spectrum and a state that governments will

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.720
want to actually be regulating Bitcoin.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:48.920
They have the actual capacity to be having the majority of the servers just so you guys

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:53.840
know and I'm not sure if you've been looking actually the current Bitcoin economy economy

01:07:53.840 --> 01:08:00.400
only Bitcoin already spends more than 21 European countries in electricity bill.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.400
Yeah I've heard that.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:04.580
I don't I don't buy it either and not combined.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:08.700
It's not combined but if you look at individual European nations are small so it is very likely

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:12.660
impossible that that can happen but in order to get that that's a rabbit hole I don't we

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:16.000
address that on Linux action news a few weeks ago so I'll just I'll refer people to that

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000
but so just to just so you see I guess where I'm coming from here is I totally follow your

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:28.920
point that if Russia goes off and creates you know the Moscow coin and now the Russian

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:35.640
economy is doing sales with other large economies using the Moscow coin I do I do grok that

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:40.920
then the US and the West in general lose a hammer that they can hit Putin over the head

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:45.760
with but at the same time that feels almost similar to the argument of well if you open

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.240
source the software and give it away then these huge corporations are going to go out

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.080
of business and there's lots of jobs they're going to be not at all I'm not going on that

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:59.020
route what I'm going is there is a lot of things that are tied to the fact that there's

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:03.940
actual power structure and money is what governs this power structure yeah what we're moving

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:09.640
away is the power structure for us as people that have been enjoying democracy it is fantastic

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:14.700
that we can get these extra further control of our lives it's awesome and it feels great

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:20.500
as a principle the problem I see is the other power plays that we actually don't have to

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:25.920
deal on a daily basis that we are totally dependent on but we don't realize in an every

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.580
that's a hard sell that's a pretty hard sell to get people to care about that I mean because

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:33.680
you're essentially you're also at the same time advocating for the for the ability for

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.860
some nations to abuse that lever which likely happens more than it gets used correctly try

01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:43.880
really hard to not be hypocritical when in the way I live my life and that requires that

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.680
I acknowledge what the advantage you're right there is an advantage there it's a fair point

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:52.640
it seems like a lot like oh sorry I mean advantage in in the terms of you know as Trump would

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.840
see it that's an advantage for Donald Trump or Rex Tillerson at the State Department is

01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:01.180
not necessarily advantage for Chris the podcaster well you also get other than the benefits

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:05.800
I guess I receive remotely at us as a citizen of a nation that is using those levers to

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.660
make life better I would say to I would wrap I would wrap this segment with this thought

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:15.760
is we are at the really early stages and it's weird because the value is trying to get to

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.740
the point where it feels like it's bigger than it's it's like it's bigger than it fits

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:25.820
in its own boots right now exactly and I think we're gonna see probably I don't know 20 years

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:30.440
of iteration and that's where all these different cryptocurrencies will sort of battle it out

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.740
and again to make a comparison just like we see a bunch of different open source forks

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:39.720
and projects sort of battle it out over years and sometimes it looks like a waste of resources

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:46.040
or a deferral of resources but over time usually projects emerge as the dominant player in

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.880
that particular vertical if you will right and it's I think we're gonna see that same

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.880
thing happen with cryptocurrency I think I mean to summarize both you and daredevil

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:59.720
its points it's this is early days there's a lot of effects both positive and negative

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.400
so it's just we should be paying attention proceed responsibly yeah and there we go yeah

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:09.720
and also consider that any of this stuff could be replaced by something superior because

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:13.780
it's a technical thing right so you can actually have something even more innovative come along

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:18.200
one day in theory yeah so it's a it's a totally different beast that people are now actually

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:23.160
putting real money into and overall it is going to make like international monetary

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:28.440
stuff more transparent because like if foreign governments implement something on a blockchain

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:34.480
well you can now track the the movement of money through foreign governments on a public

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.720
way boy it'd be really inconvenient to have like isis on the blockchain that would that

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.280
would be really inconvenient track that let's go let's move on now and get ready for the

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.640
gentoo challenge so everybody get ready that wants to check in uh we're gonna we're gonna

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.520
follow up on the gentoo challenge here in just a moment yeah you feeling good over there

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:52.680
yeah yeah oh very good all right well before we go to the gentoo corner i'll mention ting

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:56.880
real quick here go to linux.ting.com go check it out this is the perfect time to pick up

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:01.600
a ting sim for about nine dollars seven dollars depends on the sale they have going you can

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.800
even get it off of amazon prime you can get a ting sim you pop that in a device and when

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:12.640
you're ready it's pay for what you use wireless service your minutes your messages and your

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:17.120
megabytes whatever you use that's what you pay my friends it's that simple it's just

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:21.220
six dollars for your line and then you got the uncle sam cut in there for your particular

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:25.320
region and then it's just your minutes and your messages and your megabytes with no contract

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:31.000
nationwide coverage you pay for what you use and they have a cdma and a gsm network to

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.240
choose from which gives you the option to pick up whatever might be better in your area

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.160
like i did a little speed test here and i think on average i get about i get about 21

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:43.220
megabits on gsm here at the studio which is a little bit better than i got on the cdma

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:48.240
so for the most part i i use gsm now and it's wonderful when i travel to have those different

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:52.080
options they have a dashboard that makes it easy to use you can see your usage at a glance

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:57.040
have complete control set up usage alerts if you want to buy a device directly from

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.440
ting you can do that too you don't have to buy the sim card if you want you can just

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.080
buy a device directly it's a really easy process to bring a phone over though and i recommend

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.940
that because if you bring a phone you get 25 in service credit and that'll probably

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:11.920
pay for more than your first month average ting bills 23 a month per line the compatibility

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.840
is pretty crazy especially with both networks like of all the people i've switched to i

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.760
don't think any of them wasn't able to bring your phone it was just like they have a real

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:22.120
easy pyod page too that makes it super easy to look it up is this going to work or not

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:25.560
um so yes go to linux.ting.com because if you want to get a device if you just want

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.680
to hit the easy button and buy one directly from them they'll take 25 off the device too

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.540
you deserve it a new shiny christmas present i mean come on yeah really yeah give it out

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:36.840
to somebody in their stocking they can put in a device they have sitting around all of

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:40.560
a sudden they have great use at a device they just pay for what they use with it and it's

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.840
a stepping stone from there you go geez ting's great then you get another device and it's

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:48.760
only six dollars for each line so it's easy to go from there and they'll love it you can

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:55.900
get it for yourself too i suppose linux.ting.com linux.ting.com all right so let's go over

01:13:55.900 --> 01:14:01.280
into the gen 2 corner here how is your build going over there mr wes oh we've got a kernel

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:06.160
do you oh yeah i'm impressed so i think that's a pretty good way to end it uh now we just

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:10.640
need to do a little more configuration yeah bootloader fs tab a few couple other niceties

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.800
to have hostname you know those things yeah i think next episode will be booted and ready

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:20.080
to go i am impressed i am glad to see that's going well so are you ready for the reveal

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.680
then on the desktop environment that people want you to build yeah i'm excited should

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.840
we take guesses yeah all right i mean do you remember do you remember which ones we asked

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:32.280
about we asked about three enlightenment uh sway and lumina you are correct those are

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:38.200
the ones do you have a guess as to how it's gone knowing our audience they probably chose

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:44.240
the most boring one sway why is that the most boring one i think that's the most exciting

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:51.240
one it's boring yeah 48 of the audience voted for sway lumina desktop came in at deuce and

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.360
then enlightenment uh with 25 of the votes actually really close to lumina oh wow see

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.960
but the thing about sway is that it's a wayland compositor and dropping a replacement for

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:03.640
i3 so you got the i3 lovers and you got the wayland lovers they're all going to come together

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.440
behind sway and it just seems to make sense to me yeah but you don't get like the esoteric

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:12.640
ness of lumina yeah or the eye candy of enlightenment but it will be our first sway review on the

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:17.080
show too true yeah we do need to get back to enlightenment and lumina though that is

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.200
something that does need to be all right we got to get to that all right so let's check

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.120
in with the virtual log uh how are we doing in here guys how's your how's your gen 2 day

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:34.400
going anybody anybody no i thought ben was i'm a bit sad that you went with sway even

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.760
though i understand it's the most popular yeah yeah but you would have covered sway

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:44.000
inevitably at some point that's true i like that you did with it like that you actually

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.840
went with it because i've been actually uh the lame i switched this way so well we put

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.760
it up for a vote so it was really you know on the flip side it does mean that we're going

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:58.440
to be compiling wayland on gentoo yeah well it's either that or x so right we're building

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:03.680
one way uh now bashful were you doing an install uh along with us i noticed you said you grabbed

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:09.680
the minimal iso during the show there what kind of shenanigans were you doing no that

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:16.520
was actually back regarding the multi-abundance installer oh that'll work too that's an easier

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:21.840
path that would be yeah that would be so are you feeling good about sway i'm meeting to

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.320
try you could as a challengee i suppose you could override you could submit an override

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:30.520
but i i have been wanting to see it you could secretly install all of them that's true was

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:33.960
built taking a long time yeah i might have to do some pre-building in that case i know

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:37.920
we have some people building along with us and so if they would like to do sway as well

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:45.760
i think though ben did um it's like gnome 2 recently so that's an option we should we

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:52.800
haven't considered at all dude it's hell you do not want to go down there i've got i've

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:57.000
got i can imagine let's do gnome one it was just such a huge like going from sway to gnome

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.240
2 that's a bit of a leave that's what it is wow so might be tricky gnome 2 on wayland

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.920
yeah that would be a thing and it will it all be in an x wayland session yeah the power

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:13.420
of x wayland there so any other notes ben on your journey so far as we've uh as we've

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:19.760
done the gen 2 challenge i think i'm good thank you okay i like that you tried gnome

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:24.480
2 though good on you and uh i think the report works so next week then we'll get the system

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:29.120
bootable it sounds like and if anybody back for that okay all right and if anybody else

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:33.840
wants to play along at home if you want to catch up to us at this point you have to get

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:40.160
your vm essentially uh booting off of the install yep stage three get your kernel built

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.320
with your particular parameters and then i suppose next episode it's bootloader set it

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.880
all up and reboots have you already partitioned uh yes okay so you've got your file system

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:53.680
set up uh yeah that's right yeah yeah okay and it went just real simple this time so

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:58.800
it's basically like an efi partition we are doing gpt efi here so uh okay that's an extra

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:05.360
layer of fun all right well that closes out the the gen 2 corner this week very nice wes

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:09.280
good job over there you pulled it out it's making me want to build some gen 2 on digital

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.880
ocean too now that we're just doing this already well i need to have a lot faster cpu yeah right

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:18.100
exactly yeah but you got the kernel built so challenge day one is completed episode

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:22.080
one 226 we're gonna see how long this takes i think you're gonna go faster than we were

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.200
initially expected i think you're gonna have this done pretty soon all right well let us

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.920
know what you think on your thoughts about bitcoin and open source currencies on the

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.280
gen 2 challenge and any other news items you think we should cover go over to linux unplug

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:39.320
dot reddit dot com linux unplug dot reddit dot com is where you go if you want to give

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.200
us your email thoughts if you don't like the social medias you can go to the jupyter broadcasting

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:48.160
dot com slash contact otherwise you can also always hit me up on twitter at chris las with

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:54.840
your show thoughts and ideas also check out wes and i on the new brand new rebooted texas

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.760
coming out later this week i guess we probably should have teased this a little more that's

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:02.240
probably true it's going to be a soft lid it's going to be a re-envisioning of the show

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:06.680
and i think one for the better and i hope you guys will give it a go and share your

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:12.200
thoughts with us and in the meantime go over to jupyter broadcasting dot com slash calendar

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:17.680
and uh observe the live time observe the live time because there's only a few left this

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:23.160
year wow yeah boy and there's some more bitcoin coverage on upcoming user as well yeah we'll

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:28.240
do a little more yeah stay tuned for that friend of the show often a frequent contributor

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:34.400
and all-around great guy martin wimpers joins us a very special user air in the future that'll

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:38.080
be coming out down the road though there's just so much good stuff a holiday yeah like

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.920
a holiday special if you will which we may do a holiday special of this year show too

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.240
as well so i'm open to ideas for that too if you want to leave a comment on what we

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:49.360
should do for a holiday special let me know at chris las thank you for joining us on this

01:19:49.360 --> 01:20:15.920
week's of unplugged and you know what we'll see you back here next week

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:35.960
i feel like for the holiday show all options are on the table so i think we should be

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:41.240
drinking some sort of uh oh like a holiday beverage alcoholic holiday i'm in oh i don't

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:45.880
do big on eggnog no oh just because the dairy yeah right but like what about like a spiced

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:50.640
apple cider or something yeah i'm sticking with the eggnog what would we do i'm open

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.280
i'm open to ideas from the chats and the and the discords and the uh and the mumbles on

01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:00.160
what we should do for a holiday special open source yule log maybe i don't know what that

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:08.400
means yeah yeah like or suveen with wes and chris oh boy is our food judge yeah we um

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:13.440
we could uh make things from the open your mouth repo yes that's right i forgot about

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:17.640
that we could that's an interesting those open source recipes are up there uh so a bit

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:23.840
of emerging value emerged unplug gen2 madness those are our irc kind of like gen2 madness

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.560
it's not bad although it doesn't talk about anything else in this show plus we got to

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:31.760
save some bitcoin yeah and we got it oh that's right and plus i think we want to save it

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:37.600
for the finale too the gen2 thing um so we have uh the open economy welcome to the real

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:42.680
world open source doing it in public that's not bad kind of like doing it in public so

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:47.160
i had a real basic one but i thought it would maybe be the most descriptive and it was bitcoin

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:52.480
for linux users yeah kind of felt like that is like the heart of your message in this

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:58.160
episode yeah i think that's reasonable um all right so yeah anybody in the mumble room

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.560
have any ideas on what we should do for our holiday special bashful you could come down

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:05.920
and celebrate with us come down here and do a holiday special what day are you doing it

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.840
i don't know i just thought of this we just we literally just we have something we know

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:12.920
we need to do we're probably gonna do it in the next couple of weeks you know so that

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:17.440
way what with the holiday time yeah yeah the sooner probably the better but we need to

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:21.480
come up with a fun idea first i like it sounds like we're trending towards food at the moment

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:25.680
but i don't know if that's what we're gonna do we're trending towards food you could you

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.080
could uh play a bridge game on gb did you see how many people did you see that was like

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:34.440
one of the number one feedbacks from the last user errors people want people wanted to learn

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:39.120
about like you use a video stream bridge game or something okay yeah that would be good

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:44.960
that is doable i'll bring my 2v machine i'll show west like one thing and then he could

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.920
destroy me at bridge what a great how do we do that how do we do bridge in an audio podcast

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.800
though that's the question probably a video stream for that one yeah because a lot of

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:58.800
people listen to unplug that's the you know um but there's something there there's something

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.720
there too hungry though right yeah that's the problem something to think about we should

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:07.480
have talked about this at the end of a podcast when we're tired and hungry yeah something

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:10.920
to think about that if you guys have any ideas give it some thought all right well i think

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:15.480
we're gonna go with the boring basic bitcoin for linux users just because that's sort of

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:19.960
the best of what we do it open economy yeah i saw that one i don't mind it but it sounds

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:25.760
too um like uh corporatey to me a little bit like like an american express ad or something

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:31.080
but i do appreciate you guys being here thank you very much love your faces and uh probably

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:36.160
see you next time right i hope see you guys oh god oh god don't leave us please come back

01:23:36.160 --> 01:24:02.960
all right okay okay sorry sorry okay okay
