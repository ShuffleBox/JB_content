00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 4 for September 3rd, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, pour yourself a cold one, because honestly this show probably

00:41.000 --> 00:44.440
makes a lot more sense if you've had a few drinks, otherwise it sounds like a couple

00:44.440 --> 00:47.360
Linux users rambling about using Linux.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.560
My name is Chris.

00:48.560 --> 00:49.560
My name is Matt.

00:49.560 --> 00:54.000
Hey Matt, so we made it to four episodes, that's a month solid man, that's awesome.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.520
So I was just telling the, well I was just about to tell the story, I thought, no wait,

00:57.520 --> 01:03.160
I'll share it on air because it's embarrassing enough that I should share it with the audience.

01:03.160 --> 01:07.680
So when my wife was pregnant, you know one of the things preggo ladies do is they like

01:07.680 --> 01:11.900
to have certain foods, right, they want to have a food, for my wife it was citrusy flavors.

01:11.900 --> 01:16.000
So lemonade was perfect, it's summertime, it's hot outside, let's get some lemonade

01:16.000 --> 01:17.920
going on in this house.

01:17.920 --> 01:22.200
I got hooked Matt, I got hooked on lemonade, like I've never been hooked on it, every day

01:22.200 --> 01:23.200
gotta have a little lemonade.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.840
Oh this glass of water doesn't have any lemonade in it, I'll fix that, pour a little, you

01:25.840 --> 01:26.840
know.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.760
Yeah, gotta have lemonade, so I'm mixing it with everything, so I'm at the grocery store

01:30.760 --> 01:35.520
doing the shopping because the wife was on bed rest, and I'm like, we got a lot of lemonade

01:35.520 --> 01:40.600
at home, look at this, lemonade vodka, didn't know that was a thing, I mean I've never tried

01:40.600 --> 01:42.120
it, I knew it was a thing, but I've never tried it.

01:42.120 --> 01:48.720
So I grabbed myself a big bottle of lemonade vodka, or lemon vodka, and it turns out you

01:48.720 --> 01:51.980
could pour like half of that into a cup and pour half the other half with lemonade, go

01:51.980 --> 01:58.400
half and half and it's just a delicious treat Matt, well, I had two of those like a week

01:58.400 --> 02:02.120
ago, and I'm still feeling a little hungover from that, just a little bit.

02:02.120 --> 02:06.000
Oh yeah, well vodka doesn't play around, especially if you get the good stuff.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.480
Well I did not get the good stuff I don't think, I think it was being sold in the grocery

02:10.480 --> 02:13.480
store.

02:13.480 --> 02:18.040
Alright so we have a fun show today, one of the things that's new is we've dialed into

02:18.040 --> 02:24.760
a new mumble server, we called up on our 56k modems and called in, and no we got it set

02:24.760 --> 02:28.760
up, it's now hosted on Scale Engine, PriceTX has been working, took us off, got it all

02:28.760 --> 02:34.600
dialed in, we were on a hosted solution, the Arbulous had set up for us that was awesome,

02:34.600 --> 02:36.840
but we kept hitting user limits.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.640
Turns out people wanted to hang out and chat with each other while we were doing the show,

02:39.640 --> 02:43.840
they wanted to be involved with the show, and it was a lot more popular than we expected,

02:43.840 --> 02:52.600
so now we're on a new mumble box at TS.JupiterColony.com, and hopefully somebody in the IRC chat room

02:52.600 --> 02:55.480
will paste the port in there, but it's on a funky port.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.040
I'll try to put it in the show notes, because it's going to be open 24-7, so if you guys

02:59.040 --> 03:04.320
just want to hang out, it's essentially kind of like, it's an adjunct to the IRC, it's

03:04.320 --> 03:05.320
always going.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.160
And we got rooms in there for every show, we got general hangout rooms, so we're going

03:08.160 --> 03:14.720
to jump in there, we've got an on-air channel now, it's port 64-734, which by the way, if

03:14.720 --> 03:20.840
you just highlight that line that Tox put in the IRC, and then you open the mumble client,

03:20.840 --> 03:25.440
it will automatically detect that on your clipboard and fill it into the server settings

03:25.440 --> 03:26.440
for mumble.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.440
It's really nice.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.440
That's kind of slick, right?

03:28.440 --> 03:31.760
Yeah, that's, you know, that's an application you can really feel like was meant for the

03:31.760 --> 03:32.760
Linux desktop.

03:32.760 --> 03:33.840
Yeah, I like that.

03:33.840 --> 03:39.160
And that audio ducking thing they do, it feels like that Linux version of mumble is a first

03:39.160 --> 03:40.840
class Linux desktop application.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.760
Makes me excited what we might see in the future.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.760
Oh, definitely.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.600
So, we're going to chat with one of the, Ray, one of the folks that's in there.

03:48.600 --> 03:54.120
He's replaced Dropbox with InkFS, and I think Git, and a couple other things, he's sort

03:54.120 --> 03:57.640
of put these things together, he's wrote up a good post about it, and we caught it in

03:57.640 --> 04:01.400
our subreddit and said, let's talk to you, so he's come on, he's joined us, it's like

04:01.400 --> 04:06.360
11pm where he's at right now, and he's had a heck of a day.

04:06.360 --> 04:10.480
Today was one of those days, Matt, so on Friday I went to PAX, as you know, and while I'm

04:10.480 --> 04:14.720
at PAX, go figure, my phone starts buzzing.

04:14.720 --> 04:19.820
And I look down, hey, can you give us a call, we have an emergency.

04:19.820 --> 04:23.600
And so the way this works is, I don't have any clients that I go to on a regular basis

04:23.600 --> 04:28.320
anymore, but in a few circumstances, if their main IT guy is out, and then their backup

04:28.320 --> 04:30.800
guy is out, and they're really, really screwed, they'll call me.

04:30.800 --> 04:35.120
I'm like third guy in line, and if you're calling Chris, at that point, you're really

04:35.120 --> 04:36.120
screwed, right?

04:36.120 --> 04:37.800
At that point, you really don't want to be the guy going in.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.260
Oh, so true, man, so true.

04:40.260 --> 04:43.560
So there I am at PAX, and I'm getting the third guy call, and I'm like, oh no, this

04:43.560 --> 04:44.860
is bad, this is real bad.

04:44.860 --> 04:50.140
So I ended up working out a schedule with them, and worked them through some problems

04:50.140 --> 04:55.080
Friday night, then Monday was Labor Day, a holiday here, so they were closed, thankfully,

04:55.080 --> 04:57.040
so I was able to do code radio and all that.

04:57.040 --> 05:02.000
Go in there this morning, first thing, I roll in there at 8.30 a.m., and they've been down

05:02.000 --> 05:07.320
now for three days, essentially, they went down roughly Wednesday night, Thursday morning,

05:07.320 --> 05:11.700
they were down all day Thursday, all day Friday, and they are under contract with Washington

05:11.700 --> 05:15.080
State to have certain things posted on their website within four hours of receiving it

05:15.080 --> 05:16.080
from the state.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.080
Oh, that's not good.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.480
Or they're in violation of this contract, right, and that's a huge revenue source, right?

05:19.480 --> 05:24.160
So if they violate that contract, then the contract goes up for bid, they lose it, and

05:24.160 --> 05:26.080
then they lose like 70% of their funding.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.160
So of course, everything's on the line.

05:28.160 --> 05:33.400
And that was my morning, and I got in there, it's this whole custom scripted up system

05:33.400 --> 05:38.520
using R-Sync and NFS mounts all over the place, every server's got a mount to every

05:38.520 --> 05:44.080
other server, R-Sync's running, GNU parallel running all up in this place, it was, I mean,

05:44.080 --> 05:46.560
it is a spider's web of automation, Matt.

05:46.560 --> 05:47.880
It sounds like a mess.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.200
It was a mess.

05:49.200 --> 05:54.280
So before we get to talking with Ramy and do a couple of follow-up items, I wanted to

05:54.280 --> 05:58.400
do a quick public service announcement, speaking of things that are fantastic and optimized.

05:58.400 --> 06:03.840
Today, just before we went on air for Linux Unplugged, the Jupyter Broadcasting browser

06:03.840 --> 06:07.720
plugins for Chrome and Firefox, which are linked to the bottom of our website, were

06:07.720 --> 06:08.720
updated.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.480
Now, first thing you should probably know is, at least in Chrome, not sure about Firefox,

06:12.480 --> 06:15.920
it's requesting permissions, so you have to go in there and re-enable it, it'll be under

06:15.920 --> 06:19.720
the little hamburger menu, the little three-line button, that's officially, by the way, being

06:19.720 --> 06:21.040
called the hamburger button.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.040
The hamburger button.

06:22.040 --> 06:27.240
So yeah, you click that, there'll be a notification, and the reason why, it is requesting new permissions,

06:27.240 --> 06:30.280
and it's very vague with the way they make it look, but the reason is, we've made it

06:30.280 --> 06:31.580
a little more polite.

06:31.580 --> 06:37.100
So now, if you're on somebody else's website and they have an Amazon affiliate link and

06:37.100 --> 06:41.400
you click it, our extension will not override that, it'll detect that, and it'll be graceful

06:41.400 --> 06:42.400
about it.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.260
So that requires permission changes for that to happen, but that's one of the things.

06:46.260 --> 06:50.360
And then we've added woot.com, so now if you're shopping at woot.com and you have our browser

06:50.360 --> 06:55.480
extension installed, we will get a portion of your shopping session, which is awesome.

06:55.480 --> 06:58.400
And then on the Firefox side of things, I'm not positive if you have to re-enable it or

06:58.400 --> 07:03.760
not, I haven't tried it on my Firefox install yet, but we have Firefox integration improvements,

07:03.760 --> 07:07.000
performance improvements, and goodies as well, of course, there's woot and all that stuff

07:07.000 --> 07:08.120
over there as well.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.600
So new extensions being updated today, so your browser will probably get the update,

07:11.600 --> 07:15.620
and if you don't know about this yet, these are open source extensions, we have them linked

07:15.620 --> 07:21.240
up on GitHub in the Linux Action Show show notes, or you go to jbdev.... Where was that?

07:21.240 --> 07:25.480
I can't remember, there's a jbdev site I have linked to on the show notes, and those are

07:25.480 --> 07:30.320
posted up on GitHub, they're open source, and we've actually got a good amount of people

07:30.320 --> 07:35.280
now, this is so funny, when we launched these extensions, I said, well let's go open source

07:35.280 --> 07:40.180
so that way people know we're not doing anything shady and anything like that, and if people

07:40.180 --> 07:42.040
want to use them, they can, that's fine.

07:42.040 --> 07:45.560
And people didn't necessarily think that was a good idea because there are other podcasts

07:45.560 --> 07:47.640
networks that take them, right?

07:47.640 --> 07:48.640
Oh, right.

07:48.640 --> 07:49.640
Exactly.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.400
Yeah, I mean that happens, but the other thing that's been really interesting is it's been

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
big in churches.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.400
Oh.

07:54.400 --> 07:59.360
So, I've heard from several people that are grabbing it for their church, setting it up

07:59.360 --> 08:02.600
and coding it for an affiliate code for their church, and then the people, the members of

08:02.600 --> 08:07.400
that church, when they shop at home, are using a modified version of the Jupiter Broadcasting

08:07.400 --> 08:10.280
extension to benefit the church.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.280
That's clever.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.720
Yeah, so I thought that was kind of a neat use of it.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.400
So there you go, so you can find links to those linked at the very bottom of jupitabroadcasting.com,

08:16.400 --> 08:20.280
and then when you have those installed, they just automatically take your shopping session

08:20.280 --> 08:26.840
at Amazon, Newegg, Woot, Monoprice, eBay, lots of popular sites, and then it helps keep

08:26.840 --> 08:27.840
us on the air.

08:27.840 --> 08:32.280
All right, well I'm going to unmute our Mumble channel here and say hi to the folks in the

08:32.280 --> 08:35.920
Mumble room, and specifically I want to welcome Remi to the show.

08:35.920 --> 08:39.440
He's been a contributor to the network for a while, he's sent in emails to many of the

08:39.440 --> 08:41.000
shows, and he's active in our subreddits.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.600
Remi, welcome to the show.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.680
Good evening, Chris.

08:44.680 --> 08:48.480
So now, did I have it right, it's about 11 p.m. where you're at right now?

08:48.480 --> 08:49.480
Yes, that's correct.

08:49.480 --> 08:53.320
It's now just 11, 9 p.m. in the Netherlands.

08:53.320 --> 08:58.520
Well I know that you were fighting server outages all day, so I appreciate you joining

08:58.520 --> 09:01.440
us after the day of hell that you've had.

09:01.440 --> 09:05.680
And you caught my attention, I think it was last week when you submitted a blog post about

09:05.680 --> 09:08.900
your encrypted file synchronization solution.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.280
Can you tell us what it is and what tech you're using?

09:11.280 --> 09:12.960
Okay, yes, it's correct.

09:12.960 --> 09:18.440
I just recently bought a Chromebook and I used Spideroak, which is a locally encryption

09:18.440 --> 09:21.520
and then upload to the cloud.

09:21.520 --> 09:27.440
And it doesn't work on ARM, and I have an ARM Chromebook, so I had an issue.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.880
I was already having issues with Spideroak because of RAM usage, because I have over

09:30.880 --> 09:34.000
90,000 files in there and it doesn't really like that.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Wow.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.520
I've also tried Oowala, and it's also a local encryption and then dump the blobs in cloud

09:40.520 --> 09:41.520
tool.

09:41.520 --> 09:45.480
And it also had RAM issues, and so I was looking for something else.

09:45.480 --> 09:51.200
And I already use AnkaFest, AnkaFest is a user space tool that mounts your local folder

09:51.200 --> 09:55.240
and you have an encrypted folder and then you mount it and then you have the unencrypted

09:55.240 --> 09:56.240
part.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.040
It just works with a password.

09:58.040 --> 10:02.320
And that's the encryption part and the synchronization part, because that's really important that

10:02.320 --> 10:08.440
you also have the files on multiple devices, is using DVCS auto sync.

10:08.440 --> 10:13.960
It's distributed version control system auto sync, and it works both with Git and material

10:13.960 --> 10:16.280
and other version control systems.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.520
So you're not using Spideroak at all because you're on ARM?

10:19.520 --> 10:23.440
Yeah, I had to switch because I also needed the files on my Chromebook.

10:23.440 --> 10:27.720
The Chromebook runs Arch Linux, but Arch Linux ARM.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.400
Oh, okay.

10:29.400 --> 10:33.680
So you're using, okay, so just so I get this, you're using AnkaFest for the encryption,

10:33.680 --> 10:36.440
you're using SSH to Git?

10:36.440 --> 10:38.640
How are you doing SSH to Git?

10:38.640 --> 10:45.600
Well, I have a VPS just somewhere else and the point is, the AnkaFest folder is only

10:45.600 --> 10:47.760
decrypted when you mount it.

10:47.760 --> 10:57.080
So the folder which I sync to the cloud is the folder, the encrypted data.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.120
And how does it handle like small file changes?

10:59.120 --> 11:03.560
Like if you do like, you're only updating maybe three lines in your notes file, does

11:03.560 --> 11:07.560
it update the whole file?

11:07.560 --> 11:09.360
The AnkaFest part works like this.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.720
It works per file.

11:10.720 --> 11:11.720
So that's very nice.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.040
It's not like you have a true grid volume and you have to unmount it.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.040
Yeah, right.

11:15.040 --> 11:19.040
It works per file, but because I have it set very strictly, you can give options if you

11:19.040 --> 11:22.160
want per file chaining and that kind of stuff.

11:22.160 --> 11:26.760
I've set it very strictly so that every change I make in a file after a write makes the entire

11:26.760 --> 11:28.720
file gets re-uploaded and synced.

11:28.720 --> 11:35.560
But you can also set less restrictive options which make only bigger changes to a file make

11:35.560 --> 11:36.840
it upload again.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.600
Now any way to make this work with a Windows machine?

11:40.600 --> 11:41.600
Yes.

11:41.600 --> 11:46.760
You have, I think it's a few tools which support SSH on Windows.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.920
You have a few tools which support Git on Windows.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.800
What is your solution for mobile?

11:50.800 --> 11:52.560
Well, Android.

11:52.560 --> 11:57.480
I only use Android phones and there is an open source application in the Android app

11:57.480 --> 12:02.760
store, it's called Ankdroid, which I use to mount it, the encrypted folder.

12:02.760 --> 12:08.880
And there's also a few Git clients in the app store so which you can sync back the encrypted

12:08.880 --> 12:09.880
part.

12:09.880 --> 12:13.400
The beautiful thing is you only in the cloud you have the encrypted part and everywhere

12:13.400 --> 12:17.000
you have AnkaFest, you can mount a local part.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.360
So with Inkdroid, I'm going to go look that up right now, I did not even know about that.

12:23.360 --> 12:27.280
You also have an app that's called, I think it's Boxcryptor and it's a closed source app

12:27.280 --> 12:30.960
and it supports AnkaFest, but it's for me really important that you have open source

12:30.960 --> 12:34.040
code so that you can make sure that nobody else gets your password and key.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.480
Yeah, big advocates of that here.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.480
Wow.

12:37.480 --> 12:41.440
With this solution when you set it up and I use it on a Chromebook, on a MacBook Pro,

12:41.440 --> 12:47.440
which I have for my work, on an Android phone and on two other Ubuntu and Arch Linux machines

12:47.440 --> 12:48.720
and it really works fine.

12:48.720 --> 12:53.000
It also handles deletions of files and folders.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.440
So when you say deletions, do you mean it handles revisions of deletions?

12:57.440 --> 13:01.920
No, just when I remove a file, it's also removed in the version control.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.920
Yeah, okay.

13:02.920 --> 13:03.920
Okay, so that's the same.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.920
Despite the issues on that, when I had deleted the file in one machine, on the other machines

13:07.920 --> 13:11.080
it would just re-upload it because it thought it was a new file on the machine on which

13:11.080 --> 13:12.080
it was deleted.

13:12.080 --> 13:16.300
So how do you, so with having all of your files in Git, then are you able to go in with

13:16.300 --> 13:20.320
like a Git Explorer and like pull out certain versions of stuff that you want and things

13:20.320 --> 13:21.320
like that?

13:21.320 --> 13:22.320
No.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.320
No.

13:23.320 --> 13:27.400
And that is because in Git, only the encrypted part is.

13:27.400 --> 13:33.360
So that's quite of a disadvantage, not really for me, because the important files, I make

13:33.360 --> 13:34.360
manual backups.

13:34.360 --> 13:39.240
So because Git doesn't, because it's encrypted, Git can't make revisions because it doesn't

13:39.240 --> 13:40.240
know.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.240
What is what?

13:41.240 --> 13:42.240
Yeah.

13:42.240 --> 13:46.380
Yeah, it makes revisions of the encrypted data, but not of the decrypted data.

13:46.380 --> 13:47.380
That's the whole point.

13:47.380 --> 13:48.380
Right, yeah.

13:48.380 --> 13:49.380
That makes sense.

13:49.380 --> 13:52.080
One other disadvantage is that you cannot have selective sync, so you cannot have a

13:52.080 --> 13:54.520
big mess with all your files in your phone with just a few.

13:54.520 --> 13:58.720
And also because it's a disadvantage of not knowing what is what and having to mount it

13:58.720 --> 13:59.720
encrypted locally.

13:59.720 --> 14:00.720
Right.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.640
Selective sync is nice, but it does allow you to be lazy too, which honestly that's

14:03.640 --> 14:04.640
how I use it.

14:04.640 --> 14:05.640
This is true.

14:05.640 --> 14:06.640
And complacent.

14:06.640 --> 14:07.640
Yeah.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.480
And one of the other nice things with this solution is that, as I said, I have a lot

14:10.480 --> 14:14.120
of source code for companies I work for in my encrypted folders.

14:14.120 --> 14:19.680
And as I said, I had over 9,000 files and it has totally no performance issues with

14:19.680 --> 14:24.400
that RAM usage of the syncing process and the anchor phase is, I think, less than 90

14:24.400 --> 14:28.160
megabytes, where Spyder Oak was on three to four gigabytes.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.160
Holy cow.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.760
I got to play more with that.

14:30.760 --> 14:31.760
That's interesting.

14:31.760 --> 14:36.600
So you've got how you've done all of this written up on your site, rayme.org, and I'll

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
have a link to it in the show notes.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.600
It's also linked in the subreddit.

14:38.600 --> 14:44.680
You know what a nice part was about, I put the article on Saturday evening.

14:44.680 --> 14:48.800
It's the first article I did with a picture, with a diagram, and it was also on the front

14:48.800 --> 14:49.840
page on Hack News.

14:49.840 --> 14:55.720
And normally my website has about 1,000 visitors a day, and it got 40,000 extra visits in the

14:55.720 --> 14:56.720
last four days.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.720
Whoa.

14:57.720 --> 14:58.720
Oh my goodness.

14:58.720 --> 14:59.720
Whoa.

14:59.720 --> 15:00.720
Whoa.

15:00.720 --> 15:01.720
You really notice that people are looking for such a solution.

15:01.720 --> 15:02.720
Exactly.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.040
And it's not a one-click easy solution, but it still is there.

15:05.040 --> 15:09.240
People are really looking to go off the grid, in a sense.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.880
Not actually off the grid, but off the surveillance grid.

15:11.880 --> 15:15.680
Well, to put themselves in more control, too, I think is really the big focus.

15:15.680 --> 15:16.680
Yeah.

15:16.680 --> 15:17.680
Isn't that interesting?

15:17.680 --> 15:21.840
Because now, on the other end of it, I've seen such an explosion in bit message adoption.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.280
I'm just buried now in bit messages.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.280
It's awesome.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.280
Yeah.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.280
No kidding.

15:26.280 --> 15:29.960
So it's like people are really looking, and we've seen a huge interest in mail servers,

15:29.960 --> 15:30.960
too.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.600
Well, Remy, before we move on to the next topic, is there anything you wanted to mention

15:33.600 --> 15:35.680
about it, or anything you want to touch on?

15:35.680 --> 15:40.920
Well, just as I said, it's not an easy one-click solution, but I hope it will help people with

15:40.920 --> 15:44.400
having their encryption and data truly secure and locally.

15:44.400 --> 15:48.400
Yeah, I mean, you've got an encrypted sync solution here that is off the surveillance

15:48.400 --> 15:51.240
grid, and it's using all open source code, right?

15:51.240 --> 15:52.720
Yes, that's totally correct.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.720
Yeah, I mean, that's awesome.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.720
That's very awesome.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.720
That's very cool.

15:56.720 --> 15:57.720
So we'll have a link.

15:57.720 --> 15:58.720
Thank you.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.720
Thank you for having me on.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.720
Yeah, you bet, man.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.720
Thanks for staying up for us after your rough day.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.720
I appreciate it.

16:02.720 --> 16:09.680
Have you experienced rate cards that only detect issues when you reboot the server?

16:09.680 --> 16:10.680
Oh, oh, oh.

16:10.680 --> 16:15.000
Yeah, it's funny how something about that reboot process, if there's something that's

16:15.000 --> 16:17.440
going to die, that's when it will die, even if it's a drive.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.520
But yeah, I've had the rate card go out on the database server.

16:20.520 --> 16:26.280
Today I had eight servers which had that issue, and about 24 drives are now dead.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.280
Eight separate servers?

16:27.280 --> 16:31.440
Yeah, with all the same rate card and the same firmware, the latest firmware from HAPI.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.440
Oh, wow.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.160
Oh, did the firmware nuke it?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.160
That might be it.

16:35.160 --> 16:39.800
No, the rate card only detects changes in disk issues when you reboot the server, so

16:39.800 --> 16:43.120
we had to reboot after scheduled updates, and eight servers just said, whoa, my hard

16:43.120 --> 16:44.120
drives are dead.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.120
Bye.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.120
Oh, my.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.120
Oh.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.120
Goodness.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.120
That is not a good day.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.120
That's a bad day.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.120
That's OK.

16:51.120 --> 16:54.360
I was up at 6 a.m., and it's now 11 p.m., and I'm only home for about an hour, so I'm

16:54.360 --> 16:58.360
going to sleep now, and my alarm goes at 4 a.m. the next morning, because I have to

16:58.360 --> 16:59.920
be in the data center again.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.640
Well, arm that coffee pot, man, and thank you for joining us.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.520
Yeah, we'll have a good show, and I will listen to it tomorrow.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.520
All right.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.520
Thank you for having me on.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.520
Yeah, you bet.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.520
Thank you.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.520
Thank you.

17:11.520 --> 17:12.520
Bye.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.520
Yeah, bye.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.520
Bye.

17:14.520 --> 17:15.520
Thanks.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.080
So I wanted to just mention a couple of follow-up items before we chat more with the mumble

17:17.080 --> 17:19.080
guys there.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.080
I meant to follow up on this a little while ago.

17:22.080 --> 17:29.640
I mentioned that I was frustrated that the GNOME search in GNOME 3 is not searching documents.

17:29.640 --> 17:35.160
It's just on my machine, and the only GNOME time I've ever used GNOME 3.8 is in this

17:35.160 --> 17:36.160
installation of Arch.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.080
In fact, when I installed this installation of Arch, it was like one of the few places

17:39.080 --> 17:40.360
you could actually get GNOME 3.8.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.720
It hadn't hit the other distros yet.

17:42.720 --> 17:47.360
Well, so I don't know why it doesn't work on my machine.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.160
It does work for everybody else on the internet, though, and they all told me.

17:51.160 --> 17:56.040
So we even got like on the comments section for last week's show, we even got like a really

17:56.040 --> 17:57.040
nice screenshot.

17:57.040 --> 18:01.200
I don't know if you saw that, but it even looked, of course, it's GNOME related, so

18:01.200 --> 18:02.200
it just looked gorgeous.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.200
Sure, sure, sure.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.200
Oh, that's bizarre.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.200
That's bizarre.

18:05.200 --> 18:10.120
You know, I'm using Synapse or whatever you want to call it, and so I just, yeah, I don't

18:10.120 --> 18:12.000
really have too many troubles there.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.080
Yeah, your days are numbered, my friend.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.840
That Synapse project, they haven't been pushing new code for a while.

18:16.840 --> 18:17.840
They have not.

18:17.840 --> 18:18.840
I'll probably go to GNOME do.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.520
Yeah, there you go, yeah.

18:20.520 --> 18:26.440
And also, just a quick update, I made an app pick on last, GDmap for scanning your drive

18:26.440 --> 18:28.180
and showing up in blocks.

18:28.180 --> 18:30.680
For us KDE users, K4derstat.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
Durst?

18:31.680 --> 18:32.680
Really?

18:32.680 --> 18:33.680
Okay.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.680
K4derstat.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.680
Yeah.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.680
K4derstat.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.680
And that is a KDE version.

18:37.680 --> 18:38.680
That's very German.

18:38.680 --> 18:43.720
Some people say that even Winderstat's based off of, so take that as you will.

18:43.720 --> 18:50.560
Okay, so I wanted to get to a topic today that it kind of got me thinking.

18:50.560 --> 18:54.120
In the subreddit, I think it was like an episode, actually one of this show, I said, man, it

18:54.120 --> 19:01.640
sure would be great, gosh, it'd be great if there was some sort of website out there collating

19:01.640 --> 19:04.560
the Steam numbers and giving us some nice charts to look at.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.560
That would be fantastic.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.560
Right?

19:06.560 --> 19:08.760
And, well, that happened.

19:08.760 --> 19:17.460
One of our listeners, Mateci, I bet it's Mateci, I bet that's how you say it.

19:17.460 --> 19:25.780
He started a Steam survey charts over at his site and it is not looking good for Linux.

19:25.780 --> 19:26.780
Not looking good, Matt.

19:26.780 --> 19:29.740
In fact, when I say not looking good, I mean it looks real bad.

19:29.740 --> 19:31.600
It looks real bad.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.520
Would it be bad, and I'm going to get probably set on fire for this, but is it bad to say

19:35.520 --> 19:38.420
it's because the folks that run Linux have jobs?

19:38.420 --> 19:42.600
I was going to say it's because I was going to ask you, and so here's what I'm thinking.

19:42.600 --> 19:46.360
I think we take a break, we'll thank our first sponsor, then I'm going to toss it to you.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.600
I got a couple things I want to throw your way.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.320
I'm going to toss it to you.

19:50.320 --> 19:55.720
Are Linux users, on a whole, obviously there's going to be individual cases, but are Linux

19:55.720 --> 19:56.720
users cheap?

19:56.720 --> 20:02.000
I'm going to convince you otherwise, I think, but we'll see.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
We will see.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.720
But first, Matt, I want to thank our first sponsor this week, and that is Ting.com.

20:07.720 --> 20:12.720
Now Ting is mobile that makes sense, my friend, and Ting was the lifesaver at PAX.

20:12.720 --> 20:16.520
I think I mentioned this on Sunday's last, but really I was the only guy, except for

20:16.520 --> 20:21.280
another guy that also was on Ting's service, that had a working cell phone.

20:21.280 --> 20:26.720
I cannot tell you, when I had a client who was in full-fledged freakout mode and they

20:26.720 --> 20:32.360
needed Chris to make everything better, having to make that phone call, being able to make

20:32.360 --> 20:38.840
those phone calls while I was on the exposition floor of PAX was invaluable.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.320
I would have paid any monthly service for that, and of course I'm just paying for what

20:42.320 --> 20:43.320
I use.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.320
That's one of the great things about Ting.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.600
Look, go to linux.ting.com.

20:45.600 --> 20:49.400
We got Linux for this show, so go to linux.ting.com.

20:49.400 --> 20:55.880
That'll get you $25 off your first Ting device, or $25 of service credits for your first month

20:55.880 --> 20:57.360
of service.

20:57.360 --> 21:02.760
I have the HTC One, and that guy powered through it real well, real good.

21:02.760 --> 21:03.760
I was quite happy.

21:03.760 --> 21:09.120
However, now I know this is the same phone, but I just noticed now Ting has the HTC Blue.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.120
Ooh, hey, that's new, right?

21:10.120 --> 21:11.120
Yeah, yeah.

21:11.120 --> 21:14.280
Oh, and they also have this S4 Purple, I didn't know that.

21:14.280 --> 21:17.800
The HTC One Blue is gonna be the phone I want, but what?

21:17.800 --> 21:18.800
I'm holding out.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.800
I'm gonna see.

21:19.800 --> 21:24.680
I wanted to say, if you've been looking at phones, go over to linux.ting.com, and you're

21:24.680 --> 21:27.880
not sure which one you wanna get, because these are off contract.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.120
That's a good thing, but it also means they're gonna be a little bit higher in price.

21:31.120 --> 21:35.200
Of course, in the long run, you're saving money, and even after the cost of the phone,

21:35.200 --> 21:36.760
you're probably gonna save money in some circumstances.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.120
Oh yeah, you're gonna save big buckets of money.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.120
Right.

21:40.120 --> 21:44.120
However, you can buy used on Ting, and there's really a lot of options here.

21:44.120 --> 21:47.600
On that tab, they have buy used, and they have the personal shopping service, where

21:47.600 --> 21:51.440
you go out and find a device, you just give them the parameters, screen size, OS, etc.,

21:51.440 --> 21:55.160
and they'll go get you a refurbished phone that works on Ting.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.160
That's awesome.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.840
That's really awesome.

21:57.840 --> 22:02.800
However, maybe you might be in a situation where you wanna have multiple people on the

22:02.800 --> 22:03.800
line.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.800
Ting makes that real easy.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.080
It's just $6 a month, and you pay for what you use.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.000
So you could have yourself a smartphone, and maybe there's somebody else in your family.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.080
Maybe it's a significant other, maybe it's a parent, maybe it's a kid, and they don't

22:13.080 --> 22:16.320
need to have a full-fledged smartphone, or you don't want them to have a full-fledged

22:16.320 --> 22:17.320
smartphone.

22:17.320 --> 22:19.000
You don't want a full-fledged smartphone.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.520
I mean, I can totally understand that.

22:21.520 --> 22:27.160
They have got the Samsung, which is a really great flip phone, the Samsung M370.

22:27.160 --> 22:33.200
It's very sturdy, very reliable, $52, and if you go to linux.ting.com, Ting is gonna

22:33.200 --> 22:35.400
take $25 off of that.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.200
So that's practically nothing.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.680
That's practically nothing to get you on a Ting phone, and then you're only paying for

22:40.680 --> 22:41.840
the price you use.

22:41.840 --> 22:46.880
Ting just takes your minutes used, your text, and your data, adds them all up at the end

22:46.880 --> 22:50.480
of the month, and then puts you in a bucket, and you can check on their online dashboard

22:50.480 --> 22:53.800
at any time to see where you're at, to know exactly where you're trending.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.640
And the great thing is, if you go with a smartphone, you get all these great features like built-in

22:57.640 --> 22:59.080
hotspot and tethering.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.720
You've gotten caller ID, and all these things that the other cellular companies will sort

23:02.720 --> 23:07.120
of fit into the tax brackets, or sort of fit into like these bolt-on services, and none

23:07.120 --> 23:08.120
of that happens.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.480
No ride-alongs with Ting.

23:09.480 --> 23:12.400
It's just nice, easy, straight, simple, forward mobile.

23:12.400 --> 23:16.280
They've also got that airwave, so if you want to boost cellular service in your house, you

23:16.280 --> 23:17.840
can plug one of these into your house.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.720
It'll use your internet connection, and then you get four bars, or five, or whatever your

23:20.720 --> 23:21.720
phone reads.

23:21.720 --> 23:27.600
You get full signal in your house, but the phone, the OS, everything is just talking

23:27.600 --> 23:30.880
over the cellular, so everything that you would have work over your cellular works right

23:30.880 --> 23:31.880
over one of those things.

23:31.880 --> 23:32.880
It's really, really cool.

23:32.880 --> 23:33.880
That's cool.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.880
Yeah, and to be able to take 25 bucks off of any one of those, especially that little

23:36.880 --> 23:37.880
flip phone.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.880
That's pretty cool.

23:38.880 --> 23:39.880
I know.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.080
When you're starting at 50 bucks, and then you take 25 bucks off, and then you're paying

23:42.080 --> 23:46.760
just for what you use every single month, this is the value.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.840
This is the best value out there, and the service is great, the people are great, and

23:49.840 --> 23:51.240
the company's really good, too.

23:51.240 --> 23:56.520
So go to linux.ting.com, and get yourself something nice on a really easy to use, simple

23:56.520 --> 23:57.520
to follow site.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.840
I was so impressed when I activated my devices, how easy that was.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.320
Matt, you just recently did that.

24:02.320 --> 24:04.840
Tell me, is that not the most straightforward device activation process?

24:04.840 --> 24:07.280
I couldn't believe how simple it was.

24:07.280 --> 24:11.440
Even though I had to make sure it was basically deactivated from your stuff, because I got

24:11.440 --> 24:13.880
a phone from you, it was brain dead simple to do.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.320
I mean, it was just like, type in a couple buttons, I mean, the instructions were easy

24:17.320 --> 24:20.800
to set up, and then once I actually activated the phone, it was like three seconds, like

24:20.800 --> 24:22.920
boop, boop, bam, boom, done, reboot.

24:22.920 --> 24:28.000
I feel like good UI designers, and I think maybe Ting's got a real good group on their

24:28.000 --> 24:29.560
hands, and maybe, here's what their trick is.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.760
If I was a good, here's what makes a good UI designer.

24:31.760 --> 24:36.080
I say you get three or four beers into the wind, then you try to use your site, and if

24:36.080 --> 24:39.000
you can use it efficiently, you know you got a really well-designed site.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.080
Well let me tell you, Ting passes the three or four beer test.

24:42.080 --> 24:46.160
I've been on Ting's website several times, three or four beers in, and I never get lost.

24:46.160 --> 24:50.160
So I just say, if you're an interface design person out there, go take a look at their

24:50.160 --> 24:54.200
site, learn a little bit, and try the beer challenge for yourself, and it makes for a

24:54.200 --> 24:55.200
fantastic website.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.440
It makes it super clear and easy, so that way when you have family members, like my

24:58.440 --> 25:02.200
mom's on Ting, and when I have her go to the Ting site, I can just remember it all from

25:02.200 --> 25:05.320
the top of my head when I'm walking around, because it's so straightforward.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.400
So I'm like, yeah, click there, click there, okay, you're done, bye mom, and we're all

25:08.400 --> 25:09.400
set.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.160
But if mom wanted to call into Ting, she could.

25:11.160 --> 25:17.400
Ting has representatives that answer the phone, you can call them, 1-855-846-4389, and they're

25:17.400 --> 25:19.080
available 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.640
You call in, and a real person answers the phone.

25:21.640 --> 25:25.360
And so if there's something mom can't do on the website, I just have mom call Ting.

25:25.360 --> 25:28.220
Well, and that's awesome, because not only are they going to get a real person when they

25:28.220 --> 25:32.640
call in, but if maybe they're not really into doing stuff on the website, they prefer to

25:32.640 --> 25:34.400
deal with a person, what a great option.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.400
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.840
So go to linux.ting.com and start saving right now, you guys, don't be crazy.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.840
Don't be crazy.

25:41.840 --> 25:45.240
All right, Matt, so here we go, you ready for my Linux users might be cheap?

25:45.240 --> 25:50.240
And I'm a Linux user, I'm not cheap, but I'm just saying.

25:50.240 --> 25:54.640
So I got an inside guy, I don't know if he's in the chat room right now, but I got an inside

25:54.640 --> 25:59.400
guy, and he's been sussing out the number, suss is my word of the week, he's been sussing

25:59.400 --> 26:03.120
out the numbers from the Ubuntu Software Center.

26:03.120 --> 26:09.520
And we're looking now, Ubuntu, supposedly the number one deployed desktop Linux operating

26:09.520 --> 26:10.520
system.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.480
Our own web stats would back that up.

26:12.480 --> 26:19.380
The number one app in the Ubuntu Software Center right now is FileCryptor Professional.

26:19.380 --> 26:23.720
The number two app is WPA Generator, and the number three app is FileCryptor.

26:23.720 --> 26:30.800
All right, of these top apps, the first app goes for $4.99, the second app goes for $3,

26:30.800 --> 26:34.000
and the third app goes for $2.99.

26:34.000 --> 26:40.800
Now here's the thing, these are the top three applications in the Ubuntu Software Center.

26:40.800 --> 26:46.460
None of them have ratings, none of them have average, none of them have comments, nothing.

26:46.460 --> 26:50.760
They're all blank, I should take comments back, ratings, none of them have any interaction

26:50.760 --> 27:00.140
on that level, and when talking to these developers, they're making at best a couple hundred dollars

27:00.140 --> 27:01.140
a month.

27:01.140 --> 27:02.140
And that's being pretty generous.

27:02.140 --> 27:03.140
From the software center.

27:03.140 --> 27:04.140
Really, yeah, that's pretty generous.

27:04.140 --> 27:07.600
It is, and that's like the top, that was like the top app, actually, that made that much

27:07.600 --> 27:08.600
money.

27:08.600 --> 27:12.740
Now the time skew was a little short, it wasn't a full month, but still, it is, the numbers

27:12.740 --> 27:13.920
are devastating.

27:13.920 --> 27:16.460
Now we go over to Steam.

27:16.460 --> 27:20.260
Since Steam has launched, it has gone in a sharp decline.

27:20.260 --> 27:27.520
On January 13th, Steam had, Linux Steam usage, had a 1.12% market share.

27:27.520 --> 27:31.340
On February 13th, it went up to 2.02%, that was after we were out of beta and all this

27:31.340 --> 27:33.420
good stuff.

27:33.420 --> 27:38.020
Then from that point forward, June, it goes down to 1.07%, July, 1.06%.

27:38.020 --> 27:43.800
Now in August, we're below 1%, we're at 0.93%.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.380
So we're dropping off.

27:46.380 --> 27:52.660
Now you gotta ask yourself, because Linux is free, and a lot of the software is free,

27:52.660 --> 27:58.700
is it more attractive to people who don't wanna pay for software?

27:58.700 --> 28:03.940
Is this not a marketplace where you can make a living writing software and selling it to

28:03.940 --> 28:05.660
Linux users?

28:05.660 --> 28:08.220
So here's how I see it.

28:08.220 --> 28:13.940
First of all, if I'm gonna buy anything, if I can get an equitable alternative for free,

28:13.940 --> 28:16.940
I would be mouth breathing stupid not to.

28:16.940 --> 28:18.940
So of course I'm gonna go that route.

28:18.940 --> 28:23.540
Now as far as the two marketplaces, whether it be Steam or the Ubuntu Software Center,

28:23.540 --> 28:27.380
the Ubuntu Software Center is a little bit like trying to do grocery checkout at your

28:27.380 --> 28:31.580
dentist's office, or at the B&B, it's horrible.

28:31.580 --> 28:32.780
It is absolutely hideous.

28:32.780 --> 28:36.340
Now for free apps, it's reasonably painless because all you're gonna do is enter a password

28:36.340 --> 28:37.340
and you're done.

28:37.340 --> 28:41.260
Yeah, but when you buy an app, you gotta put in your shipping address and everything.

28:41.260 --> 28:42.420
It's just stupid.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.180
So that's hideous.

28:44.180 --> 28:48.300
Steam's is actually not so bad, but I think that the bigger problem, especially when you

28:48.300 --> 28:51.740
look at it from the fact that, like I'll use Steam as a better example because that's really

28:51.740 --> 28:55.500
where we had a nice peak and it kind of dropped off, I think the people that were really excited

28:55.500 --> 28:59.060
about getting on the games have then done so.

28:59.060 --> 29:03.820
And I would be interested in comparing a contrast with what's going on in the Windows space.

29:03.820 --> 29:05.780
Is there also a decline there?

29:05.780 --> 29:10.060
Or perhaps maybe there's a surge of new Windows games coming out to where maybe there's not

29:10.060 --> 29:13.220
as many compelling new Linux coming out.

29:13.220 --> 29:19.820
The Windows penetration seems to be fairly steady and in January it was 94.56%.

29:19.820 --> 29:25.740
It drops down slightly between February and July, but then it's back to 94.59%, slightly

29:25.740 --> 29:27.060
above where it was in January.

29:27.060 --> 29:30.900
So since Linux has come out for Steam, Windows usage has actually gone up slightly.

29:30.900 --> 29:34.220
And so I would say that it's not so much a problem, I don't think the problem was with

29:34.220 --> 29:35.220
Linux at all.

29:35.220 --> 29:38.980
I think it's a lot of its availability of give me something compelling, you know, okay

29:38.980 --> 29:41.940
for existing Linux games, do you have a map pack that's come out?

29:41.940 --> 29:45.700
Maybe there's something compelling to add on to my existing games.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.740
What new things are out there as an existing Steam user that's going to make me say, oh

29:49.740 --> 29:52.560
hey, let me make that purchase.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.420
Maybe there are some games that are out there, maybe there aren't.

29:54.420 --> 29:58.120
Maybe you're already into your game and you would like to expand on that existing experience.

29:58.120 --> 30:02.060
So I would need more data before I can completely rule it out as a Linux thing because I mean

30:02.060 --> 30:08.580
like, you know, the Humble Bundle is done really well.

30:08.580 --> 30:12.820
But then again, it's something different and I think honestly the success of that Humble

30:12.820 --> 30:15.300
Bundle was one of the things that brought Steam over.

30:15.300 --> 30:19.540
I mean, you know, so yeah, that's a good point.

30:19.540 --> 30:22.420
I'm going to, so I'll ask the mumble room.

30:22.420 --> 30:25.460
I don't know if the guys in the On Air channel have any, if anybody in here has any thoughts

30:25.460 --> 30:31.100
on if Linux users are just cheap, you know, with software I would say yes, but not with

30:31.100 --> 30:32.100
games.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.100
That's my big difference.

30:33.100 --> 30:37.900
Do you think it's maybe Linux users are willing to pay for certain things and not other things?

30:37.900 --> 30:38.900
Oh yeah.

30:38.900 --> 30:42.420
Well, I mean, I look at like when I try and find something on OS X, because I have to

30:42.420 --> 30:47.700
do this occasionally, it astounds me at the stupid software titles that are being, they're

30:47.700 --> 30:48.700
charging $20, $30.

30:48.700 --> 30:49.700
Oh yeah.

30:49.700 --> 30:50.700
I know, right?

30:50.700 --> 30:52.700
It's just like, and it's like, you really think I'm going to do that?

30:52.700 --> 30:53.700
No.

30:53.700 --> 30:55.580
You know, it's like, I'm not going to give you my money.

30:55.580 --> 30:57.860
So I think that it's a lot of what you're used to.

30:57.860 --> 31:02.180
Linux users have an expectation that if they hunt hard enough, because the Ubuntu Software

31:02.180 --> 31:06.500
Center is not the end all to be all of software, you hunt hard enough, a lot of times you can

31:06.500 --> 31:09.540
find a package that's compatible with your distro.

31:09.540 --> 31:13.640
That's going to offer you a way to accomplish the task you're trying to do.

31:13.640 --> 31:18.220
May not be as glossy, may not be as pretty, but a lot of times you can get it done.

31:18.220 --> 31:19.420
And you can get it done for free.

31:19.420 --> 31:23.180
So we got the mumble room up and we just heard Jack in the box type in a little bit, but

31:23.180 --> 31:28.580
I'm curious, anybody in here, Josh or Mad Joe or Miracode, we haven't heard from you

31:28.580 --> 31:30.340
or Westeros in here.

31:30.340 --> 31:31.520
We haven't heard from you guys.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.940
You guys think Linux users are cheap?

31:32.940 --> 31:35.900
Do you think it's something else?

31:35.900 --> 31:36.900
What is your explanation?

31:36.900 --> 31:37.900
Go ahead, Miracode.

31:37.900 --> 31:38.900
You first.

31:38.900 --> 31:39.900
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:39.900 --> 31:46.900
I'm a few milliseconds closer than any of you.

31:46.900 --> 31:51.820
I think it's a mix of the fact that people are a little bit cheap, however, I think a

31:51.820 --> 31:57.620
lot of professional users also use the new systems.

31:57.620 --> 32:02.780
That may be part of the issue, where we have people who are generally busy filming and

32:02.780 --> 32:06.300
not having time really to play these games.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.300
All right.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.660
So Josh, what do you think, Josh?

32:09.660 --> 32:12.220
Is it Linux users are too busy?

32:12.220 --> 32:13.460
No.

32:13.460 --> 32:20.880
So my opinion is, for instance, with the Ubuntu Software Center, those apps, half of those

32:20.880 --> 32:23.980
apps are not integrated with the operating system.

32:23.980 --> 32:30.620
They're using an old GTK library, which for instance, GTK 2, which one, looks terrible

32:30.620 --> 32:37.940
and two, the apps just suck, and three, then they're just charging an obscene amount.

32:37.940 --> 32:42.420
Well, it's $4 or $3 out of an obscene amount.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.940
So the top, we had $4.99, $3, and $2.99.

32:44.940 --> 32:52.500
I think for apps that don't integrate with the OS that are outdated, or for instance,

32:52.500 --> 32:56.900
when I went on there the other day, I saw a Windows Phone 8 app in there, which is just

32:56.900 --> 33:00.940
like, I don't even know how that got through the review process, but it was in there.

33:00.940 --> 33:04.660
Oh, so you're talking about applications rather than...

33:04.660 --> 33:08.620
I'm talking about applications within the Ubuntu Software Center.

33:08.620 --> 33:14.860
Regarding Steam, I think people want a very smooth experience, and I don't think we're

33:14.860 --> 33:21.260
quite there yet, and it's not at the fault, it's not exactly at the fault of the developers.

33:21.260 --> 33:25.540
With some, it's regarding their game optimization, but with some, it's the drivers.

33:25.540 --> 33:30.380
We're getting there, I think it might be a couple of years, depending on Linux adoption.

33:30.380 --> 33:36.260
I think Valve's really pushing it, so I think we're going to see drivers improve a lot,

33:36.260 --> 33:40.100
but I just don't think we're quite there yet with a lot of the games.

33:40.100 --> 33:44.980
And a lot of the AAA titles aren't even on Linux, so until then, I'm kind of stuck on

33:44.980 --> 33:45.980
Windows.

33:45.980 --> 33:46.980
Yeah, that's true.

33:46.980 --> 33:47.980
We are still missing...

33:47.980 --> 33:48.980
Okay, well, so is it this?

33:48.980 --> 33:53.380
Oh, so Green in the chat room is mentioning System76, and I would say they are a premium

33:53.380 --> 33:54.380
brand.

33:54.380 --> 34:00.180
It's a high-quality device that delivers on what they say, and I feel like, as a Linux

34:00.180 --> 34:03.220
user, I'm more picky about what I spend my money on.

34:03.220 --> 34:06.020
I'll buy Steam games if it's a good game.

34:06.020 --> 34:09.100
I've bought apps from the Ubuntu Software Center, now I can't really use them, but I

34:09.100 --> 34:13.380
have, and I'll buy a Bonobo when there's a good Linux laptop.

34:13.380 --> 34:17.940
So for me, is it actually that Linux users maybe are just more discerning?

34:17.940 --> 34:20.460
Yeah, I would lean with that.

34:20.460 --> 34:25.380
I think that our expectations are, the first bill of goods that you serve to us, we're

34:25.380 --> 34:31.340
not going to necessarily jump on board like we see with OS X and Windows, OS X especially.

34:31.340 --> 34:32.680
That's where I've really seen it the worst.

34:32.680 --> 34:35.580
So I think that's definitely a big piece of it.

34:35.580 --> 34:39.460
But as far as integration and all that, and as far as making an application center that

34:39.460 --> 34:45.540
doesn't suck, I hate to beat the dead horse again, but I'm sorry, it's been done, and

34:45.540 --> 34:46.660
Ubuntu went backwards.

34:46.660 --> 34:51.840
Not only did they go and hire Linspire developers that worked on CNR from Linspire and actually

34:51.840 --> 34:57.580
integrated them into the Ubuntu software project, they then managed to make it suck harder.

34:57.580 --> 35:01.220
So it's like, I don't know how that works because Linspire sucked, don't get me wrong.

35:01.220 --> 35:02.220
I hated their model.

35:02.220 --> 35:06.420
I didn't like a lot of what was going on there, but that piece of it, before they decided

35:06.420 --> 35:09.820
to make it available to all the distributions, was the most seamless software experience

35:09.820 --> 35:10.820
I've ever seen.

35:10.820 --> 35:11.820
It was just apt.

35:11.820 --> 35:12.820
It wasn't anything wonderful.

35:12.820 --> 35:17.060
You could do an entire aisle of software, go to another computer, log in, aisle bam

35:17.060 --> 35:18.060
done.

35:18.060 --> 35:19.060
It was very, very seamless.

35:19.060 --> 35:22.620
So the Ubuntu Software Center really lacks that seamless experience.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.780
Steam, however, is pretty close.

35:24.780 --> 35:27.940
I think Steam is probably closer than anything else out there for Linux.

35:27.940 --> 35:29.660
But we're going to see that.

35:29.660 --> 35:30.660
Go ahead.

35:30.660 --> 35:31.660
Sorry.

35:31.660 --> 35:32.660
Go ahead.

35:32.660 --> 35:33.660
Go ahead, Josh.

35:33.660 --> 35:34.660
Yeah, go ahead.

35:34.660 --> 35:40.380
I just think, going back to that question you asked, are Linux users cheap?

35:40.380 --> 35:42.580
I don't think we are cheap.

35:42.580 --> 35:47.860
I think because we're power users, we're all power users, we want to find the best for

35:47.860 --> 35:54.660
us and we will look until we can't look anymore to find what we want.

35:54.660 --> 35:59.860
And then at the end of the search, if there's something that's not free, then we will end

35:59.860 --> 36:00.860
up buying it.

36:00.860 --> 36:01.860
Yeah.

36:01.860 --> 36:02.860
Okay.

36:02.860 --> 36:03.860
All right.

36:03.860 --> 36:04.860
All right.

36:04.860 --> 36:05.860
All right.

36:05.860 --> 36:06.860
Well, I'm going to move on.

36:06.860 --> 36:07.860
I'm going to move us on.

36:07.860 --> 36:08.860
Can I address something?

36:08.860 --> 36:09.860
Yeah, go ahead.

36:09.860 --> 36:10.860
Go ahead.

36:10.860 --> 36:11.860
Go ahead.

36:11.860 --> 36:15.860
So with Ubuntu Software Center, yes, there are some issues.

36:15.860 --> 36:18.260
Performance is certainly one of them.

36:18.260 --> 36:22.860
And one of the other issues is the minimum payment level is quite high.

36:22.860 --> 36:28.140
So there are no 99 cent apps in Ubuntu Software Center because of the payment provider that

36:28.140 --> 36:34.060
Canonical uses to do the payments for apps in Software Center, which makes it less attractive

36:34.060 --> 36:40.460
for people making very small apps that could potentially get very high volume sales.

36:40.460 --> 36:45.900
Not everyone in every region can pay because certain restrictions with credit cards and

36:45.900 --> 36:51.300
certain ages, it makes it difficult and they might not be able to use PayPal either.

36:51.300 --> 36:56.620
And there's also a significant hurdle to installing apps because you have to sign up for an Ubuntu

36:56.620 --> 37:02.300
single sign on account and that's seamless inside Software Center.

37:02.300 --> 37:05.620
And the fundamental issue, there's a lack of content.

37:05.620 --> 37:09.740
When you don't have enough content, when there isn't the sea of applications that you get

37:09.740 --> 37:14.140
on Android and on iOS, where you can just page down and page down and page down and

37:14.140 --> 37:17.580
keep going, okay, you'll find some dross in there, but there'll be an awful lot of stuff

37:17.580 --> 37:20.540
in there for you to choose from, you'll almost certainly find it.

37:20.540 --> 37:26.660
And until we've got that vast amount of content, it's very difficult to get realistic sales

37:26.660 --> 37:27.660
figures.

37:27.660 --> 37:30.860
So is AppGrid going to solve some of this problem?

37:30.860 --> 37:36.260
Is Ubuntu's new Software Center redesign going to be sort of a reset on some of this?

37:36.260 --> 37:37.980
Yes, to some degree.

37:37.980 --> 37:41.420
I mean, part of it is that we haven't jumped the chasm yet.

37:41.420 --> 37:44.540
We're still, as Chris says, we're geeks.

37:44.540 --> 37:49.980
The people who are using Linux and Ubuntu, even now, are mostly geeks and so they're

37:49.980 --> 37:56.580
looking for geek tools and they're happy with Wget and downloading an RPM and using alien

37:56.580 --> 37:59.580
to turn it into a deb or that kind of stuff.

37:59.580 --> 38:02.580
Whereas normal people, we haven't got to them yet.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.780
The moms and dads and then the kids, we haven't got to them.

38:05.780 --> 38:10.900
So it's very difficult to say that this is like normal behavior.

38:10.900 --> 38:14.180
It's normal for us, but it's not normal for them.

38:14.180 --> 38:20.380
And ideally, yeah, this will all be fixed with 14.04 and 14.10 with click packages and

38:20.380 --> 38:21.540
in-dash purchases.

38:21.540 --> 38:27.140
So you'll be able to just scroll down through the dash, see an app and just click on it

38:27.140 --> 38:28.900
and install it.

38:28.900 --> 38:32.500
You won't have to go off to a store to go and find it.

38:32.500 --> 38:34.140
I've always wondered if that would be coming to the dash.

38:34.140 --> 38:36.580
That makes a lot of sense that that would be in the dash because the dash has the ability

38:36.580 --> 38:40.740
to suggest and recommend apps in the software center.

38:40.740 --> 38:43.420
And then the dash becomes useful.

38:43.420 --> 38:47.940
You can kind of see the pieces of it are there.

38:47.940 --> 38:48.940
So cool.

38:48.940 --> 38:52.540
I'm going to link to a little article here that's talking about getting the app grid

38:52.540 --> 38:54.980
on 13.04 and it takes a little look at it.

38:54.980 --> 38:57.860
I know it's something that Canonical is working on.

38:57.860 --> 39:06.380
So I'm hopeful that what I come back to is I hope it does come down to it's the challenges

39:06.380 --> 39:07.380
to payment.

39:07.380 --> 39:08.540
It's the challenges to create an account.

39:08.540 --> 39:10.260
It's the price issue.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.360
It's the inventory issue.

39:12.360 --> 39:13.980
And it's also the volume issue.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.380
And so it's not any one particular thing.

39:15.380 --> 39:18.360
So it's not fair to say, well, Linux users are cheap.

39:18.360 --> 39:19.980
That might be a component of it.

39:19.980 --> 39:22.580
I would say it's they're more picky.

39:22.580 --> 39:29.740
And there's also we haven't had a decent unified SDK across across all the platforms.

39:29.740 --> 39:34.500
And now we have now we're building one that works on phones, tablets, TVs, desktops, you

39:34.500 --> 39:35.500
know, everything.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.500
Yeah.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.380
So effectively, a developer can write their app, sell it for 99 cents and run on all those

39:39.380 --> 39:40.380
form factors.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.900
Ideally, that should bring more people in.

39:42.900 --> 39:43.900
I don't know.

39:43.900 --> 39:44.900
We'll have to wait and see.

39:44.900 --> 39:45.900
Come back in a year.

39:45.900 --> 39:46.900
Right.

39:46.900 --> 39:47.900
Yeah.

39:47.900 --> 39:48.900
It's fixed.

39:48.900 --> 39:49.900
Yeah.

39:49.900 --> 39:54.180
So it's definitely if it doesn't cause if it if it if it doesn't result in that, it's

39:54.180 --> 39:55.780
at least the right move to make.

39:55.780 --> 39:58.540
And it seems to only be setting up for success.

39:58.540 --> 40:02.340
Who knows if it'll bring success, but it's at least positioning in the right direction.

40:02.340 --> 40:03.580
So let's hope so.

40:03.580 --> 40:04.580
I'm hopeful.

40:04.580 --> 40:05.580
All right.

40:05.580 --> 40:06.580
I'm hopeful as well.

40:06.580 --> 40:09.740
So we declared Linux users not necessarily cheap and to stay tuned.

40:09.740 --> 40:13.060
And you know, honestly, I think what you see there in the steam stats actually being reflected

40:13.060 --> 40:17.660
is initial excitement and then sort of people getting like you guys are all saying, getting

40:17.660 --> 40:18.660
back to work.

40:18.660 --> 40:22.860
And what it does show you is when all the Linux users are really excited to go in for

40:22.860 --> 40:26.380
some reason and maybe it's some new release or some update, you can get up to two percent

40:26.380 --> 40:27.580
of steam on Linux.

40:27.580 --> 40:35.080
Now, maybe your maybe your sustained average run rate is one percent.

40:35.080 --> 40:38.660
But on peaks, if you can get up to two percent, that at least means the audience is there

40:38.660 --> 40:39.660
for steam.

40:39.660 --> 40:43.680
And, you know, it could be different members of that two percent are in there at different

40:43.680 --> 40:45.420
times at any given time.

40:45.420 --> 40:47.620
Their concurrent rate is only one percent.

40:47.620 --> 40:48.620
That's true.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.620
That's a good point.

40:49.620 --> 40:52.580
I still think that could really do wonders if they could find a way to get people to

40:52.580 --> 40:55.980
come back and say, hey, I've got the games I'm really excited about.

40:55.980 --> 40:56.980
That's not going to change.

40:56.980 --> 40:58.380
I'm not necessarily looking for new ones.

40:58.380 --> 41:01.240
Get me something that's going to enhance my existing game experience.

41:01.240 --> 41:03.420
That's why I like that natural selection too so much.

41:03.420 --> 41:07.140
That just feels like a triple A. I turn people send me in bit messages and turn down your

41:07.140 --> 41:09.860
texture quality won't crash as much on you, which always hurts.

41:09.860 --> 41:10.860
Right.

41:10.860 --> 41:12.660
Because on the bonobo, the first thing I do, I go in and say everything, crank crank, crank

41:12.660 --> 41:13.660
everything.

41:13.660 --> 41:14.660
It's out of principle.

41:14.660 --> 41:15.660
Yeah, exactly.

41:15.660 --> 41:18.140
I just wanted to kick a topic around with you.

41:18.140 --> 41:20.820
It's not too related to Linux, but it happened today.

41:20.820 --> 41:24.620
And you got to wonder, you look at Ubuntu Touch, you look at Firefox OS.

41:24.620 --> 41:26.380
So I'm going to ask you, Matt, Unity Sync.

41:26.380 --> 41:28.420
I got to talk about Unity Sync before we go on.

41:28.420 --> 41:29.960
Our second sponsor this week.

41:29.960 --> 41:30.960
What is Unity Sync?

41:30.960 --> 41:31.960
We'll find out for yourself.

41:31.960 --> 41:36.780
Go to derwiz.com slash Unity Sync, but I'll give you a hint since you're asking me.

41:36.780 --> 41:41.120
Unity Sync is a centralized service that synchronizes data between different types of directories.

41:41.120 --> 41:43.340
Now I don't mean like a directory on your hard drive.

41:43.340 --> 41:49.140
I'm talking real enterprise-grade directories, actor directories, Zimbra directories, OpenLDAP,

41:49.140 --> 41:53.140
ComniGate Pro, Oracle Internet Directory, Sun One, iPlanet.

41:53.140 --> 41:54.780
Yeah, it'll do iPlanet group-wise.

41:54.780 --> 41:57.380
Yeah, enough people actually asked.

41:57.380 --> 41:58.700
They implemented group-wise support.

41:58.700 --> 42:04.260
It'll also do Microsoft SQL access, Oracle, Sybase, MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, LDF, CFV

42:04.260 --> 42:05.260
files.

42:05.260 --> 42:06.260
Here's what you can do.

42:06.260 --> 42:10.720
You can move either the entire directory or just attributes of the directory seamlessly

42:10.720 --> 42:16.140
between the different directories and all from the Unity Sync service that runs on either

42:16.140 --> 42:20.020
a Windows box or a Linux box and doesn't require its own database.

42:20.020 --> 42:25.300
Unity Sync allows you to solve this problem that has plagued IT for centuries.

42:25.300 --> 42:28.220
Since we have had online databases, IT has struggled with this.

42:28.220 --> 42:29.220
I know.

42:29.220 --> 42:30.220
I know.

42:30.220 --> 42:31.220
I know.

42:31.220 --> 42:32.860
I know your plight, friends.

42:32.860 --> 42:33.860
I know your plight.

42:33.860 --> 42:34.860
Here's the good news.

42:34.860 --> 42:36.460
No scripting or programming is required.

42:36.460 --> 42:41.180
All of Unity Sync's attribute management is handled by an easy-to-learn template system

42:41.180 --> 42:43.060
requiring no programming experience.

42:43.060 --> 42:47.060
However, there is a little Python under the hood, or not Python, Perl, that you can get

42:47.060 --> 42:49.700
in there and do some Perl scripting if you want to do some massaging.

42:49.700 --> 42:50.700
These templates are great.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.540
You can make sure data is exactly what you expect.

42:52.540 --> 42:58.500
Look, when Susie in HR updates her application because somebody changed their last name,

42:58.500 --> 43:02.340
you need to get that reflected in whatever the IT database has pointed out for the global

43:02.340 --> 43:03.740
directory for your entire company.

43:03.740 --> 43:07.460
You want to look like one unified organization with different data stores?

43:07.460 --> 43:11.420
Unity Sync solves that for you by bringing all of these things together and letting you

43:11.420 --> 43:12.420
control.

43:12.420 --> 43:15.740
Plus, Unity Sync's easy-to-use web interface lets you do dry runs, lets you get reports,

43:15.740 --> 43:17.620
lets you just check on the status of things.

43:17.620 --> 43:21.860
It's really quite easy and quite simple to set up, but yet extremely powerful, clocking

43:21.860 --> 43:24.220
in at just under five megabytes.

43:24.220 --> 43:29.740
This enterprise-grade software, friends, and of course, it runs on Linux, is used by some

43:29.740 --> 43:34.100
really big names, including, oh, the Canadian Department of National Defense.

43:34.100 --> 43:37.020
Yeah, yeah, those guys, yeah, yeah, you've heard of them.

43:37.020 --> 43:38.020
What about General Dynamics?

43:38.020 --> 43:41.660
Yeah, General Dynamics, they're a customer of Unity Sync, and they use Unity Sync to

43:41.660 --> 43:44.100
move data between their different directories.

43:44.100 --> 43:49.900
Oh, the MLB, Washington Nationals, as well, MLB Major League Baseball HQ also uses Unity

43:49.900 --> 43:50.900
Sync.

43:50.900 --> 43:53.820
You baseball fans, FYI on that one, you're welcome.

43:53.820 --> 43:56.420
Go over to durwiz.com and check out Unity Sync.

43:56.420 --> 43:58.900
Just go to durwiz.com slash Unity Sync.

43:58.900 --> 44:02.980
And when you decide you want to grab it, just to try it out, you can get a free trial.

44:02.980 --> 44:06.700
If you use the code LINUX, it'll extend it to a full 30-day trial, so you get an extra

44:06.700 --> 44:10.820
extended trial, plus your first year of maintenance is going to be absolutely free.

44:10.820 --> 44:13.620
So once you pull that trigger, you're going to be taken care of for a year, and that's

44:13.620 --> 44:14.980
a really great deal.

44:14.980 --> 44:17.380
So go to durwiz.com slash Unity Sync.

44:17.380 --> 44:18.380
Check it out and be impressed.

44:18.380 --> 44:20.140
I know it's going to solve your problems.

44:20.140 --> 44:24.420
I have struggled with this myself, and if you're out there with this kind of problem,

44:24.420 --> 44:26.500
Unity Sync is going to make you the IT hero.

44:26.500 --> 44:29.380
So thanks to Durwiz for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

44:29.380 --> 44:33.900
So I'm going to ask you, Matt, Microsoft today announcing they're buying the Nokia phone

44:33.900 --> 44:38.980
division for $7.2 billion.

44:38.980 --> 44:42.220
This is coming from, well, everywhere on the internet.

44:42.220 --> 44:47.840
Stephen Elop will be stepping down as Nokia's CEO, and he'll be heading up Nokia's devices

44:47.840 --> 44:52.540
and services division, which is actually going to just become part of Microsoft.

44:52.540 --> 44:57.460
And Nokia will now focus on their Nokia Now brand, which is their mapping stuff, and their

44:57.460 --> 45:03.000
Nokia network services stuff, which I guess they've had some good traction lately.

45:03.000 --> 45:11.100
And the 30,000 employees of Nokia will be joining Microsoft, and Microsoft will be taking

45:11.100 --> 45:16.940
the Apple route and the Nexus route of developing their hardware more closely, sort of like

45:16.940 --> 45:17.940
the Moto X or the iPhone.

45:17.940 --> 45:18.940
Right, right.

45:18.940 --> 45:19.940
Well, yeah, they're following Google suit.

45:19.940 --> 45:21.140
I mean, that's exactly what they're doing.

45:21.140 --> 45:23.420
So what do you think this means for...

45:23.420 --> 45:25.580
So it's already a very locked down market.

45:25.580 --> 45:31.740
I mean, you got your incumbents, Android, iOS, and Blackberry, and Microsoft in there.

45:31.740 --> 45:35.700
And we were already saying, like, gosh, this doesn't seem like it's very practical for

45:35.700 --> 45:38.860
somebody like Ubuntu Touch or Firefox OS to break in.

45:38.860 --> 45:44.980
Is Microsoft becoming a phone maker?

45:44.980 --> 45:45.980
Is this a big deal?

45:45.980 --> 45:49.820
Is this going to lock it down completely, or is this a total irrelevant move?

45:49.820 --> 45:54.620
Well, here's the problem is that, first of all, let's go to the Firefox phones, for example.

45:54.620 --> 45:55.980
They've mastered grassroots.

45:55.980 --> 45:57.340
They obviously have got it nailed.

45:57.340 --> 45:58.800
I think they totally nailed that one.

45:58.800 --> 45:59.800
So that's something...

45:59.800 --> 46:04.980
They can go to eBay or something totally obscure and still get the sales happening.

46:04.980 --> 46:05.980
Microsoft is under the...

46:05.980 --> 46:11.060
I'm using a delusion that they're still relevant in this space, and it just cracks me up, especially

46:11.060 --> 46:13.580
as the CEO is retiring.

46:13.580 --> 46:16.380
Anyway, so, you know, cough, cough.

46:16.380 --> 46:17.380
Yeah, right.

46:17.380 --> 46:21.660
Anyway, so the whole point of it is that, you know, so just because you go and buy a

46:21.660 --> 46:27.180
company like Nokia, who back in the 90s were really awesome, and they still maintain decent

46:27.180 --> 46:31.500
numbers out of the United States, I'm sure there's still people that use those phones

46:31.500 --> 46:33.180
over the borders.

46:33.180 --> 46:37.060
But honestly, I don't really see that as being a real relevant, exciting thing because, you

46:37.060 --> 46:39.660
know, the Firefox phone comes out or the Ubuntu phone comes out.

46:39.660 --> 46:43.860
It's something completely unique and different that we haven't tried before, where with the

46:43.860 --> 46:49.380
Windows phone, we already tried it, we weren't real impressed with it, so now we want more

46:49.380 --> 46:50.380
of it.

46:50.380 --> 46:51.380
It doesn't really jive.

46:51.380 --> 46:52.380
I get you.

46:52.380 --> 46:53.380
You know what I mean?

46:53.380 --> 46:54.380
Let me give you a devil's advocate here.

46:54.380 --> 46:57.220
So, okay, I'll play devil's advocate.

46:57.220 --> 46:58.220
I'm in the enterprise.

46:58.220 --> 46:59.220
I'm a business.

46:59.220 --> 47:00.220
Let's say I'm a hospital.

47:00.220 --> 47:02.780
I've got a lot of Windows applications.

47:02.780 --> 47:07.940
But one of the things you can't argue is Surface RT is kind of a snore, right?

47:07.940 --> 47:09.900
And it's crap.

47:09.900 --> 47:13.780
But Nokia, on the other hand, makes fantastic hardware.

47:13.780 --> 47:23.100
And if I had a Nokia-made Surface X86 or whatever, and I'm a doctor's office, I'm a hospital,

47:23.100 --> 47:26.980
I've got all of this stuff already on the Windows platform, I can get these devices,

47:26.980 --> 47:31.420
I can have them cooperate with my file formats, I can have them access my Windows file servers

47:31.420 --> 47:35.580
and join the domain potentially and all this kind of stuff, I can have group policy applied

47:35.580 --> 47:36.580
to them, etc.

47:36.580 --> 47:40.700
Maybe not an RT, but on the X86 version.

47:40.700 --> 47:47.380
Could it be that what Microsoft is going to do is sort of lock down this sector of the

47:47.380 --> 47:52.260
market where it's a personal device, but it's a business device first?

47:52.260 --> 47:56.940
And it needs to get some work done, and it needs to be compatible, and maybe this is

47:56.940 --> 48:02.060
what they're going to do is create a hardware platform that is all of these disenfranchised

48:02.060 --> 48:06.100
Windows 8 corporations who are refusing to go to Windows 8 eventually going to have to

48:06.100 --> 48:07.100
pick something.

48:07.100 --> 48:10.540
They're either going to have to go to 8 or 9, whatever it is at the time they make their

48:10.540 --> 48:13.180
leap, they're going to have to switch to Linux, they're going to have to switch to the Mac.

48:13.180 --> 48:16.620
What if Microsoft came to them and said, well look, a ton of your staff members are coming

48:16.620 --> 48:21.900
in with iPads and Android devices, and this is driving your IT crazy, and you guys can't

48:21.900 --> 48:23.220
standardize on this.

48:23.220 --> 48:26.660
But they obviously need this functionality, it's great for meetings, it's great for taking

48:26.660 --> 48:28.820
inventory, etc, etc, blah, blah, blah.

48:28.820 --> 48:32.280
So here's what we're going to do, we're Microsoft, we now own this hardware company, we're going

48:32.280 --> 48:36.100
to work directly with them to make a Windows product, and this is what you can move to.

48:36.100 --> 48:39.020
You can have Windows on the desktop, you can have Windows on the server, and now you can

48:39.020 --> 48:43.140
have Windows on the mobile client device, and we create all of it.

48:43.140 --> 48:47.340
I think that if they, that's the right idea, but here's why they won't do it.

48:47.340 --> 48:50.260
I mean, they should, and that would be, if you were working for them, they'd actually

48:50.260 --> 48:53.060
be doing well, because you're right, that's exactly where they need to be, they need to

48:53.060 --> 48:57.820
be an enterprise, and they need to make things seamless for the end user, as well as sane

48:57.820 --> 48:58.820
for the IT folks.

48:58.820 --> 49:02.480
Look man, I got a good piece of malware, and I need to get that across your entire organization

49:02.480 --> 49:03.480
as fast as possible.

49:03.480 --> 49:07.460
Exactly right, well yeah, but I mean, they can still lock it down at some level I'm sure,

49:07.460 --> 49:11.060
but it's Windows, so you're still going to always have that as an issue.

49:11.060 --> 49:14.280
But besides that, I think that yes, if they stuck with the IT market, or stuck with the

49:14.280 --> 49:19.420
enterprise market, and really continue to master that's where they do well, that would

49:19.420 --> 49:21.240
be fine, but that's not what's going to happen.

49:21.240 --> 49:24.140
What we're going to see is we're going to see another commercial with dancing idiots

49:24.140 --> 49:27.640
and flapping tablets, and they're going to try for consumer again.

49:27.640 --> 49:28.640
That's the problem.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.880
You see, if they stuck with what you're talking about, that would actually make a lot of sense,

49:31.880 --> 49:34.020
but they won't do that exclusively.

49:34.020 --> 49:38.360
They'll dabble in that, but the consumer market is sexy.

49:38.360 --> 49:42.280
They want to be kind of the Apple folks, and when they get a new CEO in there, I think

49:42.280 --> 49:43.280
that's what's going to happen.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.840
I think that they're going to be like, well, we need to be more relevant in the consumer

49:45.840 --> 49:48.900
market because that's really where growth is, because the enterprise market, they tend

49:48.900 --> 49:51.640
to kind of lock down in segments and blah, blah, blah, blah, but you know.

49:51.640 --> 49:52.640
Yeah, stagnate.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.240
Yeah, I mean, I've seen banks still using Windows 2000.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.360
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's bad, it's bad.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.880
So they know that, so they want growth.

49:58.880 --> 50:03.560
I'll ask, okay, mumble chat room, anybody in here that wants to chime in, what do you

50:03.560 --> 50:08.640
think, is Microsoft buying up Nokia bad for the free and open mobile operating systems?

50:08.640 --> 50:12.840
I'm thinking specifically Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, because I kind of saw them as having

50:12.840 --> 50:16.800
potential inroads to the enterprise, especially Ubuntu Touch with Convergence.

50:16.800 --> 50:20.720
I think that could be big in enterprise, but if Microsoft comes along and they've got

50:20.720 --> 50:25.220
Nokia hardware, they've got the Windows desktop, they've got the Windows mobile crap, it's

50:25.220 --> 50:28.000
all crap, but enterprises will buy it anyways.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.080
It's standardized, that's why, yeah.

50:30.080 --> 50:35.880
Is this sort of closing the door of opportunity for these up and coming mobile operating systems?

50:35.880 --> 50:37.520
Mumble room, I ask you.

50:37.520 --> 50:44.600
Not, I hope not, but as Mr. Mango also in the chat room mentioned, Nokia owns a lot

50:44.600 --> 50:50.760
of patents and I think that Microsoft is going to use those patents to hurt Firefox and all

50:50.760 --> 50:52.240
the other operating systems.

50:52.240 --> 50:56.320
Oh, that's a great point, yeah.

50:56.320 --> 51:01.760
Nokia still owns a large segment of their IP.

51:01.760 --> 51:08.760
The difference is Microsoft has a 10-year reciprocal license with Nokia regarding those,

51:08.760 --> 51:13.160
so I believe Nokia still owns a lot of its patent portfolio.

51:13.160 --> 51:15.360
The Qualcomm stuff goes to Microsoft.

51:15.360 --> 51:19.600
The other stuff, Microsoft has a 10-year license, I believe, with the option at some point,

51:19.600 --> 51:22.560
at any point, to make it a perpetual license.

51:22.560 --> 51:23.560
Right.

51:23.560 --> 51:28.080
Now, regarding Nokia getting bought out, for the most part, by Microsoft, it shouldn't

51:28.080 --> 51:30.600
come to anyone by surprise.

51:30.600 --> 51:36.780
Back in Build 2012 and reiterated in 2013, Microsoft clearly stated that they're pushing

51:36.780 --> 51:41.640
more towards becoming a devices and services company.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.640
Because they've done so well so far.

51:43.640 --> 51:44.640
Yeah.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.640
Right.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.480
Well, apparently, Surface Pro is doing all right.

51:47.480 --> 51:51.760
It's just the Surface RT that's been a complete flop and everyone knows why.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.960
That's true, that's true.

51:53.960 --> 51:59.600
But Nokia is a very established brand, and if they could bring that level of hardware

51:59.600 --> 52:04.360
to Microsoft's other products, we might see a bit more success.

52:04.360 --> 52:06.680
I don't know, and I guess time will tell.

52:06.680 --> 52:09.680
Yeah, I think the patent thing is going to be the scary thing to watch.

52:09.680 --> 52:12.600
I totally agree with you guys.

52:12.600 --> 52:16.760
The patents are still owned by Nokia, and Microsoft just have a cross-license to use

52:16.760 --> 52:17.760
them.

52:17.760 --> 52:21.600
That doesn't mean they get an opportunity to use them in court against other people.

52:21.600 --> 52:26.320
Well, some of the Qualcomm stuff will be owned by Microsoft, and there's a lot of cellular

52:26.320 --> 52:28.520
stuff in that Qualcomm portfolio.

52:28.520 --> 52:31.800
Right, but they don't own Qualcomm license.

52:31.800 --> 52:36.680
They just are allowed to leverage the current deal that Nokia has with Qualcomm.

52:36.680 --> 52:37.680
Yeah, right.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.680
So they probably couldn't sue over that.

52:38.680 --> 52:39.680
Yeah, right.

52:39.680 --> 52:40.680
They can't pull the trigger on it.

52:40.680 --> 52:41.680
Yeah.

52:41.680 --> 52:42.680
Okay.

52:42.680 --> 52:43.680
Good point, good point.

52:43.680 --> 52:51.000
What I find interesting is that Microsoft used the name Nokia on their products.

52:51.000 --> 52:57.720
And Nokia can't make smartphones under this agreement until 2015, in which case they are

52:57.720 --> 53:00.560
allowed to make smartphones.

53:00.560 --> 53:05.660
And the announcement said that their award-winning design team manufacturing and assembly facilities

53:05.660 --> 53:11.520
around the world that Microsoft are absorbing, but it doesn't actually mention engineering,

53:11.520 --> 53:12.520
software development, and research.

53:12.520 --> 53:13.520
Right.

53:13.520 --> 53:16.560
In fact, I believe Nokia's lead engineer, or I mean lead designer, just announced he's

53:16.560 --> 53:21.320
leaving Nokia to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities, it was.

53:21.320 --> 53:28.040
Yeah, and that could be a good move for Yola, or Mozilla may go around hiring.

53:28.040 --> 53:29.040
True.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.040
Oh, man.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.040
In Canonical.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.040
Oh, man.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.600
That would be interesting if they snapped him up.

53:33.600 --> 53:37.600
And like Jarem's saying, man, am I glad QT is out of Nokia now, right?

53:37.600 --> 53:38.600
No kidding.

53:38.600 --> 53:40.080
QT has been saved.

53:40.080 --> 53:44.800
Now, what do you guys think about the kind of the elephant in the room is, so Stephen

53:44.800 --> 53:50.440
Elop, former Microsoft employee, goes to Nokia, everyone has always said, he's a Trojan horse.

53:50.440 --> 53:55.400
Now he's going to step down as CEO, and he's going to become head of devices and services,

53:55.400 --> 53:57.240
which is getting absorbed by Microsoft.

53:57.240 --> 54:01.800
Julie Larson Green, who had just gotten promoted in this whole reshuffle, she got like moved

54:01.800 --> 54:06.200
way up to the top and was reporting right to Balmer, now reports to Elop, and Elop reports

54:06.200 --> 54:07.200
to Balmer.

54:07.200 --> 54:10.240
So do you think Elop is our next CEO of Microsoft?

54:10.240 --> 54:11.240
Yes.

54:11.240 --> 54:14.520
I would say he's either that or he's going to be Arthur Cheney.

54:14.520 --> 54:20.480
I'm sorry, I mean, he's not, I mean, just looking at this picture, you got to have someone

54:20.480 --> 54:24.200
that's, no, he's, I can't, you got to have a nice figurehead in there, and I think they

54:24.200 --> 54:28.080
learned their lesson from Balmer that he's just not really, the consumers just aren't

54:28.080 --> 54:29.080
really buying it.

54:29.080 --> 54:30.080
You got Elop pulling the strings of some public.

54:30.080 --> 54:31.120
Yeah, I got him pulling the strings.

54:31.120 --> 54:34.320
I think he's the brand of the operation for sure, but I don't think he's the front man.

54:34.320 --> 54:35.800
I think he's behind the scenes.

54:35.800 --> 54:36.800
Yeah, yeah.

54:36.800 --> 54:37.800
Might be.

54:37.800 --> 54:40.560
I mean, almost anybody would be an upgrade from Balmer though, right?

54:40.560 --> 54:42.960
Oh my gosh, don't get me started.

54:42.960 --> 54:43.960
Man.

54:43.960 --> 54:48.080
So, Heaven's Revenge just joined us.

54:48.080 --> 54:51.720
Before we move off on this topic, did you want to chime in with any thoughts?

54:51.720 --> 54:56.960
Well, Balmer might've kept them as a, if you can hear me all right, Balmer might've kept

54:56.960 --> 55:03.560
them as a devices or a personal computer company because I don't think they're going to try

55:03.560 --> 55:07.440
to stay as a PC company for very much longer.

55:07.440 --> 55:08.440
Not at all.

55:08.440 --> 55:13.880
I think we're seeing them advance more towards promoting Windows Azure, which is already

55:13.880 --> 55:15.520
a $1 billion business.

55:15.520 --> 55:20.880
We see them bringing Office over to multiple platforms, which, lol, good luck.

55:20.880 --> 55:24.400
I don't think they're going to drop it, right?

55:24.400 --> 55:27.360
I think they're going to canonical focus a little bit on mobile.

55:27.360 --> 55:31.680
They're going to kind of make that shift where mobile is the priority, but desktop is an

55:31.680 --> 55:35.420
important client operating system that also interacts with some of the same cloud services

55:35.420 --> 55:36.420
that mobile does.

55:36.420 --> 55:41.840
I'm not saying this is a good idea, but what I'm saying is I think they see the consumer

55:41.840 --> 55:46.760
devices as just as critical to the success as their enterprise devices.

55:46.760 --> 55:53.440
Because what Balmer, at least Balmer, I believe, has felt like he's learned from Apple is if

55:53.440 --> 55:57.440
you get the consumers to buy the gadgets, they'll bring it to the enterprise.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.520
And so you kind of, it's like a front.

55:59.520 --> 56:03.120
You got to have a stake in the consumer space and you got to have a stake in the enterprise

56:03.120 --> 56:05.480
space because the two merge together and meet.

56:05.480 --> 56:10.120
So I think he's thinking, I mean, I would assume Microsoft always sees Windows as key

56:10.120 --> 56:14.400
to that overall strategy, but right, it's no longer going to be a Windows company, right?

56:14.400 --> 56:18.160
I mean, Windows is going to be part of that company, but it's just like Canonical is no

56:18.160 --> 56:20.480
longer the Ubuntu desktop company, right?

56:20.480 --> 56:21.480
Exactly.

56:21.480 --> 56:22.480
Exactly.

56:22.480 --> 56:28.440
Yeah, no, I see them just and with their heavy focus on going into basically a hardware mindset,

56:28.440 --> 56:29.920
someone said, well, they do hardware well.

56:29.920 --> 56:32.240
I mean, remember the Xbox and that's true.

56:32.240 --> 56:36.240
But from my memory that that division was left alone enough to where they were able

56:36.240 --> 56:37.240
to be successful.

56:37.240 --> 56:43.000
The other departments in Microsoft, not, you know, it's kind of hit and miss really.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.160
And I think Windows is probably the one that's really taken the biggest hit.

56:46.160 --> 56:49.520
So I don't know, this whole reorganization thing where Ballmer ends up, you know, he

56:49.520 --> 56:51.080
leaves, who comes in, all this sort of stuff.

56:51.080 --> 56:55.080
At the end of the day, what you're left with is they need to make a decision as to who

56:55.080 --> 56:56.320
the hell they're marketing their product to.

56:56.320 --> 56:59.280
I don't care if they're selling pears or bananas or what.

56:59.280 --> 57:02.640
It doesn't make any difference who's their market and they can't seem to get the brain

57:02.640 --> 57:03.640
around that.

57:03.640 --> 57:06.800
You brought up a great point that, you know, they start with the enterprise and then, you

57:06.800 --> 57:09.880
know, or they start as consumers and bring it into the enterprise or even vice versa.

57:09.880 --> 57:14.540
In Microsoft's, honestly, Apple was always strongest in consumer.

57:14.540 --> 57:16.120
Microsoft was always strongest in enterprise.

57:16.120 --> 57:17.920
They need to figure out a way to keep it in the enterprise.

57:17.920 --> 57:20.740
And if they can get it down, trickle down to the consumer, great.

57:20.740 --> 57:23.080
But anything to do with consumers is just going to backfire.

57:23.080 --> 57:27.720
One of the things that they said that was interesting is that they put out this PowerPoint

57:27.720 --> 57:32.160
presentation that All Things Deep posted up on their website and I don't know who this

57:32.160 --> 57:37.040
presentation was for, but Microsoft, I guess, has got to have a PowerPoint for everything.

57:37.040 --> 57:42.160
In the PowerPoint presentation for this acquisition, they mentioned that right now Microsoft makes

57:42.160 --> 57:45.480
$10 on average per Windows phone device.

57:45.480 --> 57:49.240
Now it's funny because I think they make more than that on an Android device.

57:49.240 --> 57:58.560
However, if once they own Nokia, they project they will actually generate $40 per device.

57:58.560 --> 58:05.000
So it's interesting to see as a licensee and they talk about how in the, they say it used

58:05.000 --> 58:08.920
to be common knowledge that the best way to have a successful platform was to license

58:08.920 --> 58:11.040
it and become the standard.

58:11.040 --> 58:15.320
But now we've learned that the best, now the market has changed and the best solution is

58:15.320 --> 58:18.440
an integrated approach of hardware and software and services.

58:18.440 --> 58:21.200
We're going to do it all, try to be the one all, answer all.

58:21.200 --> 58:25.320
And the problem with this is it's very against the whole Linux, Unix philosophy where you

58:25.320 --> 58:29.160
have a lot of tools that work together that do one thing really well.

58:29.160 --> 58:34.360
And I want to go back, I want to go back to when the iPhone just launched and Android

58:34.360 --> 58:38.960
just launched, Amazon didn't have their own mobile device, Google was totally cool with

58:38.960 --> 58:42.760
integrating with everybody, Apple didn't want to have to own absolutely everything and have

58:42.760 --> 58:47.680
an iCloud service and all this garbage so I could use Amazon for my MP3s, I could use

58:47.680 --> 58:48.680
Google for my search.

58:48.680 --> 58:53.380
It was this really nice, you know, now everybody has to own the whole stack, right?

58:53.380 --> 58:58.160
Everything has to be an integrated, custom-built solution that's custom-tailored to you.

58:58.160 --> 59:00.680
I'm just getting so sick of it.

59:00.680 --> 59:02.520
But I think there's a market for it, you know.

59:02.520 --> 59:04.200
My wife certainly is a market for it.

59:04.200 --> 59:06.120
She wants iEverything because she likes all that.

59:06.120 --> 59:08.120
She doesn't want to get an app, she just wants it to work.

59:08.120 --> 59:10.080
I think your wife would probably agree with that.

59:10.080 --> 59:11.080
Yeah, yeah.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.080
You know, that's kind of her thing.

59:12.080 --> 59:14.480
So there are people that definitely want that for sure.

59:14.480 --> 59:19.680
Yeah, and it's interesting too because I think we're moving, oh sorry, Miracode.

59:19.680 --> 59:24.120
I think we're moving towards a world that maybe not all users realize we're moving because

59:24.120 --> 59:28.600
when Angela made the switch to Android for a little while, she was like, wait, wait,

59:28.600 --> 59:29.600
wait, wait, wait.

59:29.600 --> 59:33.280
What do you mean I need to put all of my photos and music up on the server?

59:33.280 --> 59:34.600
I want them here on my hard drive.

59:34.600 --> 59:36.560
I don't want them up on the server.

59:36.560 --> 59:39.760
Why would I want to use my data to listen to my music that I already own?

59:39.760 --> 59:41.840
Why am I paying for it twice in her mind?

59:41.840 --> 59:46.760
And you got to figure a lot of people are smarter than we give them credit for.

59:46.760 --> 59:48.960
Sometimes people can just see the common sense of a situation and say, wait a minute, wait

59:48.960 --> 59:52.080
a minute, I got to buy this track and then I got to pay for the storage and I got to

59:52.080 --> 59:56.600
pay for the data to stream it instead of just having it sync over to my machine for my hard

59:56.600 --> 59:57.600
drive.

59:57.600 --> 01:00:01.200
That doesn't, for her, what was the killer for Android was that it was too dependent

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.080
on Google services.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.640
She wanted to have everything local.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:09.060
She wanted to be able to just plug in a USB cord to her computer, click a sync button.

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.680
Everything is copied from her hard drive to the device.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:16.440
There's also a strong network effect with these platforms.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:23.000
Like my daughter has been saving up her money to buy herself and she wanted an iPod touch

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.800
and I said, well, how about a Nexus 4 because it's ridiculously cheap and it can do everything.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.440
And she was like, yeah, okay.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.000
And then when she thought about it a bit more, the reason she didn't want a Nexus 4 and she

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.640
wanted an iPod touch was because all of her friends in her class use FaceTime and that

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.320
would lock her out and she wouldn't be able to talk to her friends.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.640
So there's a strong network effect that once, you know, half the kids in the class have

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.040
an iPod or an iPhone, the rest of them are guaranteed to get one.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.000
It's the whole ecosystem thing, isn't it?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.520
If you've got Apple's ecosystem, you're tied into it.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:03.760
The people at work, they don't want to move over to Android because they're tied into

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.760
iTunes.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760
Everything's into iTunes.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.320
The same happens with Google.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:14.720
You get tied into Google with all of those services that ship on an Android device these

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.720
days.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.600
You can get very tied into the Play Store and you bought all your purchases in the Play

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.600
Store.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.560
You've got all your email in Gmail.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.080
It's a hard thing to switch away from.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.080
Yeah, I agree with that.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:33.040
I think Miracle, you might be making the same point and so is Alex Bell in the chat room

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:39.240
is iMessage gets a lot of crap, but I think it's the most understated feature and FaceTime

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.240
as well.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.420
Although it kind of sucks that FaceTime is being relayed now, but iMessage and the thing

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:48.840
about iMessage is different than Hangouts because Android has this now with Hangouts.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.840
In some ways it's superior because it can be opened up to groups.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.560
It's easy to throw Hangouts on any computer that has Chrome.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:01.200
So Hangouts are superior in every single way except I'm a paranoid bastard and I know that

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:07.060
everything I say is being stored indefinitely by Google and available immediately by a Homeland

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.120
Security note.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:15.400
And it's just stupid things, but if I say to my wife, oh yeah, I'll go upstairs and

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.120
I'll beat the children and she knows I'm joking because I would never do that, but that's

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.520
in a text message now that is logged on a Google server forever that is being indexed

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.720
by the National Security Agency potentially.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:37.120
What's to say that Apple, the biggest consumer company around, isn't also storing everything?

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.840
You never know, especially with Apple and especially in a closed source environment.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.840
You never know.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:50.040
Now their docs illustrate what happens is the Apple servers essentially are involved

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.280
for the initial handshake.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.800
So if Matt was an iPhone user and I was an iPhone user and I sent Matt an iMessage and

01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:01.480
that initial iMessage is coordinated by the iCloud service, whatever you want to call

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.240
it, their push service.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:09.480
Once the two devices link, there is a key generated on each handset that is then exchanged

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:14.540
and they then communicate directly to each other from that point forward.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:22.760
Maybe that's just because the Apple ecosystem has been directly tied into the business world.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:26.040
So they've had to develop that kind of encryption.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:31.600
I think when it happens to Android, they'll update it or they'll have to update it to

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.560
be able to enter into that ecosystem.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.500
I think it's deeper than that by an order of magnitude.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:42.400
What I think it is is Google is inherently an internet connected company.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.920
Everything is orchestrated through the cloud.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.920
Everything is synced through the cloud.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.080
Like in Google, you don't sync your calendar, right?

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.280
Google Calendar is the master source of the calendar you can push and subscribe.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:56.980
But Apple was a company that existed before there was an internet.

01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:04.000
So what Apple does, Apple is local land first and they don't have any reason to be internet

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
first.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.140
For example, AirPlay.

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:11.520
When you AirPlay something from an iOS device to an Apple TV, that is a direct IP connection

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.140
from the iOS device to the Apple TV.

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:18.760
But when you use Chromecast, that sends a notification message up to the cloud.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.840
The cloud then orchestrates the connection from the YouTube video down to the Chromecast

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.000
initiates the play, and then the commands from your handset are sent up to the cloud

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.760
server and the cloud server sends the commands down to the Chromecast.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:36.040
Potentially, each one has its advantages for sure, but one is inherently more private.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.760
One is inherently more private because it never has to leave your land.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:45.000
The fact that iMessage and FaceTime can in some capacities work like that and the fact

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.680
that it enables free text messaging and that they support pictures and messages is a huge

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.200
advantage to that platform.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.940
So that is a lock-in that we don't even talk about when we talk about Ubuntu Touch or Firefox.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:02.160
We talk about apps, but we don't even talk about all of these services like video stores

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:08.200
and music stores and these messaging services, Hangouts or iMessages, that are sort of becoming

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.520
indispensable for some people.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:17.000
I think both Google and Apple are inherently evil, I just think they do evil differently.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.960
I know we get some flack for the Ubuntu Software Center, but if you buy stuff from the Software

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:26.880
Center, they're just a bunch of PPAs and you can just log into Launchpad and get those

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:31.360
packages back out and port them across to another Linux distro if you like.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:36.720
It's not so easy on either iOS or Android.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:42.760
Another thing, back to the original point regarding whether the move by Microsoft to

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:53.040
Nokia is going to affect Ubuntu Phone and such, Canonical and Mozilla and Yola, they

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:58.120
don't care if you use Amazon for your books and Google Music for your music, they don't

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.120
care.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:05.400
It's just to create this wonderful OS that everything can coexist on and I think that's

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:14.440
kind of the point we need to get back to regarding these new, I guess you could say, indie OSs.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.480
I think it also helps define their market.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.480
That's their market.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:21.640
For people that want to select and choose those individual services, folks like us that

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:25.160
care about that sort of thing, that's attractive.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.440
I think that's great because it definitely defines that market for folks.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:35.040
My solution for this was kind of the final straw that made me roll my own XMPP server.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:41.160
I just wanted to, all of this NSA stuff has made me just, it's not that I'm worried about

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.520
being monitored, it crosses my mind now.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.680
I think about it.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.600
I was doing a whole bunch of reading about Syria recently and then I got down a path

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.040
so there's been protests outside of John Kerry's house.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.920
I haven't seen that on the news so I wanted to see pictures of it.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:01.000
Now I realize I'm searching for Syria locations on Google Maps, I'm searching for chemical

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.520
weapons, I'm searching for John Kerry's house.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.520
And nothing happens.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.640
But the fact that I have to worry about it makes me uncomfortable.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:12.080
And so I'm just like, you know what, I'm going to go to XMPP, I'm going to chat with my wife

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:15.840
on our own private chat server so that way I never have to worry about it at all.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.040
It never even crosses my mind.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.960
It's not a distraction anymore.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:24.880
And I like that peace of mind and I like the idea that Yala or Ubuntu Touch or Firefox

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:31.940
OS is more about the phone getting something on there but not necessarily locking you into

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.640
any particular service.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:39.080
That to me as a customer might be their biggest advantage, that they don't have that ecosystem.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:43.440
I completely agree with that and I think the way I've always looked at privacy long before

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:48.040
all this stuff with privacy concerns really came about is I always looked at privacy as

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:53.840
a very simple analogy in that absolutely I can if I choose to stand in front of my window

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:57.400
and get undressed and hop into the shower and if someone sees me it's really no big

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.400
deal.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.400
Please don't.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.960
But I feel more comfortable if no one has to subject their eyes to that and I just pull

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:06.440
the blinds and that's kind of where I see this taking privacy back into our own hands

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.680
thing is that for me it's out of principle.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.440
It's just like it's none of their damn business period.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.440
Doesn't matter why.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.200
It's just none of their damn business and that's just my perspective.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.400
I just keep it simple.

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:22.880
Alright so while we got the mumble line open I wanted to toss something around in the chat

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.320
room and I'll watch you too.

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:29.680
So something I get an email about once a day is hey the CAPTCHA isn't working on the Jupiter

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.680
colony.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.840
The Jupiter colony is the form not you know Jupiter colony is kind of what we is is an

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.880
overall branching title that we have for a lot of things but the Jupiter colony form

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:41.280
specifically the PHP BB bulletin board that we have up at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.520
forum is retired.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.160
It's in sort of read only mode we're not allowing new account creations there's still activity

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.160
there.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.740
Partially because I don't know.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:55.800
So the main reason is I don't have the time to take care of that anymore and it just it's

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.560
something that just needs attention from time to time and I don't have it.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.680
So I thought well okay social networks have kind of replaced this but then not everybody

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.680
wants to have a social network account.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.280
Reddit kind of replaces but not everybody wants to have a reddit account.

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:14.200
So we have a great G plus Jupiter colony community I really would like to have seen everything

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:18.400
move from the forums to that but so many people said I don't want to use G plus.

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:24.480
So what in this day and age so there's apparently some forums that the community still wants

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:28.560
to organize on and discuss a subset of the community but they don't want to create accounts

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:31.880
on some other services servers or anything like that.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.000
What do you use and or maybe is it our forms just dead is it just maybe time we just say

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.280
goodbye forms you're in read only mode stop trying to make accounts everybody.

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.880
I mean I kind of have but people but people are still trying to do it.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.480
Still trying to sign up still trying to engage in conversation in there.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:53.120
We've been in Ubuntu we've been promoting discourse which is made by the same people

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:57.400
who make stack exchange Jeff Atwood and it's brilliant.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:04.120
We've stood up Ubuntu discourse dog and it's a really lovely way to have discussion.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:08.600
It's it it looks a bit like a forum and a bit like stack exchange it's got the best

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.960
bits of stack exchange and the best bits of forum.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.080
What's the management like so like what's the up is it hosted or thinking about for

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.240
a while.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:20.840
So we we run it on I think we run it on HP cloud but you know you can run it on anything

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.120
it's it's it runs on Linux.

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.760
We've written a juju charm for it so we can stand up an instance anywhere at any time

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:35.520
and we we we have the the upstream developers contribute on our discourse when this is when

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.520
I use this.

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.520
Yeah this I like.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.520
Yeah I agree.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:43.760
I think this is and you don't have to sign up it uses an open ID or whatever so you can

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.640
you can sign in with some other you know single sign on.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.640
That is pretty cool.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.640
All right that's a good recommendation.

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.960
What's attractive and yeah like you said with the sign on that's great.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:59.160
Yeah so is this actually hosted as in could we host our own copy.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.160
Yes.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:01.160
Okay.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.400
It's open source.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.160
It's something I've been thinking about for quite a while Chris because I'm I'm one of

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.400
those people that try to sign up.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:14.720
I'm actually a PHP developer and I was going to send you an email actually and ask if you

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:19.640
wanted something built but it's funny that you've spoken about it now.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:24.160
Yeah yeah I know I get emails about it a lot so I know it's kind of a topic of that I just

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.360
don't really have a great forum to address a forum to address it.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:32.280
I do like this discourse thing but I guess my the fundamental question I have is is it

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.720
still needed today.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:40.000
I mean between all the social networks the IRC a mumble server TeamSpeak servers the

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.040
subreddits do we really need a forum too.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:49.800
I personally I've sworn off forums ever since the change of the last Jupiter Colony forum

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.800
change.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.800
I've been through forums ever since.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.840
Dude that was like six years ago.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.840
Wow.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:58.360
Never have I gone on another forum since.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.960
Well I was thinking of maybe doing something similar to maybe have a forum but with the

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:07.320
social networking aspect built in kind of with our own custom accounts on the Jupiter

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.320
Colony.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:11.160
So how would that work?

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:19.280
We would have to find some software to run it on or have somebody develop it.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.640
Well since discourse is open source why don't we just extend that.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.200
Yeah I think that's something we should look into right there.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.200
I like that.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.200
I think that's the smartest approach.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.200
All right.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.200
Well thanks guys.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.200
Sounds good.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.200
Thanks guys.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.200
So I'm going to mute the channel just for a little bit as we get to a couple emails

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.960
then we got to run because we're running long.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.080
I don't you know it is it is a hard thing to get to these emails Matt but we got some

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.080
good ones.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.080
Oh yeah.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.080
We got some good ones and I think this one came in.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.080
I think this one might have been on.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.880
We got some bit messages too and it was from B via bit message.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.120
Chris and Matt great job last unplugged.

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.040
We're going with Linux unplugged now.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.040
Thanks to you clowns.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.880
I will never ever get through my podcast back catalog.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:59.920
Not only do I have another JB podcast on my list but you've turned me on to Star Trek

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.920
podcasts.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.040
Now I get around 130 podcasts in my current queue.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.480
I guess I'll have to tell my boss that it's your fault.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.480
On the subject of mail service I've been running one for years.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:11.240
I started out running CoLab on a spark station back in the day.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.000
That box died about 10 years ago so I began running Zimbra on a P4 rack mount I had in

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
the basement.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
He likes Zimbra quite a bit.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.760
He says I was getting an email from my public mail service and collected them locally however

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:26.760
since ISPs had enough force I had to push the ISP had to push the force server used

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.600
but I'm going to jump ahead here.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:35.120
He says that he says that he now that he's got now these really now the NSA shenanigans

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.160
have happened that he's doubled down on this in light of all of that and he's going to

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:42.080
set he's going to set it up for real again and maybe this time include Nagios alerts

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.000
and things like that for when it goes offline.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Yeah.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Sounds pretty snazzy.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.280
I know I agree.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.360
So all right.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.400
So I want to read just a couple more.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.200
I'm going to make it quick because I promised Matt I promised we would do it so I cannot

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.200
go back on my promise.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.200
Here we go.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.200
We did make that claim.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.200
Juris, Linux handhelds.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.560
Hello Chris and Matt.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:05.200
Can I share can can you share your opinion on Linux handhelds in the open market at the

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.200
moment?

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:11.280
Like for example the open Pandora also the I have the new GW you want to know what we

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.960
thought about Linux on like handheld consoles.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.960
Matt do you have any thoughts on that?

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.340
Honestly I can't speak intelligently to it because I haven't really subjected myself

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:20.340
to it extensively.

01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.760
I think that actually is kind of an answer.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:25.080
It's kind of like I want to.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.080
I'm interested.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.080
I'm open minded.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.160
I know this GCW zero but it's kind of like you'll be really great.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:35.480
What would make this GCW perfect is that if good old games were just like boom that's

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.160
our console of choice and we're now you're talking right.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.160
Yes.

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.160
Right.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.160
Right.

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.160
Because you can run DOS box on this thing.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.280
So if you got DOS box going on this you could put you could run a ton of good old games

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:51.000
and if good old games could make a package and just be like pow I really think then you'd

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.860
really have something because the thing is is these little these little handheld consoles

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:59.160
like the open Pandora and the GCW zero are really cool.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.160
They're open.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.160
They're really neat.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.160
They have.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.560
Each one of them does something unique and interesting.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:08.280
But the end of the day they're really going up against smartphones now.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.200
You know if you know five six years ago that maybe not have been the case but now they

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.040
really are going up against smartphones so it's really got to stand out in some way.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.960
So I'm hopeful the GCW but we'll see.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:18.960
That would be cool.

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.880
I love the idea with good old games because that really solves the ecosystem problem for

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.040
that particular thing.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:31.280
Yeah they just got to see the light and I am a big GOG fan.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.040
But you know just like we've kind of seen them not really get the whole Linux thing.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.040
All right.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.040
We'll see.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.040
Well chicken or the egg.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.040
Chicken or the egg.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.040
Exactly.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:43.560
So John writes and he says I've been using play on Linux for some time now and the most

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.860
part I had moderate success.

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:49.680
What are your thoughts or experiences using any of these and which has worked best for

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.680
you.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.360
I'd love to see some information on the subject.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:58.320
Well boy for myself as a as a rule I think wine is a fine project where developers have

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.880
put in a lot of work and done wonderful things.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.040
As a usage thing I won't use wine.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:08.040
I will play in traffic on the freeway before using it just because it's not really my it's

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.880
just not my style.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:15.960
I try to put my feet down and stick in a native environment if at all possible.

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:20.320
I almost in some cases will prefer to just do full on virtualization.

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.320
True.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.320
That's it.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:27.400
And this I think goes back to as a Linux user when I see something of value I buy it.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:31.980
And since the mid 2000s I don't know when I mean for a very long time I have bought

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:33.960
every release of crossover office.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:39.640
I have a current version as of today and I'm not a huge I play on Linux I've had really

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:44.540
hit and miss success with but crossover if they say it works in that.

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:47.760
So in crossover you first of all you get a really nice wrapper around wine.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.760
You do.

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:52.960
You get bottles real nice so each thing you want to you get right under wine it has its

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:56.840
own self-contained configuration you can you can load stuff into it or you can have everything

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:00.840
isolated you can have different versions so I can have an XP bottle a 2000 bottle and

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.800
a Vista bottle or whatever.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:09.760
And that's how I do Star Trek Online is and once you know and to their credit once crossover

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.560
said yeah we're going to support Star Trek Online it has worked solidly.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:17.480
And a lot of things are like that and sometimes their list is a little lackluster like it's

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.160
like office 2010 is the latest but I found it to be accurate that's one thing I will

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:25.320
give them props for us that if they say it works it works yeah it's you know that I'll

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.320
give them props.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:30.000
They've expanded a community supported section now so they've got ones that users can submit

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.440
that have been sort of vetted.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:36.760
It's nice it's still not great though I mean like for example Star Trek Online takes ten

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:41.080
minutes to launch once it launches it's okay but for some reason under crossover wine it

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.120
takes ten minutes.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:49.120
I know that so I just accept it and it works fine and it's fine.

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:54.640
But you know I'm with Matt I it's my it's my last resort.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.840
Exactly and one other thing I thought they did well is at least they used to do bounties

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:03.760
so where there were you could actually chip in to help make this more compatible I don't

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.620
remember if they still do that or not now but they used to be you could actually throw

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:10.040
money in that direction to say I want this particular game or particular app to run.

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:12.880
I don't know I haven't tried that for a long time but yeah they had a voting system I think

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:13.880
that's still around.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:18.080
A couple of quick things I just wanted to mention this is like pissing in the wind here

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:23.640
but if anybody out there has access to a computer around them that has iTunes Linux Unplugged

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:27.080
just hit the new and noteworthy section of iTunes if you give us a rating in the comment

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.880
that helps Discovery keeps us kind of in the charts for a while.

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:35.580
Once we're up there it helps and and the reason why I mentioned that is because if we stay

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:39.140
up there for a few days we'll probably have a few new thousand people several thousand

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:42.760
people find the show and that's that's a great thing for Linux and for the network in general

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:46.640
so I know it can be challenging for some of you Linux users out there to get access to

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:52.000
iTunes but if it happens somehow we would appreciate a vote absolutely and that's another

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.800
thing you can use wine for while you're not gonna be able to do a lot with it yeah you

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.280
can probably get an older version of iTunes cross over has like an installer script for

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:02.920
that yeah yes yeah it does okay so I think that was all the emails now I was kicking

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:07.680
around an idea before the show okay we don't have to do it you you have final call on this

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:13.640
Matt all right a lot of the pre shows on unplugged have been Star Trek heavy talk a lot of Star

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:20.360
Trek on the live show I unplugged we're recording Tuesdays a 2 p.m. Pacific over JB live TV

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:27.440
which is 9 p.m. UTC I believe join us over JB live TV if you can do it what do you think

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:35.360
Matt of watching Star Trek deep space 9 episode 1 before next week's unplugged and then at

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.400
the last last like 10 minutes or so of unplugged we'll sort of wrap up all of our topics and

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.080
we'll talk about that first episode it might just be for just like a minute or two or something

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:48.440
oh absolutely no I'm totally fine if that shoot me a email reminder the DS9 challenge

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:53.160
you want to the DS9 challenge okay and I that's one I'm actually my favorite out of the entire

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:57.040
I actually prefer that over TNG in a lot of ways so yeah I'm I've watched the hell out

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.640
of it so there's not a problem I I was I was really not sure what direction to go TNG

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:05.800
I lean heavily toss I definitely had to consider I mean it's the original the reason I'm not

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:10.400
doing toss is there's already a really great podcast out there that's talking about toss

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.880
mission log I mentioned them before and I don't want to step on their thing and it's

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:21.040
their whole show and but I need to I need to bring DS9 back into my life as a Star Trek

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:26.540
fan I go through these cycles of Star Trek re-ingestation where I reprocess and re-watch

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:31.600
and re-understand and I am now at that point with deep space 9 and I need to do it in order

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.480
so I'm in for this the long haul as long as the audience and you are so if you guys can

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:39.520
stick with it every single week I'm up for another episode I have I can somehow manage

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:45.000
to watch one episode of DS9 on Netflix between now and next week I can make that happen you

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.240
can make that commitment right yeah I can do it I can do it I'm you know I don't remember

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.400
it was a good episode you got like some bored cube action in there you got Jean-Luc in there

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:58.600
right there's a it's a very and it's really setting the pace for that first season yeah

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:03.040
so we'll see how it goes we'll see how you guys respond to that and and I know I said

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.520
I'd give you some more of my thoughts on the GCW zero but honestly I just haven't had much

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:12.200
time to play with it since last I did play with a little more and kind of waiting to

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:16.800
see my wife really likes it she thought it was really awesome she thought it was like

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.340
she said I think her words were like it looks like a much more modern DS or something she

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:24.240
said it looks really good so I'm gonna see how my kids react to it too because they haven't

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.400
really done a lot of controller stuff so maybe the next week or so we'll do a little chat

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:34.360
about the GCW zero sounds good alright so I'm gonna bring us through a close then if

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:38.120
you want to email the show you can do that just email Linux action show at Jupiter broadcasting

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:42.880
dot com we'll be watching that also you can submit things to our subreddit over at Linux

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:48.740
action show dot reddit dot com and that's a that's probably your best out of all of

01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:51.960
your resources that's probably the best way to get something in front of us you can always

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:56.460
hang out in our IRC room too of course and join us there and chat with us and don't forget

01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:01.660
to join us live and subscribe and download and if you're near an iTunes machine we could

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:05.120
use the help a little bit there too absolutely alright Matt we'll have a great week I'll

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:08.720
see you on Sunday sounds good see you then alright everyone well thank you so much for

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:31.280
tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.
