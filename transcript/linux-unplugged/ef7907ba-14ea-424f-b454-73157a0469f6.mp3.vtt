WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.020
I gotta imagine some of you out there are VLC users.

00:03.020 --> 00:04.300
I think it's important that everybody knows

00:04.300 --> 00:07.280
that VLC just released version 3.07,

00:07.280 --> 00:09.680
which is sort of a minor feature update,

00:09.680 --> 00:11.840
but the release is special in another way

00:11.840 --> 00:14.240
because it has the most security issues

00:14.240 --> 00:17.180
that have ever been fixed in any version of VLC ever.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.140
Yeah, that's right.

00:18.140 --> 00:19.240
And actually it's kind of neat

00:19.240 --> 00:22.120
because this high number of security issues

00:22.120 --> 00:25.560
is due to the sponsoring of a bug bounty program

00:25.560 --> 00:28.200
funded by the European Commission.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.420
The two most important issues are an out-of-bound right

00:31.420 --> 00:34.520
and a classic stack buffer overflow.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.560
And there's a couple of mediums in there

00:36.560 --> 00:39.120
and some low ones in there as well.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.600
A couple of them only affect actually version 4 of VLC,

00:41.600 --> 00:43.480
but either way, probably worth making sure

00:43.480 --> 00:44.320
you got the latest version

00:44.320 --> 00:45.600
because you don't want to download something.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.000
Yeah, especially if you happen to throw

00:47.000 --> 00:49.080
strange media files at that application.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.280
Yeah, you know, I also saw this week

00:51.280 --> 00:53.240
that Ubuntu Mate announced they're switching

00:53.240 --> 00:55.540
to GNOME MPV for their media player.

00:55.540 --> 00:57.960
If you haven't tried out MPV, I mean, I love VLC

00:57.960 --> 01:00.840
and it's great and that's a super great project,

01:00.840 --> 01:02.640
but MPV is wonderful too.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.160
And GNOME MPV is simple.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.840
Just a nice, easy wrapper on top.

01:05.840 --> 01:06.680
I love it.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.840
So if you haven't checked out MPV in a while,

01:08.840 --> 01:09.960
why not this week?

01:09.960 --> 01:10.800
Give it a go.

01:12.020 --> 01:17.020
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 305 for June 11th, 2019.

01:17.020 --> 01:31.420
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show

01:31.420 --> 01:34.260
that I'm pretty sure got trolled this week.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.220
My name is Chris.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.420
My name is Wes, and I mean, if not that,

01:37.420 --> 01:39.660
then we might be kind of inadequate.

01:39.660 --> 01:42.980
Thanks, Wes, at least as a team though, right?

01:42.980 --> 01:43.820
So that's good.

01:43.820 --> 01:44.660
That's right.

01:44.660 --> 01:46.340
Yeah, we all got a little trolled this week.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.620
We'll tell you about our attempt

01:49.620 --> 01:51.500
at giving resilient Linux,

01:51.500 --> 01:56.500
the indestructible Debian-based Linux, a try.

01:57.740 --> 01:59.820
We only got so far, hence the trolling.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.460
But we also have a bunch of community news,

02:01.460 --> 02:04.860
including OpenSUSE is looking at renaming.

02:04.860 --> 02:08.760
Firefox is considering a premium paid edition.

02:08.760 --> 02:09.600
Say what?

02:09.600 --> 02:11.300
Yeah, I'm curious to see if you'd pay for that.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.780
Plus we've got some feedback

02:12.780 --> 02:13.940
and we've got some pics this week,

02:13.940 --> 02:15.860
but before we get to any of that, Wes,

02:15.860 --> 02:17.820
we've got to bring in Cheese and Elle.

02:17.820 --> 02:18.640
Hello, Cheese and Elle.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.480
How are you?

02:19.480 --> 02:20.300
Hey, hey.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.140
Hey, hey.

02:21.140 --> 02:21.960
Thank you for joining.

02:21.960 --> 02:22.800
We've got a lot to get to,

02:22.800 --> 02:24.780
so let's also bring in that virtual log time.

02:24.780 --> 02:26.000
Appropriate greetings.

02:26.000 --> 02:26.840
Mumble room.

02:26.840 --> 02:27.660
Hello.

02:27.660 --> 02:28.500
Hello.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.340
Hello.

02:29.340 --> 02:30.160
Hello.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.000
Hello, it's so good to talk to you

02:31.000 --> 02:33.060
for the very first time right now.

02:33.060 --> 02:34.800
I have never talked to you before this very moment,

02:34.800 --> 02:36.180
obviously, of course.

02:36.180 --> 02:39.140
So it's good to see you in there, Brent and Bruce and Carl.

02:39.140 --> 02:40.420
Drewbert, Matt's in there.

02:40.420 --> 02:41.780
Minimech, Skull Leader took a break

02:41.780 --> 02:42.900
from leading all the Skulls.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.520
And of course, Tech Mav in there,

02:44.520 --> 02:46.220
as well as Dave and Rotten,

02:46.220 --> 02:48.940
and the bros up in quiet listening.

02:48.940 --> 02:50.340
Aren't we happy to see you all?

02:50.340 --> 02:51.180
It is.

02:51.180 --> 02:52.020
It is really nice to see you.

02:52.020 --> 02:52.840
It's a good crowd.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.680
It's a good crowd.

02:53.680 --> 02:54.520
So let's kick things off

02:54.520 --> 02:55.620
with something I just mentioned there.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.820
This seems like a big story that's unfolding.

02:57.820 --> 02:59.080
A lot is still up in the air.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.260
It's early days.

03:00.260 --> 03:01.740
And the takeaway headline that people

03:01.740 --> 03:03.740
are really talking about over at LWN

03:03.740 --> 03:07.220
is that OpenSUSE is looking at potentially renaming.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.680
Wes, you would agree that the hardest thing about a project,

03:10.680 --> 03:12.100
no matter if it's a software project

03:12.100 --> 03:14.020
or a media project, is the name.

03:14.020 --> 03:14.860
Oh yeah, I mean, heck,

03:14.860 --> 03:16.340
I just struggle with variable names.

03:16.340 --> 03:19.100
But right, we want names to represent us.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.620
They're a big part of how we identify

03:20.620 --> 03:22.460
and how we present ourselves to the world.

03:22.460 --> 03:24.700
And that means everyone has to disagree.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.580
Yeah, that's so true.

03:26.580 --> 03:27.660
That is really true.

03:27.660 --> 03:29.580
And when I heard this story first,

03:29.580 --> 03:31.420
my first reaction was, what?

03:31.420 --> 03:33.700
Like, OpenSUSE, they're like established.

03:33.700 --> 03:34.980
It's not the first one I would have thought.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.300
Why are they renaming?

03:36.300 --> 03:39.660
Well, this is actually all part of a larger conversation

03:39.660 --> 03:41.660
that's happening in OpenSUSE

03:41.660 --> 03:43.820
as they look to define their independence.

03:43.820 --> 03:45.540
And instead of us telling you about it,

03:45.540 --> 03:48.260
I thought we would just kind of go inside

03:48.260 --> 03:49.380
one of the board meetings.

03:49.380 --> 03:51.660
Richard Brown, the OpenSUSE chairman, breaks it down

03:51.660 --> 03:52.860
in a board meeting that, thankfully,

03:52.860 --> 03:54.460
they had audio recording.

03:54.460 --> 03:55.520
And so we're going to play that for you.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.280
Sort of conference board meeting.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.260
Last year, we had a whole bunch of topics

04:00.260 --> 04:02.920
and we kind of rambled on about all of them

04:02.920 --> 04:04.500
for the better part of an hour

04:04.500 --> 04:06.660
and then had questions at the end.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.300
This one is a little bit different

04:08.300 --> 04:09.860
because if you've been kind of keeping up

04:09.860 --> 04:11.540
with the mailing lists,

04:11.540 --> 04:12.860
there's pretty much only one topic

04:12.860 --> 04:15.260
that's on the board's mind at the moment.

04:15.260 --> 04:19.100
This idea of a foundation or some legal structure.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.500
An OpenSUSE foundation.

04:22.500 --> 04:26.060
A need for a legal structure under the distribution.

04:26.060 --> 04:26.880
And you might wonder,

04:26.880 --> 04:28.180
what are some of the main drivers of that?

04:28.180 --> 04:29.380
Well, they'll tell you.

04:29.380 --> 04:33.900
What we've noticed in organizing the last conferences,

04:35.340 --> 04:38.180
but as well in sponsoring other projects

04:38.180 --> 04:40.260
or receiving money from sponsors,

04:40.260 --> 04:44.500
it is an issue that the OpenSUSE community

04:44.500 --> 04:47.760
has no legal entity behind it.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.440
And if there is a company, for example,

04:50.440 --> 04:53.900
that wants to sponsor us or we as a community think

04:53.900 --> 04:55.380
this project is beneficial

04:55.380 --> 04:57.100
and we want to donate some money for it,

04:57.100 --> 04:58.740
we just can't do it at the moment.

05:00.020 --> 05:03.860
Just for legal and as well for tax reasons.

05:03.860 --> 05:08.420
So the idea is now let's put a legal structure

05:08.420 --> 05:10.820
in behind of OpenSUSE.

05:10.820 --> 05:15.820
So you want a legal structure that is behind OpenSUSE,

05:15.920 --> 05:18.860
but if you're using the SUSE trademark and brand,

05:18.860 --> 05:22.260
there are tons of restrictions that come along with that.

05:22.260 --> 05:24.820
And so that's something they're beginning to be

05:24.820 --> 05:26.140
a little concerned about.

05:26.140 --> 05:27.380
I mean, you could see how there would be

05:27.380 --> 05:30.260
some impedance mismatches between a company

05:30.260 --> 05:31.100
and what they need to do

05:31.100 --> 05:32.380
and how they're trying to represent themselves

05:32.380 --> 05:33.480
and an open source project

05:33.480 --> 05:35.860
with maybe totally different aims in some communities.

05:35.860 --> 05:38.940
Yeah, but today there's alignment

05:38.940 --> 05:41.300
between what SUSE, the parent company wants

05:41.300 --> 05:42.500
and what OpenSUSE is trying to do.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.100
There's alignment and they're very supportive.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.780
Five years from now, will that be true?

05:47.780 --> 05:51.220
How will that work if SUSE is sold to another company?

05:51.220 --> 05:53.300
You know, imagine like a Microsoft or an Oracle

05:53.300 --> 05:55.600
were to buy the SUSE division for their cloud.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.980
Then where does OpenSUSE fit in that picture?

05:58.980 --> 06:02.180
So having a separate legal entity is a really good idea,

06:02.180 --> 06:04.300
but you run into all these trademark issues.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.060
And that's where the name issue comes up.

06:06.060 --> 06:08.780
It's well, maybe we need to call it something else.

06:08.780 --> 06:10.200
And I don't know where they're gonna go with this.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.580
They say the primary motivation for the name change

06:12.580 --> 06:14.180
as described by Richard Brown,

06:14.180 --> 06:17.100
is that OpenSUSE that contains the words SUSE,

06:17.100 --> 06:19.260
the company will have to retain a significant amount

06:19.260 --> 06:21.980
of control over what the foundation could do

06:21.980 --> 06:26.240
with its own name and likewise the distribution.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.640
The other consequences of the current trademark situation

06:28.640 --> 06:31.020
Brown said is that OpenSUSE says board spends

06:31.020 --> 06:32.540
a significant amount of its time

06:32.540 --> 06:34.460
dealing with trademark issues

06:34.460 --> 06:37.080
to the detriment of the rest of the project.

06:37.080 --> 06:37.920
Yeah, okay.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.760
Didn't realize that.

06:38.760 --> 06:39.580
Wasting a bunch of time.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.500
No, I wouldn't have imagined that at all.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.160
Unsurprisingly, others in the group,

06:43.160 --> 06:45.220
other board members feel that the name change

06:45.220 --> 06:46.780
would be a bad idea.

06:46.780 --> 06:49.660
Some say it would cause the distribution to lose its users.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.860
Some say the brand is the most important part

06:51.860 --> 06:53.540
of keeping the distribution alive.

06:53.540 --> 06:56.420
Throwing it away means throwing away the distribution.

06:56.420 --> 06:57.900
I think that's a strong statement.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.540
I mean, you could see it though, right?

06:59.540 --> 07:01.060
If you weren't already interested and you didn't,

07:01.060 --> 07:02.540
you maybe knew what SUSE was,

07:02.540 --> 07:04.620
but you didn't really know what this other non-branded

07:04.620 --> 07:05.960
or new name project,

07:05.960 --> 07:07.120
are you gonna check that off on a list

07:07.120 --> 07:08.980
even if it's up on DistroWatch?

07:08.980 --> 07:09.820
I don't know.

07:09.820 --> 07:12.180
Yeah, it just could become yet another Linux distribution.

07:12.180 --> 07:14.180
Versus a route of, oh, SUSE, interesting,

07:14.180 --> 07:15.660
I see their name or their products or.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.660
There's a historical legacy here.

07:17.660 --> 07:19.060
What do you think about this, Cheesy?

07:19.060 --> 07:19.900
Yeah, you know, I mean,

07:19.900 --> 07:22.660
I think this is a great step for SUSE, OpenSUSE,

07:22.660 --> 07:26.620
to kind of pull themselves out of that SUSE umbrella.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.180
This is a good opportunity for them

07:28.180 --> 07:32.980
to maybe, you know, be funded and have a few projects

07:32.980 --> 07:36.100
that they really focus on to bring to the community.

07:36.100 --> 07:39.020
So I think this could be a good thing for them.

07:39.020 --> 07:42.740
You know, whenever you change brands, names, logos,

07:42.740 --> 07:46.220
titles, colors, you're always gonna get backlash.

07:47.860 --> 07:51.780
It is kind of important for them to pick a name

07:51.780 --> 07:53.820
that represents them well.

07:53.820 --> 07:57.080
But I think that the majority of the OpenSUSE users

07:57.080 --> 08:00.700
are going to migrate over to whatever it is they call it.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.340
I mean, if they call it ketchup,

08:02.340 --> 08:03.500
people are still gonna use it

08:03.500 --> 08:05.340
because it used to be OpenSUSE

08:05.340 --> 08:07.260
and that's what they're used to.

08:07.260 --> 08:10.100
So, you know, I think it's a good step for them

08:10.100 --> 08:12.660
to kind of pull themselves out from that umbrella,

08:12.660 --> 08:15.740
that SUSE umbrella, remove all that branding,

08:15.740 --> 08:18.500
you know, kind of like what Fedora has done, right?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.480
Yeah, they argue that Fedora was harmed

08:20.480 --> 08:21.320
by their name change,

08:21.320 --> 08:23.740
but I see it more the way you're seeing it.

08:23.740 --> 08:26.220
It would actually, to me, be an advantage for them.

08:26.220 --> 08:28.060
And there's another way around this.

08:28.060 --> 08:30.780
There's a middle ground they may be able to tread here.

08:30.780 --> 08:32.540
They may get away with coming up

08:32.540 --> 08:36.540
with something like the Green Lizard Foundation

08:36.540 --> 08:38.140
for the name of the foundation.

08:39.180 --> 08:41.900
And then OpenSUSE is what the foundation takes care of.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.180
And then if the need ever came along

08:44.180 --> 08:45.500
to change the name of the distribution

08:45.500 --> 08:48.220
because of what the parent company was up to,

08:48.220 --> 08:50.260
then the foundation name would be established by that point

08:50.260 --> 08:51.900
and everybody would know, oh yeah, that's the same thing.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.780
You at least already have a strong association

08:53.780 --> 08:57.140
and you could pivot then to put all your eggs in one basket.

08:57.140 --> 08:57.980
Right. Right now.

08:57.980 --> 08:59.360
Those are lizard eggs, to be clear.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.200
Sure.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.380
And you avoid all those trademark entanglements

09:02.380 --> 09:05.500
by calling it the Green Lizard Foundation or whatever it is.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.340
So that seems like a middle ground that could go here

09:07.340 --> 09:08.180
that we might see.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.680
It also seems like at this point, no one really agrees.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.660
I guess it's early days for the conversation.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.380
It is neat though that we, I mean,

09:14.380 --> 09:17.660
we get to watch this from afar as it's all playing out.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.980
Elle, would you install open ketchup on your laptop?

09:19.980 --> 09:23.980
You know, it might just get a little messy.

09:23.980 --> 09:24.820
It already does.

09:24.820 --> 09:27.500
So, nice, nice.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.580
Well, there's one element that would remain the same

09:29.580 --> 09:33.900
and that is SUSE's involvement in picking the chairman

09:33.900 --> 09:35.420
that runs the whole thing.

09:35.420 --> 09:38.700
At the moment, if you look at the Wiki page for OpenSUSE,

09:38.700 --> 09:41.660
there is the existing rules

09:41.660 --> 09:44.180
that we define how the board is elected.

09:44.180 --> 09:47.660
There is the existing rules for how members,

09:47.660 --> 09:48.480
well, who can be a member

09:48.480 --> 09:50.300
that Richard needs to put back there.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.060
But basically the idea is,

09:54.060 --> 09:56.300
without having gone through a lawyer yet,

09:56.300 --> 09:59.300
fundamentally we don't want that structure to change.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.740
The chairman will still be appointed by SUSE.

10:01.740 --> 10:03.660
The board will still be voted by the members

10:03.660 --> 10:05.380
in the same way it is now.

10:05.380 --> 10:08.700
Now, that is also possible

10:08.700 --> 10:09.740
that if the members of the board

10:09.740 --> 10:11.940
don't like the chairman being appointed by SUSE,

10:11.940 --> 10:12.900
they can vote to change it.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.740
So that is still an option to them.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.060
And it's not something Richard Brown asked for,

10:17.060 --> 10:18.140
but that's how it's gonna work.

10:18.140 --> 10:20.020
And I have the policy linked in the show notes

10:20.020 --> 10:21.180
if you wanna see it.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.580
The way the board election rules work

10:22.580 --> 10:26.220
is the chairman is appointed by SUSE.

10:26.220 --> 10:27.500
So there's still some connection there.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.700
Yeah, but I mean, I guess that could also be a good thing.

10:29.700 --> 10:30.520
It could change too.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.360
There's a certain amount of involvement

10:31.360 --> 10:32.860
right from the parent organization

10:32.860 --> 10:34.860
saying that they care about what's happening there.

10:34.860 --> 10:35.780
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

10:35.780 --> 10:37.580
They wanna make sure, you could argue that, exactly.

10:37.580 --> 10:38.460
You could argue they wanna make sure

10:38.460 --> 10:40.660
the mission is carried out or whatever.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.220
We'll let you know.

10:43.220 --> 10:44.300
If they come up with a new name

10:44.300 --> 10:46.100
or if they get a foundation established,

10:46.100 --> 10:46.940
we'll let you know.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.540
I mean, Red Hat has CentOS,

10:48.540 --> 10:50.860
so maybe SUSE could have $OS.

10:50.860 --> 10:53.700
Yeah, something like that.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.540
I was thinking it's kind of like the opposite

10:55.540 --> 10:58.660
of the CentOS situation where CentOS,

10:58.660 --> 11:00.440
well, actually, not really.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.520
CentOS is based on RHEL.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.460
OpenSUSE, or at least OpenSUSE Leap,

11:05.460 --> 11:10.220
is based on their enterprise distribution,

11:10.220 --> 11:13.120
OpenSUSE or SUSE desktop, enterprise desktop.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.720
So there is a lot of similarity there

11:14.720 --> 11:18.100
where CentOS is connected but rebranded.

11:19.020 --> 11:22.220
It's not like the first time we've seen this trademark issue.

11:22.220 --> 11:23.920
This isn't like an unknown thing.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.460
I think my biggest takeaway was is

11:25.460 --> 11:28.740
I'm kind of surprised SUSE is at this stage right now,

11:28.740 --> 11:31.660
but they kind of have a unique situation too.

11:31.660 --> 11:32.500
And there is a part of me,

11:32.500 --> 11:35.060
like it seems like if SUSE was huge,

11:35.060 --> 11:37.200
like if it was a blowaway success,

11:37.200 --> 11:39.060
these issues would have been long resolved.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.260
Yeah, yeah, it is interesting

11:40.260 --> 11:41.740
that we're kind of hitting them right now.

11:41.740 --> 11:44.660
It speaks both to its success and to its relative size.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.740
Yeah.

11:45.740 --> 11:47.700
Now, speaking of foundations,

11:47.700 --> 11:49.820
the Matrix Foundation has been formed,

11:49.820 --> 11:52.620
along with Matrix 1.0.

11:52.620 --> 11:56.940
Now, I know some of you may not be Matrix users right now.

11:56.940 --> 11:59.500
Just as a quick reminder, it's an open source project

11:59.500 --> 12:02.860
that creates an open source standard

12:02.860 --> 12:06.200
for secure, decentralized, real-time communication.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.860
And it's like Slack plus 10 all under the Apache license.

12:10.860 --> 12:11.940
Yeah, I like to think of it as like a,

12:11.940 --> 12:15.220
it is kind of, it is like a matrix or like a web mesh,

12:15.220 --> 12:18.580
a signaling standard for the internet in the modern era.

12:18.580 --> 12:19.420
Yeah, because you could use it

12:19.420 --> 12:22.380
for so much more than just basic communications.

12:22.380 --> 12:23.800
It's such a cool project.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.180
And so that's why it's really exciting too

12:25.180 --> 12:28.640
that they've just released version 1.0.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.760
I remember talking to the team five years ago

12:31.760 --> 12:34.140
when they just launched this thing

12:34.140 --> 12:37.460
and they've finally now reached 1.0 and exited beta.

12:37.460 --> 12:39.140
That's fantastic news.

12:39.140 --> 12:41.540
It probably means if you haven't already tried Matrix

12:41.540 --> 12:42.560
or some other stuff,

12:42.560 --> 12:45.460
like you can get the Riot 1.0 app going

12:45.460 --> 12:48.580
and try it out that way, maybe run a server yourself.

12:48.580 --> 12:49.820
Now's a great time to try.

12:49.820 --> 12:52.700
We've got some integrations even in the JB Telegram chat.

12:53.900 --> 12:57.780
Yep, and the System76 Pop OS community is using it.

12:57.780 --> 13:00.460
So when you want pop in there, you can chat with people.

13:00.460 --> 13:01.660
I think this is really, this is great.

13:01.660 --> 13:04.260
This is a huge milestone and-

13:04.260 --> 13:06.180
I mean, it really does take a lot to get this far.

13:06.180 --> 13:07.620
Five years is a long time to keep working

13:07.620 --> 13:09.980
on the same project and calling it 1.0, right?

13:09.980 --> 13:11.020
They're making it a big deal.

13:11.020 --> 13:13.580
They're saying this is stable, self-consistent,

13:13.580 --> 13:15.900
self-contained, ready for use.

13:15.900 --> 13:16.940
That's big.

13:16.940 --> 13:19.700
That means it's ready for the enterprise,

13:19.700 --> 13:22.100
it's ready to compete with Slack and much, much more.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.060
And then to combine it with the announcement

13:24.060 --> 13:25.940
of the foundation, which we've known is coming,

13:25.940 --> 13:28.640
it's been in the works for a long time,

13:28.640 --> 13:31.200
but they're doing it in such a great way.

13:32.060 --> 13:34.700
As of today, they've finalized the foundation,

13:34.700 --> 13:36.340
as of like today, the day we're recording.

13:36.340 --> 13:39.180
Everything's been finalized and all of the assets

13:39.180 --> 13:42.300
for matrix.org have been transferred from New Vector,

13:42.300 --> 13:45.260
which was the startup they formed in 2017 for the project,

13:45.260 --> 13:46.100
for the core team.

13:47.180 --> 13:48.480
They've transferred all of the assets

13:48.480 --> 13:50.900
from that startup to the foundation.

13:50.900 --> 13:51.740
Whoa.

13:51.740 --> 13:52.580
Yeah.

13:52.580 --> 13:53.400
Interesting.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.240
They're going all in.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.160
That is, yeah, that is a sign right at the start

13:56.160 --> 13:57.100
that this is legit.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.660
But they don't stop there.

13:58.660 --> 13:59.900
You ready for this?

13:59.900 --> 14:01.820
They've also created

14:01.820 --> 14:05.620
guardians of the matrix.org foundation.

14:05.620 --> 14:06.460
Amazing.

14:06.460 --> 14:07.420
How about this?

14:07.420 --> 14:09.100
The guardians are legal directors

14:09.100 --> 14:10.700
of the nonprofit foundation

14:10.700 --> 14:13.540
and are responsible for ensuring that the foundation,

14:13.540 --> 14:17.780
and by extension, the spec core team keeps on mission

14:17.780 --> 14:22.140
and neutrally protects the development of matrix.

14:22.140 --> 14:24.340
And they've started the foundation

14:24.340 --> 14:25.760
with five of these guardians,

14:25.760 --> 14:29.020
two of which are the original founders of matrix,

14:29.020 --> 14:32.420
and the other three are entirely independent,

14:32.420 --> 14:35.700
which they say ensures the original matrix team

14:35.700 --> 14:37.920
forms a minority,

14:37.920 --> 14:41.000
which can be kept in check by the rest of the guardians.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.140
Well, that's an interesting governance structure.

14:43.140 --> 14:43.980
Yeah.

14:45.060 --> 14:46.580
That's pretty humble,

14:46.580 --> 14:48.440
to create something like this,

14:48.440 --> 14:50.020
to birth something like this,

14:50.020 --> 14:53.940
to have this be your passion for years,

14:53.940 --> 14:57.460
and then to cede full control like that over.

14:57.460 --> 15:00.200
It's like an anti-Zuckerberg, is that how it works?

15:00.200 --> 15:03.380
It's exactly what something like matrix needs to have.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.780
Like they've really honed in on the audience.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.740
They've really got it figured out.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.860
And this is the kind of long-term arrangements

15:09.860 --> 15:11.940
that could make this thing like the glue

15:11.940 --> 15:13.460
that we need it to be.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.620
I find this to be really exciting.

15:15.620 --> 15:19.700
I think this is a very important project.

15:19.700 --> 15:23.500
And I can't wait to see like all the applications

15:23.500 --> 15:24.980
like Riot and other ones built off of it

15:24.980 --> 15:25.820
just get better and better.

15:25.820 --> 15:28.340
Now that it's 1.0 and it's a stable API,

15:28.340 --> 15:29.740
it's a self-contained project,

15:29.740 --> 15:32.060
it's ready to be built off of.

15:32.060 --> 15:35.020
Matrix.org, it is still a little bit difficult

15:35.020 --> 15:37.420
to search for, but they have a great domain name.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.460
Yeah, that's true.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.300
Yeah, it is a lot of foundations these days.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.740
Like we need like a foundation bingo game or something

15:44.740 --> 15:47.420
because we've got a lot of foundations.

15:47.420 --> 15:49.500
I thought, I don't know, I thought we'd have like

15:49.500 --> 15:51.660
some meta foundations and people would work under those

15:51.660 --> 15:55.620
like the Conservancy and whatnot, but nope, nope.

15:55.620 --> 15:57.940
No, we're just gonna have all the foundations, I guess.

15:57.940 --> 16:01.180
But congratulations to them, 1.0 is huge.

16:01.180 --> 16:04.380
Okay, now I'm curious to know your take on this next one.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.820
I'd like to know the Mumble Room's take on this too.

16:07.740 --> 16:10.740
Firefox Premium, if it were to launch later this year.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.140
Now we have very little details,

16:12.140 --> 16:15.780
so we're gonna do a little guessing here.

16:15.780 --> 16:17.180
Speculation, you know.

16:17.180 --> 16:20.620
The CEO of Mozilla, Chris Beard, revealed the plans

16:20.620 --> 16:22.580
in a conversation with a German media outlet,

16:22.580 --> 16:25.340
T3N, through a stream.

16:25.340 --> 16:27.700
It sounds like Mozilla will make a privacy

16:27.700 --> 16:30.500
and security feature service available.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.380
And one would probably be correct to assume

16:33.380 --> 16:35.060
that it will include their VPN partner

16:35.060 --> 16:37.460
amongst other things that they already have.

16:37.460 --> 16:41.020
And in details that we got in an update,

16:41.020 --> 16:42.020
there's a quote that reads,

16:42.020 --> 16:44.520
"'We'll probably launch some new services first

16:44.520 --> 16:46.520
"'and then we'll think carefully about which bottle

16:46.520 --> 16:49.540
"'makes the most sense while ensuring the best user safety.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.220
"'Firefox and MIDI security features and services

16:52.220 --> 16:54.980
"'like enhanced tracking protection will still be free.'"

16:55.980 --> 16:57.460
Beyond that, we've got little details.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.620
So we don't really know where the line's gonna be.

16:59.620 --> 17:00.980
But if you have Firefox Premium,

17:00.980 --> 17:05.060
then what's Firefox non-premium, Firefox standard?

17:05.060 --> 17:05.900
Substandard.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.100
Firefox free, Firefox basic?

17:08.100 --> 17:09.300
Maybe just Firefox.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.820
I think that it's a possibility

17:10.820 --> 17:12.980
that this is going to be just a weird branding

17:12.980 --> 17:13.820
that they've been doing.

17:13.820 --> 17:16.220
So they have Firefox Monitor and Firefox Sandwich

17:16.220 --> 17:18.980
have nothing to do with Firefox itself.

17:18.980 --> 17:20.680
And that this might be like premium service

17:20.680 --> 17:24.260
in the sense of like, hopefully in the same kind of vein

17:24.260 --> 17:26.020
that the Librem One stuff is.

17:26.020 --> 17:27.260
That's what I was wondering.

17:27.260 --> 17:30.260
And if Mozilla came around and kind of offered

17:30.260 --> 17:34.160
the same suite of services that Librem One is offering,

17:34.160 --> 17:36.580
I'd probably be more inclined to buy it from Mozilla.

17:36.580 --> 17:37.680
What about you?

17:37.680 --> 17:38.520
Oh yeah, absolutely.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.740
If Mozilla was the one doing it,

17:39.740 --> 17:42.300
that's when I first heard Librem One was announced,

17:42.300 --> 17:45.220
I was like, I mean, that's a great idea,

17:45.220 --> 17:47.300
but I'd be more comfortable if another organization

17:47.300 --> 17:50.220
has have a bigger backing and has been around longer

17:50.220 --> 17:51.220
to be doing it.

17:51.220 --> 17:53.580
And one of the examples I gave was Mozilla.

17:53.580 --> 17:56.140
Right, because they have a wider interest

17:56.140 --> 17:57.740
in keeping the web open too.

17:57.740 --> 17:58.580
Yeah, right.

17:58.580 --> 17:59.780
I mean, they're already running services.

17:59.780 --> 18:02.460
They've just been doing more of the password stuff, right?

18:02.460 --> 18:04.860
So they have a long history of keeping user data.

18:04.860 --> 18:07.700
I also wouldn't mind coming up with a way

18:07.700 --> 18:09.780
to directly contribute to Mozilla.

18:09.780 --> 18:10.860
So that was gonna be my answer.

18:10.860 --> 18:12.900
If this was some sort of premium browser,

18:12.900 --> 18:14.100
I might still pay for it,

18:14.100 --> 18:15.460
probably not for any sort of features,

18:15.460 --> 18:17.300
but just as a way to have an easy way to just like,

18:17.300 --> 18:19.060
hey, Mozilla, here's some money, thank you.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.940
I have over the years just bought like a t-shirt

18:21.940 --> 18:23.900
or I'll buy like a, I bought a backpack,

18:23.900 --> 18:25.860
which I've used for like a decade now.

18:25.860 --> 18:26.700
Well, you got that.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.700
Yeah, yeah, it's time to replace that backpack too.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.540
Like over the years, I've just bought Swag to support them.

18:32.540 --> 18:36.500
And I encourage them looking for viable,

18:36.500 --> 18:39.380
sustainable revenue models that get them off

18:39.380 --> 18:41.100
the search engine bandwagon,

18:41.100 --> 18:42.980
cause that's how they're making money right now.

18:42.980 --> 18:44.460
And that's not a good idea long-term

18:44.460 --> 18:46.500
for what they wanna do for the web

18:46.500 --> 18:47.940
and for where they want their leverage,

18:47.940 --> 18:49.540
they need to get off that sauce.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.940
Brent, I can't remember if you're a Firefox or Chrome user,

18:51.940 --> 18:53.060
but what would your thoughts be

18:53.060 --> 18:54.780
on somebody who travels a lot,

18:54.780 --> 18:56.900
if you got a VPN service and a couple other things,

18:56.900 --> 18:57.980
would you pay for it?

18:57.980 --> 19:01.260
And would you wanna go through somebody like Mozilla

19:01.260 --> 19:03.020
or would you do like what I'm doing right now?

19:03.020 --> 19:04.900
I have an air VPN subscription, for example,

19:04.900 --> 19:07.580
that's my VPN provider, no affiliation or anything,

19:07.580 --> 19:09.500
it's just who I use right now.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.420
And I kind of trust them to do a better job at that.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.940
I'm curious what your thoughts are.

19:12.940 --> 19:15.140
I would say my first reaction to seeing this last night

19:15.140 --> 19:19.740
was like, oh no, like the model for a browser

19:19.740 --> 19:21.140
that I use every single day is changing

19:21.140 --> 19:22.620
and what does that mean?

19:22.620 --> 19:24.580
But now hearing a few of your perspectives,

19:24.580 --> 19:26.260
I think that, wow, yeah,

19:26.260 --> 19:29.900
we definitely should have an easier way to support Mozilla.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.620
They're certainly a group of people

19:32.620 --> 19:35.660
that I've really believed in for a decade now,

19:35.660 --> 19:37.100
can you say that?

19:37.100 --> 19:39.220
And so if they're coming out with some products like VPNs

19:39.220 --> 19:40.700
and things like that,

19:40.700 --> 19:42.820
I actually think I would be first to trust them

19:42.820 --> 19:46.180
over even some dedicated VPN providers,

19:46.180 --> 19:49.100
simply because they've built so much trust

19:49.100 --> 19:51.300
around the internet and the open source community

19:51.300 --> 19:53.340
in the last many, many years.

19:53.340 --> 19:55.180
So I think it's a good thing.

19:55.180 --> 19:56.300
If it goes that direction,

19:56.300 --> 19:58.420
I mean, we're gonna have to wait for some details, right?

19:58.420 --> 20:00.220
We know that the VPN is more than likely

20:00.220 --> 20:02.260
going to be using the Proton VPN

20:02.260 --> 20:04.100
because there was a partnership announcement

20:04.100 --> 20:05.540
last year sometime,

20:05.540 --> 20:07.940
where they were gonna be doing something with Proton.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.300
Though, I mean, as far as trusting them,

20:10.300 --> 20:13.020
if people trust Proton Mail, that's a good option.

20:13.020 --> 20:13.860
Yeah, fair point.

20:13.860 --> 20:14.700
It does seem like that.

20:14.700 --> 20:17.180
That would be the most likely service provider that goes.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.020
So that's a fair point.

20:19.020 --> 20:21.020
I think looking at this whole thing in totality,

20:21.020 --> 20:23.180
the thing in the back of my mind is,

20:23.180 --> 20:27.020
I've had some questionable moments when I watch Mozilla

20:27.020 --> 20:29.060
and some of the decisions they've made even like this year

20:29.060 --> 20:29.900
or in the last year,

20:29.900 --> 20:31.500
there's been some questionable moments for sure.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.300
And you have to take everything in its totality.

20:34.300 --> 20:38.100
However, I also like to judge people based on their work

20:38.100 --> 20:41.620
and Firefox has been consistently getting better.

20:41.620 --> 20:43.880
They really, truly made a focus.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.580
And Mozilla as an organization

20:45.580 --> 20:48.460
has been making the right moves for both user privacy

20:48.460 --> 20:50.660
and for open web standards now.

20:50.660 --> 20:54.460
And they really haven't deviated on that course.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.580
And so I would actually say,

20:56.580 --> 20:57.780
their trust level in my book

20:57.780 --> 20:59.300
has gone up considerably over the last year.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.140
Isn't that interesting?

21:00.140 --> 21:00.980
Yeah, that is what it is.

21:00.980 --> 21:02.460
We just feel good about them

21:02.460 --> 21:04.140
because we've seen what they do

21:04.140 --> 21:06.500
and believe that they have the right intentions behind them.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.980
I wanna get Elle's perspective, last take on this.

21:08.980 --> 21:11.820
Elle, would you pay like a monthly fee,

21:11.820 --> 21:13.060
like 10 bucks a month,

21:13.060 --> 21:16.300
if you got a Firefox VPN and some other services

21:16.300 --> 21:17.460
and it goes towards Mozilla?

21:17.460 --> 21:19.380
Is that something you'd be interested in actually doing?

21:19.380 --> 21:20.940
I mean, I already pay for their VPN,

21:20.940 --> 21:22.940
so can I just get rolled in?

21:22.940 --> 21:24.060
You're ready to go.

21:24.060 --> 21:24.900
I'm good.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.940
I mean, you know, every time you guys are like,

21:26.940 --> 21:29.220
oh, load up Chrome, I throw a fit.

21:29.220 --> 21:30.620
So I'm already there.

21:30.620 --> 21:31.460
Yeah, that's true.

21:31.460 --> 21:33.900
That is a huge, good point, good point.

21:33.900 --> 21:34.860
All right, very good.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.720
Well, why don't you tell us a little bit

21:36.720 --> 21:39.220
about something pretty amazing that happened recently

21:39.220 --> 21:41.220
at a Hacker Family dinner.

21:41.220 --> 21:42.940
And I think it's something

21:42.940 --> 21:44.340
that the whole audience should hear about.

21:44.340 --> 21:47.580
So this was an event held before B-Sides.

21:47.580 --> 21:50.420
One thing I've gotten into doing is just kind of throwing

21:50.420 --> 21:53.900
a B-Side event next to our large conference,

21:53.900 --> 21:55.340
just to get to know people.

21:55.340 --> 21:58.340
And so I had about 25 people show up

21:58.340 --> 22:00.420
and, you know, we get down to the tables

22:00.420 --> 22:02.020
and this is a family dinner.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.860
People have drinks in their hands

22:03.860 --> 22:06.060
before we even have the table.

22:06.060 --> 22:08.540
Their appetizer's going, everything's great,

22:08.540 --> 22:09.900
we're all talking.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.140
And about an hour and a half in,

22:11.140 --> 22:12.820
the guy next to me turns around and he's like,

22:12.820 --> 22:14.380
hey, Elle, I've got to go.

22:14.380 --> 22:16.100
I'm like, oh, you know, we're going to miss you, bye.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.020
And then he comes back by the table and says,

22:18.020 --> 22:20.420
just let everybody know that up to this point,

22:20.420 --> 22:22.500
I went ahead and took care of the bill.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.020
And it didn't register in my brain.

22:24.020 --> 22:25.460
Like, I thought he was telling me,

22:25.460 --> 22:27.980
hey, I already paid for my food, bye.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.420
And so I was like, okay, have a,

22:29.420 --> 22:31.140
and I didn't even finish the sentence

22:31.140 --> 22:32.820
by the time the guy is gone.

22:32.820 --> 22:36.020
So yeah, it took me a minute and I'm, wait,

22:36.020 --> 22:37.360
I look over at Allie and I said,

22:37.360 --> 22:40.060
did he just say he paid for the meal?

22:40.060 --> 22:42.000
She's like, no, no, he must've meant his.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.820
So I went over to look for the waitress

22:43.820 --> 22:46.820
and she's like, no, he covered the bill.

22:46.820 --> 22:48.520
And I was like, for everyone?

22:48.520 --> 22:49.600
Yes.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.340
All the drinks, appetizers, everything?

22:51.340 --> 22:53.100
And she's looking at me like, are you daft?

22:53.100 --> 22:54.440
Yes.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.940
There were two tables worth of people

22:56.940 --> 23:00.420
and he was out the door before we could even acknowledge it.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.700
I tried to find out how much the bill was

23:02.700 --> 23:06.380
and another waiter was like, no, it was his gift.

23:06.380 --> 23:08.940
And just kind of like cut me off there.

23:08.940 --> 23:12.320
So a very, very special thank you to,

23:12.320 --> 23:14.220
and I'm just gonna call him by his Twitter handles

23:14.220 --> 23:16.900
not to out him for privacy at Jedi Mammoth

23:16.900 --> 23:18.300
for that great gift.

23:18.300 --> 23:19.140
That's so great.

23:19.140 --> 23:19.980
Amazing.

23:19.980 --> 23:21.540
The best community in the world.

23:21.540 --> 23:23.140
And a classy move.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.340
Yeah, that is a really classy move.

23:25.340 --> 23:26.180
And that's another thing,

23:26.180 --> 23:27.800
we've been doing these study groups

23:27.800 --> 23:29.080
which are posted on the Meetup,

23:29.080 --> 23:32.260
but also if we're at an event and like Elle's dinner,

23:32.260 --> 23:33.540
for example, that was on the Meetup page,

23:33.540 --> 23:35.860
meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

23:35.860 --> 23:37.740
Thank you to Jedi Mammoth for doing that.

23:37.740 --> 23:38.580
That's super cool.

23:38.580 --> 23:41.720
He's a interesting individual himself.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.620
I'll put a link to his Twitter profile.

23:44.620 --> 23:46.740
He's, we have the coolest community.

23:46.740 --> 23:47.580
We really do.

23:47.580 --> 23:49.100
He's a very interesting guy.

23:49.100 --> 23:51.380
And I'll put his Twitter profile in there.

23:51.380 --> 23:53.380
Well, that's really great, Elle.

23:53.380 --> 23:55.180
How was all of B-Sides and all of that?

23:55.180 --> 23:56.060
Was that a good event?

23:56.060 --> 23:57.460
It was a lot of fun.

23:57.460 --> 24:00.180
This is the one conference that I really try to stay away

24:00.180 --> 24:02.660
from volunteering so I can just enjoy it.

24:02.660 --> 24:05.060
And every single year I'm trying to figure out

24:05.060 --> 24:07.700
how they make it happen for as little as they pay,

24:07.700 --> 24:09.400
or as they charge for the tickets.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.960
Hmm.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.040
Yeah, and B-Sides, okay, so for those people

24:13.040 --> 24:13.880
that are not familiar,

24:13.880 --> 24:16.640
because it's kind of not fully well-known yet,

24:16.640 --> 24:18.960
B-Sides is happening all of the time,

24:18.960 --> 24:22.040
and it grew out of a larger, more well-known

24:22.040 --> 24:23.400
and more established conference.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.320
So B-Sides grew out of Black Hat.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.720
When Black Hat was going on,

24:27.720 --> 24:30.560
there was only so many talks they could establish

24:30.560 --> 24:32.040
or they could host.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.640
And there was a little bit of arguments

24:33.640 --> 24:36.300
to really how they should pick these talks.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.880
And so a great guy by the name of Chris Nickerson

24:38.880 --> 24:41.600
and a few others, I could miss them all by name,

24:41.600 --> 24:44.280
but of course, because I'm talking, I've forgotten them all,

24:44.280 --> 24:46.920
decided, you know what, we'll rent a mansion.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.320
And in every room, we're gonna have a talk.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.040
And just invited all of the conference speakers

24:52.040 --> 24:54.680
that didn't get accepted to come and give their talks.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.360
And it's just continued to grow.

24:57.360 --> 25:00.400
And last I counted was I think 52

25:00.400 --> 25:03.320
with B-Sides Cairo being the latest one.

25:03.320 --> 25:07.280
And the name comes from running B-Side, a major conference,

25:07.280 --> 25:10.040
or the major conference being the A-side of the record.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.020
The B-side of the record, yeah.

25:12.020 --> 25:14.160
So you're saying, how many are this year?

25:14.160 --> 25:15.360
I think it was 52.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.200
Now I wish I would have looked it up before I got here,

25:17.200 --> 25:18.320
but it's huge.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.080
That is.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.200
It's really neat because it's a good example

25:22.200 --> 25:25.240
of a grassroots community conference.

25:25.240 --> 25:28.240
And the name B-Sides is so good

25:28.240 --> 25:30.240
because it is beside another conference

25:30.240 --> 25:32.080
or it is the B-side of a record.

25:32.080 --> 25:32.920
I love it.

25:32.920 --> 25:36.160
All right, well, we have some things to talk about

25:36.160 --> 25:37.500
in the housekeeping.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.160
First of all, you may have noticed

25:39.160 --> 25:42.240
that the AWS DevOps Professional Certification Exam

25:42.240 --> 25:44.800
has just been updated as they often are.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.680
Well, the good folks over at Linux Academy

25:47.680 --> 25:49.880
have got your back, check it all out.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.800
I'm gonna put a link in the show notes

25:51.800 --> 25:55.520
for a lab and some information about the AWS Developer Suite.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.360
This is a big area right now.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.480
AWS, I'll tell you what, changing like crazy.

25:59.480 --> 26:00.480
Yeah, you gotta stay up to date.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.320
And it's easier this way, let me tell you.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.840
Exactly, so I'll have a link to that.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.180
If you haven't heard BSD Now for a while.

26:08.560 --> 26:09.400
It's hot and fresh.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.680
Hot and fresh.

26:10.680 --> 26:11.640
You know what?

26:11.640 --> 26:12.480
You know what?

26:12.480 --> 26:14.360
This calls for a special moment, don't you think?

26:14.360 --> 26:15.340
You ready for a classic?

26:15.340 --> 26:16.480
You ready for a classic?

26:16.480 --> 26:19.380
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show

26:19.380 --> 26:21.840
that's too busy getting actual work done

26:21.840 --> 26:24.080
to care about what your silly display server.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.040
My name is Alan.

26:25.040 --> 26:25.860
Still hurts.

26:25.860 --> 26:28.700
Yep, but you probably want more Alan Jude, we all do.

26:28.700 --> 26:32.040
Yeah, BSD Now has been refreshed.

26:32.040 --> 26:35.800
Starting with 301, we are recording in a brand new format,

26:35.800 --> 26:40.480
high fidelity audio, and Mr. Drew is editing each show

26:40.480 --> 26:44.440
so we try to fix up as much crosstalk and things like that.

26:44.440 --> 26:47.600
The show is tighter and better than ever.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.480
300 too, congratulations to them.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.520
So go check out BSD Now, I'll have a link to 301,

26:51.520 --> 26:53.200
bsdnow.tv slash 301.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.720
Also, Foss Talk Live happened.

26:56.720 --> 26:59.040
Man, that looked like so much fun, I was jealous.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.760
Yeah, so that's an event that happens across the pond

27:01.760 --> 27:02.840
that we've never really been to,

27:02.840 --> 27:05.880
but it's a night of podcasting, of Linux podcasting.

27:05.880 --> 27:06.840
Live!

27:06.840 --> 27:09.480
And our friends at the Ubuntu Podcast participate

27:09.480 --> 27:12.280
and Late Night Linux and others are all participating

27:12.280 --> 27:14.400
in what is basically just a great night

27:14.400 --> 27:17.520
of Linux podcast geekiness in a nice,

27:17.520 --> 27:19.360
really kind of intimate venue.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.080
It seems like you can find beers there too.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.720
Yeah, rumor has it.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.000
And I believe the first episode from there,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.360
Late Night Linux, is out, and I bet you our friends

27:27.360 --> 27:28.920
over at Ubuntu Podcast have something too.

27:28.920 --> 27:32.920
So check out a link for that or go to Late Night Linux.

27:32.920 --> 27:36.800
Speaking of podcasts, the best 17 seconds

27:36.800 --> 27:39.320
from Texas Linux Fest did indeed make it

27:39.320 --> 27:43.240
into the Friday stream, fridaystream.com, fridaystream.com.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.720
I really, really enjoyed this last episode.

27:45.720 --> 27:47.320
Make sure you stick around for the post-show

27:47.320 --> 27:51.800
because we did a live version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire

27:51.800 --> 27:54.760
where it was Elle versus Allie and we gave away a game

27:54.760 --> 27:56.560
to a live stream audience member.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.400
That was fun.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.640
Woo, exciting stuff.

27:58.640 --> 27:59.760
That really was fun.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.120
That was great.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.960
I mean, if you wanna see stuff like that too,

28:02.960 --> 28:05.640
you can watch it all live on the actual Friday.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.600
That's true, you could.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.400
Yeah, 1 p.m. over at jblive.tv

28:09.400 --> 28:11.840
or jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar

28:11.840 --> 28:14.720
to get it converted to your local time zone.

28:14.720 --> 28:17.400
Now, we do have some other details

28:17.400 --> 28:19.840
on the meetup page about upcoming events.

28:19.840 --> 28:24.720
We just finished up the Linux Permissions Basic study group.

28:24.720 --> 28:25.840
Yeah, oh, that was good.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.600
Like, I think we're gonna, I'm not quite sure

28:27.600 --> 28:28.800
how we're gonna actually deliver it

28:28.800 --> 28:33.200
because we may split it up into multiples, we're thinking,

28:33.200 --> 28:35.200
but we'll soon have an update on that,

28:35.200 --> 28:36.800
but we just did another study group

28:36.800 --> 28:38.920
where we had a fantastic presenter,

28:38.920 --> 28:40.880
Alex from Rackspace, sat down

28:40.880 --> 28:43.320
and went through the basics of Linux permissions,

28:43.320 --> 28:45.160
but then some of the more advanced things

28:45.160 --> 28:48.520
that I think most Linux users have sort of glossed over

28:48.520 --> 28:50.400
that are so crazy powerful.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.880
So that information will be out soon,

28:51.880 --> 28:54.040
but if you wanna attend those kinds of things live,

28:54.040 --> 28:57.960
meetup.com slash jupitabroadcasting is where you go for that.

28:59.120 --> 28:59.960
Also, it's cheesy.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.920
We should tell people about the Telegram sticker pack.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.440
Oh yeah, it's got all of,

29:03.440 --> 29:05.320
well, it's the first six stickers

29:05.320 --> 29:06.960
that we've released in the pack.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.600
It's pack one, there are more to come,

29:10.600 --> 29:12.600
but we do have some of your favorites in there,

29:12.600 --> 29:16.000
like get it out of here, patch your shit,

29:16.000 --> 29:17.720
negative in the freedom dimension.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.160
I encourage everyone to go there.

29:19.160 --> 29:22.400
If you're on Telegram, go ahead and pick them up.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.480
There'll be a link in the show notes.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.760
If you're not on Telegram, then you should be,

29:25.760 --> 29:26.960
and just go on over to the site

29:26.960 --> 29:29.440
and click on the little Telegram icon

29:29.440 --> 29:32.080
at the top of the site, and you'll be prompted to join.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.200
Now, Al, this is your moment.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.480
Now, was there anything else,

29:34.480 --> 29:36.720
any meetups we should mention,

29:36.720 --> 29:39.240
or any other things that you wanna plug

29:39.240 --> 29:40.560
before we wrap up the housekeeping?

29:40.560 --> 29:43.840
So the next meetup is going to be understanding burnout,

29:43.840 --> 29:45.960
and I think this is a really important topic

29:45.960 --> 29:47.800
that we're not discussing in the community

29:47.800 --> 29:50.240
is kind of mental health, so please join us.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.080
That's a good one.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.320
Okay, yeah, the burnout one's good.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.160
It's important.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.160
Yeah, it is, it is.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.440
So meetup.com, you know where that's gonna go.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.520
Go there, why do I have to keep telling you?

29:58.520 --> 30:00.040
Jeez, just go do it, gosh.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.040
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, gosh.

30:02.040 --> 30:05.960
Okay, I think we got pretty trolled this week.

30:05.960 --> 30:09.360
I don't actually know, I don't know if this was a long con

30:09.360 --> 30:11.760
or if our team has peaked,

30:11.760 --> 30:13.200
and it's time for us to all go home.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.120
I guess maybe we should survey.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.680
I'm curious how far everyone got.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.200
Yeah, I am too.

30:18.200 --> 30:21.760
So this was a suggestion that came in by SW listener.

30:21.760 --> 30:25.800
He wrote to us at Chris and at Wes Payne,

30:25.800 --> 30:29.480
how about you take a look at the Tinfoil Hat Brigade,

30:29.480 --> 30:32.160
take a look at resilientlinux.com.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.760
So we went over to resilientlinux.com,

30:33.760 --> 30:35.040
which looks like it might be ripping off

30:35.040 --> 30:36.760
the elementary OS background,

30:36.760 --> 30:38.520
and we read around and saw what we liked,

30:38.520 --> 30:41.320
a resilient Debian GNU slash Linux derivative

30:41.320 --> 30:44.800
for indestructible installations for desktops

30:44.800 --> 30:46.720
and servers that are 64-bit.

30:46.720 --> 30:50.520
Ooh, yeah, a persistent partition that contains only diffs

30:50.520 --> 30:52.560
from the stock installation, things like that.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.400
Yeah, and based on Debian Stretch

30:55.400 --> 30:56.840
with a unique partitioning scheme

30:56.840 --> 30:58.680
crafted for maximizing the strength

30:58.680 --> 31:00.600
against file system corruption,

31:00.600 --> 31:05.600
as well as persistence, and a friendly installer.

31:06.120 --> 31:10.120
So you end up with a nice, clean-looking Linux desktop.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.120
You write to a USB, you boot off that,

31:13.120 --> 31:14.600
and they write, in less than a minute,

31:14.600 --> 31:16.840
the installer will easily install Resilient Linux

31:16.840 --> 31:18.720
onto your PC hard drive.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.840
You could optionally set a password for encrypting

31:20.840 --> 31:23.520
the persistence partition, and then you can test

31:23.520 --> 31:26.720
and use it in a virtualized environment as well.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.800
So this is pretty nice.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.760
It has a lot of potential.

31:29.760 --> 31:32.200
It looks like it's a passion project of two individuals.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.040
So we're not gonna try to bash on or anything,

31:35.040 --> 31:37.600
but I'm not actually sure if it's actually meant to be run.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.520
I will start with the honesty.

31:40.520 --> 31:41.920
I couldn't get it to boot.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.160
In fact, I can't remember the last time

31:44.160 --> 31:47.680
I have come on this podcast, or on any of my podcasts,

31:47.680 --> 31:49.560
and said, I can't get this Linux distro to boot.

31:49.560 --> 31:52.040
I don't know if I've ever, if that's ever been my...

31:52.040 --> 31:54.440
I mean, you remember to press F12, right?

31:54.440 --> 31:57.440
Yeah, I could not get it, I could get to grub.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.880
I could get past grub, but from there,

31:59.880 --> 32:02.360
I just got various versions of fail.

32:02.360 --> 32:03.520
What about yourself, Futchese?

32:03.520 --> 32:05.800
Were you able to get this to boot, Resilient Linux?

32:05.800 --> 32:07.240
Yeah, I was able to get it to boot.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.200
Did you get to a desktop?

32:08.200 --> 32:09.040
I did.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.360
Actually, I'm running it right now.

32:10.360 --> 32:11.200
You're shitting me.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.480
Okay, Elle, did you get it to boot?

32:12.480 --> 32:14.240
No, I don't believe him.

32:14.240 --> 32:16.520
No, Wes, did you get it to boot?

32:16.520 --> 32:18.960
No, not quite, I kept running into issues

32:18.960 --> 32:19.800
in the init room, I guess.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.520
I know, Wes wanted to be the one to get it to work, too.

32:22.520 --> 32:23.360
Like, he was on a mission.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.200
No, there's a couple things to try,

32:24.200 --> 32:25.320
but just like in a virtual machine,

32:25.320 --> 32:27.360
and I tried, yeah, I tried writing it to a USB stick.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.680
I tried it on my T480, raw dog off a USB thumb drive.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.320
I tried it in a KVM virtual machine.

32:33.320 --> 32:35.560
I couldn't get it to boot in either places.

32:35.560 --> 32:36.880
Wow, guys.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.040
All right, so Elle, how far did you manage to get it?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.240
Did you get to grub, at least?

32:40.240 --> 32:41.160
I don't know, I got to grub,

32:41.160 --> 32:43.400
but then I started cyberstalking the person,

32:43.400 --> 32:44.880
because I thought this was a joke.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.840
So I even got into their GitHub

32:46.840 --> 32:49.080
and was looking at the code going, wait a minute.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.440
Yeah, I thought maybe we were getting punked.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.960
Like, I thought, this isn't actually meant to boot,

32:52.960 --> 32:55.680
because, see, the reason why I didn't think Cheese

32:55.680 --> 32:58.280
had ever got it booted, because he sent me pictures,

32:58.280 --> 33:01.360
and when it first booted up, it put everything upside down.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.040
And so his whole screen was upside down.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.560
I thought, well, he must've given up.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.320
So, Cheese, did you get past the upside down screen stuff?

33:07.320 --> 33:09.120
Yeah, yeah, I did.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.280
It should be said, too,

33:10.280 --> 33:12.760
that whenever you go to download this image,

33:12.760 --> 33:15.720
it's a zip file, there's no checksum there,

33:15.720 --> 33:17.720
which would be nice to see if you're gonna do this.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.960
It's an image file, too, not an ISO file.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.040
I got it to boot.

33:21.040 --> 33:24.320
It did take some finessing to get it to work.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.880
Running it on, I think it's a Dell Inspiron 3000,

33:27.880 --> 33:31.200
like two-in-one inexpensive old Windows laptop.

33:32.360 --> 33:36.400
And one of the problems that most GNOME-based distributions

33:36.400 --> 33:38.160
have on this particular laptop

33:38.160 --> 33:41.680
is that the IIO sensor proxy,

33:41.680 --> 33:43.320
which is basically the accelerometer,

33:43.320 --> 33:45.760
so whenever you flip it over into tablet mode or whatever,

33:45.760 --> 33:47.240
it'll rotate the screen.

33:47.240 --> 33:50.200
Well, by default, it rotates the screen.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.440
By default, so your screen's rotated by default,

33:52.440 --> 33:53.480
out of the box. Out of the box.

33:53.480 --> 33:56.520
Because obviously that's gonna be a super common use case

33:56.520 --> 33:58.160
for all those GNOME Shell tablets out there.

33:58.160 --> 34:01.280
And what's super weird is if I reboot the machine

34:02.160 --> 34:05.800
right after, then it'll reboot right side up.

34:05.800 --> 34:09.800
So there's some commands you can run

34:09.800 --> 34:13.280
and you can remove the IIO sensor proxy package

34:13.280 --> 34:15.600
and stuff like that so that you don't have those issues.

34:15.600 --> 34:16.440
All right, hold there.

34:16.440 --> 34:18.600
Now, I'm curious to know, once you got things,

34:18.600 --> 34:20.720
that's funny, could you imagine him doing that?

34:20.720 --> 34:22.440
Once you got things right side up,

34:22.440 --> 34:23.560
I wanna hear how it went.

34:23.560 --> 34:26.200
But I know, Brent, you also tried to give it a go.

34:26.200 --> 34:28.320
How far did you get with Resilient Linux?

34:28.320 --> 34:30.360
So while I was downloading, I got super interested

34:30.360 --> 34:32.720
in all of it, and I read up on some of the founders

34:32.720 --> 34:33.880
and stuff and got super jazzed.

34:33.880 --> 34:37.520
And then, same as you, I tried it in a VM with nothing.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.920
And then I was like, okay, I got this brand new,

34:39.920 --> 34:42.720
well, brand new, I got this new-to-me X240

34:42.720 --> 34:44.040
and I'm just gonna do it on bare metal.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.600
And I got the same as Wes, this initramfs.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.680
I couldn't get past it and I thought,

34:48.680 --> 34:51.040
I think I know what I'm doing for the most part.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.280
Like, I can't remember the last time I couldn't get,

34:53.280 --> 34:54.960
I think it was like Crunch Bang was the last time

34:54.960 --> 34:56.400
I couldn't get something running.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.960
And I just couldn't get past it

34:58.960 --> 35:00.440
and I wasn't motivated enough.

35:00.440 --> 35:03.760
Once I read into, I started getting confused.

35:03.760 --> 35:07.320
I think L just linked a page that was an installer as well

35:07.320 --> 35:08.760
that was a dev installer.

35:08.760 --> 35:12.600
And I was like, I love the sounds of this project,

35:12.600 --> 35:14.240
but I'm just not that motivated.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.080
It is a little confusing.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.160
Like, if you go over to the GitHub page,

35:17.160 --> 35:20.520
there's a release, oh, four days ago, actually.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.840
That one has an ISO file.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.280
And then, yes, they also have this dev

35:23.280 --> 35:26.520
that is a Python package that will install on a USB stick.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.080
So probably they're still working out

35:29.080 --> 35:30.480
some of the fundamentals.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.080
Because you'll note some of the previous work,

35:32.080 --> 35:35.000
stuff like LiveEng, they've put a lot of time and thought

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
into rethinking some of how live environment works.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.760
That probably affects the image we're trying to put.

35:40.760 --> 35:41.080
Right.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.520
Yeah, I just kept getting dropped down to a busy box.

35:43.520 --> 35:46.120
So Cheesy, once you got the desktop going,

35:46.120 --> 35:48.760
what's the takeaway experience like?

35:48.760 --> 35:50.400
I mean, it's not bad.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.200
It's pretty standard GNOME.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.080
So all the apps that you would expect

35:55.080 --> 36:00.800
are there, Chromium, Firefox even.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.880
I think it's Nautilus as the file manager, Rhythmbox,

36:03.880 --> 36:05.160
and so on and so forth.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.160
One thing that I did find kind of interesting

36:07.160 --> 36:12.640
is that on the applications page panel, wing, whatever

36:12.640 --> 36:17.880
it's called in GNOME, there is a software icon.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.560
It says software dot dot dot.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.960
Once you click on it, it actually

36:20.960 --> 36:23.480
brings you to the software sources

36:23.480 --> 36:25.880
and not to the software store.

36:25.880 --> 36:29.040
So the software store is found under utilities.

36:29.040 --> 36:32.120
I think that's just something they just maybe didn't look

36:32.120 --> 36:36.320
over whenever they were pushing this out.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.720
But all in all, it's really not bad.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.760
I mean, it's snappy.

36:40.760 --> 36:45.720
I like the fact that it boots relatively quickly.

36:45.720 --> 36:51.120
The three applications in the drawer,

36:51.120 --> 36:55.920
the panel at the bottom, terminal, text editor,

36:55.920 --> 36:59.160
Firefox, I love that.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.400
The installation of Inkscape was super painless.

37:02.400 --> 37:06.520
I'm kind of playing around in Inkscape with it right now.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.200
It does support the touch screen that

37:08.200 --> 37:10.360
is built in to this 2-in-1.

37:10.360 --> 37:15.280
So I can move objects around in Inkscape or whatever just fine.

37:15.280 --> 37:19.280
It might not be the snappiest, but it's definitely not bad.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.560
If you're on one of these 2-in-1s like me

37:24.560 --> 37:27.120
and have that problem, once you remove that sensor proxy

37:27.120 --> 37:29.880
package, it seems to work all right.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.640
Well, I'll tell you what I like about this.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.440
I like what they're trying to do.

37:33.440 --> 37:38.080
We've talked a lot about an indestructible Linux before.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.080
I think it's a good idea.

37:39.080 --> 37:41.320
Something that has this persistent partition that

37:41.320 --> 37:43.680
only contains the diffs from the stock installation

37:43.680 --> 37:45.800
is a solid idea.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.760
I like where the project's going with this.

37:48.760 --> 37:53.040
Now, Brent, what do you think from a perspective of somebody

37:53.040 --> 37:54.920
who just tried to give it a go?

37:54.920 --> 37:56.960
When you delve into the project, does anything

37:56.960 --> 37:57.600
alarm you?

37:57.600 --> 37:59.760
Is there anything people should take away from this

37:59.760 --> 38:00.920
before they try it?

38:00.920 --> 38:01.760
Things like that?

38:01.760 --> 38:04.240
I would say that I love the direction of where

38:04.240 --> 38:09.120
all of the writing went that I read.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.120
The thing that really stood out to me

38:11.120 --> 38:16.560
was right on the front page, it says,

38:16.560 --> 38:18.680
resilient Debian Linux derivative

38:18.680 --> 38:20.400
for indestructible installations.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.640
And that's the first time I come across that term.

38:23.640 --> 38:28.280
That just, to an endlessly curious being like me,

38:28.280 --> 38:29.960
that just felt like a taunt.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.400
And I thought, ah, this is great.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.440
I'm going to install this.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.280
And I want to dive in more and figure out what it's all about.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.360
So I was a little disappointed that I never got as far as

38:37.360 --> 38:37.840
cheese.

38:37.840 --> 38:38.600
I'm glad he did.

38:38.600 --> 38:39.160
Same.

38:39.160 --> 38:42.400
He's going to have to school us a little bit, maybe.

38:42.400 --> 38:45.400
But I think really what I took away

38:45.400 --> 38:47.200
was that I'd love to keep an eye on this

38:47.200 --> 38:51.160
and just maybe, in a month from now,

38:51.160 --> 38:54.680
to come out with a little bit more maybe support

38:54.680 --> 38:57.160
around all this so that we can get some checksums

38:57.160 --> 38:58.880
and get this running.

38:58.880 --> 39:01.800
Something that's a little more mature, maybe.

39:01.800 --> 39:02.240
That's it.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.040
Exactly.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.960
I would be totally up for trying it again, for sure.

39:04.960 --> 39:07.320
Brandon, the issue is just you weren't resilient enough.

39:07.320 --> 39:07.820
Oh.

39:07.820 --> 39:08.320
Oh.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.000
I knew these were coming.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.120
It was destructible for me.

39:13.120 --> 39:13.720
Yeah.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.280
I think it's sort of in the same camp

39:15.280 --> 39:18.280
that right now I put Clear Linux and Silverblue in now.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.080
It's like, I'm watching these because this

39:20.080 --> 39:22.600
might be a new way I do my desktop or at least a work

39:22.600 --> 39:24.280
station in the future.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.640
It's like, I'm watching you now.

39:25.640 --> 39:28.000
That's not the great part about open source stuff.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.200
We don't have to use it.

39:29.200 --> 39:29.800
We don't have to rely on it.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.560
We have plenty of options for great real world

39:32.560 --> 39:34.280
everyday installs.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.880
And then these can be research projects

39:35.880 --> 39:38.480
that might eventually make it into the tech we use every day.

39:38.480 --> 39:42.040
It's also neat to see another Debian-based distro.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.240
I just love that.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.200
A lot of times you see them based off of Ubuntu

39:45.200 --> 39:46.480
these days, which is fine.

39:46.480 --> 39:47.840
But it's cool to see those that are still based off of it.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.000
They went all the way up.

39:49.000 --> 39:49.840
Yeah, that's right.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.560
So you can check it out if you want to give it a go

39:51.560 --> 39:53.800
and tell us what we did wrong, resilientlinux.com.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.600
If you do get it going, let us know.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.560
Because apparently we weren't that successful.

39:58.560 --> 39:59.720
And maybe try to break it.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.800
Yeah, see if it is unbreakable.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.600
All right, there you go, resilientlinux.com.

40:03.600 --> 40:04.880
It looks like a good initiative.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.720
Although I think they got to work

40:06.720 --> 40:09.400
on that art at the top of the old website there.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.240
That's my take on it.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.400
That's what happens.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.400
You tweet us, see if we'll give us a challenge

40:14.400 --> 40:15.520
to see if we can get something working.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.600
And we gave it a go.

40:16.600 --> 40:17.760
The whole team gave it a go.

40:17.760 --> 40:18.400
No guarantees.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.320
That's our new little ad online.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.200
Oh, I also want to mention, we're

40:22.200 --> 40:23.360
going to get to the pics now.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.760
So just a little bonus information

40:24.760 --> 40:25.660
before we get to the pics.

40:25.660 --> 40:26.960
Because I didn't know when we were talking

40:26.960 --> 40:27.960
about the B-Sides stuff.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.640
But Elle wrote up a hell of a post.

40:30.640 --> 40:33.240
We call them articles on B-Sides 2019.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.080
We'll have a link in the show notes for that.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.720
Some pictures, if you want to know a little bit more

40:36.720 --> 40:38.400
about what B-Sides is about and sort

40:38.400 --> 40:40.600
of that organic community stuff, check it out.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.680
We'll have a link in the show notes for that.

40:42.680 --> 40:44.080
Now let's get to the pics.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.560
Mr. Payne, I have something I don't think

40:46.560 --> 40:47.600
I tried to keep from you.

40:47.600 --> 40:51.040
You may have seen it if you've been really watching my links.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.400
I won't talk about Chobb.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.240
Have you heard Chobb?

40:54.240 --> 40:54.740
No.

40:54.740 --> 40:55.720
Chobb.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.600
Anybody have a guess of what Chobb is?

40:57.600 --> 40:58.440
Anybody want to guess?

40:58.440 --> 40:59.680
It sounds like Trute almost.

40:59.680 --> 41:00.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does.

41:00.800 --> 41:01.760
It does, doesn't it?

41:01.760 --> 41:02.640
No?

41:02.640 --> 41:03.760
You guys have no idea.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.320
I've stumped you, haven't I?

41:05.320 --> 41:06.640
Don't Google it.

41:06.640 --> 41:07.280
Don't Google it.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.280
That's cheating now.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.880
Yeah, just use dot dot go.

41:10.880 --> 41:11.600
Yeah, OK.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.080
You have maybe a 50-50 shot there.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.560
All right, are you Googling it?

41:15.560 --> 41:17.080
Is it Chobb?

41:17.080 --> 41:18.320
Chobb.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.720
I'm saying Chobb, like cob, like C-H-O-B.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.200
Like brats, B for brats.

41:23.200 --> 41:24.960
Yeah, like B for brats.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.200
All right, anybody have a guess?

41:26.200 --> 41:27.080
Anybody?

41:27.080 --> 41:28.080
I'm going to guess on this one.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.080
All right, go ahead, Brett.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.480
I think O-B just sounds like obvious to me.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.480
So I don't know if Chobb admitted to obvious.

41:34.480 --> 41:37.680
Is it a link de-mystifier?

41:37.680 --> 41:38.760
Oh, that's a good guess.

41:38.760 --> 41:39.400
I can see that.

41:39.400 --> 41:39.880
Good guess.

41:39.880 --> 41:42.120
No, it is not a link de-mystifier, though.

41:42.120 --> 41:46.400
Does it do something to change object files, output

41:46.400 --> 41:47.480
from a compiler, maybe?

41:47.480 --> 41:50.200
Oh, Wes, you've been doing too much code on radio.

41:50.200 --> 41:54.880
No, it is not changing object files in a compiler.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.240
Why did I make that a pick?

41:57.240 --> 41:58.560
I thought maybe it was listening.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.520
I don't know.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.720
All right, anybody else have a guess before I reveal one?

42:01.720 --> 42:02.800
This is a lot of fun.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.040
I'm really enjoying this.

42:04.040 --> 42:07.160
I cheated, and there is no way I would have figured it out,

42:07.160 --> 42:08.040
just by guessing.

42:08.040 --> 42:08.600
Fair enough.

42:08.600 --> 42:09.080
Fair enough.

42:09.080 --> 42:11.160
All right, all right, all right, fair enough.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.080
All right, here we go.

42:12.080 --> 42:13.280
Get it out of here.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.800
Chob, C-H-O-B, is a nice little helper tool

42:16.800 --> 42:19.040
that you can run on the command line that

42:19.040 --> 42:22.600
will search across Flathub, SnapCraft, and app

42:22.600 --> 42:25.960
images for an application, and then present you a menu,

42:25.960 --> 42:28.760
and then proceed to install whichever one you prefer.

42:28.760 --> 42:30.760
So if you are sick and tired of figuring out,

42:30.760 --> 42:33.440
jeez, is there an app image, or a SnapCraft, or a FlatPak

42:33.440 --> 42:36.180
for this particular thing, you use Chob,

42:36.180 --> 42:37.920
and it will give you all of the results.

42:37.920 --> 42:39.960
So an example that they have on their GitHub page,

42:39.960 --> 42:41.320
and it works great, is Chob.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.780
You could type in the Chob command

42:42.780 --> 42:45.840
once you have installed, I just love the name, Chob code,

42:45.840 --> 42:47.640
and then it'll give you all of the results

42:47.640 --> 42:50.720
across SnapCraft developers, app image developers,

42:50.720 --> 42:51.440
and FlatPak.

42:51.440 --> 42:54.400
Unfortunately, if you try to use it to search for itself,

42:54.400 --> 42:56.320
it's not listed.

42:56.320 --> 42:57.600
Meta, dude, meta.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.400
And then you just pick which one you want,

42:59.400 --> 43:00.840
and you're off to the races.

43:00.840 --> 43:03.360
So now you have a universal search

43:03.360 --> 43:06.360
for all of those universal packages.

43:06.360 --> 43:07.800
It's a meta universe.

43:07.800 --> 43:11.600
Yeah, it's kind of nice, and you can just grab it as a binary

43:11.600 --> 43:14.680
and run it directly, or there is a deb as well.

43:14.680 --> 43:17.920
And I think, I would bet, there's probably

43:17.920 --> 43:19.120
other ways to install it.

43:19.120 --> 43:20.280
I think it's using Node.

43:20.280 --> 43:22.360
It would be nice if it had a little bit more version

43:22.360 --> 43:23.000
information.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.640
It would also be neat if it could hook into your distros

43:25.640 --> 43:27.440
package manager, maybe compare and show,

43:27.440 --> 43:28.440
here's the different versions you can get,

43:28.440 --> 43:29.640
here's what you have natively.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.400
That would be next level cool, right?

43:31.400 --> 43:33.200
So then you can make an educated decision.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.080
Should I go with the one that's in the repo,

43:35.080 --> 43:37.080
or should I go with the one that's in FlatPak?

43:37.080 --> 43:39.200
There's downsides, upsides, lots to consider.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.000
Yeah, I don't think so.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.320
They do have just a binary you can run, download it,

43:44.320 --> 43:46.280
Jamad plus X, and you're set.

43:46.280 --> 43:48.080
They also have a deb file, it looks like.

43:48.080 --> 43:51.840
How did I come across this?

43:51.840 --> 43:55.240
I think I was trolling blogs and Twitter feeds.

43:55.240 --> 43:57.600
I found it on Reddit just now.

43:57.600 --> 44:00.140
It was posted a month ago, and I saw it,

44:00.140 --> 44:03.800
and it completely ignored it because it said Chobb.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.200
I think I saw it just recently, because I tagged it

44:06.200 --> 44:08.660
in the last seven days, so I must have just seen it recently.

44:08.660 --> 44:09.560
I can't remember.

44:09.560 --> 44:10.760
I can't remember where it was.

44:10.760 --> 44:16.000
But I follow a lot of the different Snap developers

44:16.000 --> 44:19.160
and AppImage guy and the FlatPak developers,

44:19.160 --> 44:20.800
and I've been doing a lot of digging

44:20.800 --> 44:22.280
around for my Fedora machines.

44:22.280 --> 44:24.800
So I think maybe I found it when I was looking for FlatPaks,

44:24.800 --> 44:26.360
but I can't remember.

44:26.360 --> 44:28.600
I tagged it forever ago, which in my world

44:28.600 --> 44:29.840
is more than three days.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.400
And don't worry, it is based on JavaScript.

44:32.400 --> 44:33.920
Well, OK, it's TypeScript, but I'm

44:33.920 --> 44:35.720
pretty sure it bundles Node in there for you.

44:35.720 --> 44:36.720
Phew.

44:36.720 --> 44:37.400
Oh, good.

44:37.400 --> 44:37.960
Oh, good.

44:37.960 --> 44:39.160
All right, well, there we go.

44:39.160 --> 44:42.640
Um, there's your pic of the week.

44:42.640 --> 44:43.160
There you go.

44:47.160 --> 44:48.080
Kind of love Mario.

44:48.080 --> 44:49.000
I just love it.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.200
I just love it, you know?

44:50.200 --> 44:50.960
It just makes you happy.

44:50.960 --> 44:52.560
All these years later, still love it.

44:52.560 --> 44:53.400
Still good.

44:53.400 --> 44:54.280
Still really good.

44:54.280 --> 44:55.880
Stay a while and listen.

44:55.880 --> 44:58.040
Now, if you love these shows, I want to remind you

44:58.040 --> 45:00.240
that we are part of Linux Academy.

45:00.240 --> 45:01.920
You should go check out linuxacademy.com,

45:01.920 --> 45:03.540
and you can tweet them, linuxacademy.com,

45:03.540 --> 45:05.120
and tell them how much you appreciate

45:05.120 --> 45:07.160
them here for making these here shows,

45:07.160 --> 45:09.520
because we appreciate them doing that for us.

45:09.520 --> 45:10.240
We sure do.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.840
linuxacademy.com on the Twitter.

45:11.840 --> 45:12.720
Send them some love.

45:12.720 --> 45:15.480
Let them know you appreciate them making these shows

45:15.480 --> 45:17.120
sponsor-free for the community.

45:17.120 --> 45:19.400
Yeah, we're not here just selling you some crazy.

45:19.400 --> 45:20.560
They didn't ask me to say that.

45:20.560 --> 45:21.720
I just was thinking about it this morning.

45:21.720 --> 45:23.200
I was having an argument in the chat room.

45:23.200 --> 45:25.360
And I had a realization, like, it's a huge deal.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.280
We've dropped all ads.

45:26.280 --> 45:27.840
Like, that's really great.

45:27.840 --> 45:28.520
So great for me.

45:28.520 --> 45:29.200
I was thinking the same.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.880
I was listening, and the local NPR station

45:30.880 --> 45:31.840
was doing a pledge drive.

45:31.840 --> 45:33.480
Well, we also don't do that, right?

45:33.480 --> 45:34.720
We could if you want, but we're not going to.

45:34.720 --> 45:35.760
Feels good, though.

45:35.760 --> 45:36.720
I know, it's been nice.

45:36.720 --> 45:38.240
I think we should send them some love.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.400
There's a lot of gratitude going around for that.

45:40.400 --> 45:41.520
linuxacademy.com on Twitter.

45:41.520 --> 45:42.840
Let them know.

45:42.840 --> 45:45.480
And also, the community edition, by the way, free.

45:45.480 --> 45:48.280
Oh, with video.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.440
That's right.

45:49.440 --> 45:49.960
That's right.

45:49.960 --> 45:51.640
And mobile apps now, too.

45:51.640 --> 45:53.760
It's getting better and better all the time.

45:53.760 --> 45:56.680
Now, we do this show here on Tuesdays over jblive.tv.

45:56.680 --> 45:59.160
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

45:59.160 --> 46:02.240
is where you can go to get that converted to your local time.

46:02.240 --> 46:04.280
That Mumble Room is open to the community.

46:04.280 --> 46:06.000
We'd love to have you come and share your opinions.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.360
That's our virtual lug.

46:07.360 --> 46:10.400
Not everybody can get to a lug in their neck of the woods,

46:10.400 --> 46:11.560
so come be part of ours.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.480
We'd love to have you.

46:12.480 --> 46:14.280
Thanks so much for joining us, and we'll see you right back

46:14.280 --> 46:15.600
here next Tuesday.

46:15.600 --> 46:40.480
OK, bye-bye.

46:45.600 --> 46:57.280
This story didn't really kind of fit the theme of the show this week, so I didn't include

46:57.280 --> 47:00.760
it in the show, but I kind of wanted to save it just to talk about it with you guys.

47:00.760 --> 47:04.480
Because it makes me feel like people that never update their machines have got it right

47:04.480 --> 47:05.480
all along.

47:05.480 --> 47:06.480
Oh no.

47:06.480 --> 47:07.480
Oh no.

47:07.480 --> 47:08.480
I know.

47:08.480 --> 47:11.460
I know, because I'm always like arguing against those people, but I think they have it right.

47:11.460 --> 47:16.520
Only 5.5% of all vulnerabilities are ever exploited in the wild.

47:16.520 --> 47:20.320
According to, well, at least ZDNet.

47:20.320 --> 47:25.080
Most vulnerabilities that are exploited in the wild also have a CVSS severity of 9 or

47:25.080 --> 47:26.080
10.

47:26.080 --> 47:30.400
New research published this week has shed some much needed light onto the world of vulnerability

47:30.400 --> 47:34.600
exploitation, revealing how many of the total number of security flaws discovered in the

47:34.600 --> 47:39.240
past 10 years were actually ever exploited in the wild.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.760
Turns out not much.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.720
Not much.

47:42.720 --> 47:48.440
Only 4,183 security flaws from the total of 76,000 vulnerabilities discovered between

47:48.440 --> 47:52.560
2009 and 2018 had actually been exploited in the wild.

47:52.560 --> 47:56.520
I mean, this is interesting, but I feel like this is a statistics problem sort of thing

47:56.520 --> 48:00.480
in that like, shouldn't we have some weights here and really understanding that, okay,

48:00.480 --> 48:03.720
the ones that are rated highest are the ones that are probably remotely exploitable or

48:03.720 --> 48:06.240
on services that are of that nature.

48:06.240 --> 48:08.800
And then a lot of the ones that don't get exploited, yeah, they're not going to get

48:08.800 --> 48:11.160
exploited all over the place, but they are bad.

48:11.160 --> 48:15.640
They might be a secondary link or an island hopping sort of event when they got local

48:15.640 --> 48:18.200
access and suddenly they have root access.

48:18.200 --> 48:23.400
Also, there is, I mean, they go on and on and on in this article, which we'll have

48:23.400 --> 48:26.800
linked in the show notes about how great their data is and how they've collected this research

48:26.800 --> 48:30.400
and from a multitude of different sources, et cetera, et cetera.

48:30.400 --> 48:33.920
Ain't nobody reporting breaks into their systems unless they have to.

48:33.920 --> 48:34.920
Like ain't nobody.

48:34.920 --> 48:35.920
Right?

48:35.920 --> 48:39.000
So if you have a breach and you can get away without telling anybody about it, you're not

48:39.000 --> 48:43.720
like, you're not writing a press release, you're not submitted to a database.

48:43.720 --> 48:45.440
So like, I don't know.

48:45.440 --> 48:46.440
Auditors have to ask first.

48:46.440 --> 48:47.440
Right?

48:47.440 --> 48:48.440
Yeah.

48:48.440 --> 48:53.040
Like you have to be in an industry that is forced to disclose, which is some industries,

48:53.040 --> 48:54.760
but not all industries.

48:54.760 --> 48:57.640
That's why we don't take personal data here at Jupiter Broadcasting.

48:57.640 --> 48:58.640
That's right.

48:58.640 --> 49:00.140
We are GDPR compliant.

49:00.140 --> 49:01.140
That is for sure.

49:01.140 --> 49:07.120
The thing is, not patching your machine is an attitude, bad attitude or the bad routine.

49:07.120 --> 49:10.200
And someday it will lead into problems.

49:10.200 --> 49:14.480
So it's never, never a good thing.

49:14.480 --> 49:18.480
But apparently if you're playing the odds, it might be, you know, you might be all right.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.480
I don't know.

49:19.480 --> 49:20.480
I mean, we should do it for science.

49:20.480 --> 49:21.480
Let's find out.

49:21.480 --> 49:26.280
Someone said she had that during their security job interview is how do you handle security?

49:26.280 --> 49:27.280
I just play the odds.

49:27.280 --> 49:28.280
Yeah.

49:28.280 --> 49:29.280
I don't bother.

49:29.280 --> 49:30.280
Hey, that's what Sony did.

49:30.280 --> 49:32.440
They just put their machine out on the internet and not patch it.

49:32.440 --> 49:34.040
Actually, somebody has done that before, right?

49:34.040 --> 49:36.320
I just install all the software no one uses.

49:36.320 --> 49:38.360
How do you handle your security?

49:38.360 --> 49:41.400
And they'll just respond, obscurity.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.400
Problem solved.

49:42.400 --> 49:44.840
Just add one to every port.

49:44.840 --> 49:48.560
Well, and I didn't just make a Telegram sticker that says don't patch your shit.

49:48.560 --> 49:53.720
So you know, I think we need to, is there, do we have a brats, brats to the front of

49:53.720 --> 49:54.720
the line sticker?

49:54.720 --> 49:55.720
We don't yet, but it's on the list.

49:55.720 --> 50:01.280
You know, I've already got the middle image in my head.

50:01.280 --> 50:03.680
What about resilience is futile?

50:03.680 --> 50:05.240
That's kind of cute.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.880
That's kind of, that's kind of cute.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.800
Guardians of the matrix.org.

50:10.800 --> 50:14.960
I was looking at this thing not booting and I said to myself, I said, all right, you're

50:14.960 --> 50:19.040
either going to take this all the way to the end and not stop until you get it booting

50:19.040 --> 50:20.600
or you're going to call it right here.

50:20.600 --> 50:23.080
And I looked at it and I thought to myself, I said, like, you know what, I'm never going

50:23.080 --> 50:24.520
to switch to this.

50:24.520 --> 50:25.520
I'm going to call it.

50:25.520 --> 50:27.880
Like, that's the first time I've ever done it.

50:27.880 --> 50:30.600
Like, I've never allowed myself to not get it installed.

50:30.600 --> 50:31.600
Like, I got to talk about it on the show.

50:31.600 --> 50:32.600
What am I going to do?

50:32.600 --> 50:34.600
Go on the show and say I didn't get it installed?

50:34.600 --> 50:35.600
Like, I can't say that.

50:35.600 --> 50:36.600
That's ridiculous.

50:36.600 --> 50:38.600
How long can you talk about it?

50:38.600 --> 50:39.600
Yeah.

50:39.600 --> 50:42.480
But like, but then like, what's funny is like, none of us really wanted to admit to each

50:42.480 --> 50:43.920
other that we couldn't get it going.

50:43.920 --> 50:47.400
So like, it just sort of started becoming obvious that we were all struggling.

50:47.400 --> 50:50.760
No one had made any serious observations about it.

50:50.760 --> 50:51.760
Yeah.

50:51.760 --> 50:56.160
So it was like, oh, okay, but then like, I had to like, then call for the shroud of silence.

50:56.160 --> 50:59.360
We have to call down the cone of silence because now we can't talk about it.

50:59.360 --> 51:03.120
Now we've got to share our experiences on air because I think we've all had a bad experience.

51:03.120 --> 51:05.920
So I genuinely did not know cheese had got it working.

51:05.920 --> 51:08.840
So out of all of us, the design guy on the team got it right.

51:08.840 --> 51:09.840
That's what I'm thinking.

51:09.840 --> 51:16.080
Like, you guys have worked in Linux for years and here I am just like, okay, DD it to flash

51:16.080 --> 51:17.080
drive zip file.

51:17.080 --> 51:18.080
Okay.

51:18.080 --> 51:19.080
Whatever.

51:19.080 --> 51:20.760
This is my homework for the evening.

51:20.760 --> 51:21.760
Yeah, it looks nice.

51:21.760 --> 51:25.000
I mean, it's kind of like a nice, like a UEFI GPT set up.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
It should boot just fine.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.360
I mean, I was doing like PCI pass through, maybe I, maybe I just over, I over engineered

51:30.360 --> 51:31.360
my KVM maybe.

51:31.360 --> 51:40.640
It should be said too, that the, uh, easy installer is, is, um, maybe not so friendly.

51:40.640 --> 51:49.400
I mean, it's easy, but so if don't do this on a machine that you might want to sacrifice,

51:49.400 --> 51:56.120
or you might not want to sacrifice because whenever you light up the script, the Python

51:56.120 --> 52:00.520
script for the installer, it's basically SDA, right done.

52:00.520 --> 52:01.520
Yeah.

52:01.520 --> 52:06.800
It only takes two minutes, but it doesn't give you any other options to, um, you know,

52:06.800 --> 52:10.400
like they have with their USB installer, which would be nice to have that built into the

52:10.400 --> 52:14.400
GUI installer so that you could just boom, put it over to a flash drive.

52:14.400 --> 52:19.040
Like I could see that being useful in this scenario.

52:19.040 --> 52:22.720
But it is also kind of a large image at like almost four gigs.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.920
I think it's like three and a half gigs or something.

52:24.920 --> 52:25.920
Yeah.

52:25.920 --> 52:26.920
Yeah.

52:26.920 --> 52:27.920
True.

52:27.920 --> 52:28.920
So yeah, that's good advice though.

52:28.920 --> 52:31.720
I had that problem with an early edition of clear Linux where I was installing it on a

52:31.720 --> 52:36.040
laptop that I hadn't really, I hadn't planned to wipe the whole thing for.

52:36.040 --> 52:37.040
Right.

52:37.040 --> 52:38.040
Right.

52:38.040 --> 52:41.440
That's so great when you're like, when you've been doing this for a decade and you still

52:41.440 --> 52:43.480
make that mistake is the best.

52:43.480 --> 52:46.000
I definitely prefer doing it in VMs now.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
Like I don't, I'm trying to go for a, I'm trying to go for the entire.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.200
Life cycle for door 30 without reloading that laptop.

52:52.200 --> 52:53.200
So I don't want to repartition.

52:53.200 --> 52:54.200
I've worked at it.

52:54.200 --> 52:55.200
It's impressive.

52:55.200 --> 52:56.200
Yeah.

52:56.200 --> 52:58.480
That's why I'm trying to get this VM stuff all set up, but today I just couldn't get

52:58.480 --> 52:59.480
it going.

52:59.480 --> 53:00.480
Had to call it.

53:00.480 --> 53:01.480
Congratulations cheese.

53:01.480 --> 53:02.480
Thank you.

53:02.480 --> 53:03.480
You win the Linux hat.

53:03.480 --> 53:04.480
Oh yeah.

53:04.480 --> 53:05.480
For this one.

53:05.480 --> 53:06.480
Yeah.

53:06.480 --> 53:07.480
I don't know if we, do we have it?

53:07.480 --> 53:08.480
It's also red.

53:08.480 --> 53:09.480
I'll take it.

53:09.480 --> 53:14.720
I'm just discovering now that, uh, I guess on my USB drive that I tried to install it

53:14.720 --> 53:20.520
on, um, I've got G party complaining that my backup GPT table is corrupt.

53:20.520 --> 53:26.080
So that's maybe not a good start destructible Linux.

53:26.080 --> 53:27.880
It just cleared everything.

53:27.880 --> 53:32.920
And then in the documentation I read, uh, and I sent this to West yesterday that as

53:32.920 --> 53:38.440
a warning, uh, it says the USB installer will deploy the resilient Linux initial ISO image

53:38.440 --> 53:44.380
onto all the inserted and listed USB devices, thus creating complete resilient Linux operating

53:44.380 --> 53:45.460
system.

53:45.460 --> 53:50.300
So whenever you got plugged in, it sounds like, um, which sounds kind of dangerous considering

53:50.300 --> 53:52.000
I had my backup drive installed.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.960
Well, I immediately thought about clear Linux.

53:54.960 --> 53:58.480
Whenever you had thrown this distro in my way, I was thinking, you know, this is a,

53:58.480 --> 54:02.040
this is a super interesting way to handle this sort of thing, you know, just diffing

54:02.040 --> 54:04.560
everything is a neat way to do it.

54:04.560 --> 54:08.320
And I think that there's something there, but it's, it's, it's an early release.

54:08.320 --> 54:13.080
It's two guys working in a garage in their bedrooms or whatever, and this is their summer

54:13.080 --> 54:16.600
passion project or something, you know, they can be a lot closer than we're giving them

54:16.600 --> 54:17.600
credit for.

54:17.600 --> 54:18.600
It can be just a few missing pieces.

54:18.600 --> 54:22.860
I actually, that's kind of what I like about it is like, you never know, you just, with,

54:22.860 --> 54:25.040
with distros, you just, you never know.

54:25.040 --> 54:27.840
You don't want to count everybody out like this because every now and then they'll surprise

54:27.840 --> 54:30.800
you about before people really use that arch Linux thing.

54:30.800 --> 54:34.560
Or if there's one thing that the resilient guys do that gets taken off to another project

54:34.560 --> 54:36.160
to benefit us somewhere else.

54:36.160 --> 54:37.440
Yeah, sure.

54:37.440 --> 54:38.440
So next week, bedrock

54:38.440 --> 54:46.120
LFS, bro, oh no, we're not getting back into this again.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.200
Gentoo challenge.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.200
Take two.

54:48.200 --> 54:49.200
Gentoo 2019.

54:49.200 --> 54:52.720
You should do the crux because of the inspiration of arch.

54:52.720 --> 54:53.720
That's right.

54:53.720 --> 54:54.720
Yeah.

54:54.720 --> 54:55.720
Damn right.

54:55.720 --> 54:58.760
And also Brent's apparently sorted history with it.

54:58.760 --> 55:00.720
I thought it wasn't in existence anymore.

55:00.720 --> 55:04.320
Well, that's even more reason than it was last year, but it might not be anymore.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.320
That's we should.

55:05.320 --> 55:08.760
We should do is, um, Caldera Linux.
