WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
Everybody loves ProtonMail and everybody loves WireGuard.

00:02.480 --> 00:04.840
Well ProtonMail figured that out themselves

00:04.840 --> 00:07.880
and they're launching a cool way to help

00:07.880 --> 00:11.000
not only fund WireGuard, but potentially win

00:11.000 --> 00:13.800
a year of service with ProtonVPN.

00:13.800 --> 00:14.640
You like this?

00:14.640 --> 00:15.460
I like this.

00:15.460 --> 00:16.300
You like?

00:16.300 --> 00:17.120
I like.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.480
It sounds like they'll eventually add WireGuard support

00:19.480 --> 00:21.060
for their own ProtonVPN.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.640
Not yet, no promises on exactly when,

00:23.640 --> 00:26.520
but for now you can still show your support

00:26.520 --> 00:29.240
and get one of them lifetime memberships, huh?

00:29.240 --> 00:32.800
I think it's super exciting to watch new technologies

00:32.800 --> 00:35.840
like this develop, and I think they deserve more attention

00:35.840 --> 00:38.200
than they get because these are infrastructure things.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.960
WireGuard is going to securely connect

00:39.960 --> 00:42.520
data centers and workers, and it's just

00:42.520 --> 00:45.200
going to go as an implementation detail for products

00:45.200 --> 00:46.120
in the future.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.440
But it's one of these fundamental enabling

00:48.440 --> 00:53.560
technologies that we just get for free as Linux users.

00:53.560 --> 00:58.520
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 280 for December 18, 2018.

00:58.520 --> 01:13.520
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.200
It's just got a few more episodes

01:15.200 --> 01:17.280
before it's time to live up to those predictions.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.040
My name is Chris.

01:18.040 --> 01:18.880
My name is Wes.

01:18.880 --> 01:19.800
Hello, Wes.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.960
I was looking through our list, and I'm really

01:22.960 --> 01:24.000
bringing my A game.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.040
I've got to make up for a few bad ones.

01:26.040 --> 01:26.840
I've got to own them.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.460
But that's not what today's episode's about.

01:28.460 --> 01:30.720
No, Wes and I are fresh off the plane,

01:30.720 --> 01:32.560
just got back from Denver, Colorado

01:32.560 --> 01:37.040
to tour the System76 factories and meet Thaleo,

01:37.040 --> 01:41.440
their new line of desktop PCs, born to run Linux.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.320
We had a chance to go there.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.820
I'll save it, but I got some things to say.

01:46.820 --> 01:48.240
I got some stuff to share.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.760
We had some experiences.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.560
It was not what we were expecting.

01:51.560 --> 01:52.080
You agree?

01:52.080 --> 01:53.240
I think that's safe to say.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.080
Yeah, I think that's safe to say.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.000
But before we get there, we'll go through some community news

01:57.000 --> 02:00.480
this week, cover a few housekeeping items,

02:00.480 --> 02:03.000
and towards the end of the show, we'll answer some emails,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.160
follow up on a few projects that people have sent our way,

02:06.160 --> 02:09.680
and give you a few of our own, a few picks that are really

02:09.680 --> 02:13.720
killer, including one by somebody a little surprising

02:13.720 --> 02:16.320
that's impressive as heck.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.320
That's a little tease.

02:17.320 --> 02:17.640
Don't look.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.400
Don't look in the show notes.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.680
Don't spoil it for yourself.

02:19.680 --> 02:20.400
Just wait and see.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.600
It's pretty cool.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.800
But before we go any further, we have

02:23.800 --> 02:27.000
to bring in that virtual lug time appropriate greetings

02:27.000 --> 02:27.680
mumble room.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.400
Good morning.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.080
Hey there.

02:30.080 --> 02:30.720
Hello.

02:30.720 --> 02:35.200
Hello, Brandon, and Bruce, and Fundatils, and KP, MiniMech,

02:35.200 --> 02:41.040
Scott, Sean, Simi, and Xanthrux336.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.320
Very specific there, that one.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.480
Not 386.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.360
336, buddy.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.160
Get it right, Chris.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.200
Come on.

02:47.200 --> 02:47.920
OK, Wes.

02:47.920 --> 02:50.400
Well, I wish we had a, you know, we

02:50.400 --> 02:52.880
need to have a voiceover person do this part for us.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.160
So I'm just going to do it my best, OK?

02:55.160 --> 02:57.840
Previously, on Lunix Unplugged, Wes Payne

02:57.840 --> 03:00.360
attempts to get the keyboardio on fire.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.600
So before we go any further, Wes,

03:02.600 --> 03:04.240
let's open this challenge back up.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.440
This is the episode we have to wrap it up.

03:06.440 --> 03:10.520
Wes Payne, how are you feeling about lighting the keyboardio

03:10.520 --> 03:11.280
on fire?

03:11.280 --> 03:12.720
Well, it's not quite on fire.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.280
It's got some other effects, I think, loaded.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.520
We've just flashed the latest firmware.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.960
So we're up to snuff in that department.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.240
Now to enable some plugins.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.600
All right, I'm looking forward to it.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.720
Keyboardio, of course, is a split keyboard running Linux.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.760
It's got some Arduinos in there connected back

03:28.760 --> 03:31.880
to Wes Payne's ThinkPad running Ubuntu.

03:31.880 --> 03:36.920
And the idea is to install some software on the keyboard that

03:36.920 --> 03:39.880
creates a fire-like effect on the keyboard

03:39.880 --> 03:41.520
to help us celebrate the holidays.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.240
That's the plan, at least.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.240
We'll see if that actually works out.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.480
In fact, why don't we begin our community news

03:48.480 --> 03:51.880
this week with a hell of a story about keyboardio?

03:51.880 --> 03:53.680
I am shocked.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.200
I have this keyboardio because I was

03:55.200 --> 03:57.560
one of the very, very, very early backers

03:57.560 --> 04:00.520
because I met the couple behind the project very early

04:00.520 --> 04:03.480
on at OSCON years ago when they were

04:03.480 --> 04:05.320
on one of their many prototypes.

04:05.320 --> 04:12.560
And they had an update today, day 1,278, words

04:12.560 --> 04:13.840
that they never wanted to hear.

04:13.840 --> 04:17.560
Quote, I'm not saying anything else without a lawyer present.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.080
Things went.

04:18.080 --> 04:20.320
That's never good.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.120
They've had delays.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.280
They've had challenges.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.000
And they figured out the common theme.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.760
They were getting scammed badly.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.240
There's basically no situation which

04:29.240 --> 04:31.800
they wished they never had to say these words they write.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.640
These words are what someone says

04:33.640 --> 04:35.000
after they've gotten caught.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.840
These are the words that our account manager

04:36.840 --> 04:38.760
from the factory that makes the Model 1

04:38.760 --> 04:43.880
said about 6 PM on Tuesday, November 27,

04:43.880 --> 04:48.360
after we'd finally figured out how much she had stolen.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.080
This is a story that, well, I'll just leave it

04:51.080 --> 04:54.080
to you to read, but here's a couple of details.

04:54.080 --> 04:58.200
They had gotten scammed by an account manager that

04:58.200 --> 05:01.080
was working for a Chinese factory that was lying to them.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.600
She had lied to them about having a family.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.960
She even sent pictures of a fake son.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.920
She was no longer an employee at this factory,

05:08.920 --> 05:11.080
but she'd convinced the factory to let her stay on and work

05:11.080 --> 05:11.680
this client.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.840
Just multiple levels of bad relationships and bad deals.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.520
And some of these things that happened

05:16.520 --> 05:18.480
are not totally out of the ordinary over there.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.440
So they didn't set off any alarm bells immediately.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.320
And she was doing this tricky thing

05:23.320 --> 05:26.640
where she would eventually release just enough money.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.320
She'd set up a separate bank account

05:28.320 --> 05:30.440
and gotten the Keyboardio folks to wire their money

05:30.440 --> 05:31.680
to that bank account.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.080
And then when the factory would really start to get upset,

05:35.080 --> 05:37.440
and Keyboardio really needed their key caps

05:37.440 --> 05:39.180
or their keyboards or whatever it was,

05:39.180 --> 05:41.280
she'd put a little money from her bank account

05:41.280 --> 05:42.680
into the factory's bank account.

05:42.680 --> 05:42.920
Right.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.760
So she's sitting there in the middle telling the factory,

05:44.760 --> 05:45.680
oh, we can't pay yet.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.480
We can't pay yet.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.120
Taking this money, hoarding it.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.920
Yeah, and then occasionally paying a little bit out

05:49.920 --> 05:51.760
so that a few people got some keyboards

05:51.760 --> 05:53.360
and it looked like progress was happening.

05:53.360 --> 05:53.860
Yeah.

05:53.860 --> 05:57.840
And then there was instance where maybe 5,000 sets were

05:57.840 --> 06:00.840
ordered by Keyboardio, but she'd put an order in for 2,700

06:00.840 --> 06:02.760
and then skim off the top and take the rest.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.760
So the factory just wouldn't have the parts.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.080
And then when it came time to actually go over there

06:08.080 --> 06:11.360
on November 27th and start talking to people,

06:11.360 --> 06:14.440
it was super awkward because the factory owner and workers,

06:14.440 --> 06:15.920
first of all, didn't speak English.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.800
Second of all, were trying to negotiate with her in a way

06:18.800 --> 06:20.360
where they were playing along with her lives

06:20.360 --> 06:21.920
because they felt like that was the best way to get

06:21.920 --> 06:24.600
the money out of her.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.360
At a certain point, that just stopped working.

06:26.360 --> 06:26.860
Wow.

06:26.860 --> 06:28.940
That's when the lawyers had to get involved.

06:28.940 --> 06:30.440
But they learned that she was no longer

06:30.440 --> 06:32.920
an employee of the factory.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.720
They learned that she had actually quit 18 months prior

06:36.720 --> 06:38.140
to when they discovered all of this.

06:38.140 --> 06:38.640
Wow.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.640
But the factory allowed her to keep the project

06:40.640 --> 06:41.960
as an independent sales agent.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.160
Again, that's not too unusual.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.800
And then the account manager had negotiated aggressive discounts

06:47.800 --> 06:49.200
and price breaks on their behalf,

06:49.200 --> 06:52.080
but hadn't actually passed them on.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.520
When they asked if their account manager had done this

06:54.520 --> 06:56.160
to try with any of her other clients,

06:56.160 --> 06:58.400
like she'd scammed anybody else, the factory owner

06:58.400 --> 07:01.400
told Keyboardio that Keyboardio was the only customer

07:01.400 --> 07:02.720
that she'd had before she'd quit.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.920
Their one and only customer.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.480
In August, they sent back 20 defective circuit boards

07:08.480 --> 07:10.920
to have them troubleshoot and figure out what was wrong.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.480
They never received them.

07:12.480 --> 07:15.200
They never got the boards.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.200
So they never were doing the troubleshooting

07:17.200 --> 07:19.080
why the account manager told them they were.

07:19.080 --> 07:19.880
It's pretty bad news.

07:19.880 --> 07:20.840
It's not catastrophic.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.520
On one hand, it's a lot of money missing.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.980
And they think there's a decent chance that that money's just

07:25.980 --> 07:28.800
gone and never going to be seen again.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.360
But some products, they did manage to ship them.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.960
And they think after this, they're

07:33.960 --> 07:36.280
going to have a better relationship with the factory.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.780
Yeah, they've been over there now.

07:37.780 --> 07:39.620
They've established some new relationships.

07:39.620 --> 07:41.400
It sounds like, at least so far, things

07:41.400 --> 07:42.640
are still going to move forward.

07:42.640 --> 07:45.440
And even if not, the company's in a healthy enough place

07:45.440 --> 07:47.840
that they can continue just probably a little slower

07:47.840 --> 07:49.040
than we would all have liked.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.880
They got some nice perks for patrons.

07:51.880 --> 07:52.920
No, Kickstarter.

07:52.920 --> 07:53.880
What are you, a kickster?

07:53.880 --> 07:55.160
What do you when you back a project?

07:55.160 --> 07:55.600
A backer.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.280
A backer.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.040
Kickstarter backer.

07:57.040 --> 07:57.720
I like kickster.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.240
That's much better.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.120
A kickster.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.880
If you're a kickster of this project

08:00.880 --> 08:02.460
and you fill out their survey, they got some perks

08:02.460 --> 08:03.580
they're giving out too.

08:03.580 --> 08:04.920
It's a long story.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.080
We just skimmed 10% of it.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.200
But I suggest that you go read the rest.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.080
But kind of crazy that this is happening when we just

08:12.080 --> 08:14.720
started randomly talking about the keyboardio on the show.

08:14.720 --> 08:15.920
It was sitting here in the studio,

08:15.920 --> 08:17.240
and we're like, let's do something with that.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.540
That's a keyboard that runs Linux.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.520
Let's do something with it.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.600
Yeah, it really sucks too, because this

08:20.600 --> 08:22.320
isn't one of those, at least it hasn't ever

08:22.320 --> 08:24.320
seemed to be one of those shadier Kickstarter

08:24.320 --> 08:25.320
sort of things.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.120
They've delivered.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.640
They made a very quality product.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.000
So just unfortunate all around.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.960
Yeah, it's interesting how she was eking out just enough

08:30.960 --> 08:32.580
of their money to convince the factory.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.480
She would tell the factory things like, well,

08:34.480 --> 08:36.160
they have to make the shipment in order

08:36.160 --> 08:39.720
to pay you what they owe, even though they had paid.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.640
So oh, man, it's such a shame to see a cool project.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.800
Because the couple behind it that started originally

08:45.800 --> 08:47.340
just didn't have a passion making the best

08:47.340 --> 08:48.560
keyboard possible.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.640
And there are projects that have been,

08:50.640 --> 08:52.560
they've forked what these people have built

08:52.560 --> 08:54.280
and made their own projects.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.840
It's become a bit of a platform too.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.000
So good luck there on that lightning on fire, Wes.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.720
We'll check back in towards the end of the show

09:00.720 --> 09:01.960
and see how you do.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.240
You have one episode of Linux Unplugged remaining.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.520
All right, now on to the rest of the community news.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.040
Didn't think I'd be saying this one anytime soon.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.720
But it looks like you're going to be using the NVIDIA binary

09:12.720 --> 09:19.040
driver with Wayland sooner than you expected, thanks to Mir.

09:19.040 --> 09:23.800
Yeah, Mir 1.1 has been released with EGL streams, KMS support,

09:23.800 --> 09:27.320
and it works with NVIDIA's binary driver.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.400
The canonical developers maintaining the Mir display

09:29.400 --> 09:32.400
server with its modern focus on being a Wayland compositor

09:32.400 --> 09:36.440
have just issued Mir 1.1.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.480
The primary edition of Mir 1.1 is the introduction

09:39.480 --> 09:41.400
of NVIDIA's primary driver support

09:41.400 --> 09:45.360
by means of adding EGL streams, which I barely even understand

09:45.360 --> 09:47.160
what those are.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.840
And this KMS backend that is compatible with the NVIDIA

09:49.840 --> 09:53.360
Linux driver architecture that already exists by NVIDIA.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.860
So it's just working with what they already plug into.

09:55.860 --> 09:58.200
Yeah, basically there's like two different buffer APIs,

09:58.200 --> 10:00.580
one that all the open source drivers use

10:00.580 --> 10:02.880
and is already implemented in all the Wayland compositors

10:02.880 --> 10:05.760
that you use today, and EGL streams,

10:05.760 --> 10:08.200
which is what NVIDIA's driver uses.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.720
And Gnome had already grown some support for this,

10:10.720 --> 10:13.720
and work is in progress for KDE as well.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.680
But that kind of left everyone else out in the cold

10:15.680 --> 10:17.020
unless you were going to implement

10:17.020 --> 10:18.480
this for your custom compositor.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.440
What was it, three months ago, we

10:20.440 --> 10:22.880
were seeing stories about canonical working

10:22.880 --> 10:25.480
to upstream some sort of EGL?

10:25.480 --> 10:26.980
I mean, I just remember seeing that,

10:26.980 --> 10:28.600
and I just went by the writer, and I went, well, who cares?

10:28.600 --> 10:29.600
What does that mean?

10:29.600 --> 10:31.480
But now you see the other shoe drop,

10:31.480 --> 10:33.920
and you're like, oh, this is going

10:33.920 --> 10:36.760
to tie all the way from Wayland, Amir, to Gnome Shell.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.920
There's a whole channel here where you could potentially

10:38.920 --> 10:41.920
get a Gnome Shell environment using Amir Shim talking

10:41.920 --> 10:44.880
to Wayland, talking Wayland, not talking to, but talking

10:44.880 --> 10:49.560
Wayland, with actual NVIDIA binary accelerated graphics.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.720
And I know so many people listening to this show

10:51.720 --> 10:53.740
are going, who the hell wants NVIDIA binary graphics

10:53.740 --> 10:54.560
on their Linux box?

10:54.560 --> 10:57.800
I am there with you.

10:57.800 --> 11:01.920
My utopia, my Lenovo T480 utopia, I feel like,

11:01.920 --> 11:03.500
has been shattered with the introduction

11:03.500 --> 11:04.940
of the NVIDIA binary driver.

11:04.940 --> 11:06.600
Not only have I had that obnoxious system

11:06.600 --> 11:10.560
to UDEV issue, which is being managed at this point,

11:10.560 --> 11:12.680
but there's just other weird things,

11:12.680 --> 11:15.880
like now my displays don't properly line up correctly.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.440
I'd never had some of these issues

11:17.440 --> 11:19.400
that I've had, like stuttering windows,

11:19.400 --> 11:21.400
and having my display not line up correctly

11:21.400 --> 11:22.720
when I'm using the Intel driver.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.800
But I switch over to the NVIDIA binary driver,

11:24.800 --> 11:27.680
and Bob's your uncle, and now I'm having problems.

11:27.680 --> 11:28.360
Don't like it.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.480
No, I mean, that's rough.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.080
But if you do pay a lot for one of those nice NVIDIA cards,

11:32.080 --> 11:33.640
and you want to push a lot of frames,

11:33.640 --> 11:35.000
hopefully better support in the future.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.200
Yeah, I mean, exactly.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.440
You're buying a machine that's got a video card in it,

11:38.440 --> 11:40.440
and you're not going to just waste that $300, $400

11:40.440 --> 11:40.980
component.

11:40.980 --> 11:43.640
And we're trying to get to the world of Wayland.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.240
This is one more step.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.800
It's amazing that Mir can do this,

11:46.800 --> 11:49.360
and it's incredible they got there this fast.

11:49.360 --> 11:53.720
I imagine we'll see even more alternative desktops embedding

11:53.720 --> 11:56.280
Mir just for the support, and make it easy to have something

11:56.280 --> 11:58.920
of your own compositor without having to do all the work.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.920
Asus has begun digging their own grave

12:00.920 --> 12:04.800
by releasing encrypted kernel sources for the Zenfone Max

12:04.800 --> 12:08.840
Pro, Max Pro 2, and M2, and M Max 2, whatever the hell.

12:08.840 --> 12:09.520
Who cares?

12:09.520 --> 12:11.000
It appears that Asus has been releasing

12:11.000 --> 12:13.220
encrypting kernel sources for their Zenfone series.

12:13.220 --> 12:14.480
That's what I'm trying to say.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.320
The encryption apparently came into play

12:16.320 --> 12:19.240
since the last two code releases.

12:19.240 --> 12:20.560
And of course, the real issue here

12:20.560 --> 12:22.760
is this is likely a GPL violation.

12:22.760 --> 12:23.240
Yeah, right.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.160
I mean, if you release an encrypted file,

12:25.160 --> 12:28.560
and no means for anyone to decrypt it, what is the point?

12:28.560 --> 12:30.200
You haven't released anything.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.440
No, it's just dumb.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.100
You know that anyone who wants to buy these phones

12:33.100 --> 12:34.600
because they might be interested in,

12:34.600 --> 12:35.800
they're probably enthusiasts.

12:35.800 --> 12:36.300
Yeah.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.720
And GPL violations are never good.

12:37.720 --> 12:38.640
That's just bad press.

12:38.640 --> 12:43.760
It seems like Asus has got to recognize

12:43.760 --> 12:47.160
that people that are buying their phones are geeks.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.120
You know, like it's a-

12:48.120 --> 12:49.800
How many Asus phone users do you know there?

12:49.800 --> 12:50.320
Yeah.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.600
So I don't know what they're doing with this.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.000
I do have some conspiracy bacon that

12:55.000 --> 12:56.360
sort of ties it all together.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.160
And what the hell do I know?

12:58.160 --> 13:01.360
And I'm just becoming a paranoid old man, apparently.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.360
But if I was going to fry any bacon about what's

13:03.360 --> 13:07.760
going on here, I wonder, Wes, if they're not

13:07.760 --> 13:10.360
trying to get us all nice and ready for a Fuchsia future

13:10.360 --> 13:12.320
where you're not going to be able to get out.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.560
And so they're just, they're taking away

13:14.560 --> 13:17.880
some of the legacy things about how Android phones worked

13:17.880 --> 13:21.440
and getting us ready for a life of Fuchsia.

13:21.440 --> 13:26.200
And I think this is perhaps the first step in getting us all

13:26.200 --> 13:27.400
to eat that shit sandwich.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.640
Is you first get them to take these first few bites.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.800
You haven't had kernel sources in so long anyway.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.480
Who cares?

13:32.480 --> 13:33.640
That's exactly what I'm saying.

13:33.640 --> 13:34.480
That is exactly-

13:34.480 --> 13:36.120
You don't get them on the iPhone.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.800
Right.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.160
We haven't shipped a device, even

13:39.160 --> 13:41.000
when we've been using Android for the last two years.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.560
I mean, let's say it's two years in the future, right?

13:43.560 --> 13:44.960
Why would you expect us to do a Fuchsia?

13:44.960 --> 13:45.680
Of course not.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.320
So when Fuchsia devices ship, it's just the norm.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.160
And this is something that I'm sure Google's-

13:50.160 --> 13:51.760
I mean, you look at across the line,

13:51.760 --> 13:52.600
it's just happening more and more.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.000
But this is a next level.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.920
Like locking on the bootloader is one thing,

13:55.920 --> 13:57.760
but the encrypted kernel sources-

13:57.760 --> 13:59.320
And just why publish them at all?

13:59.320 --> 14:00.720
It's so weird.

14:00.720 --> 14:04.280
Yeah, so it just seems like Asus is off the mark here.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.740
I don't know what's going on, but it

14:05.740 --> 14:07.320
seemed like maybe it was worth talking about,

14:07.320 --> 14:09.800
because you have to be able to make the right choice when

14:09.800 --> 14:10.920
you're purchasing this hardware.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.720
And so it's something to think about.

14:12.720 --> 14:13.880
Factor it in.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.400
Unless you're Westpain.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.920
Unless you're Westpain, then you're probably not

14:17.920 --> 14:19.880
buying an Asus phone, unless you're Westpain.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.520
Well, Westpain has two of them.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.640
Oh, it's more than that now.

14:22.640 --> 14:23.120
That's six.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.440
I keep them one in every pocket.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.640
Ha, ha, ha.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.000
I kid, I kid.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.520
All right, well, I really want to talk about our System76

14:31.520 --> 14:33.040
factory tour, but why don't we start

14:33.040 --> 14:34.640
with a little bit of housekeeping?

14:34.640 --> 14:35.800
Yeah, whoa, boy, whoa.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.040
I just got to mention the user air show.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.080
It's doing so good.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.080
Air.show slash subscribe.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.800
Go subscribe to it, because the boys

14:42.800 --> 14:45.120
have got a new episode coming out this week.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.080
And it is really meshed into a great show.

14:47.080 --> 14:51.800
Popey, Daniel Foray, and Joe Resington on that show

14:51.800 --> 14:52.760
make it so great.

14:52.760 --> 14:53.460
Occasional guests.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.960
I was on there once telling them about my near-death story.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.880
And they come up with really anything about life

14:59.880 --> 15:01.040
and the universe.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.800
They answer questions, hashtag ask air.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.200
You can just do a hashtag ask air.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.880
E-R-R-O. I say air.

15:07.880 --> 15:08.920
It's error.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.200
Hashtag ask error on Twitter, and they'll

15:11.200 --> 15:14.160
answer the questions about Linux or life in general.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.480
It's become that kind of show where

15:16.480 --> 15:18.400
the moment it's released, I listen to it.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.880
It's the first podcast I play as soon as it's released.

15:21.880 --> 15:22.920
It's never too heavy.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.800
You get some good serious topics in there,

15:24.800 --> 15:26.800
but with some laughs in between.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.640
The guys are clicking really good.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.520
It's just a good show.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.960
Air.show slash subscribe, because they'll

15:31.960 --> 15:33.960
have a new one out this week.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.760
So jump in on that stuff.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.440
And then, also worth noting for you students out there

15:38.440 --> 15:40.800
of Linux Academy, this is kind of a cool time

15:40.800 --> 15:42.560
if you've got some downtime in the holiday

15:42.560 --> 15:44.440
or if you want to sneak away from family.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.360
For each learning activity that you complete,

15:46.360 --> 15:50.020
between the 16th of December, so that's a couple days ago,

15:50.020 --> 15:53.160
and the 26th, the day after Christmas,

15:53.160 --> 15:56.600
Linux Academy will donate $1 to St. Jude Children's Research

15:56.600 --> 16:00.000
Hospital for every learning activity that you complete.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.640
So far, and we're just getting into this,

16:02.640 --> 16:05.520
they've raised $3,535.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.080
Nice.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.440
Which means people have completed

16:07.440 --> 16:12.400
3,535 learning activities too, which is kind of great,

16:12.400 --> 16:14.560
because while you're learning, you can also give.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.360
So there's more information on the Linux Academy blog,

16:16.360 --> 16:17.860
but all you have to do to participate

16:17.860 --> 16:21.640
is you just log in and take one of the 20,000 learning

16:21.640 --> 16:22.840
activities that's available.

16:22.840 --> 16:26.360
And once you complete it, it'll donate a buck.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.520
That's pretty nice.

16:27.520 --> 16:31.120
And then, last bit of housekeeping before we move on,

16:31.120 --> 16:32.920
Linux Fest Northwest.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.720
April 26 and 28, we just locked in,

16:35.720 --> 16:39.240
while we were down at System 76, the barbecue.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.840
So the barbecue is going to be on, the great barbecue.

16:41.840 --> 16:42.640
It's on.

16:42.640 --> 16:45.120
I think Saturday night is the night we're doing it.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.680
It's when we did it last year.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.720
And it's outside of Lady Joop's.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.920
Everybody is welcome to come hang out.

16:51.920 --> 16:56.000
BYOD and BYOF, which would be food and drinks.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.840
We'll have some, too.

16:56.840 --> 16:57.400
You want it, bring it.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.280
There'll be some there.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.520
We'll have a bit of a budget for it.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.520
System 76 will have a bit of a budget for it.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.680
So if you can't bring anything, too,

17:02.680 --> 17:04.320
if you've been traveling, you can't bring anything,

17:04.320 --> 17:07.080
still show up, because we'll be able to accommodate.

17:07.080 --> 17:07.960
Also, we've got a drone.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.120
I want to do a drone thing.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.280
I'm going to see if I can't bring two of my drones.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.280
Two grills and two drones.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.760
Have the TV going if we want.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.280
Have some music going.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.440
Bring out the HomePods.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.280
I think you have enough at this point, don't you?

17:21.280 --> 17:22.680
I had to ruin it with something.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.920
Anyways, Linux Fest, its 20th anniversary.

17:24.920 --> 17:25.920
We're going to be there.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.440
We'll be doing live shows.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.160
Joe's flying in.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.080
We're going to do a live.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.960
It'll be the first live Linux action news.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.360
We've never done one.

17:34.360 --> 17:35.000
It might be terrible.

17:35.000 --> 17:35.640
Who knows?

17:35.640 --> 17:36.920
That's breaking down all the rules.

17:36.920 --> 17:37.440
We'll see.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.600
I feel like we got it in us.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.320
Oh, it'll be great.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.520
I feel like we got it in us.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.320
So that's going to be really cool.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.200
We've been saving doing a live Linux action

17:44.200 --> 17:45.840
news for a special occasion.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.320
And I think this is going to be it.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.520
LinuxFestNorthwest.org, their 20th anniversary,

17:50.520 --> 17:53.600
past, present, and future, is the theme this year.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.320
And we're going to have some huge announcements.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.360
You know it's big when we're already planning it,

17:58.360 --> 17:59.240
and it's months out.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.040
So come out.

18:00.040 --> 18:00.480
Check it out.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.080
We'd love to see you there.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.320
LinuxFestNorthwest.org.

18:02.320 --> 18:03.320
OK, I'm done.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.600
Housekeeping is complete.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.120
Had to mention that.

18:06.120 --> 18:09.280
And I really do hope Linux Fest is a big party,

18:09.280 --> 18:11.240
because I think it's just going to be our best one so far.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.920
So I really do hope it all works out.

18:12.920 --> 18:13.880
It's just the best.

18:13.880 --> 18:14.800
I mean, it's the best opportunity

18:14.800 --> 18:15.880
to celebrate all the things we love.

18:15.880 --> 18:18.260
It's a culmination of stuff between the huge announcements

18:18.260 --> 18:20.480
and all the great people that you love.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.440
What could be better?

18:21.440 --> 18:25.080
OK, let's talk about our trip to Denver, Mr. Payne.

18:25.080 --> 18:31.080
So System76 contacted me around the time of about a week

18:31.080 --> 18:33.840
before the Thaleo was officially announced.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.000
They started emailing me back and forth saying, hey,

18:36.000 --> 18:37.120
we've got something coming.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.080
We want to show it to you, because it's kind of a big deal.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.160
And I think a lot of us will remember the initial messaging

18:43.160 --> 18:45.040
was about open hardware.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.960
Open hardware, I think, was the big part of the initial messaging.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.000
And of course, that means I immediately

18:50.000 --> 18:51.080
put my skeptical hat on.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.120
Boom, first thing I do.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.480
It's a big claim, right?

18:53.480 --> 18:55.700
And especially in our terrible world,

18:55.700 --> 18:57.160
we often have pretty high standards

18:57.160 --> 18:58.760
for what open hardware means.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.400
Well, and this is something that we

19:00.400 --> 19:03.120
got into in a few conversations, is there's not

19:03.120 --> 19:07.280
like one accepted definition of open hardware.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.080
Open hardware, I think, in the audience's mind

19:10.080 --> 19:13.000
is the Intel blobs on the board.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.280
But open hardware, in the industry's mind,

19:15.280 --> 19:18.760
is your plans, your diagrams.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.560
The idea, essentially, is could you

19:20.560 --> 19:23.360
take the plans from System76's GitHub page,

19:23.360 --> 19:26.080
go to a metal fab shop, and have them build you out a case?

19:26.080 --> 19:29.720
And the answer is, in this case, is yes.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.600
But that's not, I don't think, a definition

19:31.600 --> 19:34.440
that System76 is necessarily satisfied with.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.560
I think they are trying to push that forward further.

19:36.560 --> 19:37.900
We'll get into that a little bit.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.480
But I thought maybe we'd start with the essentials.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.520
So they contacted us and said, something's coming.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.880
And I said, well, I want to see it.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.320
If I'm going to believe this, if you're going to go build,

19:46.320 --> 19:48.040
I just have been extremely skeptical

19:48.040 --> 19:50.560
about the entire transition to a factory.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.880
Because they're a bunch of lovable hipster geeks

19:53.880 --> 19:55.640
that know how to use Linux.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.120
They can manage an ordering pipeline.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.620
They can work with outside vendors,

19:59.620 --> 20:01.440
assemble a few custom systems, and so on.

20:01.440 --> 20:05.680
We already know how hard, like other things like the Librem.

20:05.680 --> 20:08.360
It's just difficult, especially with laptops and other things,

20:08.360 --> 20:11.400
to get all that stuff open as much as you can.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.840
And it was a new building.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.320
A factory is very different than customizing

20:14.320 --> 20:15.400
some hardware someone else builds for you.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.120
It's a totally different business.

20:17.120 --> 20:17.680
It's a totally different business.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.400
It really is, right?

20:18.400 --> 20:18.880
Yeah.

20:18.880 --> 20:23.200
And it's not like they have a bunch of warehouse experts

20:23.200 --> 20:26.680
and people that know how to manage this huge equipment

20:26.680 --> 20:27.180
on staff.

20:27.180 --> 20:28.720
They're pretty lean operation already.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.520
So it would mean learning those things.

20:31.520 --> 20:35.520
And that just, to me, seems nearly impossible

20:35.520 --> 20:38.520
when you're also trying to launch an operating system

20:38.520 --> 20:41.120
and manage an existing business, support

20:41.120 --> 20:43.440
your existing customers.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.840
I was very skeptical.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.240
So I was like, I got to see this.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.280
You got to show it to me.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.360
I got to see it.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.300
And they said, OK, good enough.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.400
When the factory is ready, we'll fly you guys out.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.840
And you can see it with your own eyes.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.160
That was back in October or so.

20:55.160 --> 20:55.880
I don't remember.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.040
And sure enough, they made good on that deal.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.840
And they flew Wes and I out as well

20:59.840 --> 21:02.680
as six or seven other journalists, I guess,

21:02.680 --> 21:08.480
five or six other journalists, and gave us the full tour.

21:08.480 --> 21:12.000
And prove me wrong.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.360
Prove me wrong.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.840
They're not, I'm not going to sit here and tell you

21:15.840 --> 21:17.940
that they've mastered how to run a factory

21:17.940 --> 21:19.400
and that they're cranking out systems

21:19.400 --> 21:21.000
at an unbelievable volume.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.600
They're still in that learning curve, hockey puck curve

21:24.600 --> 21:25.100
right now.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.920
They're still stuck in that learning curve.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.840
And they're still figuring out how to build these faster.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.540
They're still figuring out the best way

21:31.540 --> 21:34.160
to even lay out the warehouse.

21:34.160 --> 21:39.760
But they are, to be honest, three years ahead of where

21:39.760 --> 21:40.800
I thought they would be.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.960
I mean, I know that was pretty harsh on my part.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.960
But they are cranking out systems.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.200
They are building them.

21:47.200 --> 21:51.000
And they are not sacrificing attention to detail

21:51.000 --> 21:51.720
in the process.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.800
That's the big part right there.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.600
They're not just cranking out any old thing.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.480
They're doing so with a high degree of quality.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.640
So the real reason we came down there

21:59.640 --> 22:02.120
was to see this factory and see Thaleo

22:02.120 --> 22:03.800
and see what it was all about.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.120
And to that end, they really went all out.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.120
So they flew us in.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.240
They set us up in hotels.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.400
Then they brought us in for a Friday tour.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.240
It starts with a back story where

22:13.240 --> 22:16.080
we learn that it's been three years in the making.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.300
And the different industrial design iterations

22:18.300 --> 22:19.640
they went through to get where they're at,

22:19.640 --> 22:21.940
the incorporation of the wood, the look of it.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.240
And they demonstrated how, at the same time,

22:24.240 --> 22:28.360
they had another team running simultaneously,

22:28.360 --> 22:31.160
figuring out the internal components, the arrangement.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.400
But the practical matters.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.000
How do we actually put this together?

22:34.000 --> 22:34.800
Mm-hmm.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.100
And so the way they did this over the last three years

22:37.100 --> 22:39.800
was have these two different tracks of development

22:39.800 --> 22:44.480
running simultaneously and build out a lot of this

22:44.480 --> 22:47.560
at the same time and then come together.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.840
And it really seems to have resulted

22:49.840 --> 22:52.320
in a very high quality PC.

22:52.320 --> 22:55.040
I wrote up a blog, and I have some pictures,

22:55.040 --> 22:57.620
over at linuxunplug.com slash articles.

22:57.620 --> 22:59.620
You can look at the System76 tour,

22:59.620 --> 23:02.400
including a video of them dipping the machines in acid.

23:02.400 --> 23:08.080
The thing that jumped out at me was the clear amount

23:08.080 --> 23:13.080
of enthusiasm about being able to apply all of these lessons

23:13.080 --> 23:15.480
that they were probably very frustrated

23:15.480 --> 23:17.880
by working with other OEMs over the years.

23:17.880 --> 23:21.160
So many of the components that they talked about

23:21.160 --> 23:22.640
were things that had been inspired

23:22.640 --> 23:25.400
by solving problems of past machines that they've shipped.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.400
You can really tell, right?

23:26.400 --> 23:27.240
They've dealt with this.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.240
They haven't been happy.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.880
But there's no solution except if you

23:29.880 --> 23:31.240
can manufacture it yourself.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.280
And sometimes it's small things, like a custom-built,

23:34.280 --> 23:37.840
custom-printed bracket to hold the GPU in place.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.840
And other times, it's just having motherboard standoffs

23:40.840 --> 23:43.480
at a certain height because they know that this is the height

23:43.480 --> 23:45.120
they prefer for their motherboard standoffs.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.540
Thinking about it's easier to service.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.040
It'll be cleaner to get connections.

23:48.040 --> 23:48.560
Mm-hmm.

23:48.560 --> 23:52.160
And they really agonized over every little detail

23:52.160 --> 23:53.840
about the airflow and all of this.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.000
And that was very, very impressive.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.400
But the bigger thing for me that I walked away

24:00.400 --> 24:04.560
from this thinking about was a lot of the same people

24:04.560 --> 24:08.640
that were working there the last time I visited back in 2015

24:08.640 --> 24:11.020
are still working there.

24:11.020 --> 24:14.200
And they have sort of risen to the challenge.

24:14.200 --> 24:16.800
They've all taken on a project that

24:16.800 --> 24:19.820
is bigger than just themselves and kind of pulled together

24:19.820 --> 24:23.360
as a whole company.

24:23.360 --> 24:26.160
And everybody has sort of leveled up in what they're doing

24:26.160 --> 24:28.520
and what they know and what their understanding is.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.320
And in a way, just about every person

24:30.320 --> 24:32.320
has had their hands on these first batch of machines

24:32.320 --> 24:36.320
that have gone out as they've learned this process.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.800
And so this small team was able to really play

24:38.800 --> 24:42.240
to their strengths and raise the bar

24:42.240 --> 24:44.240
and rise to the challenge, I think.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.760
Was that your assessment of it?

24:45.760 --> 24:47.080
Yeah, you can really tell.

24:47.080 --> 24:51.320
I mean, half the tour was kind of Karl's excited kind

24:51.320 --> 24:54.480
of impromptu lecture on how modern manufacturing

24:54.480 --> 24:56.680
at a small scale might work, you know?

24:56.680 --> 24:59.280
Just kind of going through all the pieces that you have to do.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.800
There's some fun pictures out there of you

25:01.800 --> 25:03.360
bending some metal as well, right?

25:03.360 --> 25:04.320
So all kinds of stuff.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.640
But you could just tell he'd put in the time.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.960
And it is as hard as it sounds.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.920
I would be a little daunted by that challenge.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.840
OK, I'll learn all these different components

25:10.840 --> 25:11.960
that you need.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.720
But they've done it.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.120
I mean, yeah, there's still a lot of efficiencies

25:16.120 --> 25:17.840
to be gained figuring things out.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.520
The other part that struck me was they're so excited about it,

25:20.520 --> 25:22.080
it seems like this is what they wanted

25:22.080 --> 25:23.920
to do the whole darn time.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.760
And they haven't gotten there everywhere, right?

25:25.760 --> 25:28.280
There's no custom-built laptop yet.

25:28.280 --> 25:30.080
But you can tell that's what they're

25:30.080 --> 25:31.000
trying to achieve.

25:31.000 --> 25:31.600
Yeah.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.160
So before they get to the laptops,

25:33.160 --> 25:34.680
they have to nail the desktops.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.160
And here's Karl talking a little bit about that process.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.240
We had two directions going at some time.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.960
We had kind of intentionally did them separate

25:42.960 --> 25:45.360
so that one wouldn't hold back the other.

25:45.360 --> 25:48.840
So while Kate was working on design,

25:48.840 --> 25:51.720
R&D was working on mechanical engineering.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.600
The idea was for them to get to a certain point

25:54.600 --> 25:56.680
and then merge the two together.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.200
And this is the beginnings of mechanical design.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.760
You see how different it is when you

26:00.760 --> 26:02.680
think from a mechanical design standpoint

26:02.680 --> 26:06.280
and when you think from a mechanical engineering

26:06.280 --> 26:07.360
to design.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.480
The margins you would imagine are better on desktops.

26:10.480 --> 26:13.160
And I asked Karl, do you sell more laptops

26:13.160 --> 26:14.280
or do you sell more desktops?

26:14.280 --> 26:17.480
And it was a clear, we sell more laptops.

26:17.480 --> 26:21.240
So I said, how then are you making this work?

26:21.240 --> 26:23.360
You set up this whole factory to build desktops

26:23.360 --> 26:25.400
and you sell more laptops than you sell desktops.

26:25.400 --> 26:28.160
He said, yes, but the thing is the sale of the desktops

26:28.160 --> 26:31.360
has financed this entire operation.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.080
And think about what that means for a moment.

26:33.080 --> 26:38.720
It means that a company that sells Linux-only desktops

26:38.720 --> 26:41.480
has been able to successfully finance a company now

26:41.480 --> 26:44.800
for many years, more than 12 years,

26:44.800 --> 26:47.400
and build out a factory, including all of the things

26:47.400 --> 26:49.440
that it means moving staff.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.520
It means building office spaces.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.560
It means setting up factory equipment

26:54.560 --> 26:57.540
that is of an unbelievable industrial scale.

26:57.540 --> 26:59.720
It means learning to work with acid.

26:59.720 --> 27:04.080
All of these things have been financed and lessons learned

27:04.080 --> 27:07.240
by the sale of Linux-running desktop computers.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.120
They haven't taken outside lending.

27:09.120 --> 27:13.720
They've done it with the sale of the desktops.

27:13.720 --> 27:17.560
That's a big achievement right there.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.080
I think that's really nice.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.360
And I think one of the things that really stood out to me

27:21.360 --> 27:26.880
is what a unique individual Carl is.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.600
I mean, I've always felt this way.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.740
But watching him, one of the things

27:32.740 --> 27:35.320
that's interesting about Carl is he gets everyone's attention

27:35.320 --> 27:36.760
by being a soft talker.

27:36.760 --> 27:43.240
So he manages to sort of get the whole room to take it down.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.720
Everybody has to be quiet to listen to Carl speak,

27:45.720 --> 27:47.400
which is an interesting technique.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.640
It would have been real easy to come off like you're bragging,

27:50.640 --> 27:52.760
showing people around the cool new factory you built,

27:52.760 --> 27:54.000
but not at all.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.520
No, there's a humbleness and like a kid in a candy factory

27:57.520 --> 27:59.000
aspect to Carl.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
He floats around.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.440
Guys, look at all these cool things.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.320
Aren't you interested?

28:02.320 --> 28:04.280
Yeah, he floats from station to station.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.640
And when we took a break to do some,

28:06.640 --> 28:08.800
we got unrestricted access to the staff.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.440
When we took a break to chat with the staff,

28:11.440 --> 28:14.020
Carl took that opportunity to then start

28:14.020 --> 28:15.600
going around from station to station,

28:15.600 --> 28:17.520
just kind of like a quality check-in.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.920
And you could see him sort of relay what he's

28:19.920 --> 28:23.020
looking for to the staff so they learn what to do

28:23.020 --> 28:24.840
as they're building the systems.

28:24.840 --> 28:29.080
And I think it's been an obsession for him

28:29.080 --> 28:30.640
for the last few months.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.840
They started opening these pre-orders

28:32.840 --> 28:36.180
on the beginning of November, and they were just

28:36.180 --> 28:37.960
shipping them as we were arriving that day.

28:37.960 --> 28:38.680
They were beginning to ship them.

28:38.680 --> 28:41.040
Yeah, some of the first went out then.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.440
But maybe we should talk about the Thaleo hardware

28:42.440 --> 28:43.000
for a moment.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.120
Probably, yeah, that's kind of a big piece.

28:45.120 --> 28:50.480
They're using, I think, any parts you'd be happy to buy

28:50.480 --> 28:52.200
yourself if you're building your own PC,

28:52.200 --> 28:53.640
good off-the-shelf motherboard.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.640
They've gone through and they've battle tested

28:55.640 --> 28:57.440
a few different systems.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.120
But it's nothing you couldn't replace yourself.

29:00.120 --> 29:01.200
It's a standard PSU.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.000
It's just a really good one.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.320
It's a standard motherboard.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.200
It's just a great one.

29:04.200 --> 29:07.800
It has standard CPUs, GPUs, all of that.

29:07.800 --> 29:11.880
The value really is in the whole complete package.

29:11.880 --> 29:16.720
Thaleo's process of being built is mind-numbingly

29:16.720 --> 29:18.600
detail-oriented.

29:18.600 --> 29:22.140
They really focus on every little aspect of the machine,

29:22.140 --> 29:25.720
the feel of the screw holes, the way the case slides down

29:25.720 --> 29:27.920
from the cooling system.

29:27.920 --> 29:30.320
They spent a special, special care trying

29:30.320 --> 29:31.720
to get the power button just right.

29:31.720 --> 29:32.840
Yeah, and they did a great job.

29:32.840 --> 29:33.800
Yeah.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.000
And so there's a process that goes

29:35.000 --> 29:37.600
into building these systems that any geek would be proud of.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.820
And of course, they're great parts,

29:38.820 --> 29:40.120
depending on how you spec them.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.360
They're very fast.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.120
And Wes and I were having this conversation.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.200
It seems like they're doing this huge commitment.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.840
And Linux geeks are often enthusiasts.

29:48.840 --> 29:51.040
They might just want to build their own PC.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.800
I mean, we certainly both have, right?

29:52.800 --> 29:58.160
All the machines in this room have been self-built.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.280
What do you think about that?

29:59.280 --> 30:01.040
Do you think that they're taking a risk here

30:01.040 --> 30:04.040
by this huge investment into this desktop line

30:04.040 --> 30:06.040
when they're trying to sell to a bunch of users

30:06.040 --> 30:08.640
who are just going to go build their own?

30:08.640 --> 30:09.320
It's interesting.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.840
You definitely can go build your own.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.720
And these days, I think of that almost more as something

30:13.720 --> 30:15.400
to do because you want to learn.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.960
You're curious how to put together.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.680
And maybe sometimes because you can't get something

30:19.680 --> 30:21.880
on the market of the quality that you want.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.880
You know, like you want that you're going to have price

30:23.880 --> 30:24.160
or quality.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.600
You're worried just like, well, I could buy that.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.360
But it's not going to come with a great motherboard.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.280
Or I'm going to have to replace that PSU once I

30:29.280 --> 30:31.560
get my graphics card.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.880
I would be hard pressed without turning it

30:33.880 --> 30:38.000
into a really big project to make you a computer as nice.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.720
Oh, for sure, yeah, especially with the wood casing and stuff.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.000
It really is a showpiece.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.160
So I think that has to be the market they're aiming for.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.400
It's to put it up on your desk.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.000
It's for someone who's either an enthusiast or a professional

30:50.000 --> 30:50.520
as well.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.320
I think that could be a big market for them

30:52.320 --> 30:54.360
because it's going to be powerful.

30:54.360 --> 30:55.000
It's quiet.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.600
It has an eye for being servants.

30:56.600 --> 31:00.680
There was some talk about producing some service videos.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.120
It's been built for serviceability

31:02.120 --> 31:04.240
by customer upgradability and serviceability.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.680
It's a big focus of theirs.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.280
Like you said, with the screw holes,

31:07.280 --> 31:09.280
they focus there that using extra durable ones

31:09.280 --> 31:10.200
so that they won't strip.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.200
Yeah, they give you extra parts even

31:11.200 --> 31:13.760
so you can add more components after the fact on your own.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.840
So I think they could make a pretty reasonable play

31:15.840 --> 31:18.840
for just a responsible desktop that you know will

31:18.840 --> 31:20.840
be a five, seven-year machine.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.680
Well, it's kind of like I was saying to you

31:22.680 --> 31:24.120
on the pre-show before we even turn on the mics.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.280
It's like, I'm just kind of feeling like maybe I'm

31:26.280 --> 31:28.480
done distro hopping and desktop hopping.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.800
Like I just I'm ready to move on to a different phase

31:30.800 --> 31:31.480
and just work.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.920
And I feel the same way about my desktops.

31:33.920 --> 31:38.920
I have been building my desktops since the 90s.

31:38.920 --> 31:41.680
And now I'm kind of done doing that.

31:41.680 --> 31:42.480
Like I've done it.

31:42.480 --> 31:44.400
And now I just want to use the computer.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.560
I don't want a project.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.320
I want to just get to work on my other work

31:47.320 --> 31:48.560
that I have, my other projects.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.120
I don't want another one.

31:50.120 --> 31:53.240
So I was really impressed by this machine

31:53.240 --> 31:54.760
when I started thinking about it for my use cases.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.600
I think the other part you have to consider, too,

31:56.600 --> 31:59.600
is so there's the model that we mostly saw.

31:59.600 --> 32:02.640
But there's bigger models of the same form factor, right?

32:02.640 --> 32:04.120
That was the other thing that struck me

32:04.120 --> 32:05.920
is how small the standard Thalia was.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.360
Oh, it's a very compact.

32:07.360 --> 32:07.960
Yeah.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.280
It's like a mini ITX size.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.880
But I don't know if it's actually mini ITX.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.420
But then they have minor and major.

32:13.420 --> 32:14.880
They have different models they're going to be rolling out.

32:14.880 --> 32:15.720
Major and massive?

32:15.720 --> 32:16.240
Yes.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.240
And then there will be a minor.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.360
Minor, which will be more like a NUC, which

32:19.360 --> 32:20.560
is going to be really cool.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.320
That's fascinating.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.720
But they have these really big, beefy machines

32:23.720 --> 32:26.160
with multiple GPUs and tons of fast drives.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.720
So you know that's going for some professional use cases,

32:28.720 --> 32:28.920
right?

32:28.920 --> 32:31.360
So those are going to be people who maybe are doing machine

32:31.360 --> 32:34.640
learning or are managing big arrays of storage.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.140
I can see it playing well there, too,

32:36.140 --> 32:38.880
because you also get that nice wood veneer.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.180
So they've moved into a factory.

32:41.180 --> 32:43.880
They've been developing this thing for three years.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.040
And they're a small business.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.000
Just think about the investment that is.

32:48.000 --> 32:54.920
They have reshaped the company in order to build this thing.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.080
As a business, this may be the biggest risk.

32:57.080 --> 32:59.320
It must be the biggest risk he's ever taken.

32:59.320 --> 32:59.960
It's got to be.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.720
I mean, the whole, I mean, now even their physical layout,

33:01.720 --> 33:02.240
right?

33:02.240 --> 33:04.520
There's a couple of small offices and then

33:04.520 --> 33:06.120
a big old factory building.

33:06.120 --> 33:08.040
And it's also been an ask.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.960
Some of the staff have moved or are moving to get closer now

33:10.960 --> 33:13.040
because there's a different location.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.600
So I said to Carl, is this something

33:15.600 --> 33:17.280
that's going to be around for a while?

33:17.280 --> 33:19.840
Is this the future line of desktop?

33:19.840 --> 33:21.360
So that's exactly what it is.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.440
This is our next decade of machines.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.960
We'll iterate the parts.

33:25.960 --> 33:29.920
They already have ideas for cool thermal, even cooler

33:29.920 --> 33:30.560
thermal designs.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.920
They have ideas for future machines.

33:31.920 --> 33:32.760
But right now, they're just trying

33:32.760 --> 33:34.600
to get this first one out, get it built.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.520
This will be the base platform that they're

33:36.520 --> 33:38.920
going to build on top of for the next 10 years.

33:38.920 --> 33:39.680
And they'll own it.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.360
They own the whole line now.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.620
And they even have their own operating system

33:44.620 --> 33:45.360
that runs on it.

33:45.360 --> 33:46.040
They sure do.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.520
You can start to see where Pop!

33:47.520 --> 33:51.880
OS has a bigger part in the picture here now.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.160
And then, of course, that daughter board.

33:54.160 --> 33:58.280
Yeah, the Thaleo IO board, which is a SAS backplane

33:58.280 --> 34:01.640
and also a controller for the thermal system.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.920
And the thing they're doing that's pretty neat about it

34:03.920 --> 34:07.840
is it can do thermals kind of like the way a Mac does

34:07.840 --> 34:08.700
thermals.

34:08.700 --> 34:11.200
So on Macs, they have the SMC controller

34:11.200 --> 34:13.680
that Apple doesn't release drivers for.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.480
You know, you guys know I hate this.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.920
This is one of the things I caution people.

34:16.920 --> 34:17.680
One of those magic chips.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.600
When they're putting Linux on a MacBook,

34:19.600 --> 34:21.360
you don't get full thermal management.

34:21.360 --> 34:25.160
What you get is the Intel baseline emergency management.

34:25.160 --> 34:27.160
Just to make sure that it doesn't melt in here.

34:27.160 --> 34:32.200
Yeah, because the SMC controller is communicating with Mac OS.

34:32.200 --> 34:36.360
Now, the way System76 has done it is so much better.

34:36.360 --> 34:39.480
So the way System76 has done it is by using open standards.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.040
And it's on this open board that you

34:41.040 --> 34:42.560
can go get all the specs for.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.840
And we have information.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.240
I should put a picture in the blog of it if I haven't.

34:47.240 --> 34:48.640
That's a pretty important component.

34:48.640 --> 34:50.560
You're right, yeah it is.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.800
And it is a SAS backplane.

34:52.800 --> 34:56.160
And they can put multiple cards in if you have multiple drives.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.120
It's pretty cool.

34:57.120 --> 35:00.440
But the best thing it does is it combines data

35:00.440 --> 35:03.480
from the standard Linux temperature interfaces

35:03.480 --> 35:07.760
and the motherboard sensor inputs that are built into the motherboard.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.760
And it can aggregate all of the information.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.520
So the motherboard, for example, it

35:11.520 --> 35:15.680
doesn't know what the utilization of the GPU core is.

35:15.680 --> 35:20.080
And it doesn't know what the GPU core temperature is.

35:20.080 --> 35:23.040
But this little card does because the operating system does.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.560
So it can combine the sensors from the motherboard

35:25.560 --> 35:28.600
and the temperature data from the operating system

35:28.600 --> 35:30.880
and then intelligently drive the fans.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.440
So a basic motherboard controlled system

35:33.440 --> 35:35.640
will rev the fans if your CPU is under load.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.720
But your GPU, screw that, that's on its own.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.680
It's got its own fan, I don't give a crap.

35:39.680 --> 35:43.720
But with this system, without you having to do a damn thing,

35:43.720 --> 35:45.040
it will manage all of it.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.400
It will preemptively turn on the case fans up higher

35:47.400 --> 35:49.480
if the GPU is under a massive load.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.280
It's really cool.

35:51.280 --> 35:54.640
And the other thing that they've done is they've made it really clean

35:54.640 --> 35:56.480
to run all the SATA wires using this thing.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.840
So you plug everything into that and it's just nice and clean,

35:58.840 --> 35:59.800
minimal wires.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.600
Because they designed the whole thing,

36:01.600 --> 36:03.520
the wiring in there is really well thought out.

36:03.520 --> 36:05.160
So it's all exposed and accessible.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.520
You can change it if you need to.

36:06.520 --> 36:09.400
But it's also not in the way you don't have this big cluster of wires

36:09.400 --> 36:12.520
in the middle of a case that you often find.

36:12.520 --> 36:13.160
Yeah.

36:13.160 --> 36:16.440
So the performance, I think, is going to be great.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.520
And the design is literally the best built PC

36:19.520 --> 36:20.640
I've ever seen in my life.

36:20.640 --> 36:24.720
It's just, I mean, I just can't even believe the things

36:24.720 --> 36:29.600
that they are caring to worry themselves about.

36:29.600 --> 36:30.520
That's what I come back to.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.440
This is obviously now their moment.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.360
In the blog post, I put it this way, it's

36:35.360 --> 36:38.080
like letting a dog that just desperately wants to run around and play

36:38.080 --> 36:39.520
finally off the leash.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.200
And that's what System76 is like now with this.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.920
They're just doing all the things they've never been able to do.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.800
And they still have a long journey ahead of them.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.360
They still have much to learn.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.800
They still have to figure out how to build laptops.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.560
And even if this space will work out for them long term or not,

36:53.560 --> 36:55.640
all of these things are still up in the air.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.000
But I walked away from that with a confidence

36:58.000 --> 36:59.960
that they're actually going to pull it off.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.680
Yeah, I'm betting on that group again.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.240
That was how I walked away from that.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.360
OK.

37:04.360 --> 37:08.000
I may even eventually in 2019 be a Thaleo desktop owner.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.840
I could really see myself getting one of these for a workstation.

37:10.840 --> 37:13.960
If they can't, maybe no one can.

37:13.960 --> 37:14.720
Yeah, that too.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.760
That too, I suppose.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.560
I think still they have a lot on their plate.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.800
Pulling off Pop OS and building up the factory

37:19.800 --> 37:22.480
and keeping everybody happy is going to be really tricky.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.640
And the customer demand will be off the hook

37:24.640 --> 37:26.160
if they can get laptops working.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.240
That's going to be.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.000
Yeah, scaling those laptops is obviously

37:29.000 --> 37:32.800
a whole other world of existence with different criteria.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.840
Denver itself is a unique place.

37:35.840 --> 37:39.400
And that plays into a little bit of System76's culture.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.280
I think the other thing that's happening here

37:41.280 --> 37:45.320
is the company is owning its identity a little more.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.080
You see it.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.520
They have the robot artwork now.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.240
They have the sort of the sci-fi theme.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.360
They've brought on Kate, their industrial designer.

37:51.360 --> 37:54.240
And she's really kind of gotten that whole messaging.

37:54.240 --> 37:55.200
Nailed it, I think.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.400
She's really gotten that all together.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.080
One thing I heard them say was lean into the weird.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.000
They're proud of it.

38:00.000 --> 38:00.840
They are who they are.

38:00.840 --> 38:04.600
They're proud of their kind of geeky, nerdy culture.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.600
And they just embrace it.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.080
They just embraced it with failure.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.500
They put the Rocky Mountains on the side of the case.

38:10.500 --> 38:15.240
They put the Unix Epoch solar system time on the exhaust fan.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.360
There's all kinds of little small Easter eggs

38:17.360 --> 38:18.600
throughout everything.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.640
Even, well, I don't want to spoil it for you,

38:20.640 --> 38:22.440
but there's Easter eggs throughout a lot of the stuff

38:22.440 --> 38:23.640
that they've built into this.

38:23.640 --> 38:26.200
There's just things that a company only

38:26.200 --> 38:28.560
does when they're really enjoying what they're doing.

38:28.560 --> 38:31.840
And each person really owns their part of the process.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.360
They own it in a way where they want

38:34.360 --> 38:37.860
to bring something unique to it that represents them.

38:37.860 --> 38:40.880
And it creates a very compelling product.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.040
And I hope there's a market for it.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.400
I hope they sell a whole bunch of Linux running desktops.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.240
I don't even care what version or desktop.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.720
I just hope it's a whole bunch of them.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.040
Because it was pretty neat.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.160
So I guess we should also maybe revisit some

38:53.160 --> 38:54.880
of that open hardware stuff, right?

38:54.880 --> 38:56.480
So some things you can go check out now.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.560
You have a GitHub repo for the whole thing.

38:58.560 --> 39:00.520
It's got things like their bill of materials

39:00.520 --> 39:02.360
and a whole bunch of drawing files

39:02.360 --> 39:04.360
that you could go send to get some of the parts made.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.800
I mean, I think pretty much everything they've got now.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.320
I don't know if it's 100% complete,

39:07.320 --> 39:09.560
but that's what they're working on.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.440
Yeah, and they will iterate, they say,

39:11.440 --> 39:14.200
as they learn through the manufacturing process.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.440
They'll start iterating on those documents.

39:16.440 --> 39:20.200
So the bill of materials and the technical drawings

39:20.200 --> 39:23.320
and all of that is what qualifies them for,

39:23.320 --> 39:25.680
and the daughter board is what qualifies them for,

39:25.680 --> 39:27.360
is it, I can't remember the acronym,

39:27.360 --> 39:28.800
but it's an association.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.800
OSHW.

39:29.800 --> 39:30.320
Thank you.

39:30.320 --> 39:30.840
I was hoping you'd have that.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.680
The Open Source Hardware Association.

39:32.680 --> 39:35.840
Yeah, it's an association that seems reputable.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.600
We did some asking around about people that

39:38.600 --> 39:41.400
are familiar with the matter.

39:41.400 --> 39:44.760
And it actually seems like it's a pretty legit organization.

39:44.760 --> 39:47.960
And you can go reproduce one of these machines.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.520
You'd have to put your own components in it, your own

39:50.520 --> 39:51.680
motherboard and stuff.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.320
But you could.

39:52.320 --> 39:55.760
You'd have to go get your own wood and do all of that.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.000
But if you wanted somebody to chair it,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.440
it was like, I want one that's all white.

39:58.440 --> 39:59.600
I'm like, you could.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.160
Yeah, I mean, more so than in almost any other case.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.520
It's a fascinating world we live in,

40:03.520 --> 40:05.720
where you can go take these plans to a metal shop

40:05.720 --> 40:07.000
and have them build it for you.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.920
Who knows if they would be able to do it to the Precision

40:08.920 --> 40:11.560
System 76 wheel, because this is what they do.

40:11.560 --> 40:13.160
One of the things they were talking about,

40:13.160 --> 40:15.320
the usefulness of that, too, is like, OK,

40:15.320 --> 40:17.960
with the, Carl, what's going on about the unfortunate nature

40:17.960 --> 40:20.840
of the PCI spec and how not everyone really cleanly

40:20.840 --> 40:23.000
super follows all exactly the mounting.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.520
So now there are some open examples of just how

40:27.520 --> 40:29.960
to go build a computer case and know that components will

40:29.960 --> 40:31.920
actually fit and that the tolerances are right

40:31.920 --> 40:33.800
and that you will have built something that's not useless.

40:33.800 --> 40:36.360
Yeah, listening to them describe the lessons learned there

40:36.360 --> 40:37.760
was fascinating.

40:37.760 --> 40:42.320
This, I think, is a bit of a manufacturing success story.

40:42.320 --> 40:45.040
If this could get more traction, I

40:45.040 --> 40:47.040
think there could be some trade magazines that

40:47.040 --> 40:50.640
could tell a fascinating story here, because System 76 has

40:50.640 --> 40:55.200
built a modern factory using industrial 3D printers,

40:55.200 --> 40:58.320
huge, massive laser printers, or, I mean,

40:58.320 --> 41:02.880
laser cutters that draw more power than my entire RV draws.

41:02.880 --> 41:08.200
They have ginormous acid baths and huge baking ovens.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.360
And what they've been able to do is kind of pick and choose

41:11.360 --> 41:13.700
a more modern build workflow.

41:13.700 --> 41:15.720
They don't have like a 30-year factory.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.960
There's not a lot of legacy here.

41:16.960 --> 41:17.640
No legacy.

41:17.640 --> 41:18.440
This is brand new.

41:18.440 --> 41:21.800
So if 3D printing is the best way to build this component,

41:21.800 --> 41:22.760
we'll 3D print it.

41:22.760 --> 41:25.000
And if a laser cutter is the best way to do this,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.560
we'll use this laser cutter.

41:27.560 --> 41:30.560
And I think, including other more modern materials that

41:30.560 --> 41:32.080
are going into the build process,

41:32.080 --> 41:34.760
I think that is, in a way, been their advantage,

41:34.760 --> 41:36.960
because they were able to go with just stuff that's

41:36.960 --> 41:41.580
approachable and runs Linux, too, which is also really cool.

41:41.580 --> 41:43.160
I think there's more to this story

41:43.160 --> 41:45.600
than what our trade covers.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.440
I think there's other trade coverage out there

41:47.440 --> 41:49.640
that could tell a very fascinating story of how

41:49.640 --> 41:52.560
this, essentially, a startup in Denver.

41:52.560 --> 41:54.520
It's a very agile move for their business,

41:54.520 --> 41:55.640
that kind of repositioning.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.600
Now building computers in the United States, too,

41:57.600 --> 41:58.640
which is really neat.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.720
I was really happy to see it's working out for them.

42:03.720 --> 42:05.320
And I hope they can pull it off.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.280
And I think if I was going to make a guess,

42:07.280 --> 42:09.120
they're about a year and a half, two years off

42:09.120 --> 42:10.120
from building laptops.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.560
So I'd say set your expectations accordingly for that one.

42:12.560 --> 42:13.920
That's going to be a little while.

42:13.920 --> 42:16.300
Yeah, just satisfy yourself with a shiny new desktop

42:16.300 --> 42:17.200
you can show off to your friends.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.000
It's better anyways.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.440
It is better anyways.

42:20.440 --> 42:23.440
You guys know what my biggest thing was, is I was happy to report

42:23.440 --> 42:26.520
that even under heavy, heavy load, it was not very loud.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.840
It was very quiet.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.320
It would make a lovely studio machine, wouldn't it?

42:30.320 --> 42:32.680
Gosh, I know.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.600
Get some big, big hard drives in there, too,

42:34.600 --> 42:37.040
so we no longer run out of space when we're recording.

42:37.040 --> 42:39.120
Nice and super fast, so it renders in seconds.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.680
Oh, it'd be great.

42:40.680 --> 42:44.040
Maybe, maybe one day.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.120
They're back on my potential buy list.

42:46.120 --> 42:47.080
I'm back on board.

42:47.080 --> 42:48.400
I think they're doing great.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.680
We have a couple of emails that came into the show, Mr. Payne.

42:50.680 --> 42:52.920
And Mummaroom, feel free to help us answer these

42:52.920 --> 42:53.920
as we go through them.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.720
But we got an XRender tip that came in from Duncan.

42:56.720 --> 42:59.040
And he says, a couple of episodes back,

42:59.040 --> 43:01.180
there was some talk on how to automatically handle

43:01.180 --> 43:04.160
switching between various monitors and dock setups

43:04.160 --> 43:07.320
and the use of XRender scripts to do that.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.920
He said, I got this down, and I think

43:09.920 --> 43:11.640
I found a nicer alternative.

43:11.640 --> 43:15.320
Take a look at Auto Render.

43:15.320 --> 43:17.600
In fact, the man page subs it up pretty nicely.

43:17.600 --> 43:20.160
It basically allows you to plug in monitors, docks,

43:20.160 --> 43:23.200
configure XRenders required using whatever tool you prefer,

43:23.200 --> 43:25.920
then use Auto Render to save that config.

43:25.920 --> 43:27.680
And then next time these specific monitors

43:27.680 --> 43:31.840
are plugged in, Auto Render sets them up automatically,

43:31.840 --> 43:33.360
exactly how you had it.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.080
Take a look at it.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.040
Thanks, Duncan.

43:35.040 --> 43:35.880
That's pretty cool.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.880
Check out Auto Render.

43:37.880 --> 43:42.080
And that's Render with just an R at the end, no ER, of course.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.760
The other one came in, another email

43:43.760 --> 43:50.440
that came in that is following up on MB going proprietary

43:50.440 --> 43:52.240
is MiniDLNA.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.280
This is so cool.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.240
I didn't grab their name on this one.

43:56.240 --> 43:56.720
Did you see?

43:56.720 --> 43:57.600
You might have seen it, Wes.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.140
If you see it earlier on, let me know.

43:59.140 --> 44:03.580
But they write, have you ever covered MiniDLNA, guys?

44:03.580 --> 44:04.740
It's great.

44:04.740 --> 44:08.360
It's a simple streamer that I've used on Linux and FreeNAS.

44:08.360 --> 44:12.060
My son has a player on his iPad, and it plays back just fine.

44:12.060 --> 44:15.640
I use a VPN connection to home, and I stream over Plex.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.840
And it's actually now known as ReadyMedia.

44:18.840 --> 44:20.160
MiniDLNA is its old name.

44:20.160 --> 44:25.240
ReadyMedia is a very simple DLNA universal plug-and-play

44:25.240 --> 44:28.760
streamer that was originally developed actually

44:28.760 --> 44:32.600
for ReadyNAS appliances by, I think a, who makes ReadyNAS?

44:32.600 --> 44:33.720
Netgear employee.

44:33.720 --> 44:35.680
I believe a Netgear employee originally wrote this

44:35.680 --> 44:37.480
for ReadyNAS streaming.

44:37.480 --> 44:41.480
And it's a very minimal DLNA streaming server

44:41.480 --> 44:43.160
that you can throw on any Linux box.

44:43.160 --> 44:45.440
And then if you have a television that has DLNA client

44:45.440 --> 44:49.440
or a PlayStation or Kodi, you can just stream right to it.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.800
No Plex, no MB required.

44:50.800 --> 44:52.080
Very, very nice and simple.

44:52.080 --> 44:55.520
It's called ReadyMedia, previously MiniDLNA,

44:55.520 --> 44:58.680
and it's almost guaranteed already in your repo

44:58.680 --> 44:59.360
as MiniDLNA.

44:59.360 --> 45:00.560
It wasn't mine.

45:00.560 --> 45:02.320
Thank you, Eric, for that email.

45:02.320 --> 45:04.120
Ah, thank you, Eric.

45:04.120 --> 45:07.440
And then last but not least, a streaming solution

45:07.440 --> 45:11.400
submitted by our very own Mr. Wes Payne

45:11.400 --> 45:16.320
has potentially changed travel for the rest of my life.

45:16.320 --> 45:17.440
This is so cool.

45:17.440 --> 45:20.380
Longtime listeners of this show have heard Wes and I

45:20.380 --> 45:24.160
complaining that there's no really good solution for people

45:24.160 --> 45:27.000
in two remote locations to watch the same video

45:27.000 --> 45:29.560
file with synchronized play and pause.

45:29.560 --> 45:32.640
So that way, you can watch together even when you're not

45:32.640 --> 45:33.520
in the same room.

45:33.520 --> 45:36.240
Maybe you and friends want to marathon some Star Trek.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.760
Maybe you and the significant other

45:37.760 --> 45:40.560
are trying to watch a series while you're traveling.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.440
Streama could be just that.

45:43.440 --> 45:46.140
It's a self-hosted streaming media server.

45:46.140 --> 45:49.280
And apparently, it has the ability

45:49.280 --> 45:51.280
to do live sync watching.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.680
And we play around with it a bit.

45:52.680 --> 45:53.760
Yes.

45:53.760 --> 45:55.640
Now, it is not as full featured.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.360
One thing MB did a pretty good job of

45:57.360 --> 46:00.280
is it grew a lot of the features that Plex has.

46:00.280 --> 46:01.980
Not everything, they weren't one for one,

46:01.980 --> 46:03.640
and it has some of its own features.

46:03.640 --> 46:05.880
But it had all that metadata, media information.

46:05.880 --> 46:07.720
Streama's a bit more limited.

46:07.720 --> 46:10.560
You won't find all the support for things like Chromecast

46:10.560 --> 46:11.760
or the popular TV app.

46:11.760 --> 46:15.040
So for right now, it might not be the solution for everything.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.560
Hopefully, there's coming, there's

46:16.560 --> 46:18.280
pull requests for lots of things.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.200
They have issues, so obviously, this is known.

46:20.200 --> 46:23.000
But if you're just watching in the browser,

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
it was very smooth.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.840
There was a little hiccup here and there,

46:25.840 --> 46:28.800
but with very little effort, you and I were totally synced up.

46:28.800 --> 46:30.240
I could pause, you could pause.

46:30.240 --> 46:32.280
We could scrub, and it would move right along with us.

46:32.280 --> 46:34.040
It would move the other person's playhead.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.920
It was so great.

46:35.920 --> 46:36.920
Setup is really simple.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.640
It's a Java app, so you drop the Java app

46:38.640 --> 46:40.320
in a directory with the videos, and it just

46:40.320 --> 46:41.560
indexes the videos in that directory,

46:41.560 --> 46:42.280
or do you point it at it?

46:42.280 --> 46:43.000
You can just point it at it.

46:43.000 --> 46:43.640
OK.

46:43.640 --> 46:45.120
It's got a YAML configuration.

46:45.120 --> 46:47.360
It's not the simplest thing, but it's also not that complex.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.160
And you just download one file, and it's

46:49.160 --> 46:50.600
got some decent documentation.

46:50.600 --> 46:52.480
It could use more fleshing out in some areas,

46:52.480 --> 46:54.240
but it'll get you up and running.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.680
And it indexes the videos, so it gives you a web UI

46:56.680 --> 46:57.800
to choose from to which video to watch.

46:57.800 --> 46:58.880
Yes, you can manually upload.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.400
You can also configure it to tell it which directory you're

47:01.400 --> 47:02.480
trying to store all the stuff.

47:02.480 --> 47:02.880
Yeah, that's right.

47:02.880 --> 47:04.520
You can drag and drop upload video files.

47:04.520 --> 47:06.760
That is really cool.

47:06.760 --> 47:08.880
So it's not going to be probably your one thing.

47:08.880 --> 47:11.560
It probably won't replace Plex if you're a heavy Plex user,

47:11.560 --> 47:13.520
but it might be just another handy little tool

47:13.520 --> 47:14.120
you have out there.

47:14.120 --> 47:15.400
You've got a few videos, something like that.

47:15.400 --> 47:18.200
You're watching the season of a show, something like that.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.880
And the other thing that's really nice

47:19.880 --> 47:21.600
is you can start it up, you can select it,

47:21.600 --> 47:23.480
and then you can just generate a share URL.

47:23.480 --> 47:24.920
And it's a session URL.

47:24.920 --> 47:26.400
You can send that to people over whatever message.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.000
It also supports anonymous access,

47:28.000 --> 47:29.760
so you could even set it up that way.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.160
That's pretty cool.

47:31.160 --> 47:35.480
So that's Streamya, Streama, which is S-T-R-E-A-M-A.

47:35.480 --> 47:38.920
And of course, we will have a link to that in the show notes.

47:38.920 --> 47:42.560
And yes, before you even ask, of course, it's open source.

47:42.560 --> 47:45.200
It's licensed under the MIT license.

47:45.200 --> 47:47.160
Good find, Wes.

47:47.160 --> 47:49.520
That is going to change the game for us.

47:49.520 --> 47:50.960
I'm very excited about that.

47:50.960 --> 47:52.400
Well, I'll read this next email.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.680
You work on setting your keyboard on fire, OK?

47:54.680 --> 47:55.760
Oh, I'm hard at work over here.

47:55.760 --> 47:56.240
You are.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.120
I should not drop the keyboard on the ground.

47:58.120 --> 48:00.320
You're going to.

48:00.320 --> 48:01.480
It's actually, in some ways, a little more

48:01.480 --> 48:02.600
tricky that it's two pieces.

48:02.600 --> 48:03.440
It really is.

48:03.440 --> 48:06.200
This is not helpful, although it is a neat design.

48:06.200 --> 48:06.680
It is.

48:06.680 --> 48:07.760
It looks really cool.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.080
And the wood is really nice.

48:09.080 --> 48:11.400
You know what it would go really nice with is a Thalia.

48:11.400 --> 48:11.880
It sure.

48:11.880 --> 48:12.560
Oh, man.

48:12.560 --> 48:13.160
Oh, geez.

48:13.160 --> 48:15.800
And then there must be wood mice out there, too.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.760
All right, well, Codyjustcody writes in.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.920
And he says, if systemd was giving me

48:19.920 --> 48:22.720
as many damn problems as it's giving you, Chris,

48:22.720 --> 48:26.960
with that Udev stuff, I would go straight up no systemd,

48:26.960 --> 48:29.640
and I would ban it from my box.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.680
Serious question.

48:31.680 --> 48:35.960
How do you remain patient when stuff like that goes so bad?

48:35.960 --> 48:40.200
How can you tolerate systemd, Codyjustcody asks?

48:40.200 --> 48:42.080
Quick recap.

48:42.080 --> 48:44.760
Previously, on Linux Unplugged, I

48:44.760 --> 48:47.000
have an issue where when I disconnect my eGPU

48:47.000 --> 48:51.360
dock, that's a word for you, my eGPU Thunderbolt 3 dock,

48:51.360 --> 48:54.640
and I boot up my ThinkPad with the dock disconnected,

48:54.640 --> 48:57.120
systemd Udev goes crazy trying to load

48:57.120 --> 49:00.040
the drivers for an NVIDIA card that no longer exists,

49:00.040 --> 49:02.400
because then at that point, I'm on Intel graphics.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.920
And we came up with a quick workaround,

49:03.920 --> 49:06.720
but a couple of people wrote in and have been really

49:06.720 --> 49:11.080
just jumping on the opportunity to abuse systemd here.

49:11.080 --> 49:12.680
And I kind of want to turn this around

49:12.680 --> 49:14.720
to the mumble room for a moment.

49:14.720 --> 49:21.080
Do you guys think that I am just sort of taking the abuse?

49:21.080 --> 49:23.340
Have I just become complacent with systemd

49:23.340 --> 49:25.640
and just rolled over and said there's no getting away

49:25.640 --> 49:26.640
from it?

49:26.640 --> 49:29.140
It didn't even cross my mind to go on a systemd rant

49:29.140 --> 49:32.240
when systemd Udev was eating up all of my CPU.

49:32.240 --> 49:35.920
Or would it just be junk anywhere?

49:35.920 --> 49:37.680
I'd like to know what the mumble room thinks.

49:37.680 --> 49:38.440
Brandon, I don't know.

49:38.440 --> 49:39.440
You're a systemd guy.

49:39.440 --> 49:40.520
What do you think?

49:40.520 --> 49:44.900
I mean, this is a difficult case that you have a plug-in GPU.

49:44.900 --> 49:46.720
That is not a normal case.

49:46.720 --> 49:49.520
Otherwise, I'm so used to systemd now

49:49.520 --> 49:52.120
that I can't even imagine living without.

49:52.120 --> 49:55.120
Yeah, that in part might be it.

49:55.120 --> 49:55.680
Yeah, OK.

49:55.680 --> 49:58.080
I mean, I think the way it works for me

49:58.080 --> 50:00.440
is this isn't an issue with systemd so much as it is a,

50:00.440 --> 50:01.640
yeah, it's a strange setup.

50:01.640 --> 50:03.180
I think that's a good way to put it.

50:03.180 --> 50:05.240
And I'm testing an edge case here.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.240
That's why I got this eGPU dock.

50:07.240 --> 50:07.740
I agree.

50:07.740 --> 50:09.240
It's a complete edge case.

50:09.240 --> 50:13.200
It's not something that is going to be

50:13.200 --> 50:14.640
on every system out there.

50:14.640 --> 50:16.440
You're going to have very few systems that

50:16.440 --> 50:18.080
are going to have what you've got.

50:18.080 --> 50:18.820
Yeah.

50:18.820 --> 50:21.480
And I think that's also why I'm having such performance issues

50:21.480 --> 50:23.180
with my two external monitors.

50:23.180 --> 50:28.440
I have two ASUS 2K monitors that are turned counterclockwise

50:28.440 --> 50:28.960
90 degrees.

50:28.960 --> 50:30.400
So they're vertical.

50:30.400 --> 50:34.360
And then in the middle, I have a 1080P built-in laptop display.

50:34.360 --> 50:36.800
And any time I'm using applications

50:36.800 --> 50:40.800
on the vertically turned monitors, they're really laggy.

50:40.800 --> 50:43.960
Like dragging them around and resizing,

50:43.960 --> 50:47.200
it's like old Mac OS laggy where the whole, it's like jerk,

50:47.200 --> 50:49.960
jerk, jerk, jerk as I resize the window.

50:49.960 --> 50:52.040
It's bad.

50:52.040 --> 50:54.440
And I think part of it is because of this strange setup.

50:54.440 --> 50:56.080
I have them rotated.

50:56.080 --> 50:59.040
They're 2K while the main display is 1080P.

50:59.040 --> 51:01.360
They're going off of the NVIDIA card.

51:01.360 --> 51:04.200
This whole setup is odd.

51:04.200 --> 51:07.360
And it's probably not one that many Plasma developers or KWin

51:07.360 --> 51:08.960
developers have.

51:08.960 --> 51:13.960
And I wonder if this isn't an area where, as Linux users,

51:13.960 --> 51:16.880
we've just kind of come to accept it a little bit.

51:16.880 --> 51:19.260
Oh, you know, it's not a very common setup.

51:19.260 --> 51:21.440
It's an edge case.

51:21.440 --> 51:24.280
But you know, that's not something Mac or Windows users

51:24.280 --> 51:25.720
have to say as much.

51:25.720 --> 51:28.280
Yeah, I was about to say, on the other hand,

51:28.280 --> 51:29.800
there's no reason why you shouldn't

51:29.800 --> 51:34.720
be able to rotate a monitor and have it just work.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.200
It should just work.

51:36.200 --> 51:39.520
But the functional issue is that simply not enough people

51:39.520 --> 51:42.800
in the community that write software are using that setup.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.920
But a commercial company would hire somebody,

51:45.920 --> 51:49.000
would pay somebody to grind that work out.

51:49.000 --> 51:54.920
Unity 7 is famous for having great multi-monitor support.

51:54.920 --> 51:59.640
Like, up to six monitors, it could be rock solid.

51:59.640 --> 52:02.240
And so finally, we asked, why is it?

52:02.240 --> 52:05.780
Why is it that Unity is able to handle fractional scaling

52:05.780 --> 52:07.840
high DPI before any desktop did?

52:07.840 --> 52:10.200
Why does it have great multi-monitor support, even up

52:10.200 --> 52:11.320
to six monitors, even when you're

52:11.320 --> 52:12.440
using proprietary graphics?

52:12.440 --> 52:15.760
Why is it that it's better than everybody else's support?

52:15.760 --> 52:17.760
And they looked at us, and I won't say who,

52:17.760 --> 52:20.180
but they looked at us, and they chuckled a little bit.

52:20.180 --> 52:23.960
And they said, because Mark paid them to do that work,

52:23.960 --> 52:27.080
and he bought them a GPU, and he bought them six monitors,

52:27.080 --> 52:29.040
and he bought them a monitor mount.

52:29.040 --> 52:32.360
And they set up and connected six monitors to their computer,

52:32.360 --> 52:35.520
and then they developed software to support it.

52:35.520 --> 52:37.120
And that's why it was so good.

52:37.120 --> 52:40.640
So we better hope that IBM is providing Red Hat employees

52:40.640 --> 52:43.400
with a whole bunch of Thunderbolt trucks

52:43.400 --> 52:45.000
and vertical monitors.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.640
Please, please, some vertical monitors.

52:46.640 --> 52:47.280
They're great.

52:47.280 --> 52:48.680
If you haven't tried vertical monitors,

52:48.680 --> 52:49.920
they're the best thing ever.

52:49.920 --> 52:51.080
As long as you have landscape, too.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.240
I mean, how many sysadmins do they have?

52:52.240 --> 52:54.240
You'd think they would want that for their log files.

52:54.240 --> 52:54.760
Yeah.

52:54.760 --> 52:56.720
And this may not be an issue under NomeShell.

52:56.720 --> 52:57.400
I don't actually know.

52:57.400 --> 52:58.240
I've never tried it.

52:58.240 --> 53:00.040
Well, and by the same token, there's

53:00.040 --> 53:03.160
no reason why Blue Systems shouldn't be helping develop

53:03.160 --> 53:07.040
Kawin and Plasma to that extent.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.560
Yeah, and maybe that will happen.

53:09.560 --> 53:10.240
You're right.

53:10.240 --> 53:10.980
That could happen.

53:10.980 --> 53:13.200
But I feel like, really, this is one

53:13.200 --> 53:16.040
of the greater unspoken challenges of using

53:16.040 --> 53:19.920
an open source desktop, is there are sometimes deficiencies

53:19.920 --> 53:24.200
in areas that are not very common configurations that

53:24.200 --> 53:26.000
bite people that are maybe trying to sustain

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
a certain level of work.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.680
I'm getting kind of grumpy having

53:29.680 --> 53:30.920
my computer be really slow.

53:30.920 --> 53:33.400
And the other thing is it's kicking up my CPU fan now,

53:33.400 --> 53:36.040
which normally that never happened on this laptop.

53:36.040 --> 53:37.460
It's not the same machine anymore

53:37.460 --> 53:38.660
with these external monitors.

53:38.660 --> 53:41.800
I unplug these monitors and it's fine, but I'm less effective.

53:41.800 --> 53:45.120
So do I compromise my workflow and become less effective?

53:45.120 --> 53:46.880
Do I struggle through these issues,

53:46.880 --> 53:50.000
or do I start desktop hopping again?

53:50.000 --> 53:50.560
Just not.

53:50.560 --> 53:51.520
None of those are great options.

53:51.520 --> 53:52.020
Not ideal.

53:52.020 --> 53:52.920
Not ideal.

53:52.920 --> 53:56.920
So Kodi, just Kodi, it's not that I'm taking system D abuse.

53:56.920 --> 54:00.400
It's that it seems like whenever it comes to desktop computing,

54:00.400 --> 54:04.120
especially on a laptop, there is just some series

54:04.120 --> 54:05.940
of compromises you make.

54:05.940 --> 54:08.160
And you could look at it the other way.

54:08.160 --> 54:11.520
It's kind of great that I can plug a cable in and have

54:11.520 --> 54:12.880
a dedicated GPU.

54:12.880 --> 54:13.640
That's pretty cool.

54:13.640 --> 54:15.720
And then unplug that cable, and all I have to do

54:15.720 --> 54:20.560
is run one command, and now I'm rocking an internal GPU that

54:20.560 --> 54:21.520
has great battery life.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.640
Like, I get the best of both worlds.

54:23.640 --> 54:27.160
I just have to make a couple of compromises.

54:27.160 --> 54:29.960
Yeah, I think that's just the way it goes, Kodi, just Kodi.

54:29.960 --> 54:32.640
And Chris, there's no reason why you can't keep desktop hopping.

54:32.640 --> 54:34.440
I mean, me, I have a reason to.

54:34.440 --> 54:39.040
That's because I want to bring Ubuntu Studio to all desktops.

54:39.040 --> 54:40.520
OK, fair enough.

54:40.520 --> 54:42.120
Yeah, your reason is that you need

54:42.120 --> 54:45.000
to find out what's the best experience for you.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.080
Yeah, I'm just exhausted by it.

54:47.080 --> 54:48.080
I'm done with it.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.360
That's time you could be getting the other work done.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.200
Yeah, I've got to reload, or I've got to reset a batch.

54:52.200 --> 54:55.000
Make sure you budget 10% of your year for desktop hopping

54:55.000 --> 54:57.880
and trying new file systems.

54:57.880 --> 54:59.720
Yeah, at least you get paid to do it, right?

54:59.720 --> 55:02.240
That's true, although I also get paid to do other things

55:02.240 --> 55:04.640
that I'm not doing when I'm reloading distros.

55:04.640 --> 55:05.680
That's a tough call.

55:05.680 --> 55:06.560
It's a tough call.

55:06.560 --> 55:10.540
It's first Linux world problems, first open source world

55:10.540 --> 55:12.720
problems.

55:12.720 --> 55:16.400
The reality is, too, once I'm about midday and I'm done,

55:16.400 --> 55:18.600
I get to a point in my workflow where I'm not really

55:18.600 --> 55:20.280
rearranging Windows anymore.

55:20.280 --> 55:23.200
Telegram, Slack, Terminal is going here.

55:23.200 --> 55:24.160
Firefox is here.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.000
Chrome is here.

55:25.000 --> 55:25.640
VLC is here.

55:25.640 --> 55:26.680
You get to that steady state of, I've

55:26.680 --> 55:29.800
done all the things I do in a day, and now I'm just operating.

55:29.800 --> 55:32.000
It's fine, and then I'm not moving stuff around,

55:32.000 --> 55:33.960
and it's just great.

55:33.960 --> 55:35.920
Plasma is rock solid that way.

55:35.920 --> 55:37.640
But in the meantime, getting there

55:37.640 --> 55:40.360
is a bit of a challenge, so I like to tinker around

55:40.360 --> 55:42.640
and play with a few different apps on the command line

55:42.640 --> 55:45.040
to remind me why the hell I love Linux so much.

55:45.040 --> 55:47.680
So let's do a couple of app picks before we get out of here.

55:47.680 --> 55:49.960
Our first one comes from a company

55:49.960 --> 55:52.240
that seems to be releasing a lot of open source software

55:52.240 --> 55:52.800
these days, right?

55:52.800 --> 55:53.960
This is a Microsoft project.

55:53.960 --> 55:54.800
Microsoft.

55:54.800 --> 55:58.680
It's called Ether, E-T-H-R, and it's a cross-platform network

55:58.680 --> 56:01.680
performance measurement tool written in Go.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.480
It's either Rust or Go these days.

56:03.480 --> 56:04.200
Wait a minute.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.200
Let's just pause for a second.

56:06.200 --> 56:09.720
Microsoft is releasing a network performance measurement

56:09.720 --> 56:13.640
tool for Linux that's open source and written in Go.

56:13.640 --> 56:15.080
Isn't Go the Google language?

56:15.080 --> 56:16.520
It sure is, buddy.

56:16.520 --> 56:17.240
OK, all right.

56:17.240 --> 56:19.320
I just wanted to make sure I was following this.

56:19.320 --> 56:21.320
The goal of the project is to provide a native tool

56:21.320 --> 56:23.560
for network performance measurements of bandwidth,

56:23.560 --> 56:27.920
connections, packets, latency, loss, and jitter

56:27.920 --> 56:29.240
across multiple protocols.

56:29.240 --> 56:32.600
So you can look at TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS,

56:32.600 --> 56:35.040
and it also works on Windows as well.

56:35.040 --> 56:37.620
This, though, is pretty neat, because Wes,

56:37.620 --> 56:40.160
you were showing me a demonstration of throughput

56:40.160 --> 56:42.880
on HTTP versus TCP.

56:42.880 --> 56:44.520
Yeah, I mean, it's handy that it has that.

56:44.520 --> 56:46.420
Now, it doesn't have support for bandwidth measuring

56:46.420 --> 56:48.600
across everything, like UDP isn't implemented.

56:48.600 --> 56:51.360
So clearly, they're refining some of their capabilities.

56:51.360 --> 56:54.760
But it's very much inspired and feels like Iperf 3,

56:54.760 --> 56:56.600
but with more protocol support.

56:56.600 --> 56:57.440
And simpler, too.

56:57.440 --> 56:58.880
You just grabbed the binary and ran it, right?

56:58.880 --> 56:59.920
Yep.

56:59.920 --> 57:01.600
The other thing that really shocked me

57:01.600 --> 57:05.880
is we all know that an HTTP connection has less throughput

57:05.880 --> 57:07.920
than, say, just a raw TCP connection,

57:07.920 --> 57:09.720
because you've got all the overhead of the HTTP headers

57:09.720 --> 57:10.760
and all that.

57:10.760 --> 57:13.760
But when you ran this tool and you did a test,

57:13.760 --> 57:17.480
it was like a difference of you could get a sustained 1.5

57:17.480 --> 57:22.920
megabits over HTTP, and you could get 11 over TCP.

57:22.920 --> 57:25.720
That's a 10 difference.

57:25.720 --> 57:27.640
It's neat to see that kind of stuff broken out.

57:27.640 --> 57:30.560
And you can also see how damn fast UDP is and all that.

57:30.560 --> 57:33.000
I would actually, I'm thinking that if we still

57:33.000 --> 57:34.840
have that problem back at the LA office,

57:34.840 --> 57:36.520
this would be a handy tool for troubleshooting.

57:36.520 --> 57:38.440
Yeah, the Wi-Fi LAN issue that we were having,

57:38.440 --> 57:39.600
this would be pretty great.

57:39.600 --> 57:41.840
So Ether, a cross-platform by your buddies

57:41.840 --> 57:44.880
now over in Redmond.

57:44.880 --> 57:46.160
What will they think of next?

57:46.160 --> 57:46.880
I don't know, man.

57:46.880 --> 57:47.800
I don't know.

57:47.800 --> 57:51.500
Now, this next one isn't really an open source project.

57:51.500 --> 57:53.440
I don't think it might be.

57:53.440 --> 57:54.160
It's free, though.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.720
It's the coolest, coolest thing.

57:55.720 --> 57:57.360
I saw it going around on the web today,

57:57.360 --> 57:59.840
and I didn't know a super easy way to do this in Linux,

57:59.840 --> 58:02.280
so I thought this could be a handy tool for people.

58:02.280 --> 58:04.760
It's called remove.bg.

58:04.760 --> 58:06.920
And it automatically removes backgrounds

58:06.920 --> 58:08.560
in five seconds from an image.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.840
And it looks like it's really good.

58:10.840 --> 58:14.920
It looks like it's super, super good, actually.

58:14.920 --> 58:16.880
Like, if you spent hours in GIMP,

58:16.880 --> 58:18.000
you would probably not do this good.

58:18.000 --> 58:18.960
It's pretty handy.

58:18.960 --> 58:20.200
It's not perfect.

58:20.200 --> 58:23.480
I tested it with some of our System76 photos,

58:23.480 --> 58:25.180
and it does a decent job.

58:25.180 --> 58:27.520
If you've got something that's kind of light or like holding

58:27.520 --> 58:29.360
a glass, well, it does a bad job with that,

58:29.360 --> 58:30.880
or often hats can throw it off.

58:30.880 --> 58:34.060
But yeah, it's going to do a better job mostly,

58:34.060 --> 58:35.880
especially on things like hair, than I'm ever

58:35.880 --> 58:36.880
going to do in GIMP.

58:36.880 --> 58:38.280
The hair is the hardest part, yep.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.720
Yeah, if you have really what I think

58:39.720 --> 58:41.400
it's looking at contrast and things like that.

58:41.400 --> 58:43.160
So there has to be some clear differentiators

58:43.160 --> 58:46.640
between foreground and background for it to work great.

58:46.640 --> 58:48.460
But this would be a cool way to like meme up

58:48.460 --> 58:50.360
some of the folks from System76 and put them

58:50.360 --> 58:51.360
like in weird spots.

58:51.360 --> 58:52.760
I'm getting some ideas with.

58:52.760 --> 58:54.720
I'm getting some great ideas.

58:54.720 --> 58:56.960
So that is over at remove.bg, and we'll

58:56.960 --> 58:58.300
have a link in the show notes.

58:58.300 --> 59:00.000
If you want to get those picks this week,

59:00.000 --> 59:01.620
and if you've got a pick you'd like to send our way,

59:01.620 --> 59:02.880
please send it in.

59:02.880 --> 59:07.120
linuxunplug.com slash contact, or linuxunplug.reddit.com.

59:07.120 --> 59:09.120
We're monitoring those locations,

59:09.120 --> 59:13.120
and really kind of want to maybe open up the field.

59:13.120 --> 59:14.520
We kind of have our grooves, but we'd

59:14.520 --> 59:15.840
love to get your app picks out there.

59:15.840 --> 59:17.880
Maybe you're looking at stuff we don't even think about.

59:17.880 --> 59:19.200
There's just so many, and honestly, it's

59:19.200 --> 59:20.680
a lot of fun on our side to go just

59:20.680 --> 59:23.560
evaluate these random things, because very surprisingly often

59:23.560 --> 59:25.120
you find a diamond in the rough.

59:25.120 --> 59:28.280
You know, like that mini DLNA that's now ready deal,

59:28.280 --> 59:29.040
ready whatever.

59:29.040 --> 59:29.800
Ready media.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.200
Ready media, thank you.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.400
That's been in my repository this entire time.

59:33.400 --> 59:34.780
I just didn't know it was there.

59:34.780 --> 59:35.480
That's a really good one.

59:35.480 --> 59:37.240
If you've got stuff that supports DLNA,

59:37.240 --> 59:40.640
it's not quite as robust as some of the richer programs

59:40.640 --> 59:41.800
for things like transcoding.

59:41.800 --> 59:43.200
But if you just already have files,

59:43.200 --> 59:44.520
and you want to serve them, boom.

59:44.520 --> 59:46.640
There is a fork of it that will do transcoding.

59:46.640 --> 59:47.280
Oh, nice.

59:47.280 --> 59:47.760
Yeah.

59:47.760 --> 59:49.360
But so what Wes is talking about there

59:49.360 --> 59:51.960
is one limitation of that mini DLNA pick

59:51.960 --> 59:55.560
is that it will only play back on the devices that

59:55.560 --> 59:57.040
support the videos you're put out.

59:57.040 --> 59:58.520
How to say this?

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.920
It relies on client-side decoding.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.600
In other words, the TV or the set-top box

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.040
has to have that specific codec and support

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.000
that particular container.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.720
So if you've got a bunch of weird MKV files,

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.800
it may or may not work.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.320
The other problem is DLNA is just kind of a finicky thing,

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.800
and a lot of the client implementations

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.000
kind of vary in quality depending on the firmware

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.880
running on your television, for instance.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.720
But when it works, it works nicely.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.160
All right, Mr. Payne.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.840
Here we go.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.760
Now, two-episode journey in.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.560
First, bringing it up from its baby firmware,

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.840
an early build of the firmware.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.320
Flashing it, connecting it from your ThinkPad,

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.480
getting on there over the USB-C connection,

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.080
then loading in the LED control plugins.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.920
And now, Wes Payne, have you successfully

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.680
lit your keyboardio on fire?

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.280
Look at that.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:44.960
I sure have.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.680
Look at that.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.520
Now, OK, Chris, you're probably wondering,

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.560
it's only half on fire.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.160
Now, there's actually a bug in the current version

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.360
of the firmware and one of the default plugins for it

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.640
on the very handy Board Manager API

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.120
that they provide to integrate with the Arduino IDE.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.840
So that's nice if you go get the latest one from Git,

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.480
that's fixed.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.320
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to do it.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.040
But half of it's on fire.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:06.840
That'll spread.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.400
That'll spread.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.120
You know, the GIF that I'm playing on the screen

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.680
does not do it justice.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.040
It's way smoother and nicer.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:15.760
It's way nicer.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.040
It actually kind of looks like fires.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.920
It changes hues, and it's one color at the base,

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.120
and it flickers and goes up.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.120
You can imagine it's like a really small window

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:24.840
on a bigger fire.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.520
I actually legitimately, when I'm not using my computer,

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.600
would love to have that.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.880
That'd be fun, wouldn't it, just sitting at your desk?

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.600
Man, that is so cool.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.160
Well done, Wes.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.240
That is a big win for you on the old challenge

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.480
you managed to rebuild that thing, basically,

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.640
while also doing a live show.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.240
So I'm going to say that is a big congratulations.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:53.680
Way to get our Linux running keyboard back in action.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.560
That's pretty cool.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.560
And now we have a new reason to follow Keyboardia.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:57.880
We sure do.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.840
In the meantime, I had no idea that Wes was a pyromaniac.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.080
Yeah, he sure is over there.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:02.840
He's fighting it on fire.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.320
That's so nice.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.160
That's totally lit.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.360
No, it's only half lit.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.480
Oh, that's horrible.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.600
That's no good at all.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.240
All right.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:12.920
Well, let's see.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.200
On that particular bombshell, on that particular one,

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.840
let's get the heck out of here.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.640
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.400
of the Unplugged program.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.040
We have a lot in store for the holiday episodes coming up.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.400
On the 26th, we're going to be doing our predictions

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.960
and answering our previous predictions,

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.880
try to get those in before the new year comes.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.680
And then on January 2nd, we'll do our reflection,

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.880
our look back on the biggest stories, the biggest

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.040
things that happened to Linux.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:40.920
I love these.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.720
We've got a great list this year.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.200
And then we'll wrap it up with our magic wand wishes.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.680
If we could make anything happen in the open source world,

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.280
what would those be?

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.240
And I'd love to hear your thoughts.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.080
So join us.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.080
They'll be on the 26th and then on the 2nd.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.920
But thanks so much for being here this week.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.320
See you back here soon.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:57.800
Tuesday?

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.280
I don't know.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.000
Sometime.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:02:59.800
And the holidays.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.600
They ruin everything.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.600
Bahambe!

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:32.480
Yeah, it is.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.800
This is the last episode before the holidays.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.360
Happy fricking holidays, everybody.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.120
What?

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.680
Yeah, the next episode we'll be back, we'll be after.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.160
Yeah, we should marry Christmas, too.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:40.840
That's pretty good.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.680
That's crazy.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.240
Man, that is really something.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.520
Well, we had a week to go.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.520
Yeah, I guess that's good.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.080
I think I'm done shopping.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.040
I never am, though, because I'm so bad.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.240
Can't be.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.440
There's always somebodies I forget.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.440
I always forget somebodies, because I don't want anybody

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.440
to get me anything, really.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.800
Because all the stuff I want is really expensive anyways.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.280
And then I live in a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny home.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.840
You don't need extra stuff that you didn't really want anyway.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.280
I don't mean to be so.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.000
The things that I want are, you know.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:13.960
I mean, I don't know.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.160
I always say that, and then people

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.920
think of stuff to give me that's so thoughtful that I don't know.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.920
I'm always really like, aw.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.420
That's probably a short list, though.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.280
And what it is is I'm just a jerk.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.400
That's what it is, I guess.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.720
Mr. Bain, we've got to pick a title.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:25.640
Oh, guys, come on.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.320
We need your help.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:26.800
Yeah, we do.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.160
I'm plumb out of ideas.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.240
Oh, it was fun going to System 76, seeing everybody again.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.440
Making plans for our big barbecue at Linux Fest.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.720
That's what I'm looking forward to.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.760
It's just going to be, I bet you they're going

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.720
to bring some Thalios to Linux Fest.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.600
They probably should.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.320
Why would they not?

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:40.960
Oh, man.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.460
Yeah, Eric, you're coming, aren't you?

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:45.400
Dude, now that I no longer have a job,

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.240
I can definitely be there.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.200
Oh, well, it was on the weekend, man.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.680
Oh, yeah, well, the thing is I worked on the weekends.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.800
Oh.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.080
Well, that's worth it right there, then.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.920
Yeah, well, to be fair, I quit.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.900
I did not, I was not fired.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:02.680
I quit.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.760
You make sure that's clear.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.920
That's on the record.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.760
That's on the record.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.720
Totally on the record.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.000
Ben got a good one in there, the keyboard drama.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.820
If we're making this one about the keyboard,

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:12.840
that'd be a good one.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.440
I don't know what I'm going to do about this desktop situation.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.360
Part of me really thinks I should just use a desktop.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.640
You might just use a desktop.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.320
And just keep the laptop for laptop things.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.760
That seems like a good idea.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.360
Why didn't I think that?

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.120
That is simpler.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.880
That works if you have an office to go to,

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.320
but like myself who lives in a trailer, much like Chris

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.960
living in an RV, a moto home.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.960
Yeah, yeah, for home.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.800
For home, yeah, you definitely need the laptop.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.760
But for work, you know, that's so backwards, too.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.920
It used to be you need the laptop for work

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.680
and then the desktop for home.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.200
Yeah.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.240
Now it's the other way around.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:46.960
It is totally.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.360
It is totally the other way around.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.360
That's, hey, you know, I don't need all the horsepower

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.560
at home because I'm not trying to do as much stuff.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.760
When I'm in the office, I'm at work,

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.240
I'm trying to get a million things done

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.880
and trying to get it done as fast as possible.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.160
Yeah, I have a relatively powerful laptop, though,

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.520
so that way, because I need the horses in order

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.600
to do audio processing, clearly.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.720
I have a rack that's like 10 years old

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:13.800
I bought for less than $200 that it does great.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:17.920
And I just use a laptop that's pretty cheap as basically

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.480
a satellite most of the time.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.840
And yeah, there you go.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.800
Yeah, that's kind of what I'm thinking.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.720
That's exactly what I'm, that is exactly the setup.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.260
I mean, you could even use a Chromebook

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:26.360
for what I'm thinking about.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.560
Exactly.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.120
Chris, I meant to jump in.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.800
I'm sorry, Synergy crashed.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.400
Oh, that's so funny.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.240
Wait a minute.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.060
I thought we were supposed to be using

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:36.920
barrier or whatever it is now.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.600
I'm still using Synergy One, but.

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.040
All the feels, all the feels.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.360
Do you have thoughts?

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.200
Do you have thoughts?

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.340
Yeah, so I use.

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:48.320
By the way, for people listening,

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:51.640
I asked him if, Brandon, I asked Brandon

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.480
if he thought I was just taking the system to the abuse

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.640
and living with it.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.220
Yeah, I don't think so.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:00.720
But one, I think the, I think most of it is actually.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:05.200
Now, Thunderbolt docs for Linux users are pretty new.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.560
Like I kind of like, you know, for the most part, it's not.

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.400
It is.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.480
Like it hasn't been mainstream in the Linux world.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.920
So I think it's more so drive, more problem,

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.120
not necessarily at system D.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.760
I think it's more driver level.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.240
Well, so I think so.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.880
And I am like Nvidia and also Nvidia graphics

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:29.800
for hot plug from my experiences is terrible.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.880
Just asking for trouble.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.660
Well, who expects the GPU to be removed, right?

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.120
But also to dovetail on that,

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.840
because the best Thunderbolt support right now is in GNOME.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.480
It's not in Plasma.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.640
It's not in any other desktop.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.400
It's in GNOME, unfortunately.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.320
Yeah, that's true too.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.400
All right, let's do one bonus little quiz game

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.240
before we go for the day.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.440
All right, chat room, mumble room,

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.640
without looking, don't cheat.

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:57.960
What do you guess is the third most popular distribution

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.220
on DistroWatch right now?

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.520
Number one is Manjaro.

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.960
Number two is Linux Mint.

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.440
What, without looking,

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.720
is the third most popular Linux distribution

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.360
as ranked by the totally arbitrary DistroWatch?

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.720
I'm just going to plug a boot in his studio.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:20.180
Yeah, well done, sir, they're getting their value there.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.360
Anybody have any guesses?

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.800
Anybody, anybody?

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.760
Yeah, I'll tell you what, I was shocked.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.160
I was shocked when I saw this.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.680
Iana Gross is coming in from Bitten.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.960
A solid guess there, Bitten.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.680
That is a solid guess.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.400
Architect comes in with the answer.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.240
Let's go for it, everybody.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:46.800
MX Linux, MX Linux, the number three Linux on DistroWatch.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.920
MX Linux is a desktop-oriented Linux distribution

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.640
based on Debian's Stables branch,

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.520
and it's a comprehensive venture between AntX

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.960
and the former Mepps Linux communities,

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.080
or Meeps, how do you say, what?

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.200
You're laughing at me over there.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.380
I know I've got it wrong when Louis starts laughing.

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:04.300
And I didn't plan on reading this.

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:07.680
It uses XFCE for the default desktop.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.820
So there you go, Joe.

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.320
You've got a new desktop.
