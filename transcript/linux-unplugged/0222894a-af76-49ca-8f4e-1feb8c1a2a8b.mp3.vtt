00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 27 for February 11th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.640
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's watching the Debian mailing

00:40.640 --> 00:43.400
list and it's fresh all out of popcorn.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.400
My name is Chris.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.400
And my name is Matt.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.440
Hey Matt, here we are.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.960
We actually got the first word of it on Sunday as we were wrapping up last that it looked

00:50.960 --> 00:54.840
like Debian was going to go with Systemd and I thought, okay, that's good, but let's not

00:54.840 --> 00:55.840
run with it just yet.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.160
It's not even crazy, because Debian doesn't just make decisions like that, right?

00:59.160 --> 01:03.480
I don't just, boy, it has been an interesting couple of days.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.680
And I know a lot of you are thinking, why do we care so much about an init system?

01:05.680 --> 01:07.800
Well, we're going to talk about that a little bit.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.840
There's a lot of actual larger ramifications.

01:09.840 --> 01:14.480
I think a lot of people are very aware that Debian is the base of so many distributions

01:14.480 --> 01:17.320
and a lot of things are changing in the Linux world.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.600
And at the same time, some of these things are coming together.

01:19.600 --> 01:23.360
And that's what the Systemd discussion isn't just happening at Debian, right?

01:23.360 --> 01:27.200
It's been happening across all of the Linux distributions for a couple of years now.

01:27.200 --> 01:33.400
And the Debian one has been one of the most watched and, unfortunately, not really been

01:33.400 --> 01:37.520
the greatest example of open community collaboration.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.720
And we could get into that whole discussion about should this stuff be on a public mailing

01:40.720 --> 01:43.160
list, but it was.

01:43.160 --> 01:48.760
And I kind of want to talk a little bit about that, too, and if maybe we've sort of sent

01:48.760 --> 01:50.560
a bad signal to the rest of the industry.

01:50.560 --> 01:51.560
We'll see.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.040
I don't want to overstate it, but I think we'll discuss that aspect of it, too.

01:54.040 --> 01:57.760
I think at the end of this episode, if you haven't been sure why this has been a topic

01:57.760 --> 02:02.400
of interest for so many people, I hope by the time we're done, you will know why.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.160
You'll feel like you've got a good grasp on it.

02:04.160 --> 02:09.720
Hey, Matt, before we go too far, we should do a Valve update.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.040
I just thought this was really cool.

02:11.040 --> 02:16.240
I wanted to update a story we ran a couple of weeks ago and unplugged about Valve donating

02:16.240 --> 02:18.320
games to Debian developers.

02:18.320 --> 02:22.040
Well, they're expanding that program now to Ubuntu developers, too.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.040
How about that?

02:23.040 --> 02:26.640
That is exciting because it's not only showing that they're – because the Debian thing

02:26.640 --> 02:29.680
could have been seen as a fluke, but I think the fact that they're being inclusive to

02:29.680 --> 02:33.640
the Ubuntu guys as well is that they're saying, look, we really want Linux to take

02:33.640 --> 02:38.320
off and we want to embrace those that put their time and energy into making Linux awesome.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.320
And so they really get that.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.320
Yeah.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.320
1204 was there.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.320
That was the distro they recommended.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.320
That's right.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.320
Yeah.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.000
So, man, if they get Steam boxes, this is your chance now, guys.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.720
Go sign up to become a Debian developer or an Ubuntu developer.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.720
Get your Steam box.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.720
Because you never know.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.640
What's going to happen, that's going to be next.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.760
And there was – what was – there was another Valve story today, too.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.760
Oh, that's right.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.760
Right, right.

02:58.760 --> 02:59.760
We were just talking about it on the pre-show.

02:59.760 --> 03:05.400
Steam Dev Days, the videos from Steam Dev Days are now up and there's some of interest.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.600
One we talked about on last is this switching to Linux, where Ikyulys went through some

03:10.600 --> 03:14.280
of the reasons why switching to Linux, porting your game to Linux is not nearly as bad as

03:14.280 --> 03:15.280
everybody thinks it is.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.720
It's called getting started with Linux game development.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.600
Anyways, all of the videos I think that are available now are linked on the SteamDevDays.com

03:21.600 --> 03:24.320
page and I'm going to go through some of them.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.880
And if there's something really crazy, I'll pull out and put it in the Linux Action Show

03:27.880 --> 03:28.880
on Sunday.

03:28.880 --> 03:33.360
But otherwise, you can just go check it out on your own because there's so many on there

03:33.360 --> 03:36.640
that I'm sure we'd only be able to cover a tiny, tiny percentage of what was actually

03:36.640 --> 03:38.440
said.

03:38.440 --> 03:41.920
Speaking of last, on Sunday, one last little bit of business before we get into our main

03:41.920 --> 03:47.400
topic of the day, Sunday, Linux Action Show, 10 a.m. Pacific, jblive.tv, the place to be

03:47.400 --> 03:48.880
because it's episode 300.

03:48.880 --> 03:54.120
Oh my goodness, big, big, big, big, big, big, huge, huge.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.720
So we got a lot of stuff to talk about in episode 300.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.720
We're going to celebrate.

03:57.720 --> 04:02.040
It's not going to be, I haven't really decided how much of a regular Linux Action Show it's

04:02.040 --> 04:03.040
going to be.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.800
Probably depends on what's going on in the week.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.400
But we have some stuff planned to talk about, so I'd really love to have you guys there

04:07.400 --> 04:10.800
because it's a good one to join live and I think we'll have a good active community.

04:10.800 --> 04:11.800
Maybe we can break the IRC server.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.880
Maybe we'll load it up with so many people.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.640
So I'd love to have you there this Sunday.

04:15.640 --> 04:20.280
It'll be February 16th, I think that's it, yeah, 16th.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.280
Yeah, I think that sounds right.

04:21.280 --> 04:22.280
That sounds right.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.080
And I think it's definitely one of those things to where if you don't normally show up for

04:25.080 --> 04:28.200
a live show, make this the live show you show up for.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.480
I think you'll be pretty glad you did.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.120
Yeah, you know what?

04:32.120 --> 04:33.920
It's better than getting bit by a dog.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.600
This is true, especially if that dog wants to bite you.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.600
Yeah, yeah.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.160
That was redundant, but you get the point.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.640
Well, point well reiterated, Matt.

04:41.640 --> 04:45.560
All right, well, so I want to take a second here and just thank Ting.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.640
Ting is one of our sponsors this week and they're doing something really awesome.

04:48.640 --> 04:49.640
So get started.

04:49.640 --> 04:54.880
Go to linux.ting.com and if you're watching this live today, go over to their blog.

04:54.880 --> 04:59.400
I don't know of any other cell phone company that would have done this.

04:59.400 --> 05:06.760
Ting now, right now, if you go to ting.com slash blog, has the message up that a lot

05:06.760 --> 05:10.920
of sites are running with today because it's take back the privacy day on the internet

05:10.920 --> 05:14.000
and they have the call your legislators numbers and the submit for an email address right

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
here.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.760
Ting is so out of control that the authors of the Patriot Act are sponsors of Lena Bill

05:18.760 --> 05:19.760
to reign it in.

05:19.760 --> 05:20.760
So they have these.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.720
We have one running right now on the Jupiter Broadcasting website too.

05:23.720 --> 05:28.600
Let's see if you go over to our, yeah, so here's the Jupiter Broadcasting website, thedaywefightback.org.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.000
A lot of sites are doing this.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.320
I just thought it was so awesome that Ting is one of them.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.320
They didn't need to do this.

05:33.320 --> 05:38.360
I mean, they, you know, but they did because Ting is, they're really kind of internet savvy

05:38.360 --> 05:40.440
and that's one of the things I like about them quite a bit.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.800
It shows in their dashboard too.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.840
They have a really awesome and easy to use dashboard that follows web standards.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.560
In fact, it even supports the Mozilla login system, which I like a lot.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.840
We've had one of their developers on Coder Radio before to talk about it.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.680
And what's great about Ting is there's no contracts, there's no early termination fees.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.840
You only pay for what you use.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.280
Each flat line is six dollars and then, you know, taxes and then it's just your usage.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.400
If they take your message, your megabytes and your minutes, they add them all up at

06:04.400 --> 06:07.800
the end of the month, whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.800
It's really straightforward.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.000
You buy the device outright.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
You own it.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.800
You're not paying some sort of subsidized price over the time of the device.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.800
It's yours.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.920
And one of the great things about Ting is every plan includes hotspot and tethering

06:18.920 --> 06:20.600
and it's just part of your data usage.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.160
You don't have to be in some sort of special plan.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.160
You just turn it on.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.200
You know that feature built into Android?

06:25.200 --> 06:26.520
You should be able to just turn it on.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.600
That's why, that's why Google put it there and that's how Ting works.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.960
Ting also has awesome no-hold customer service.

06:31.960 --> 06:36.080
You can give them a call anytime between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. eastern and an actual person

06:36.080 --> 06:37.080
answers the phone.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.080
What a concept!

06:38.080 --> 06:42.120
I've been able to activate like 14 devices though, all through the dashboard.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.120
It's really great.

06:43.120 --> 06:46.640
They have an iPhone and Android app to manage your account as well.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.640
And you can check them out by going to linux.ting.com.

06:48.640 --> 06:53.240
They'll take $25 off your first device or $25 off your first month if you already have

06:53.240 --> 06:54.240
a compatible device.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.380
Check out their BYOD page.

06:56.380 --> 06:58.400
I'm telling you, I've been using them for over a year and I love it.

06:58.400 --> 07:02.340
They just, they just announced too that you can buy the Nexus Red phone from the Google

07:02.340 --> 07:03.920
Play Store and put it on Ting.

07:03.920 --> 07:04.920
Just get the Ting.

07:04.920 --> 07:05.920
Oh, that's cool.

07:05.920 --> 07:06.920
Yeah.

07:06.920 --> 07:07.920
You know what's, you know what's actually really cool?

07:07.920 --> 07:11.800
This, here's a, so not only do they have, not only are they like really savvy about

07:11.800 --> 07:15.840
the net in general, but if I go over to their Google Plus page, I'm going to wait for this

07:15.840 --> 07:20.900
bad boy to load up, they check out, here's how they, here's how they posted it.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.120
This is on their Google Plus page.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.120
Okay.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.120
So they did this on social media.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.120
Cool.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.800
We're now selling the Nexus 5, but please don't buy it from us.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.440
Order it on Google Play and save yourself 95 bucks.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.440
Okay.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.440
Let me get this straight.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.520
So they not only said, Hey look, you know, we want you to, we want you to put the money

07:35.520 --> 07:40.520
back in your pocket and not in ours, but they're going to actually even provide you where to

07:40.520 --> 07:41.520
go and do that.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.520
I mean, that's really cool.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.720
Here's their, here's their announcement on a fight against mass surveillance.

07:44.720 --> 07:48.080
Help spread the word by sharing our blog posts and signing the official petition for every

07:48.080 --> 07:49.480
share before the end of the day.

07:49.480 --> 07:54.040
We're donating a dollar to the Electronic Frontier Foundation up to a maximum of $10,000.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.040
Wow.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.920
So go over to linux.ting.com.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.800
See this is why I've always talked about vote with your wallet, support these kinds of companies.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.000
And you know, we also had a listener reach out to them and ask them about Ubuntu Touch

08:04.000 --> 08:06.640
and they said they're eagerly following that project.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.640
So they're really kind of onto all of this stuff.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.160
And I think you could go check them out, try out their savings calculator.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.720
They just lowered their data rates.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.640
Try the calculator again, see if it's even more of a deal for you than before.

08:16.640 --> 08:21.060
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for being so damn awesome.

08:21.060 --> 08:22.060
That's really cool.

08:22.060 --> 08:23.060
Good guys.

08:23.060 --> 08:24.060
Good stuff.

08:24.060 --> 08:25.060
All right.

08:25.060 --> 08:26.060
Let's jump in the mumble room.

08:26.060 --> 08:27.060
Bring in the guys.

08:27.060 --> 08:30.080
Um, guys, we got a couple of, uh, we got a couple of things I want to, I want to hammer

08:30.080 --> 08:33.480
through before we jump into the, uh, to the Debian topic.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.720
I want to read some of our feedback, but you guys feel free to chime in on any of the feedback

08:36.720 --> 08:37.720
too.

08:37.720 --> 08:38.720
All right.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.720
Our first email came from Dalek.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.720
Hmm.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.720
Dalek, huh?

08:41.720 --> 08:42.720
Interesting.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.920
He says, Hey Chris, I just wanted to comment on your recent snafu on last and your comments

08:45.920 --> 08:47.600
in Coder Radio and Linux unplugged.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.360
I gathered your report on something incorrectly and someone complained on Google Plus.

08:51.360 --> 08:56.840
This was a, we mentioned that we, I reported that the KD Plasma next dates were firm when

08:56.840 --> 08:57.840
they weren't.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.400
I said, get over it.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.440
He says to me, the only things that matter are number one, you owned up to it when you

09:02.440 --> 09:04.160
found out that you were wrong.

09:04.160 --> 09:08.560
It wasn't intentional and you're taking steps to address the issue.

09:08.560 --> 09:13.360
If you made a, you have made a pledge to be more accurate and to me that is all that matters.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.920
Mistakes can and will happen.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.240
It is what you do about them that makes all the difference.

09:17.240 --> 09:20.240
This is my opinion and I will probably get trolled for saying this, but you're doing

09:20.240 --> 09:24.040
the KD project a favor by reporting on anything on the project.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.560
Instead of hitting Google Plus to complain, they should come directly to you and say,

09:26.560 --> 09:29.600
Hey Chris, you got this part wrong and you should probably fix it.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.040
Oh, and by the way, insert a link here.

09:31.040 --> 09:35.080
This is where the post about info that's correct is happening at.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.680
I definitely agree with the latter part especially.

09:36.680 --> 09:41.600
I think definitely going straight to the source versus a publicly bemoaning crap is definitely

09:41.600 --> 09:42.600
the way to handle something.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.600
Yeah, for sure.

09:43.600 --> 09:47.520
Although sometimes, yeah, yeah, I mean, I don't know, see, here's where I fall down

09:47.520 --> 09:53.200
on this is I kind of, I've been thinking about this a lot and I think mistakes will inevitably

09:53.200 --> 09:57.720
happen because there's not a ton of original reporting happening in the Linux and open

09:57.720 --> 09:58.720
source landscape.

09:58.720 --> 10:05.440
A lot of it is blogs, it's rewrites of mailing list posts, it's pulling out company announcements

10:05.440 --> 10:08.640
and then posting them online and then people either do meta coverage of them or they go

10:08.640 --> 10:13.840
do some research on their own and do some, it's very little actual original reporting.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.840
So when you are trying to do some original reporting or trying to just cover some of

10:17.840 --> 10:22.760
the original reporting, there inevitably will be some errors that crop up just because that's

10:22.760 --> 10:23.760
human nature.

10:23.760 --> 10:24.760
Sure.

10:24.760 --> 10:31.240
And I think as long as, we always try to follow up and make corrections in this show and I

10:31.240 --> 10:35.680
think if the mistake is big enough, we make corrections in the main show itself and we're

10:35.680 --> 10:39.120
very clear and open about it and plus in the subreddit, we get caught pretty quickly.

10:39.120 --> 10:46.040
And I think as long as, one of the things about a podcast is you make it consumable

10:46.040 --> 10:49.780
for one episode if somebody is just doing a drive by and they pick it up.

10:49.780 --> 10:53.920
But what you really want to do is curate a long term community that can depend on quality

10:53.920 --> 10:54.960
of content.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.320
And I think as long as we're addressing that by continuing to do corrections and updates

10:58.320 --> 11:02.520
down the road, then that audience is served in the long run and I think that's what really

11:02.520 --> 11:03.520
matters.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.920
So I'm always going to do my best not to have mistakes but when they do, I'll also always

11:06.920 --> 11:08.680
do my best to make corrections.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.200
And I think that's all you can really do.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.200
Yeah.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.200
Yeah.

11:12.200 --> 11:16.520
Alright, well next bit of feedback comes in and this is from Red Hands Guitar.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.520
Read Hands Guitar.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.520
Read Hands Guitar.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.520
Ah, well I'll get it eventually.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.800
Give me about four more tries.

11:20.800 --> 11:26.920
He says, he says, he's following up on an email we got at the end of Linux Unplugged

11:26.920 --> 11:30.760
last week and the emailer said, hey, you know what, maybe I prefer Linux not to have that

11:30.760 --> 11:31.760
big of an adoption.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.760
Let's keep it tight and small.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.760
Right?

11:33.760 --> 11:34.760
Make it a small community.

11:34.760 --> 11:35.760
Maybe it doesn't need to go out to the masses.

11:35.760 --> 11:39.440
And I think we all kind of kicked around and said, nah, to really be successful we need

11:39.440 --> 11:40.680
to get a wider adoption.

11:40.680 --> 11:45.360
He said, so Read Hands Guitar says, I think it would be, I think I would be satisfied

11:45.360 --> 11:50.920
if Linux became as popular as the desktop OS as Mac OS is, but maybe even more would

11:50.920 --> 11:51.920
be better.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.680
I think the most beneficial kind of growth initially is to allow other kinds of growth

11:54.680 --> 11:58.200
by hobbyist users, so we start there.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.840
If we have a huge influx of hobbyists who can commit code, Linux and free software become

12:01.840 --> 12:06.080
better products and give better impressions to more casual users.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.880
I agree up until the last point.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.560
The last point, generally speaking, the more coding and the more coders and things you

12:11.560 --> 12:17.120
come into it, you do end up with better stuff, but a lot of times little things like UX and

12:17.120 --> 12:22.240
stuff like that tend to go out the window, especially in the Linux space, so I don't

12:22.240 --> 12:23.240
know.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.240
Maybe so.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.240
Yeah.

12:25.240 --> 12:34.040
See, I do kind of, I see some aspects of like, sometimes if you build something for the geeks,

12:34.040 --> 12:37.480
that serves a point, that serves a purpose for a while.

12:37.480 --> 12:42.840
That does help with getting you to a level of adoption on a class of user, a lot of times

12:42.840 --> 12:43.840
it's sort of the trendsetter.

12:43.840 --> 12:48.760
You know, Matt, one of the things that I know, I'm sure you must have noticed too, over the

12:48.760 --> 12:53.800
last 20 years maybe, let's say, is like there used to be a day in an age when I would go

12:53.800 --> 12:59.240
to a restaurant and if somebody dropped a computer term like modem or windows, I would

12:59.240 --> 13:02.540
immediately pick that sucker up and be like, whoa, somebody just said something about a

13:02.540 --> 13:04.640
computer in a public place.

13:04.640 --> 13:10.280
And now these days, it's common vernacular to be throwing out, you know, Facebook, dot

13:10.280 --> 13:12.560
com, Twitter, whatever, right?

13:12.560 --> 13:18.240
So I think in some ways you could argue that the internet used to be a place only for the

13:18.240 --> 13:24.360
geeks that eventually, because of the work they did and then the work to bring other

13:24.360 --> 13:29.560
people to it, eventually it became appealing to the common person.

13:29.560 --> 13:33.720
And I think the Linux desktop could be like that and the Linux desktop shares a lot of

13:33.720 --> 13:36.400
similarities with the development of the internet in some ways.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.760
The fractured nature of it, right?

13:37.760 --> 13:41.920
The competing standards, all these things, but eventually it all sort of moves forward

13:41.920 --> 13:48.560
as one big evolutionary organic beast and I kind of feel like in a way this phase the

13:48.560 --> 13:52.320
Linux desktop is at right now could be its glory days in a sense where it's for the geeks,

13:52.320 --> 13:56.040
it's really great if you're a nerd and you really want to tinker with your system and

13:56.040 --> 14:01.560
you look at sort of the Ubuntuization of a desktop where they're putting a lot more polish

14:01.560 --> 14:05.200
on there, they're changing things, polish might not be the right word, but they're

14:05.200 --> 14:10.560
packaging and productizing it, going with their own display server because that fits

14:10.560 --> 14:14.800
the needs of the product, not because it might technically be the better thing for everyone

14:14.800 --> 14:19.000
in the community, but it helps them create a product that is good for general consumers

14:19.000 --> 14:20.680
and so they're going that direction.

14:20.680 --> 14:24.840
I think what Canonical and Ubuntu are doing right now is going to be the leading edge

14:24.840 --> 14:30.360
of what's going to happen in a lot of products using Linux.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.480
I think that's one way Linux will be brought to a lot more people.

14:33.480 --> 14:38.720
It might not be that everybody has a big tower PC with a monitor and a keyboard and a mouse

14:38.720 --> 14:43.160
hooked up to it and an Ethernet jack and power and all this kind of stuff, it might be tablets

14:43.160 --> 14:47.640
and it might be Nest thermostats and it might be robots hooked into your Google Plus account

14:47.640 --> 14:50.840
and all these kinds of things that are running Linux and eventually everyone will be using

14:50.840 --> 14:56.400
Linux in every single way, it just might not be in the exact vision we have today.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.120
That's a good point and I think in many ways we're already well into that direction as

15:00.120 --> 15:03.680
it is, especially in the embedded markets and things like that, because I think the

15:03.680 --> 15:07.640
desktop market is such a tough – it's like whack-a-mole in so many ways trying to

15:07.640 --> 15:12.120
find that perfect sweet spot to where the market is saying, we don't care if it runs

15:12.120 --> 15:16.400
Cheetos, we just want to make sure that it's accomplishing the tasks that I want to do.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.480
Right, look at the huge success of Chromebooks now, right?

15:18.480 --> 15:23.520
Yeah, exactly, because it accomplishes tasks versus what display server does it run and

15:23.520 --> 15:24.520
whatnot.

15:24.520 --> 15:28.320
I think what display server and that sort of thing, that stuff matters, but it matters

15:28.320 --> 15:30.760
to a very compartmentalized group of people.

15:30.760 --> 15:35.040
To people such as myself, I care, but getting someone like my wife or someone else to care,

15:35.040 --> 15:36.040
that's a little bit tougher.

15:36.040 --> 15:40.000
So it's going to be an interesting divide until we can begin to smooth out those edges

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
I think.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Yeah.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.800
Well, when we move forward, one weird crazy device at a time that we all think is going

15:47.800 --> 15:52.240
to fail until it doesn't like Chromebooks, you know what I mean?

15:52.240 --> 15:54.320
I honestly was a big Chromebook hater.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.720
I still think it's a little wonky.

15:55.720 --> 16:00.360
I tried it, but you know what, the market speaks, and I think a lot of it's price based,

16:00.360 --> 16:01.360
but yeah.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.360
I think they're cute.

16:02.360 --> 16:07.800
I mean, I think they're like the ideal, I don't know, college student, teenager kind

16:07.800 --> 16:08.800
of thing.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.800
I mean, I think they're great for that.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.840
It's like you drop it, you shrug, and you go buy a new one.

16:11.840 --> 16:17.840
I think the Chromebook shows a version though where it's not just the DVR or the closed

16:17.840 --> 16:23.600
camera system like who me is saying, it's like it's all devices.

16:23.600 --> 16:27.600
All consumer devices, because it seems like you look at, we just had a really great chat

16:27.600 --> 16:32.040
on Coderadio yesterday about how what Microsoft is really up against is their whole model

16:32.040 --> 16:36.600
is software licensing, and that is completely vanishing.

16:36.600 --> 16:40.360
Subscription models, reoccurring subscription models where it's essentially a license and

16:40.360 --> 16:46.600
you're getting access to the program like Adobe Creative Cloud or Office 365, but selling

16:46.600 --> 16:51.360
somebody an $80 OEM license when they go to build a product, that's going to go away.

16:51.360 --> 16:55.240
We speculated about perhaps even Windows going completely free at some point in the next

16:55.240 --> 16:57.780
year or two, especially with this new CEO stepping in.

16:57.780 --> 17:01.800
And I think if they don't, there's really going to be no reason people don't use these

17:01.800 --> 17:06.000
free operating systems when they just need a base level OS and they're building on top

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
of that.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.960
You know, when you look at Chromebooks, right?

17:08.960 --> 17:09.960
Exactly.

17:09.960 --> 17:13.480
Well, and I'm not super familiar with Windows 8, so I'm going to go out on a limb and say,

17:13.480 --> 17:17.280
I assume that Microsoft still makes their business out of selling stickers, you know,

17:17.280 --> 17:19.600
the little licensing stickers they like to put on computers.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.840
You know, they are the biggest sticker based business I've ever seen.

17:22.840 --> 17:27.040
And so if you lose that sticker, your CD becomes a coaster.

17:27.040 --> 17:33.440
And I think they need to realize that that model is not only the worst customer experience

17:33.440 --> 17:36.640
possible, but as you pointed out, it's not going to work.

17:36.640 --> 17:40.760
Let's get out of stickers and let's, you know, maybe they can look into, I don't know, opening

17:40.760 --> 17:41.880
up a nice pub or something.

17:41.880 --> 17:49.320
So what really helped Windows back in the day was they had a really kind of good relationship

17:49.320 --> 17:51.480
between their desktop product and their server products.

17:51.480 --> 17:55.820
So if you ran, and that drove a lot of people to run Windows server and Windows desktops

17:55.820 --> 17:58.720
in the business, which then drove a lot of people to buy Windows in the home because

17:58.720 --> 18:00.240
they wanted to use what they're familiar with work.

18:00.240 --> 18:06.560
You know, I remember my stepdad specifically didn't want to buy a Mac, didn't want to

18:06.560 --> 18:10.760
use Ubuntu because the job he was working at used Windows XP and that's what he wanted.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.040
He wanted to use exactly what they used at work at home.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.960
That way he wouldn't have a problem at all.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.560
And you know, to be frank, I understood the logic there.

18:18.560 --> 18:23.600
I felt like, okay, I can totally empathize with that when you're not very comfortable

18:23.600 --> 18:24.700
with computers.

18:24.700 --> 18:29.240
And so in a sense, that's going away now with the whole bring your own device initiative

18:29.240 --> 18:33.720
and a lot of those devices are Linux powered, primarily through Android and things like

18:33.720 --> 18:34.720
that.

18:34.720 --> 18:40.440
So Microsoft is transitioning to this whole cloud infrastructure, Azure, Office 365 subscription

18:40.440 --> 18:43.200
models, and you know, also attempting to do the devices thing.

18:43.200 --> 18:47.720
But the problem is Linux is already there on both fronts, on the cloud front and on

18:47.720 --> 18:50.200
the devices front and not just like a little bit, right?

18:50.200 --> 18:53.200
Like it's dominant, like it's the boss there.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.840
And so they are really going to be up.

18:54.840 --> 18:59.480
This new CEO has a ton of work and I wonder if because Linux is already the boss on the

18:59.480 --> 19:03.400
server space, it's already the boss on the device space, if you almost have that same

19:03.400 --> 19:06.720
thing again where, well, because we run it on the server and because I have it on my

19:06.720 --> 19:09.800
devices, I'm also going to put it on these other devices.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.920
And just for developers and for companies that are just trying to wrap their head around

19:12.920 --> 19:16.280
products and delivering a decent product, it almost just makes it easier for them to

19:16.280 --> 19:19.560
just put everything Linux because, well, we're already using that on the servers over here,

19:19.560 --> 19:22.440
we're writing code for that, we're already shipping these Android devices, we're writing

19:22.440 --> 19:23.440
code for that.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.440
So you know what?

19:24.440 --> 19:26.000
Let's just make it all Linux.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.360
And I think that's sort of the thing we could be seeing put in place right now.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.960
I think we're seeing that and that is what Microsoft's up against and it's like this

19:32.960 --> 19:34.260
silent monster.

19:34.260 --> 19:39.520
It's not this big company, it doesn't have any one particular logo on it, but it's still

19:39.520 --> 19:42.940
this massive battle that I don't think they're fully equipped to fight.

19:42.940 --> 19:46.960
They're equipped to fight IBM's and Apple's and Oracle's, right?

19:46.960 --> 19:49.320
That's who Microsoft is armed to fight.

19:49.320 --> 19:53.880
Microsoft, in my opinion, is going to continue to eat their own face when it comes to the

19:53.880 --> 19:55.040
consumer market.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.000
They hired who seems to be a really nice guy.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.120
I'm sure he's going to really means well and is going to do his very best and I'm sure

20:00.120 --> 20:01.120
he's great.

20:01.120 --> 20:05.440
I don't think that, but they continue to make the same mistake they've always made and that's,

20:05.440 --> 20:09.200
oh, why bring in someone new that might be able to help us in our shortcomings when we

20:09.200 --> 20:11.440
can hire someone from within again?

20:11.440 --> 20:16.200
Granted, he's got some great skill sets and like I said, I'm sure he's very talented,

20:16.200 --> 20:18.840
but it's the bigger problems they're still hiring within.

20:18.840 --> 20:19.840
They really do.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.480
They need somebody to go and do some weed whacking.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.800
Now, Bacon Drinker, you were going to make a point that you think if Windows goes free,

20:24.800 --> 20:25.800
it's better for Linux?

20:25.800 --> 20:27.440
No, it's worse for Linux, sorry.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.760
Oh, it's worse for Linux.

20:28.760 --> 20:29.760
Tell me.

20:29.760 --> 20:30.960
You think people will do…

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
It's the web browser model.

20:31.960 --> 20:36.960
You say like, well, the web browser idea is to say like, when a web browser is, when you

20:36.960 --> 20:42.560
see someone running IE, you switch them to Chrome or when someone's PC breaks and you

20:42.560 --> 20:43.960
reinstall it, you switch them to Chrome.

20:43.960 --> 20:48.240
Well, if someone's PC breaks, you haven't got the moral problem of torrenting Windows,

20:48.240 --> 20:50.200
so you're probably going to install Windows for free anyway.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.600
Yeah, but who's going to want to run Metro on it?

20:52.600 --> 20:56.520
I mean, you know, I think Microsoft is solving that problem for us.

20:56.520 --> 21:02.080
I think they are going to, I think web applications, HTML5, that kind of crap, the crap that we

21:02.080 --> 21:06.620
all hate hearing the buzz terms about, are making Windows less relevant and I think Microsoft

21:06.620 --> 21:11.200
is doing us all a favor by making Windows less relevant.

21:11.200 --> 21:18.120
Paul Thrott over at winsupersite.com ran a story, I think, I can't remember what the

21:18.120 --> 21:21.920
title was, but it was a good title, and he makes the case that he goes through and lists

21:21.920 --> 21:25.520
all of the people that have lost their jobs, the entire divisions that they've done house

21:25.520 --> 21:31.240
cleanings on, and he even proposes Balmer's loss of his job is because of what a catastrophe

21:31.240 --> 21:35.960
Windows 8 is, and he writes, he says, he's talked to people in there that, you know,

21:35.960 --> 21:40.120
they think it's worse than Vista, and they think, not in terms of sales, but in terms

21:40.120 --> 21:44.640
of public image, and they think that they may have set Windows back a decade, is the

21:44.640 --> 21:48.000
term they're using internally, that Windows has been set back a decade.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Ouch.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Yeah.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Not shocking, but ouch.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.400
That's, that's pretty, you know, that's pretty damning.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.720
And so some people are speculating now pretty openly, well Paul Thrott is the person I'm

21:57.720 --> 22:03.160
talking about, but other people as well that, you know, maybe this, maybe the reason why

22:03.160 --> 22:08.560
they went with Satya Nadella, I think is how you say the last name, Satya Nadella, is because

22:08.560 --> 22:13.240
they just really have to double down and focus on no longer making Windows the center of

22:13.240 --> 22:14.240
the Microsoft folks.

22:14.240 --> 22:17.600
Remember back, I think we all remember that quote for Balmer saying, Windows is the future

22:17.600 --> 22:18.600
of Microsoft.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.360
Hey, we want to make an Xbox, you put Windows on it.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.920
Hey, you want to make a device, put Windows on it.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.960
Hey, you need that servers, doing something, put Windows on it, and then load SQL on it.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.120
You got yourself a winning combo everybody.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.640
And it was Windows this, Windows that, Windows this, Windows that.

22:29.640 --> 22:34.920
Now it's all going to be about these reoccurring subscriptions, this Office 365, Azure, and

22:34.920 --> 22:35.920
all these things.

22:35.920 --> 22:40.280
But the problem with these is they inherently have a very high run cost.

22:40.280 --> 22:44.420
And while that might work good in the rich Western worlds, it's not going to work good

22:44.420 --> 22:46.440
in some of the poorer places in this world.

22:46.440 --> 22:49.360
And it's never going to lock them in as a dominant force.

22:49.360 --> 22:52.320
They're never going to be number one in cloud hosted services.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.360
That's already been claimed really.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.800
And they do it to themselves too.

22:55.800 --> 22:59.520
It's like if you look at Office 365, which I've had some limited experience with, it's

22:59.520 --> 23:03.800
been a couple of months, but when I looked at it, I'm thinking, okay, so compared to

23:03.800 --> 23:08.140
the Google offerings, which are free, you want me to pay for something that for a non-enterprise

23:08.140 --> 23:14.640
user isn't really compellingly different other than maybe visually different.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.720
They seem to shoot themselves in the foot as soon as they launch something like that.

23:17.720 --> 23:21.800
They launch these products and say, okay, how can we either overbrand it with too many

23:21.800 --> 23:25.680
versions, charge something when quite frankly no one's going to pay for it, not out of

23:25.680 --> 23:29.200
the enterprise anyway, and what the hell?

23:29.200 --> 23:30.200
Their thinking doesn't make any sense.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.200
Yeah.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.200
It's like a lack of focus.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.200
I agree.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.200
It really is.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.200
Craig.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.400
We're also ignoring something kind of important that people will just use Windows because

23:37.400 --> 23:38.880
they know Windows.

23:38.880 --> 23:39.880
Yeah.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.560
I've seen that change more and more though.

23:41.560 --> 23:46.120
That is until they have a reason not to, and there's going to be a thousand different reasons

23:46.120 --> 23:47.120
not to, I think.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.000
Even if it's like tablets, right?

23:50.000 --> 23:55.940
If you shift, if you're an average user and you shift 70% of your computing workload over

23:55.940 --> 24:00.680
to a tablet when you're at home, like reading email, checking Facebook, all of these things,

24:00.680 --> 24:03.600
tablets actually in some ways better at really.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.480
So isn't that a loss for Microsoft?

24:06.480 --> 24:07.480
Just right there?

24:07.480 --> 24:12.040
Even if people are just using the Windows desktop 70% less of the time?

24:12.040 --> 24:16.760
Well, not just that, but I also know of three computer technicians here in town, one of

24:16.760 --> 24:22.200
them who's a pretty big player, is tired of offering Microsoft's only solutions and has

24:22.200 --> 24:24.400
now begun offering some Linux solutions.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.920
He's not going to say this publicly because he has a Microsoft agreement, but the point

24:27.920 --> 24:32.160
is that this is happening and he's actually, a lot of people are saying, oh, okay, well,

24:32.160 --> 24:33.680
I want to do Windows 7 or Windows 8.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.680
Oh, I have old hardware.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.680
Oops, sorry, I'm screwed.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.360
I've got to buy new peripherals because nothing's supported.

24:38.360 --> 24:42.700
And so it's becoming a value proposition for him to offer them an operating system he can

24:42.700 --> 24:46.280
still support and not look like a douchebag.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.880
So and then tablets and things, that's more of a younger audience.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.160
There's a pretty much 45 and up.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.160
I don't know.

24:53.160 --> 24:57.400
I think seniors, I think there's a pretty good use case and I say that because in our

24:57.400 --> 25:03.680
own family, some of the older folks who had computer phobias, the family got them tablets

25:03.680 --> 25:04.680
and they've really taken them.

25:04.680 --> 25:07.920
And one of the things like on the Kindles that they really like is they can really increase

25:07.920 --> 25:08.920
the size of the text.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.200
So it makes it a lot easier for them to read.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.440
Kindle fires have been pretty good.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.440
Yeah, I've seen a few.

25:13.440 --> 25:18.040
You know, my grandma hasn't had a computer her entire life and now is on email all the

25:18.040 --> 25:21.600
time and she's emailing with the church group and constantly on the thing.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.600
I mean, she's like.

25:22.600 --> 25:28.680
So for her, and it wasn't just her, it was also several family members who were just

25:28.680 --> 25:33.680
anti-technology, but once they got their hands on one, gosh, you know, it really was like

25:33.680 --> 25:35.760
a pretty big transformation for them.

25:35.760 --> 25:36.760
So I don't know.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.640
And perhaps the other value for the family members too is that you're no longer, you

25:39.640 --> 25:42.560
don't feel like you have to be afraid of it anymore, like you did with the Windows box.

25:42.560 --> 25:46.880
Right, you're not worried about the malware, and it's so dead simple, it's like you just

25:46.880 --> 25:47.880
turn it on, right?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.520
You just turn it on and push the mail icon.

25:50.520 --> 25:53.840
And honestly, for some of these people, like the barrier was the mouse, like they just

25:53.840 --> 25:54.840
didn't know how to use a mouse.

25:54.840 --> 25:56.680
Now they can touch the thing.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.320
But Craig, you were going to make a point that it's convergence that's doing Windows

25:59.320 --> 26:00.320
8.

26:00.320 --> 26:06.120
Yeah, what I've seen while I worked at Memory Express was that the biggest issues with most

26:06.120 --> 26:11.600
customers computers were that they didn't know how to use Windows 8 and that when they

26:11.600 --> 26:15.460
went from a tablet to Windows 8, it still wasn't the same, even though they're made

26:15.460 --> 26:16.840
the same.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.360
And there's just a whole bunch of issues with people learning the new OS and they're

26:20.360 --> 26:25.480
shooting themselves in the foot by making it too different without leaving in some key

26:25.480 --> 26:29.200
information that helps people transition.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.640
And by having a cell phone that acts like a tablet and a tablet that acts like a computer

26:32.640 --> 26:35.680
is just confusing people even more.

26:35.680 --> 26:43.520
Yeah, I think they didn't go far enough, like in the sense, like I think maybe the work

26:43.520 --> 26:51.160
that's being done now by folks to have that device more like role change and then try

26:51.160 --> 26:52.840
to be the same thing all the time.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.040
I think that's probably the more winning recipe.

26:55.040 --> 26:58.480
And it also makes more sense as devices get more powerful, they can afford to do that.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.480
You know what I'm talking?

26:59.480 --> 27:02.680
Like you put in a dock hooked up to a computer, you get a desktop UI.

27:02.680 --> 27:09.800
I think the biggest problem is the model of quote convergence they went with.

27:09.800 --> 27:14.920
In article they're going with a fairly similar UI and with Unity 8 applications should be

27:14.920 --> 27:17.880
able to run across the different platforms.

27:17.880 --> 27:23.120
The KDE plasma interface, you have the plasma that you have on the desktop, they'll be your

27:23.120 --> 27:25.920
main plasma interface on a tablet.

27:25.920 --> 27:31.480
Yeah, there's plasma active which is definitely very plasma driven and then the idea there

27:31.480 --> 27:36.880
just like with Unity 8 would be that it would switch and I think as long, I think what we

27:36.880 --> 27:41.280
are all worried about in those scenarios is that the applications in desktop mode will

27:41.280 --> 27:46.280
feel like mobile applications and I think that's maybe almost impossible to avoid for

27:46.280 --> 27:50.640
the first year or so as developers are just working on this stuff, adding features and

27:50.640 --> 27:54.800
changing things based on user feedback because sometimes you just don't know until a couple

27:54.800 --> 27:56.680
thousand people have banged on it for a while.

27:56.680 --> 28:02.120
Sorry, I think the death of Windows 8 was in the desktop, not the tablet.

28:02.120 --> 28:04.000
Yeah, for sure, yeah, absolutely.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.480
Because if you look back at it, the uproar was really not being able to access the start

28:08.480 --> 28:09.480
menu.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.360
No, actually people are pretty positive about it in the mobile sense.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.360
People love the tiles.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.360
Ooh, the tiles.

28:13.360 --> 28:19.240
Yeah, I definitely would say that when I was experiencing it and then listening to other

28:19.240 --> 28:20.800
people talk about it, they loved it.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.800
Some of the lower end Windows tablets, they weren't real impressed with the performance

28:23.800 --> 28:27.320
in comparison to other tablets but they did like the layout.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.840
They felt it was easy to navigate but yeah, the desktop was a boy.

28:30.840 --> 28:31.840
That's a mess.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.120
All right, we got one more.

28:33.120 --> 28:37.960
I think a KDE tablet would own them all for looks.

28:37.960 --> 28:38.960
We will see.

28:38.960 --> 28:39.960
We'll see.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.080
Stay tuned and find out.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.360
All right, so one bit of feedback.

28:43.360 --> 28:46.320
Speaking of desktops, this is our last bit.

28:46.320 --> 28:50.400
The traditional desktop, Voodoo 6, who says he was going to make it this week but I don't

28:50.400 --> 28:51.400
see him in here.

28:51.400 --> 28:55.200
He says, I've made fun of Mate in the past and now I feel kind of bad about it.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.440
I listened to the show and decided to go grab the live CD and give it a run in VirtualBox

28:58.440 --> 29:00.080
and I have to say I'm pretty impressed.

29:00.080 --> 29:02.640
They've actually come a long way with Mate and made some improvements in all the right

29:02.640 --> 29:06.040
places and also holy hell is it fast.

29:06.040 --> 29:09.680
Even running from a live CD in VirtualBox with compositing enabled, it just zipped right

29:09.680 --> 29:14.760
along and then later on, he said, I went ahead and set it up on one of my workstations and

29:14.760 --> 29:15.760
I've been using it all morning.

29:15.760 --> 29:16.760
It's really good stuff.

29:16.760 --> 29:22.040
I felt like my opinion about the Mate desktop was changed during last week's episode too.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.680
So it's cool to see that some of the folks in the audience felt that way.

29:24.680 --> 29:29.720
All right, Matt, well before we jump into the Debian stuff and this is why we have a

29:29.720 --> 29:32.800
big mumble room today, we got a lot of folks in there.

29:32.800 --> 29:36.000
I think people have been following this topic with quite an interest and it's been one of

29:36.000 --> 29:41.100
these things that has just, I mean it's been like, you could have sports commentary doing

29:41.100 --> 29:42.660
a live stream of this at some point.

29:42.660 --> 29:46.680
It has really just been a heck of a thing to watch.

29:46.680 --> 29:50.520
So before we get to that, I want to thank DigitalOcean, our sponsor for this week's

29:50.520 --> 29:53.120
episode of Linux Unplugged.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.480
DigitalOcean is so great.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.760
It's simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up

29:57.760 --> 29:59.160
a cloud server.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.800
These things are so super quick.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.880
Users can create a cloud server in about 55 seconds.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.040
I got it down to 47 seconds.

30:06.040 --> 30:09.880
I believe, what, our record right now, was it 44 seconds?

30:09.880 --> 30:10.880
Was that what it was?

30:10.880 --> 30:11.880
I haven't seen that beat.

30:11.880 --> 30:12.880
I think it was.

30:12.880 --> 30:13.880
I think it was 44 because I think you had the record previously.

30:13.880 --> 30:14.880
I did.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.960
Now I kind of want to create another one just so I can try to beat 44 seconds.

30:16.960 --> 30:17.960
I think I can do it.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.080
I think I can do it because I'm getting the UI down.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.680
It's so simple and intuitive.

30:21.680 --> 30:24.080
I kind of just know where to go without even looking.

30:24.080 --> 30:27.480
I could do it without even, with like one mouse tight, I don't know.

30:27.480 --> 30:28.800
Anyways, DigitalOcean, check this out.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.240
A little bit of an announcement here.

30:30.240 --> 30:34.360
DigitalOcean has locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and now Singapore.

30:34.360 --> 30:38.120
They just added Singapore today, so congratulations to DigitalOcean.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.120
Here's what's great.

30:39.120 --> 30:41.960
Users, while you're over there and you can spin up this cloud server in 55 seconds, that's

30:41.960 --> 30:42.960
awesome, right?

30:42.960 --> 30:43.960
Sure, that's good.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.560
But check out what you get for $5.

30:45.560 --> 30:46.560
You ready for this?

30:46.560 --> 30:50.680
If you're a user of DigitalOcean for $5, you're going to get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

30:50.680 --> 30:54.240
SSD, a CPU, and one terabyte of transfer.

30:54.240 --> 30:59.040
A terabyte of transfer is really quite a bit, and I love that it's a fixed cost.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.920
Boom, I know exactly what I'm going to get, so you got to go check them out.

31:01.920 --> 31:06.120
Just for their intuitive control panel, and they also allow you to replicate it on a much

31:06.120 --> 31:09.400
larger scale with a really straightforward API.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.680
So go over to DigitalOcean.com and check them out.

31:11.680 --> 31:14.920
They got a great droplet system with images that are all ready to go.

31:14.920 --> 31:18.240
You can pay by the hour if you just want to do testing for a little bit, tons of really

31:18.240 --> 31:22.400
great features, and Linux fans, which I think you might be, will appreciate that they're

31:22.400 --> 31:24.600
doing this all on top of KVM.

31:24.600 --> 31:29.560
This is a great example of how Linux empowers a company to do a whole new category of product

31:29.560 --> 31:32.480
that just a few years ago wasn't even possible.

31:32.480 --> 31:35.940
This is just they're taking advantage of technology built into Linux.

31:35.940 --> 31:41.740
They're using great hardware, tier one bandwidth, and it really just all comes together.

31:41.740 --> 31:46.120
This is the kind of stuff as we're about to start talking about system D here in a little

31:46.120 --> 31:47.120
bit.

31:47.120 --> 31:51.680
It's this kind of stuff that when these distributions make these underlying infrastructure changes

31:51.680 --> 32:00.200
it has such wide reaching impacts, such ramifications, and the implementation of KVM into the Linux

32:00.200 --> 32:01.200
kernel.

32:01.200 --> 32:06.040
This is a great example of how something just blew up a whole new industry that is now providing

32:06.040 --> 32:10.360
a whole new level of service at a whole new price never possible for, and what's even

32:10.360 --> 32:14.660
better is you can get it for free for two months.

32:14.660 --> 32:19.440
If you use our promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDFEBRUARY when you check out Linux Unplugged February,

32:19.440 --> 32:22.080
all one word will get you a $10 digital ocean credit.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.800
You can use that $5 server for two months.

32:23.800 --> 32:28.620
I've been running that $5 server for a while now and it just, man, Linux performs like

32:28.620 --> 32:32.440
a champ and you combine it with those SSDs and their bandwidth, man it flies.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.720
It's so great.

32:33.720 --> 32:36.920
And the fact you can actually if you want to like say bang out an arch server, you can

32:36.920 --> 32:40.720
and it's super fast, it's easy, what a great place to, it's like oh I wonder, I've heard

32:40.720 --> 32:44.160
some things about this package, I've heard it enhances or hinders something, I can try

32:44.160 --> 32:45.160
it out on the server.

32:45.160 --> 32:46.220
It's like oh that's what it does.

32:46.220 --> 32:47.960
You know without actually having to do anything locally.

32:47.960 --> 32:48.960
It's great.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.600
They're big fans of the Docker project too.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.440
They're always really staying in sync with that project.

32:52.440 --> 32:56.360
They're making it so awesome to deploy applications up on the server.

32:56.360 --> 32:57.360
It's really cool.

32:57.360 --> 32:58.360
So go check them out.

32:58.360 --> 33:03.280
DigitalOcean.com, promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDFEBRUARY and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for their

33:03.280 --> 33:06.160
awesome support of Linux Unplugged.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.160
Okay.

33:07.160 --> 33:12.680
So, Ron do you want to start by bringing us up to date on, is he in here, Ron are you?

33:12.680 --> 33:15.760
Yeah, Ron do you want to start by bringing us up to date on kind of where we're at right

33:15.760 --> 33:21.240
now with the Debian init system because I got to be honest, I got to make a disclaimer.

33:21.240 --> 33:25.600
After Sunday came around and we kind of looked like we were locked into system D, I sort

33:25.600 --> 33:29.480
of stopped carrying a little bit just because it seemed like a lot of drama was, it seemed

33:29.480 --> 33:32.040
like things were getting a little nasty, a little personal.

33:32.040 --> 33:36.920
So what's happened in the last couple of days since like say Sunday, Rod?

33:36.920 --> 33:42.840
Well the main issue is that they've kind of officially decided that system D is what they're

33:42.840 --> 33:50.200
going with and the drama started with Ian kind of calling for a vote for BDale to be

33:50.200 --> 33:52.200
pulled down as chairman.

33:52.200 --> 33:56.840
That kind of pretty much backfired in him and people were starting to say that he needs

33:56.840 --> 33:58.920
to be taken out of the TC.

33:58.920 --> 34:05.160
So to kind of stave off that, right the technical committee, he decided to stave off that happening.

34:05.160 --> 34:10.920
He kind of voluntarily is taking a break for a couple of days he said and then as soon

34:10.920 --> 34:16.820
as that happened the next day BDale cast his vote which kind of solidified system D being

34:16.820 --> 34:17.820
the choice.

34:17.820 --> 34:23.940
And if I'm correct, tell me if I'm not, BDale because he's chair, in the case of a tie,

34:23.940 --> 34:25.860
his vote counts as two votes.

34:25.860 --> 34:28.600
So it'd be two votes for system D if there's a tie, right?

34:28.600 --> 34:31.160
Anybody else know if that's true or not?

34:31.160 --> 34:38.360
Well, I'm pretty sure it's something like that but it wasn't necessary because basically

34:38.360 --> 34:40.880
Ian pulled himself out of voting.

34:40.880 --> 34:45.320
And this is kind of interesting voluntarily standing down now, is that because did you

34:45.320 --> 34:48.460
guys get the impression that's because people were accusing him of having some sort of ulterior

34:48.460 --> 34:49.460
motive here?

34:49.460 --> 34:53.760
What was the what was the reason for the step aside just because emotions were getting flaring

34:53.760 --> 34:55.760
up and things like that?

34:55.760 --> 34:59.160
It was getting really heated.

34:59.160 --> 35:04.480
So whether that's why or not but essentially when he called for the BDale to be dropped

35:04.480 --> 35:08.920
down, I think three people called for him to be kicked out.

35:08.920 --> 35:09.920
Wow.

35:09.920 --> 35:14.120
Okay, so I here's this is kind of stuff I just I'm not really that big on following

35:14.120 --> 35:16.960
but I just wanted to sort of set up what's been going on so that way people have some

35:16.960 --> 35:23.200
context of sort of the you know the scope of this decision that apparently is it's really

35:23.200 --> 35:28.080
weighing on the on the Debian project here and what has really struck me on the onset

35:28.080 --> 35:33.040
of all this is how it all seemed like a foregone conclusion to me and I think this is part

35:33.040 --> 35:37.320
of why I've been so frustrated with this whole thing because technically speaking system

35:37.320 --> 35:42.200
D seems like just from a pure technical standpoint the superior solution but then when you also

35:42.200 --> 35:46.440
consider the things like the CLA and other and other problems that would be introduced

35:46.440 --> 35:51.960
that also seems like it clearly eliminates upstart unless they want to take on some sort

35:51.960 --> 35:57.960
of fork and then you look at other solutions like open RC that have a lot of critics it

35:57.960 --> 36:01.000
always seemed like system D was the proper choice and the fact that system D is already

36:01.000 --> 36:05.360
available in Debian testing seemed like it made it the obvious choice.

36:05.360 --> 36:10.160
So what the hell what the hell am I not seeing here what am I not getting what is it what

36:10.160 --> 36:14.920
is it they have been debating over what has been the big roadblock here for them making

36:14.920 --> 36:18.680
a decision on this kind of thing and the reason why I almost sound a little upset is because

36:18.680 --> 36:23.640
it's almost getting a little embarrassing at this point.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.640
It's Debian though.

36:24.640 --> 36:29.700
Well well it's pretty much done now it seems but they I'd say the only thing they were

36:29.700 --> 36:37.040
really arguing over is the well two things is the CLA and the other kernel connection

36:37.040 --> 36:39.920
which basically system D breaks that.

36:39.920 --> 36:46.200
I guess what I'm worried about is this are we watching sort of the are we watching Debian

36:46.200 --> 36:49.560
become an ineffective project or has it always been this bad and this is just sort of the

36:49.560 --> 36:54.320
recent thing that highlights it I guess is that does that seem like a fair question?

36:54.320 --> 36:58.600
Well I think it is I think you've mentioned before in the past that you know these type

36:58.600 --> 37:02.840
of debates and discussions have pretty much always happened inside you know different

37:02.840 --> 37:08.080
Linux communities but now with so many different mailing lists and people looking to put out

37:08.080 --> 37:12.440
news articles the moment something gets said it gets repeated around so many times.

37:12.440 --> 37:19.440
So I think it's just as you've stated in the past the speed at which we now broadcast this

37:19.440 --> 37:24.800
these discussions and these disagreements has grown so much that now it seems like it's

37:24.800 --> 37:26.720
worse than I believe it really is.

37:26.720 --> 37:30.400
Yeah it's basically the same for it's been like the same for the past five years at least

37:30.400 --> 37:31.400
that I can remember.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.400
This one seems particularly bad though.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.160
But it just didn't get as heated.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.520
I think maybe that's why it's gotten the coverage it has and it's not just news outlets anymore

37:37.520 --> 37:41.520
it's just general interested bystanders are tweeting out links to the mailing list it's

37:41.520 --> 37:46.240
every every major new post is you know there's four posts of it to reddit.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.400
Daredevil I want to give you a chance to chime in here what do you think?

37:49.400 --> 37:56.840
You know what I was about just to say is that pretty much the discussions on the mailing

37:56.840 --> 38:02.000
list is always a slow communication medium and until getting that it's just a matter

38:02.000 --> 38:07.160
of we're constantly looking because it's an interesting project that's it.

38:07.160 --> 38:14.520
But other decisions on Debian have been always sort of posing ethical and technical questions

38:14.520 --> 38:18.000
they don't focus on only on the technical side.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.040
Crossroads do you think this is a lack of focus problem?

38:21.040 --> 38:26.360
I mean yeah I think that they want to I think that they want Debian to be available to as

38:26.360 --> 38:32.000
many people as possible so they want it to even be available on the on the BSD and systems

38:32.000 --> 38:35.520
and system D requires C groups that they won't run on BSD.

38:35.520 --> 38:40.280
Popeye is our resident upstart fan I'm always interested to hear what you think.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.200
I wouldn't say I'm necessarily an upstart fan.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.520
I'm just poking.

38:44.520 --> 38:52.520
Yeah I know I'm not so sure I mean I mentioned last time that there's more eyeballs on this

38:52.520 --> 38:57.880
partly because you know there's more eyeballs on everything because of social media and

38:57.880 --> 39:03.280
everyone wanting instant updates on everything and everyone reporting everything pretty quickly

39:03.280 --> 39:09.060
after the event occurs and keeping an eye on mailing lists and that becomes news.

39:09.060 --> 39:14.320
But also don't forget the other side which is a positive side Debian is much more popular

39:14.320 --> 39:19.760
and much more heavily used than it ever was before so any of these discussions that happened

39:19.760 --> 39:24.560
on a random Debian mailing list the only people who are interested were nerds whereas now

39:24.560 --> 39:30.840
you've got Ubuntu users, Mint users, system D developers, Fedora users, Red Hat users,

39:30.840 --> 39:33.360
all these people who are interested in Debian.

39:33.360 --> 39:37.660
So there's a lot of focus on it not just from the media but also from people who have a

39:37.660 --> 39:39.960
vested interest in what goes on in Debian.

39:39.960 --> 39:44.400
I think that is a big point to underscore right there and Bank and Drinker you sounded

39:44.400 --> 39:47.920
like you had a kind of a perspective from a new Linux user is this look like insanity

39:47.920 --> 39:48.920
from the outside?

39:48.920 --> 39:54.400
No it sort of looks like it's been overblown so the way I look at it is from what I can

39:54.400 --> 39:58.800
see from a newbies perspective it sort of doesn't matter as much as it's been shown

39:58.800 --> 40:03.880
us because from what I can see if system D isn't your thing you can just install upstart

40:03.880 --> 40:04.880
or open RC.

40:04.880 --> 40:10.320
Yeah I think you know I think this is part of I think there's I almost feel like there

40:10.320 --> 40:15.920
was a bigger decision being made in a sense at the same time they were picking the init

40:15.920 --> 40:20.680
system and I feel like that decision was do we want to unify a great part of the core

40:20.680 --> 40:25.120
of Linux in a sense and some people feel like in part of doing that we're throwing out a

40:25.120 --> 40:29.480
bit of the Unix philosophy and there's this constant reevaluation in the Linux community

40:29.480 --> 40:35.960
about the our Unix roots versus practical needs and I feel like that was the meta discussion

40:35.960 --> 40:41.400
being had and perhaps that's why the interest was so intense and the Debian committee technical

40:41.400 --> 40:46.120
committee and the other Debian developers maybe felt the weight of that meta discussion

40:46.120 --> 40:47.120
what do you guys think?

40:47.120 --> 40:51.640
I also think sorry that it was a lot of it was emotion to be honest it was quite an emotional

40:51.640 --> 40:54.240
discussion more than the technical one.

40:54.240 --> 40:56.040
Go ahead Poppy.

40:56.040 --> 41:01.760
Russ Albury posted a lengthy mail recently which kind of sought to explain some of the

41:01.760 --> 41:06.000
stuff that went on on the list on the technical committee and the fact that these guys are

41:06.000 --> 41:13.240
all friends and they get on fairly well and maybe people's perspective from the outside

41:13.240 --> 41:17.640
is not the same perspective as those guys on the inside have.

41:17.640 --> 41:22.040
Right right yeah that's fair Q5 why don't you chime in I know you had something to say.

41:22.040 --> 41:27.800
Yeah I've talked with a lot of people recently about this and I've noticed a trend that there

41:27.800 --> 41:32.040
seem to be a large number of people you were discussing about meta discussions that a lot

41:32.040 --> 41:35.560
of people have become pro System D just because they're against some of the business moves

41:35.560 --> 41:40.640
that Canonical has made and by extension I want to reject Canonical by rejecting Upstart.

41:40.640 --> 41:44.840
So it's like a form of Canonical hate in a sense to just like System D because it's

41:44.840 --> 41:45.840
not Upstart.

41:45.840 --> 41:51.120
Yeah I've actually heard that statement from people before regarding System D versus Upstart

41:51.120 --> 41:54.880
where people have said you know I don't really know much about System D I just don't want

41:54.880 --> 41:57.200
Upstart to get it because that's what Canonical made.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.600
I guess there's probably always some of that going on and I wonder too like I look at I

42:00.600 --> 42:07.160
look at the big like down the road now what these kind of events do is they look really

42:07.160 --> 42:12.040
dramatic while they're happening but in a sense I feel like a lot of consensus has been

42:12.040 --> 42:13.920
built around System D now.

42:13.920 --> 42:18.220
Like I think the end result is the rest of the community just had this massive conversation

42:18.220 --> 42:23.720
and came to an agreement that they then all exerted upon the Debian community but as a

42:23.720 --> 42:28.520
whole collective System D kind of went from this Lenard's interesting thing that he's

42:28.520 --> 42:33.940
building for Red Hat to oh yeah this is probably the way that all Linux that can should go

42:33.940 --> 42:38.640
but it's not the end of all Linux's that don't and I think I think but I do think it does

42:38.640 --> 42:44.480
underscore this interesting consensus making process that happens as a result of these

42:44.480 --> 42:49.600
big flare ups and in the end result the community the hive mind comes to larger conclusions

42:49.600 --> 42:52.840
what do you think of that?

42:52.840 --> 42:58.760
I'm inclined to agree with you and I think there are there's a lot of focus on these

42:58.760 --> 43:04.320
things at the time but then later on we we move on like you know who really cares now

43:04.320 --> 43:08.440
that Ubuntu move the buttons to the left hand side who really cares that Ubuntu doesn't

43:08.440 --> 43:15.040
have GIMP on the CD who really cares that the CD is the image is over 800 megabytes

43:15.040 --> 43:21.280
so only fits on a USB stick at the time these things seem so important it's like the Beatles

43:21.280 --> 43:25.700
or Justin Bieber you know at the time it seems like it's massively important to everyone

43:25.700 --> 43:31.040
on the planet right now but you skip skip forward three years and nobody gives a crap.

43:31.040 --> 43:37.040
You know my favorite go-to for that is the whole Microsoft Novell deal that like we dedicated

43:37.040 --> 43:41.080
like three weeks of the Linux action show to covering and everybody was ready to burn

43:41.080 --> 43:44.560
Novell at the stake and here we are what three four year five years later and it doesn't

43:44.560 --> 43:48.000
really seem to have made too much of a difference on anything and we were all worried that like

43:48.000 --> 43:51.920
it was had some there was some sort of patent play at it that you know the Samba project

43:51.920 --> 43:58.120
was doomed and all these kinds of things that really turned out not to be a big deal.

43:58.120 --> 44:01.280
It's interesting how that comes about in hindsight because I mean at the time yeah that was you

44:01.280 --> 44:05.600
know it was perceived as just like you know the the clouds are turning blood red and the

44:05.600 --> 44:09.000
sun's gonna fall out of the sky and everything and I think the problem with this kind of

44:09.000 --> 44:15.440
consensus building is there are now tools available to manipulate the hive and like

44:15.440 --> 44:22.800
sort of and I think I think Lenart and crew kind of comes out looking like the good guys

44:22.800 --> 44:27.120
and not the good guys but kind of look comes out looking better on this whole thing and

44:27.120 --> 44:31.560
and really that was because he was able to go to his own Google Plus feed and have a

44:31.560 --> 44:36.600
platform to influence a lot of people and what they were how they how they viewed it

44:36.600 --> 44:40.120
and I think really you really think Lenart comes out being the good guy in this.

44:40.120 --> 44:46.080
I do not necessarily in terms of like like like the traditional sense but in terms of

44:46.080 --> 44:52.080
like the most logical maybe I don't know like like having the having the clearer perspective

44:52.080 --> 44:55.800
of the group it's not the right way to put either I think I think he comes away looking

44:55.800 --> 44:59.440
like he was he was right in the end maybe is that the way to put it?

44:59.440 --> 45:04.320
So he may well be technically right but I challenge you to go back over the last six

45:04.320 --> 45:10.120
months of Google Plus and whatever other mailing lists and find every occasion where Lenart

45:10.120 --> 45:15.560
has taken potshots at upstart pointing out bug reports pointing out things that upstart

45:15.560 --> 45:16.880
does or doesn't do.

45:16.880 --> 45:17.880
Now I agree.

45:17.880 --> 45:21.640
Now now now go back and find upstart developers doing the same thing and you know what you

45:21.640 --> 45:22.640
won't find them.

45:22.640 --> 45:26.080
I agree that that's not I don't really mean I don't mean all of that feed I just mean

45:26.080 --> 45:30.360
like during the heat of the discussion he's able to go and have a platform that he was

45:30.360 --> 45:34.960
able to influence a lot of people's thinking on the matter I mean I think if you look at

45:34.960 --> 45:39.340
like r slash Linux a lot of people were just repeating things that he posted on his G plus

45:39.340 --> 45:43.520
feed as if it was their own ideas and their own concepts and right it reminds me of an

45:43.520 --> 45:48.000
American presidential campaign exactly all these kind of Google Plus messages need to

45:48.000 --> 45:52.840
say underneath my name's Lenart Pottering and I approve of this message right it's that's

45:52.840 --> 45:56.720
exactly what I mean and I think that's why we have to be a little bit worried about this

45:56.720 --> 46:01.440
form of consensus building because it is ripe for manipulation and that's my point is that

46:01.440 --> 46:07.600
and I say most of my opinion regarding this matter actually came out of these Linux unplugged

46:07.600 --> 46:13.160
discussions and I kind of figured it was either going to be open RC or a system the nothing

46:13.160 --> 46:17.520
against canonical nothing against technically against upstart but I don't think they would

46:17.520 --> 46:22.320
have chosen that for the CLA crossroads I want to give you a chance to jump in to

46:22.320 --> 46:29.960
I don't really think that anyone came out looking like a good guy because the system

46:29.960 --> 46:35.120
D people what like Toby said we're going through and buying the bug reports and I almost looked

46:35.120 --> 46:39.720
petty and an upstart folks were just kind of silent so I don't think when there's this

46:39.720 --> 46:43.760
kind of arguing and this kind of tit for tat stuff if no one looks like a good guy good

46:43.760 --> 46:47.080
guy might not have been the right way to put I was just trying to think of a way to kind

46:47.080 --> 46:51.960
of frame it where I think people kind of rallied around the points he was making and kind of

46:51.960 --> 46:56.720
decided to you know to pick up on what he was what he was championing championing well

46:56.720 --> 47:00.760
I think I think he had technical accuracy on his side you know he was he was able to

47:00.760 --> 47:06.400
point out the odd bug report here and there or point out where system D might be technically

47:06.400 --> 47:11.400
superior and he and he certainly has that on his side and this it's very easy to rally

47:11.400 --> 47:17.920
round someone who is articulate and able to express how their product is technically better

47:17.920 --> 47:21.840
than someone else's but you don't have to be a douche when you do it that is that is

47:21.840 --> 47:26.040
sort of the underscores like if you can if you can manage to if you manage to do all

47:26.040 --> 47:30.400
that without offending a bunch of people that's sort of a win-win Baker drinker I wanted to

47:30.400 --> 47:37.240
let you chime in on the sort of the state of the debate yeah so all girls receive some

47:37.240 --> 47:42.120
as intense as it was Linux debate is sort of meant to be this way it sort of I was watching

47:42.120 --> 47:47.760
a talk a TED talk with Linus Torvalds boss and he explained how intense debate comes

47:47.760 --> 47:52.480
with a better decision at the end of day and I sort of think that people saying that the

47:52.480 --> 47:57.880
way the debate was not gone so politely if you will is kind of wrong I think it debate

47:57.880 --> 48:02.320
should be this way and it's worked out better it's actually almost been sickingly polite

48:02.320 --> 48:06.520
in some ways like here's be Dale's announcement that they're going with system D he writes

48:06.520 --> 48:11.220
thank you Anthony for your analysis of the votes per six dot three dot two I use my casting

48:11.220 --> 48:16.000
vote to choose D as the winner therefore the resolution reads we exercise our power to

48:16.000 --> 48:20.560
decide in case of overlapping jurisdiction six dot one dot two bias by assuring that

48:20.560 --> 48:24.520
the default init system for Linux architectures in Jesse should be system D should the project

48:24.520 --> 48:28.920
pass a general resolution before the release of Jesse asserting a position statement about

48:28.920 --> 48:34.040
issues of the of the day on init systems that position replaces the outcome of this vote

48:34.040 --> 48:38.000
and is adopted by the technical committee on its own decision that's a really interesting

48:38.000 --> 48:43.280
way to speak you know it sounds like it's like a like legislation being I could well

48:43.280 --> 48:47.360
yeah except the differences as things are actually happening that's true dubbing actually

48:47.360 --> 48:52.160
has activity no the bigger thing there is I think that it's it's not only sounds official

48:52.160 --> 48:55.680
but it'd be hard not to bust into laughter doing it really I would think yeah I mean

48:55.680 --> 48:58.640
they wanted they want to make it official I suppose they are the way making history

48:58.640 --> 49:03.200
with some of these decisions sure I guess there is that element to it all right guys

49:03.200 --> 49:10.360
will any other comments before we round off this discussion I will just like I would just

49:10.360 --> 49:17.680
like to say that actually earlier someone mentioned that the coverage like it wouldn't

49:17.680 --> 49:23.640
matter because we thought it was important at the time but I think actually covering

49:23.640 --> 49:28.960
such issues sometimes is what provokes people to think about the as an issue and actually

49:28.960 --> 49:35.080
try to find the better the best resolution and not attempt misleading directions yeah

49:35.080 --> 49:38.880
it does make for interesting back listening to when you go back and listen to the issues

49:38.880 --> 49:43.360
of the day in a way it's sort of a living documentation of what happened in some sense

49:43.360 --> 49:46.700
you know you get some of the nooks and crannies of the issue that you don't get when you look

49:46.700 --> 49:50.880
back on it three five years later so it's kind of fun from that standpoint talk about

49:50.880 --> 49:57.560
today and it you know open source and Linux so much is about building one piece at a time

49:57.560 --> 50:03.000
and and it's at that in itself inherently calls for analysis and discussion about the

50:03.000 --> 50:06.720
piece you're working on because every future piece after it is built on top of it so every

50:06.720 --> 50:10.360
piece matters in a sense and I think this one in particular because of the weight of

50:10.360 --> 50:14.440
the overall decision because of the meta discussion going on in the greater community it's been

50:14.440 --> 50:19.900
going on for a couple of years now I think this one in particular reach beyond just the

50:19.900 --> 50:25.120
interest of bloggers and podcasters and etc I think it really reached to the general user

50:25.120 --> 50:29.020
like poppy made the excellent point it affects it affects so many people now because the

50:29.020 --> 50:34.720
Debian project has grown and you know with with other huge projects like Ubuntu based

50:34.720 --> 50:38.960
on it it is really it's an important player now and what's really interesting about it

50:38.960 --> 50:45.140
is you could you could easily make it's one of our most important players and it is truly

50:45.140 --> 50:50.360
community driven and we have just watched this process unfold I mean who knows what

50:50.360 --> 50:55.420
kind of discussion there was internally at Red Hat before they set off on system D we

50:55.420 --> 50:58.780
probably could glean some of it from mailing list but I bet you don't get the full scope

50:58.780 --> 51:04.360
like you do here with Debian and it's just kind of interesting to watch it a truly community

51:04.360 --> 51:07.960
based project go through this process and yeah I don't know if it's necessarily a bad

51:07.960 --> 51:11.060
thing it took him as long as it did it just I wish it didn't get as heated and I wish

51:11.060 --> 51:16.000
maybe people would give folks a little more slack and consider that you know they are

51:16.000 --> 51:19.900
watching something from the outside I think yeah I think that's true I mean there's we

51:19.900 --> 51:22.980
do need to be sensitive to the fact there may be a lot of underpinnings we're not aware

51:22.980 --> 51:27.800
of and I have no problem with the amount of time that it takes but I think unless there

51:27.800 --> 51:32.260
was actual like threats made against people or whatever I do think the emotional side

51:32.260 --> 51:36.500
of it really is going to be hard to justify but the rest of it I would definitely agree

51:36.500 --> 51:40.220
I think that there's no question there's got to be things we're not aware of that could

51:40.220 --> 51:43.940
definitely get people a little bit riled but you know but we're all adults guys you know

51:43.940 --> 51:47.160
we got to at some point you got to like the person that stepped away that's the right

51:47.160 --> 51:51.420
approach that's good yeah it was a good decision you know if you're still kind of a little

51:51.420 --> 51:56.200
stuck on all of this well I got good news because it's one of these things it's it's

51:56.200 --> 51:59.160
maybe hard to wrap your brain around until you can play it as a video game well good

51:59.160 --> 52:03.340
news we actually have a video game version of the Ubuntu init system debate I'll have

52:03.340 --> 52:08.640
a link to the show notes you're kidding me no it's for real it's like it's it's here

52:08.640 --> 52:12.260
we go I'm playing it right now it's an it's an attorney game yeah the Debbie in init case

52:12.260 --> 52:16.300
get great emerald's trial and it explains to you what the hell's going on with all of

52:16.300 --> 52:24.940
this in video game style there we go there we go yeah yeah what kind of achievement do

52:24.940 --> 52:30.500
you get if you get the right one this is so this is so 80s awesome right now early 90s

52:30.500 --> 52:35.060
awesome and so look I mean come on how is this not the best way it's like Final Fantasy

52:35.060 --> 52:40.100
meets the Debbie in init debate I'm really disappointed that your idea of a game for

52:40.100 --> 52:45.460
this is not flappy bird it kind of felt like watching flappy somebody play flappy bird

52:45.460 --> 52:49.420
I'll tell you that yeah that's true well anyways I'll have a link to the Debbie in init case

52:49.420 --> 52:52.900
in the in the show notes if you want to get in on some of that craziness and then you

52:52.900 --> 52:56.780
know you get to learn a little something out and have fun this is true maybe next time

52:56.780 --> 53:01.660
they'll take poppy's advice and make the flappy bird edition assuming that well and if you

53:01.660 --> 53:04.940
install it on your phone and then you can flip it on eBay for 50 grand or what isn't

53:04.940 --> 53:12.060
that crazy I know all right so Ben a 14 year old listener writes in and he says hey there

53:12.060 --> 53:15.700
Chris and Matt I'm a 14 year old Linux user who would self proclaim himself as a Linux

53:15.700 --> 53:20.380
geek and I'm an avid listener of Linux unplugged well hello Ben says I use arch well how about

53:20.380 --> 53:25.420
that inspired by inspired by the arch challenge and roll my own arch Linux Raspberry Pi lamp

53:25.420 --> 53:30.100
server as well as being a happy user of a custom rig built by myself oh man I want to

53:30.100 --> 53:35.060
adopt you he says and more he says and the more I look around the amount of Linux advocates

53:35.060 --> 53:40.160
of my generation is very a very small number and it worries me it worries me and surely

53:40.160 --> 53:45.460
could be some concern to people of your generation as kids aren't getting sufficient education

53:45.460 --> 53:49.940
about computers other kids my generation in my so-called IT classes don't seem to be educated

53:49.940 --> 53:53.820
enough unless they really go and look for it like myself which most people will not

53:53.820 --> 54:00.780
do personally I I think that kids of my generation probably of others are not being stretched

54:00.780 --> 54:05.740
and not getting the sufficient grounding they need I could be arrogant here although I reckon

54:05.740 --> 54:11.500
I could teach my IT class better than my minimum wage teacher does well it sounds like you

54:11.500 --> 54:15.020
might be able to which brings me on to my next point Linux doesn't seem relevant to

54:15.020 --> 54:19.880
a lot of people and it seems somehow minor to them I have largely covered my thoughts

54:19.880 --> 54:24.220
on the matter of Linux's popularity which I cover on a blog that I call the Linux situation

54:24.220 --> 54:27.020
be great if you would just look over it and share your thoughts thanks for the thanks

54:27.020 --> 54:30.340
guys and keep up the good work so Ben says that a lot of people don't find Linux relevant

54:30.340 --> 54:33.820
anymore and the darn kids now we talked about this a little bit the darn kids aren't finding

54:33.820 --> 54:38.620
Linux that interesting and I just saw an article I don't have a link to it I just saw an article

54:38.620 --> 54:43.620
recently that said Linux should be part of IT curriculum and that doesn't yeah doesn't

54:43.620 --> 54:47.420
that kind of make sense to for an IT curriculum that makes complete sense if you want to teach

54:47.420 --> 54:51.500
computers teach them what teach them like to load a Linux distribution you can learn

54:51.500 --> 54:56.220
so much about disk partitioning and so like if you're really taking a computer class it

54:56.220 --> 54:59.540
almost doesn't make a disservice to use Windows because it's like teaching somebody how to

54:59.540 --> 55:03.340
work on a car and you give them a car with the hood sealed that's right that's right

55:03.340 --> 55:07.420
because I know I folks now that are suffering because of that they they specialized in Windows

55:07.420 --> 55:11.300
and now we're having to backtrack and learn stuff that they could have had the opportunity

55:11.300 --> 55:16.380
to learn a long time ago so it's actually become a hindrance yeah yeah go ahead I'm

55:16.380 --> 55:26.300
sorry go ahead I was just gonna say that I think the biggest part of all this is mainly

55:26.300 --> 55:31.020
like you know if you teach them one specific technology then a few years later you have

55:31.020 --> 55:39.660
this big setback and what should really be the core part about it is teaching okay here's

55:39.660 --> 55:45.660
the basic parts of the computer here's how to get a good sense for being able to read

55:45.660 --> 55:53.820
error messages or whatever to basically give the foundation for a flexible mind about computing

55:53.820 --> 56:01.820
so that you know as time goes on you're able to adjust to whatever various things may come

56:01.820 --> 56:07.540
in just because you have enough of a foundation that you're able to reason your way through

56:07.540 --> 56:13.580
anything that gets put in front of you and and of course knowing how to use Google or

56:13.580 --> 56:19.260
whatever to do your own research yeah well that sounds good but it's highly debatable

56:19.260 --> 56:24.900
what is a good foundation so that would be hard to do a curriculum for yeah that's true

56:24.900 --> 56:28.380
so the guy in here says he's part of this generation he has some thoughts on this go

56:28.380 --> 56:37.060
ahead the guy hi Chris less yeah so I'm part of this newfangled teenage generation and

56:37.060 --> 56:42.660
I just wanted to say that I really agree that there's not enough education about that this

56:42.660 --> 56:48.300
sort of thing I go to a school with over a thousand kids and of them I'm one of maybe

56:48.300 --> 56:52.820
like five people that's heard of Linux and I'm the only person that actually uses it

56:52.820 --> 57:01.120
that I'm aware of it's just a matter of people don't know go ahead everything that I learned

57:01.120 --> 57:08.060
about Linux was just on my own I mean I first talked about it through a con what's it called

57:08.060 --> 57:13.140
a conference and most people don't go to that sort of thing yeah yeah urban urban 120 go

57:13.140 --> 57:23.140
ahead yes I think that I heard first of Linux one time that I was with some guys that know

57:23.140 --> 57:29.780
a lot about computers but I actually started using Linux because I started watching news

57:29.780 --> 57:39.780
action show and I figured out that it is awesome I'm 16 years old and in my school we mentioned

57:39.780 --> 57:50.140
feelings that it exists but we in school views word views Microsoft everything is based on

57:50.140 --> 57:56.420
not free software right and everything is from Microsoft or from other companies yeah

57:56.420 --> 58:03.700
when we gave an assignment for school we need to we need to have it in font times new roman

58:03.700 --> 58:11.260
which is from Microsoft and dots dots file and everything is based on the proprietary

58:11.260 --> 58:17.380
solutions all right bit puffin go ahead yeah I was just thinking that this doesn't only

58:17.380 --> 58:22.360
apply to like operating systems but also like software in general like for example in my

58:22.360 --> 58:29.020
school with 3d program we learned Maya and Photoshop but it would have been better I

58:29.020 --> 58:35.260
think if we learned gimp and blender because that we could use after school yeah you can

58:35.260 --> 58:39.780
get on your own I know that's what you do like freelance work so yeah crossroads you're

58:39.780 --> 58:44.700
from this generate that the generation we're speaking of what do you think I mean I go

58:44.700 --> 58:50.620
to a school probably about 2000 there are very very few kids who know what Linux is

58:50.620 --> 58:54.820
and I can say the word Linux or the word open source and I just get kind of this look like

58:54.820 --> 59:01.900
what are you talking about actually our home our homecoming King this year what is a Linux

59:01.900 --> 59:09.100
nerd he's one of my best friends but um anyway I would love for there to be some basic computer

59:09.100 --> 59:14.500
education because I've had people ask me why the Internet's broken and why I mean it's

59:14.500 --> 59:18.940
just there needs to be something and even if it's not Linux there needs to be something

59:18.940 --> 59:24.940
like this is the Internet yeah I mean I do worry about getting down a path of like you

59:24.940 --> 59:29.140
see on Star Trek where the Captain Kirk arrives to the planet and it's being run by one giant

59:29.140 --> 59:32.980
computer and nobody knows how to how it works and they all think it's a god and they all

59:32.980 --> 59:37.940
worship it or something with her done I know you want to make a point go ahead I think

59:37.940 --> 59:43.220
the problem goes further than that I mean I've just completed university and the number

59:43.220 --> 59:49.100
of people that couldn't even install basic software was ridiculous so I don't even think

59:49.100 --> 59:54.140
they're teaching anything at all in IT classes so it's pretty much a joke isn't this isn't

59:54.140 --> 01:00:00.620
this why tablets are seeing the success they are because it is really just so much easier

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:04.580
for people to pick them up and install apps I mean I literally I mean I'm looking at people

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:08.980
who've never used a computer in their lives and they're in their 50s 60s and even 70s

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.900
and they're picking these things up and they're they're installing applications like Netflix

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:16.300
and Kindle and they're using them and it's just blowing my mind I mean there's still

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:22.460
kids my age who I had one girl come up to me and ask me how do I install this app and

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:25.420
she was running she was an iPhone it's not like it's even difficult she didn't even know

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:31.260
how to install an app well there is that daredevil I want to give you a chance to make your point

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:38.300
so I actually think we can have a different view for a while on this matter I think in

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:46.100
the overall picture IT education has been focused on application usage and getting just

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:53.620
whatever the school is sponsored to sort of make advertising propaganda and at that point

01:00:53.620 --> 01:01:01.260
I don't think it's a matter of what the school teaches but actually if we look at the user

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:07.380
base that Linux has has been pretty much a matter of getting people into learning on

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:12.380
their own and they actually become much more informed and at that point I think it benefits

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:19.260
the overall community and helps actually introducing users not just as users but as also contributors

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:24.820
or part of the community and I don't think that's a bad thing I think it could be improved

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:32.700
and I think actually shows like this do their part on putting the word out I hope so and

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:36.020
I think you're right to an extent that if it's important enough and people need to get

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.100
a job done they eventually come across it in a lot of cases people don't know about

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:44.100
Linux is simply because they've never needed to solve a problem that it solves all right

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:49.380
well we got we got we're gonna wrap up with the last two here MW for her M woofer M woofer

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:54.100
I like that I make you I apologize for that I never really thought about the name ever

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:58.900
being pronounced out loud it's just my initials and then the first four characters in my last

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:06.820
name so it's okay yeah well I was just gonna say that what I've been seeing more and more

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:17.660
of is developing this blind spot where it's it's not quite fear but more just willful

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:23.200
ignorance of some kind where they just say well it's a computer I probably can't understand

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.500
it I'm not going to try to understand it and you know when when they have to do something

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:32.420
on the computer they go in and they flail around but it's like they're developing this

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:37.540
mental block that maybe at a lot of points they aren't even realizing is operating that's

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:41.420
just keeping them from picking up information it's a computer therefore I'll never learn

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.340
how to do it so therefore I just won't that kind of thing bacon drinker do you want to

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:50.540
take us out with your last point yeah I think the problem lies in in modern technologies

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:55.820
and I've succeeded some from the new generation but when you know when you go back in 10 20

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:59.300
years when you have when you bought something you had a screw in the back of it and you

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.780
could open it quite easily with the Phillips screwdriver and look inside but nowadays you've

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:07.540
got like talk five screws on the MacBooks and glued to get the phones and it's no incentive

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:11.740
to go ahead and open this stuff right in fact there's every incentive not to open it exactly

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:16.140
damage it and void the warranty in the case of good phone and things like that yeah I

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:20.620
don't truly own a device until you avoid its warranty that very good right very true or

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:25.340
until you've taken it apart and put it back together again well let's let's take the rest

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:29.300
of this in the post show discussion because I think that's a good a good point to wrap

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:34.040
up to in a response to Ben's email and Ben I hope some of that's help provide some insights

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:39.040
and you know one thing you can always do is show folks a way for folks to have a need

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:44.380
to be solved a problem to be solved and show them how Linux solves that problem and I think

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:47.820
once you show them make what it can do for them maybe it's maybe they want to finally

01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:51.740
get into some sort of application development maybe they want to set up a file server at

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:55.380
home and run Plex honestly it always depends on the person you know that's one of the reasons

01:03:55.380 --> 01:04:00.780
I used to love comp is is I used to show comp is off at work and clients and people just

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:05.140
like oh my god what is that what how do you do that oh this is Linux let me show you and

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:09.520
that was a door opener and nowadays I just had somebody over at my house a total computer

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.700
noob and they were just blown away by Plex blown away by Plex could never see anything

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:17.660
like Plex can't believe something like Plex exists it's incredible like well here's what

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.660
you need and you know that could be an example well here let me set up a help you set up

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:25.180
a Linux box install Ubuntu here we'll put Plex media server on it Bob's your uncle Bob's

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:28.100
your uncle all right now well I think that's a good spot to wrap up here for this week's

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:33.700
