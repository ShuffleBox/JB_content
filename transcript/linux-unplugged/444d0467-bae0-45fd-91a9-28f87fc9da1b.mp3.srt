1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
So, this is the XFCE perspective, and this is why, even though I give Joe a hard time,

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:15,240
I get it, because I worked at a place when I was in high school, and I came back, and

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,480
I'm not, I'm almost positive, it may have been nine years, but I think it was almost

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,280
ten years on the nose.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,960
I came back, and I shit you not, one of the same Dell workstations that we set up with

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,800
Debian and XFCE to administer the servers was still in the IT department.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,120
It had been dist-upgraded a couple of times, it was still running XFCE, it was still that

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,080
original install on that same original hardware, it had just been upgraded, and it was the

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,000
identical XFCE desktop it was when I left.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,800
The terminal, everything was exactly the same.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Stable as a rock.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,680
And you look at that and you go, holy shit, that is something, that is ten years of consistency.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,240
I doubt it would hold up anymore, but at that time, when I saw that, this was many years

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,620
ago now, I was blown away by that, I was like, damn, that's not something we get on modern

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,360
computers anymore, that's just not how computers work anymore, they don't build them like they

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
used to.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,640
Chris, if I tell you that I have probably the same configuration for my E17 desktop

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,760
I had about ten years ago, no change.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Really?

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,640
And it works, no problem.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,280
Do you attribute that to, what do you attribute that to?

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,960
Desktop environment, hardware choices at the time, distro, what do you attribute that to?

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,840
The E17 manager came with the composite manager years ago.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
It was early.

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Before all the others.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
Yeah.

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
Very early.

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Right.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,080
And once you had your configuration, and that configuration stayed stable, so it's E17,

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,880
now it's E22, it's just an involvement.

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,160
In the background they changed a lot, but the configuration stays the same, so I can

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,640
use the same configuration as before.

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
That is nice.

34
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,520
I do really, thank you, because I don't really have a lot of experience with E17, so that's

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,000
a good perspective, but Wes, we must get this show on the road.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,340
There's Linux to discuss.

37
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,020
There is much to talk about, so with that, let's get going.

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,680
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 242.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,480
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's got so much to discuss, from

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,880
birthdays to new features and new distros, that we've got to get right into it.

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
My name is Chris.

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
My name is Wes.

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Hello, Wes.

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,960
I'd say it's super good to be with you and all that stuff, but I've actually been hanging

45
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
out with you all day.

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
That is true.

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,920
So it's just been nice hanging out with you today.

48
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,320
We had some Chinese food, we got the dogs in studio.

49
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,840
Now we're in the perfect mood for today's Unplugged.

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Totally, totally.

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,200
In fact, we've got something really fun coming up.

52
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,320
We're going to take a look at the new Slack's 9.4.

53
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
You know about Slack's.

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,600
It used to be based on Slackware, now it's based on Debian, and they've got some really

55
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,160
cool features and, well, maybe might just be the perfect distro for you secret agents.

56
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
I'll tell you about that coming up.

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,040
Then we're going to get into some new, brand new spanking features we're rolling out here

58
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,960
on the Unplugged program, podcast updates, everybody, and then not one, not two, but

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:22,880
three updates to this story about Google blocking G apps on uncertified devices.

60
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,520
Is your custom ROM doomed?

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,560
Stay tuned and find out.

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,360
Microsoft has some new open source, and after you hear about what it is, it'll be like,

63
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
how come they didn't do that sooner?

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Yeah.

65
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,320
I thought they were all about the open source.

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,040
Then a new Wayland contender enters the field.

67
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,400
We'll tell you about that, how people are creating their own open source Tesla wall

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
replacement.

69
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
You know those Tesla batteries?

70
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Yeah.

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Fancy.

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Yeah.

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,360
In fact, I'm going to propose we could combine two different open source initiatives, one

74
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,360
that Joe and I talked about, and this initiative to really make something special.

75
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,040
Then we got a couple of app picks, and then, yeah, like I said, we'll get to slacks, which

76
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
is super cool.

77
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,440
I got it running on my machine right here, right now.

78
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
I love it.

79
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,440
But before we go any further, we've got to bring in our virtual log.

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,240
Time appropriate greetings, Mama Roo.

81
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
What's up?

82
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Hello.

83
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Hello.

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Get it out of here.

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,680
A rare Joe Rez appearance in the virtual log this week.

86
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
That's great.

87
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,720
It's good to see you, everybody.

88
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,320
Thank you for being here.

89
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,680
Did you guys notice, you probably did, but I thought it's worth mentioning here on the

90
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,720
show, Red Hat turned 25 yesterday.

91
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:37,320
So that means 1993, and Red Hat points out that that was pre-dot-com boom, pre-mobile,

92
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,960
pre-cloud computing, pre-big data, pre-DevOps and containers, and Red Hat has been through

93
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,480
it the whole time.

94
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,480
And at first, I was like, oh, that's cute, but then you think about it, like, shit, that's

95
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,680
a lot of stuff to have to respond to.

96
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,080
Those are a lot of big trends.

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,240
The dot-com boom is alone like a make it or break it, right?

98
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Absolutely.

99
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,360
Like a lot of companies died.

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,560
And then cloud computing and mobile and all of that, instead of it making Red Hat irrelevant,

101
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,600
they managed each time to sort of turn and meet the new challenge.

102
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:24,120
And now on their fricking 25th birthday, they're damn near worth $2 billion.

103
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,200
Because the market has been has been sort of flushing out for so long and establishing,

104
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,560
it's like the next few years are going to be some of the most critical, I think.

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,200
Because there's a lot of really valuable real estate, and Red Hat isn't necessarily the

106
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,760
best position to take advantage of it.

107
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm thinking about AWS, and I'm thinking about Azure, and I'm thinking about Rackspace.

108
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,240
Ubuntu is about 70%.

109
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,880
And if I'm Red Hat, I'm looking at that going, we've got to get some of that market.

110
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,340
We've got to get some of that market.

111
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:00,320
And so I wouldn't be surprised if 2018 isn't going to be a really aggressive year for Red

112
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Hat, especially 2019.

113
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
25 years.

114
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
That's a lot of stuff.

115
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
It is.

116
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
That's a lot of stuff.

117
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,080
And you know, they got the Red Hat Summit coming up in San Fran.

118
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,760
Tempted to go, tempted to email them and say, hey, what do you think about me going to Red

119
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Hat Summit?

120
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,400
It's in San Fran.

121
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,640
I've decided after scale that pretty much anything south of San Francisco is no good.

122
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,800
I don't know, have you been to California before?

123
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Yes, I have.

124
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,440
I think you're about, have you ever noticed it just gets really brown and smoggy after

125
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,440
San Francisco?

126
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, I'm going to go to Pasadena and scale, and I love it down there.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You guys are great.

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,960
But really, everything after San Francisco is just no good.

129
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Don't tell them.

130
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
They'll come up to Washington.

131
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
That's what they're doing.

132
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,040
I know.

133
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
You joke.

134
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,880
But that's actually like a local controversy is that all these damn Californians keep coming

135
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
up to our Washington.

136
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,400
Not that we don't love you, dear California listeners.

137
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,880
Yeah, no, we love the listeners.

138
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
We love the listeners.

139
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,680
It's just their damn roads that we hate.

140
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,400
The Red Hat Summit is in San Francisco on May 8th to the 10th.

141
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,120
I mean, I'm certainly glad Red Hat's around.

142
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,240
It would be more boring otherwise.

143
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Go ahead.

144
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Yeah, I would.

145
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Yeah, go ahead, Joe.

146
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,080
Yeah, I was going to say, you talked about like AWS and stuff and how Ubuntu is massive

147
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,280
on those platforms, but how much revenue is that actually bringing into them?

148
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,480
If you've ever got RHEL running on them, then Red Hat are making money, whereas most people

149
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:26,440
running Ubuntu on AWS or wherever aren't necessarily paying for support.

150
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,800
It doesn't really matter how much market penetration Ubuntu has got.

151
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,440
It all boils down to dollars and cents, doesn't it?

152
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
That's a fair point.

153
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,320
Yeah, not every AWS or Azure installation is necessarily translating to a support contract

154
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
with Canonical.

155
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,320
And there's a lot of T2 micros out there running Ubuntu and probably some RHEL machines in

156
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,360
the GovCloud doing real work.

157
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,160
There's lots of dot-com heroes who can swoop in and help you with your Ubuntu box, too,

158
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,320
so you don't have to go get that contract.

159
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,200
But I would submit you, Joe, there's still headwinds for Red Hat, too, because, take

160
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,680
AWS again, and just after I've begun, and I think you know what I'm talking about, Wes,

161
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,840
after I've begun to understand the scale of AWS recently, it almost doesn't matter what

162
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,640
all the other guys are doing.

163
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,200
AWS in itself is so large that if only they do something, it moves the whole industry.

164
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,360
The scale is in terms and numbers, it is hard for us to understand.

165
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,700
But Wes and I recently got a better understanding of it.

166
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,620
And the thing you got to consider with Red Hat is not only are they kind of behind already

167
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,960
in that space, but then you've got Amazon Linux, which we've talked about before.

168
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,800
And Amazon Linux is based on Red Hat, and it's supported by Amazon directly, and it's

169
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,060
part of their image gallery, and it's one-click deployment for Amazon Linux, which is essentially

170
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,120
kind of like sent to us, don't call it Red Hat.

171
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,960
And like if I'm on AWS, maybe that's what I deploy instead of Red Hat, you know?

172
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,000
So like now Red Hat not only has to compete against Canonical, but they've got to compete

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,960
against AWS's own home-brewed Linux, which is really just RHEL.

174
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
That's-

175
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
But isn't that just the startups?

176
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,720
Isn't that just the people who can't afford RHEL proper who are going to go for Amazon

177
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,000
Linux, but then the big companies who can actually afford to pay for the support contracts

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,480
are going to keep paying for RHEL, and-

179
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
I think so.

180
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,160
That's why RHEL have continued, you know, Red Hat have continued to be this huge company

181
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,000
who are now pushing, you talked about 2 billion, they're pushing 3 billion at this point.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah.

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,960
Yeah, I think you're probably right that if, you know, anybody that's going to have serious

184
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,480
infrastructure that's going to be making a lot of money, you know, like think about your

185
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,560
Facebooks and your YouTubes and your, anybody that's going to be rolling serious infrastructure

186
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,400
is going to have a support contract, and they're going to go with Red Hat.

187
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Yeah.

188
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Yeah.

189
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Red Hat's doing good.

190
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,080
Their stock's up today.

191
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,440
It's been a little all over the place, but 25 years is pretty respectable.

192
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Yeah.

193
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,880
I mean, they're obviously thinking about these new things too with their, you know, acquisition

194
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
of CoreOS and-

195
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Yes.

196
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
It's similar.

197
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
We'll see if it bears fruit.

198
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,960
Speaking of that, the whole, and so yeah, their big quote unquote Kubernetes play, right?

199
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,280
That's all about the future.

200
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,200
That's all about orchestration of lots of, lots of, lots of systems, which is, boy, that's

201
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,680
going to be fascinating to watch.

202
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
All right, Wes.

203
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,840
Well, we're not the only ones.

204
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Red Hat, you got out there, you got us out there.

205
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
We're making changes.

206
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Everybody's making big improvements.

207
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
It's spring.

208
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
It's the time for that.

209
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Yeah.

210
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,720
It's the season of change, and we have some nice improvements coming to the Unplugged

211
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,360
program that I want to tell you guys about, and a little bit of a heads up.

212
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,760
So last week I said, you're going to see some changes.

213
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,600
You're going to see some feed changes, all that kind of stuff.

214
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, here we are this week.

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's arrived.

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,200
We've got linuxunplugged.com, which is a nice companion to linuxactionnews.com.

217
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,500
So we've got linuxactionnews.com and linuxunplugged.com, dedicated site and a resource for this show,

218
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,240
and it will be sort of the canonical destination, I guess I'd say, if you will.

219
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Is that, can we say that?

220
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Is that fair?

221
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
You're allowed.

222
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Okay.

223
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
This time.

224
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
Yeah.

225
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Yeah.

226
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
All right.

227
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Good.

228
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
And so, for example, like say you wanted to get the links for something we talked about.

229
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,780
You go to linuxunplugged.com slash 242 or 241, for example, and you get all the links

230
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,040
for the stuff we talked about.

231
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
You want the RSS feed?

232
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
We got that too.

233
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,360
You go to linuxunplugged.com slash RSS or if you want links to your favorite podcast catcher,

234
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,240
it's linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe.

235
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Are you getting it?

236
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Yeah.

237
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
It's clean.

238
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
It's simple.

239
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
It looks easy.

240
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Yeah.

241
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Yeah.

242
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,520
New dedicated feeds, new dedicated site, and we're rolling out chapter markers to the

243
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
MP3 feed.

244
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Started last week.

245
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,520
So you'll see them if you have a, like a Pocketcast or Overcast or IEM that support.

246
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,800
One of the fancy clients.

247
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Yeah.

248
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Or desktop player.

249
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,200
I believe that VLC can do it.

250
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,360
I believe it's possible to accomplish that in VLC, Wes.

251
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Beautiful.

252
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
I believe, Wes.

253
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
I believe.

254
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,720
You can check that out though.

255
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Linuxunplugged.com.

256
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,360
As you go there, then go grab the RSS feed.

257
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,920
Make sure you've got the right feed, linuxunplugged.com slash RSS.

258
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
New stuff.

259
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,060
Chapter markers I think are going to be pretty popular.

260
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,960
People love them across all the other shows.

261
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,640
I soft launched them last week and already got a bunch of people saying they liked them.

262
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,160
So check out linuxunplugged.com.

263
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,640
Check out the new podcast feed now.

264
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
That's it.

265
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,400
There's going to be other changes coming.

266
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,640
Now some of these changes, none of you are going to care about.

267
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,960
You're going to be like, Chris, I don't even know why you're spending time on this.

268
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,200
And some of you are going to want to come to the studio and punch me in the face.

269
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,120
So it's a difficult position I find myself in.

270
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
You know what I'm saying?

271
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Difficult position.

272
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
I sure do.

273
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,600
Rekai's last week was, basically last week, he's still technically here, but we're trying

274
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,240
to like transition everything and get it all done and do everything before he's gone, right?

275
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,720
Like try to be proactive.

276
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,080
He gave his notice at the beginning of the month and we now have all the equipment, we're

277
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,000
doing the editing, I'm editing the shows.

278
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,840
And as part of that, I am making some damn changes because I'll tell you what, I don't

279
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,600
got another full time job in me.

280
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,360
And I can't be editing the video for this show.

281
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
I can't be doing it.

282
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,560
And we can't have you just falling over in exhaustion because then everything shuts down.

283
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,640
So we're going to make some changes, but I actually think people might like them.

284
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,400
So I'm going to be publishing a couple of different things for a little bit just to

285
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,360
experiment to see what the audience likes because none of this stuff is hard set.

286
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,400
But if you watch the video version of the unplugged program, there will probably be

287
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,520
two versions initially is what I'm thinking.

288
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,620
We're going to have the live version that will go on a new YouTube channel.

289
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,300
And then we'll have an edited version, which will go on the main Jupiter broadcasting channel,

290
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,240
the podcast version.

291
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,660
The primary release will be the MP3 feed at linuxunplugged.com.

292
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,480
We'll generate a video for that at the Jupiter broadcasting YouTube channel.

293
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,020
And then we have a JB live YouTube channel that we'll be setting up that will be the

294
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,000
complete live stream unedited full video version of the show.

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,440
I don't know if that's going to be how it is for say the next six months.

296
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,160
I don't know if it's going to be how it is for a month.

297
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,640
That's just how we're trying it right now as I'm trying out different stuff.

298
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,240
So that's kind of in the works.

299
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,400
So you'll see us experimenting with the video version.

300
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,440
If you watch that, I got to be honest with you, thousands of more, I mean, tens of thousands

301
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,000
of more people download the audio version than watch the video version.

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,240
So that's where my attention has to go because I've got to do this show.

303
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
I've got to do all the other shows.

304
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,560
I've got to edit all the other shows.

305
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,960
Well, except for land.

306
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Joe's editing land.

307
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Thank God.

308
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Yeah, I was going to say.

309
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Jeez.

310
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Thank God.

311
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Thank God.

312
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,280
Especially considering how bad those two guys mess up all the time.

313
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
Am I right?

314
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,840
And then when cats like happy jump in, you got somebody's got to edit that out.

315
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,840
That was actually as a funny moment that happened during land last week, a little behind the

316
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,760
scenes is we're sitting there recording and a cat for on Joe's side of the recording jumps

317
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
up on his keyboard.

318
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Oh, yes.

319
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,480
And it's like, I almost want to just leave that in the show.

320
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
I thought that was worth leaving in there.

321
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,860
It is in the telegram group.

322
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,960
If you want to go hear that outtake, Joe did actually pop it in our Jupiter broadcasting

323
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,660
telegram group at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash telegram anyways.

324
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,360
So these changes are coming down the pipe.

325
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,160
I I am using this as an opportunity to convert the show to a multitrack recording so that

326
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,360
Wes is on his own track.

327
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,420
I'm on my own track.

328
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,440
The Mumble Room is on his on their own track.

329
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,080
Richard Stallman's on his own track.

330
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,200
Get it out of here.

331
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,000
And then they all get processed individually and it makes the audio sound much better.

332
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,600
Everybody at the same level.

333
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,680
That stuff's finally happening because it's like, well, if I'm going to be sitting down

334
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,400
and taking over the edit for a bit, might as well do it the way I would want to do it

335
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
now.

336
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,900
Now, taking everything I've learned at some point, I'm going to hand this stuff off.

337
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,080
Things will be changing.

338
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,320
All of that is going to change in the future.

339
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,800
But for right now, I'm kind of circling the wagons.

340
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm taking it in house.

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm doing the work.

342
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,400
Not to sound braggadocios, but I'm going to try to move the bar up a little bit, get it

343
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
to the next level.

344
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,080
That's always my thing is try to move the quality up on all of our shows a little bit

345
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,680
and optimize for the audio experience.

346
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,680
Yes.

347
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,360
And still provide the complete unadulterated video version is my thought for those who

348
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
want it.

349
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Capture that live experience.

350
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Yeah.

351
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Yeah.

352
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
So we'll see.

353
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
We'll be experimenting with that.

354
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,120
Things will come and go as we implement new stuff.

355
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,200
But if you just want no fuss, get the show every single week and get the best version

356
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,280
possibly available, linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

357
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,680
Just grab the feed that if you have that, you don't have to worry about any of this.

358
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,680
But for those of you who follow us on the live stream or follow us on YouTube or download

359
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,260
the MP4 from the feeds or whatever, you will see some experimentation happening there.

360
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,480
We love you.

361
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,760
We will work with you.

362
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Just give us time.

363
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
I think that's fair.

364
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,160
That was a lot.

365
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,960
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

366
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,640
Speaking of people like to mess with computers, people who like to run unofficial Android

367
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,680
ROMs sort of got the slap down this week.

368
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,680
It looks like Google has been tweaking how they, well, authenticate, I guess you could

369
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,600
say, uncertified devices, quote unquote.

370
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,000
This is a story over at xdadevelopers.com with several updates.

371
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,840
So let's get through some of this.

372
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:04,160
A device maker must follow the CDD, which is a compatibility test suite from Google,

373
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,240
before they're allowed to preload Google apps and services on their device.

374
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,620
You're familiar with this if you've ever loaded an unofficial ROM and then you've had to go

375
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,320
out and get the G apps yourself.

376
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:18,080
Well, earlier this week, XDA Forums received an anonymous tip from a person claiming to

377
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,240
be within, quote unquote, the industry.

378
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,320
This person who said they worked for an OEM notified them that Google was going to start

379
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,200
entirely locking out newly built firmware from accessing G apps.

380
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,320
And this change apparently went into effect March 16th, 2018, and affects all software

381
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,800
builds made after that date.

382
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:48,120
Now, yesterday, a member on the XDA Forums, a senior member at that, came across the exact

383
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,560
problem on his own device, which kind of goes down the lines of you get a full screen error

384
00:17:53,560 --> 00:18:00,840
message that comes up that says in big red font, device is not certified by Google.

385
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,120
And then it's got helpful instructions for users who purchase this device, unlicensed

386
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,200
manufacturers, licensed manufacturers, and custom ROM users.

387
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,240
Actually, the custom ROM users is worth reading because there is a way for you to personally

388
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,840
authorize up to 100 devices.

389
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,740
So you can actually get around this problem.

390
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,920
So it's not the end of the world for custom ROM users.

391
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,280
It doesn't appear to be affecting custom ROMs that are pretty popular, though.

392
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,360
It's more like OEMs who have their own open source build of Android who have tried to

393
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,160
cram G apps on there, like Google sort of being selective in how they apply this.

394
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
Yeah, that makes sense.

395
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,720
I can see that being a problem for them as well in trying to have some level of quality

396
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,720
control so that they can have Android be a decent platform.

397
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,320
Yeah, although Mini brings up a good question.

398
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,800
Go ahead, Mini, or a good point.

399
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,880
This could be an issue for Ubuntu Touch, huh?

400
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,260
Well, this is really bad news for Ubuntu Touch or Salesforce.

401
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,760
There is this sandbox solution called nbox.

402
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,200
I think it is Ubuntu initiative.

403
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,240
And this starts to work quite well on devices that have at least a 3.10 kernel.

404
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,800
So with this announcement, lots of applications will not run on these devices because you

405
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,440
can't install the Google services.

406
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
That's the thing.

407
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
Yeah.

408
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Yeah, you're right.

409
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,280
There's this joke going in the selfish OS community about Google liking, like acting

410
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,000
like someone who's slowly boiling some frogs.

411
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,440
I mean, they started this open source project with Android, and now they're closing it down

412
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,240
more and more.

413
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,720
Yes, that is a point that I have made on this show before.

414
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,240
And it really bothered me when this now feels like ancient history.

415
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,600
But when they moved photos to a Play Store app from the open source photo management

416
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,080
app that was on Android, that really for me, and that in Chrome.

417
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,320
Remember when they switched from the open source browser to Chrome?

418
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,120
Yeah, you're right.

419
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,040
It has been a slow boil.

420
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,880
More and more reliance on everything Google, all the APIs.

421
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,640
Those insidious bastards.

422
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,680
Joe, you run custom ROMs 24-7.

423
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Does this concern you at all?

424
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:17,040
Or is that personal device activation slash registration thing sort of take care of it

425
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
for you?

426
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,280
Well, it worried me when I first heard about it.

427
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,880
But then I looked into it and read more about it.

428
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,240
And it's like, OK, it's going to be one more step.

429
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,040
I'm going to have to extract the device ID and then go to a Google web page and input

430
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,520
that and then get my device OK'd, whitelisted, whatever.

431
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,360
So it's a little bit more hassle for me.

432
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:50,480
But in terms of UbiPorts and Andbox, I mean, Andbox in UbiPorts is going to be the standout

433
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,040
feature in 2018.

434
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,920
And if this is going to make that harder to work, then that is very worrying for me.

435
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,760
In terms of running lineage, it's a mainstream custom ROM.

436
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,920
I'm not personally worried.

437
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:12,560
But yeah, those extra ROMs like lineage and sorry, like UbiPorts and Sailfish, that's

438
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,800
where I'm worried.

439
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,560
Yeah, good point.

440
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,160
And I also saw in the comments section on that forum, but it seems like a pretty good

441
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,100
tip, that you can use Titanium Backup to back up your ID.

442
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,520
And then when you load a new ROM, you can use Titanium Backup to restore that ID, then

443
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,360
install Google Apps and the GApp stuff, and you shouldn't have a problem.

444
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,080
Haven't tried it myself, obviously.

445
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,880
But that seems like that should be pretty solid, like that could work.

446
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
You know what?

447
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
I in the past had used Titanium Backup.

448
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,520
That was some good ass software.

449
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,560
Titanium Backup.

450
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
Just going to plug it.

451
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,200
It is, you know, it is, you've got to pay for it to get the full thing and to really

452
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,680
have it work, like to get the ID, you've got to have root on your device.

453
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,040
But if you're loading custom ROMs, you probably already do.

454
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,260
That isn't your issue.

455
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,400
Now this is your issue.

456
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,360
Like that was the easy part.

457
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,100
Speaking of mobile, let's talk about Ting.

458
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,560
It's smarter than unlimited.

459
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,360
You use less, you pay less.

460
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Linux.ting.com.

461
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:13,080
Linux.ting.com is where you go to get $25 in service credit if you bring a device, and

462
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,320
$25 off a device if you want to buy one directly from Ting.

463
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,680
And I really would encourage you just to go look.

464
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,220
They've got a bunch of great devices that you may have never even considered.

465
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,760
It's like we always talk about like three or four phones, but there are a ton of other

466
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,800
great phones out there.

467
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,260
And on the Ting blog too, if this is your thing, if this is your thing for Ting, they

468
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,240
just did a roundup of their favorite flip phones, including, it's not quite a flip phone,

469
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,640
but including the one that Noah got ages ago.

470
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,480
It's about as thick as three credit cards.

471
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,960
It's a little GSM phone.

472
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,440
You can literally put it in your wallet.

473
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
That's so easy.

474
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
That's so nuts.

475
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
I love it.

476
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,120
And guys, a bunch of great devices if you want to grab one or just get a SIM or bring

477
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
your own.

478
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,840
Just start by going to Linux.ting.com.

479
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,620
You pay for what you use, a fair price for however much you talk, text, or however much

480
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,620
data you use.

481
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,580
And they got nationwide coverage, GSM and CDMA, so you can rest assured that Ting has

482
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,580
got you covered.

483
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,520
I just took them down on my scale trip, and damn if the CDMA didn't rock it.

484
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,460
Also, personal recommendation.

485
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,720
If you are in the Eugene area of Oregon, holy crap.

486
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Holy crap.

487
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,020
The Ting CDMA network is blazing.

488
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,360
So is the GSM network.

489
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,360
But better than that, crazy great ping times.

490
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,920
I don't know what they're doing, but some of the best ping times I have had probably

491
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:40,200
this year was when I was on my way to scale in Eugene, doing the show remotely.

492
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
I did that whole show over the Ting connection.

493
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Remember that?

494
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
It was wonderful, yeah.

495
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
It worked great.

496
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
And I did Coder before that too.

497
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I did two shows over that Ting connection.

498
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
I love the flexibility.

499
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,920
You know, you want it as a hotspot, they're not blocking any of that stuff.

500
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,200
There's no big Ting strategy getting in the way.

501
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,500
They don't have some play for video streaming.

502
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,880
It's just pay for what you use wireless.

503
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,040
It's great.

504
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,600
Nationwide coverage, easy dashboard, fanatical customer service.

505
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,520
Just start by going to linux.ting.com.

506
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,480
And thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

507
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,680
That's linux.ting.com.

508
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,280
So Microsoft is open sourcing something today.

509
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,760
And when you hear about this, it's going to be like one of those, okay, that makes sense.

510
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,680
They have open sourced a Windows subsystem for Linux.

511
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Is that the right?

512
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Windows subsystem for Linux?

513
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Yeah.

514
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:32,080
A sample to let other distributions that they haven't reached out to personally follow,

515
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,280
so that way they can package up their distro for the Windows store.

516
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,640
Heyo!

517
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,560
The new process makes it clear on how Linux distributions can be adapted to run on the

518
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,720
Windows subsystem for Linux.

519
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,440
It's called the WSL Distro Launcher.

520
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,620
And it's now open source.

521
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:54,200
It's a C++ code base offering the launcher that could be customized for particular distributions.

522
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,800
And it helps you step through setting up the login shell, running commands, setting configuration

523
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
values.

524
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Bob's your uncle.

525
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
You're good to go.

526
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,600
You grab this open source sample.

527
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Follow that.

528
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,360
Then once you've got it all done, you just call up Microsoft and say, please, sir, please,

529
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,040
I'd really like to be in your app store, please.

530
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,200
Please let me in the app store.

531
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
Yes, I know.

532
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
I know.

533
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
I'm just a little distro.

534
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
I mean, you really go.

535
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
I mean, that is part of the process.

536
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
It is.

537
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
It is legitimately part of the process.

538
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,960
In fact, Microsoft outlines it right here on the Microsoft developer blog where they

539
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,320
talk about it.

540
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,120
And they say you have to submit it to the store.

541
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,160
You'll have to work with us to receive publishing approval.

542
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,720
If you're a Linux distribution owner interested in adding your distribution to the Microsoft

543
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,760
store, contact us at WSPartners at Microsoft.com.

544
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,400
You know what stood out to me about that article?

545
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,640
They use the word sideload a lot.

546
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,640
And it's just.

547
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Yeah.

548
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,280
They used to be a lockdown mobile OS term.

549
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
It's now a.

550
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Now it's a Windows term.

551
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Yeah.

552
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Right?

553
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
Yeah.

554
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,200
So the way they're doing this, too, is they're making these essentially universal Windows

555
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,200
applications.

556
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,720
Don't quote me on the terminology because, again, I'm not a big Windows guy.

557
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,280
But they're UWP applications.

558
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,480
UWP, which I think stands for Universal Windows something or others.

559
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,800
And it's a way to package up an application and deliver it in the Windows store.

560
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,520
You know, you and I went down on Friday night.

561
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,520
We went out and had some beers with Mr. Wimpy, who was in Seattle.

562
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,760
And he had been visiting some folks at Microsoft.

563
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
I think that's all public.

564
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,360
I think I'm allowed to say that.

565
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,040
And it was interesting hearing his insights into the conversations with Microsoft and

566
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,480
where they're at with all of this stuff.

567
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,760
It's a real sea change.

568
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,580
And it's super hard for those of us that have been in the Linux community since the early

569
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,600
days to really wrap our head around it.

570
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,000
And I completely agreed with Wimpy's take.

571
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,720
So I'm not putting words in Wimpy's mouth.

572
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,120
He just sort of said some of the things that I personally identified.

573
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,200
And that was when I was there weeks ago talking to them.

574
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:02,120
They don't have this air of guilt, or they're not coming at this apologetically, or they're

575
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,880
not groveling.

576
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,160
They're not treating it like, oh, we've been a bad boy, and we're really sorry, and now

577
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,080
we want to be friends with WinX.

578
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,840
We have a legitimate technology.

579
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,240
The open source community has a legitimate technology.

580
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,360
There's no reason that we can't make these two things work together, because that's exactly

581
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,760
what our customers want.

582
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,360
It's not because all of a sudden they've gotten the smell of RMS.

583
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,480
It's not because all of a sudden they just have totally embraced the Linux and Unix philosophies.

584
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,040
It's simply because they've figured out customers will pay us really good money to make this

585
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
shit work.

586
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,060
It's business over philosophy now.

587
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,840
And so they're meeting on this sort of technical level.

588
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,880
There's nothing to do with the former emotional baggage attached with Microsoft's battle against

589
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,360
Linux and open source.

590
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,680
And it's fascinating to watch it, because from the outside, you have no perception of it.

591
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,960
Microsoft makes an announcement.

592
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,080
It comes from this large company that has lots of money and lots of people.

593
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,280
And you can't really understand the four or five years of work behind the scenes that's

594
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
been happening.

595
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,720
And so when you see stuff like that, it's really easy to go, shit, Microsoft is just

596
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,640
going to be like, they're going to be the cancer.

597
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,200
They're going to spread all over Linux, and they're going to embrace and extinguish.

598
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,560
When you see things like, now it's easy for anybody to package up a distro on the Windows

599
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
store.

600
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:31,520
But the reality is, it seems to be that the nature of Linux, open source, and the GPL

601
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,720
is this unstoppable snowball.

602
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,520
It really is.

603
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,040
Every time these companies have tried to embrace and extinguish, they just end up being part

604
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
of the snowball.

605
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
They just get caught up with it.

606
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,680
And I think that's what's happening even to a large company like Microsoft.

607
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:51,240
It's not that Microsoft is trying to rip off Linux users or buy off Linux or trying to

608
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,680
influence open source development.

609
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:00,080
It's that even a company as large as Microsoft couldn't stop the Linux open source snowball.

610
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,160
Yeah, they're just forced to play ball with it, because that's what makes business sense.

611
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,200
But the emotional reaction when you see that is, oh, man, these bastards at Microsoft are

612
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,480
trying to embrace and extinguish, and this is yet another way that they're doing it.

613
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:19,080
But I think that undersells the power of Linux, GPL, and open source.

614
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,300
I think you're underselling how responsible they are for making a massive C shift in which

615
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,720
the entire industry has to respond to, even IBM and Microsoft.

616
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
Right.

617
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,040
And I don't think that necessarily means we have to completely be on board with the Microsoft

618
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
part.

619
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
It's a Linux thing, right?

620
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,640
She'll be skeptical of their motives and try to understand where they're coming from and

621
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
what they're doing.

622
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,880
But they're not necessarily some evil Linux-hating monstrosity anymore.

623
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,160
Cautiously optimistic skepticism.

624
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,560
Yeah, there we go.

625
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Perfect way to put it.

626
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,240
Yeah, I think that's a great way to put it.

627
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,200
I'm also cautiously optimistic about this new 3D Wayland compositor, which I saw you

628
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,320
submitted to RLinux.

629
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,900
That's actually how I saw this story run.

630
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,720
So what caught your attention about this, other than it's yet another Wayland compositor,

631
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,440
this one is called Wayfire.

632
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,200
It's based on LibWestin.

633
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,060
They say they aim to create a customizable and extensible and extendable lightweight

634
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,940
environment without sacrificing appearance.

635
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,240
Those things appeal to me, but was there something else that caught your attention, Ron?

636
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,760
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that they had in...

637
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,240
The concept that they're working on is to move some stuff that are already in existing

638
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,200
compositors and window managers and making it possible to work in Wayfire so that can

639
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,460
be used in Wayland.

640
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:37,320
So the most obvious one, and even the jokie one, is the desktop cube.

641
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Yeah, totally.

642
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,680
Yeah, that was the number one comment, like, yes, finally, somebody understands I want

643
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,200
my desktop cube back.

644
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Yeah, exactly.

645
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,040
And it's actually kind of funny because the way they're doing the desktop cube is interesting

646
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:54,000
because the cube itself is modifiable in weird ways, like you can make it concave and convex

647
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and stuff.

648
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Finally.

649
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, of course.

650
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Who doesn't need that?

651
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,680
But there's other things that are actually somewhat more useful in the sense of the expo

652
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,960
mode that it's going to have built into it, and it already has some of this stuff already

653
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
working.

654
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
It's in pre-alpha.

655
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,940
I mean, we joke, but I guess the advantage here is then the desktop environment folks

656
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,640
don't have to invent how to do that, right?

657
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,380
So it's just done for them.

658
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,920
The one thing that made me really the most interested was probably the fact that they

659
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,760
were talking about having window rules work.

660
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,880
The compositor itself with window rules, that is amazing.

661
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Yeah, yeah.

662
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,560
What's the point of the perfect 60 frames a second compositing if we can't have desktop

663
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
cubes?

664
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,440
This isn't probably very applicable to like Mudder or KWindow, right?

665
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,520
I mean, this is for desktop environments that don't necessarily have a solution in place.

666
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,560
Yeah, if they don't have a compositor, this would be for that, like basically the window

667
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,920
managers that are dependent on X and stuff like that.

668
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,120
So this is a solution.

669
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,920
We see different things coming up.

670
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,560
I have a pretty strong inclination that we're going to hear more about Mir in the future,

671
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,720
about that as a middle layer between Wayland and the desktop environments, but this is

672
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,000
another option.

673
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,720
And it's up on GitHub.

674
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,360
Did you get a sense of how far along they are?

675
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,240
I mean, it looks like they have some basic stuff currently implemented, good stuff, even

676
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,760
like touchscreen gestures and stuff.

677
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,140
They're basically saying, this is prototyping stuff that we can show works but don't rely

678
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,140
on it.

679
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:28,440
But they're saying that it's a pre-alpha stage, so that they're not really claiming anyone

680
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,620
should use it.

681
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,260
But they are talking about that it already works with X Wayland.

682
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,360
So like any X Wayland clients, you could already use it.

683
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
That's nice.

684
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,360
Good.

685
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,360
As soon as a distro actually supports this, because I'm going to see if Arch or something

686
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,160
like that would be interested in it, as soon as someone supports it, I'm going to definitely

687
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
check it out.

688
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Yeah.

689
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,280
I like that they're trying to solve some hard technical challenges for some of these desktop

690
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
environments.

691
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Kind of push the conversation forward a bit.

692
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
Yep.

693
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
Wayfire.

694
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,400
Wayfire will have a link, linuxunplugged.com, slash 242.

695
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:09,900
One of the nice bennies about having the linuxunplugged.com site set up is we can make changes at jb.com

696
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,700
and if you just fall in there, it doesn't matter, you know?

697
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,440
If you just want the Linux Unplugged show, mm-hmm, yeah.

698
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:25,420
Maybe what we ought to do is build a whole new infrastructure up on DigitalOcean, do.co.unplugged.

699
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:32,400
Go there for a limited time and sign up and get $100 credit for a new account, $100 credit.

700
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,880
I don't know how long they're going to do this.

701
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,800
They told me it'd be a limited time.

702
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Maybe it's already over.

703
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,360
Maybe you should just go right now and find out, do.co.unplugged.

704
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,240
Find out because what an incredible value.

705
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Honestly, $10 would get you by for two months.

706
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,760
You could run a DigitalOcean Droplet two months for free with $10, with $10.

707
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,200
If you go to do.co.unplugged, you get a $100 credit.

708
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,480
I have a suspicion.

709
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,200
I believe it's because they're rolling out these new Droplet plans.

710
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,400
Now for years, they've been a sponsor here on the Unplugged program and you know that

711
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,060
they offer really great pricing on Droplets.

712
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:11,080
My favorite system is three cents an hour, three cents an hour.

713
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,080
That's great.

714
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,360
You can get the $5 a month Droplet, run it two months for free with our standard promo

715
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,520
but now when you go to do.co.unplugged and get the $100 credit, why not play with some

716
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
of the big boys?

717
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,680
They got high CPU Droplets, flexible Droplets where you can mix and match the resources.

718
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,040
They got high RAM Droplets.

719
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
Go to town.

720
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Load everything up in RAM.

721
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Go cray-cray.

722
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,320
Do what Wes does and run everything from a RAM disk.

723
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,320
You do that, right, Wes?

724
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
That's what you do?

725
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,320
Of course I do.

726
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,320
Why not?

727
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,480
Wes does two things and only two things, runs everything as root and runs everything out

728
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
of RAM.

729
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,840
That's why I don't lean and mean, baby.

730
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,460
Just go to do.co.unplugged to sign up and try out their new flexible Droplets.

731
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,120
Mix and match the resources you need.

732
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,580
Play around with snapshots.

733
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,240
You can use the team accounts and then if you ever get stuck, they have fantastic documentation

734
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,680
including a new tutorial that went live just a couple of hours ago about how to configure

735
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:06,160
16.04, Ubuntu 16.04 to reject a whole bunch of bogus SSH connections.

736
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,920
Something that like monitors for connections, I'm not talking failed ban, I'm talking about

737
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,920
something different.

738
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,640
It monitors for bogus login attempts and then starts banning those IPs automatically.

739
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,360
That's the kind of great documentation that DigitalOcean has on their website all the

740
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
time.

741
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:25,640
They have professional folks that keep that stuff lean, mean, and easy to read, do.co.unplugged.

742
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,280
Go there, sign up, and try out their new flexible Droplets, do.co.unplugged.

743
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,520
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program, do.co.unplugged.

744
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:45,460
So I will admit that living in a Class A RV has made me particularly interested in running

745
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:52,680
everything from batteries, but what if you had your own Tesla Powerwall?

746
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,120
You know about the Powerwall, right?

747
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,680
That was something that Tesla introduced for homeowners.

748
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,680
It's kind of funky because you have to be on an actual residential property.

749
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,120
You can't just go buy some land in Arizona and set up a Powerwall.

750
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,160
You have to be at a residence.

751
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,520
You have to have an internet connection to use a Powerwall.

752
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,560
And after you've spent $5,500, you then essentially have supplemental power in case the electricity

753
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
goes out.

754
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
It's kind of funky.

755
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,360
Just a big battery bank sort of plugged in to everything.

756
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,120
Wouldn't it be great if you could build that yourself from, say, old laptop batteries?

757
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,280
Turns out actually a thing.

758
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,400
In fact, laptop batteries are particularly good at this.

759
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,840
You could build your own wall, and there's a link that we'll put in the show notes that

760
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,240
you can go check out, including a bunch of different folks who essentially worked it

761
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,400
out and said it's about $5 per battery.

762
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,040
And one bloke out of Australia has this unbelievable setup with 40 solar panels in his roof.

763
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,300
He's pulling down 40 kilowatt hours, and then he has these racks of batteries.

764
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,920
So they look like double A's.

765
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,600
But if you were to break open your laptop, your lithium ion battery in your laptop, and

766
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,960
take the casing off of it, they're like individual double A-looking batteries in there.

767
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,840
And they've got this particular color that is set by the industry, so that's how you

768
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,100
know they're the kind of battery that you need.

769
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,200
And I don't know, like cyan, I don't know exactly.

770
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,800
How would you describe that color, Wes?

771
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,280
It's like a blue-ish, like a sky blue, I guess.

772
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Yeah, something like that.

773
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,400
And when you get ones that are sky blue, you essentially have the right battery.

774
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,240
And depending on how many you have, depending on how many laptops you want to murder, you

775
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,280
could set up a Powerwall yourself using a Raspberry Pi to manage all of this.

776
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
And here's an example.

777
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,720
So the Tesla Powerwall is capable of storing 14 kilowatt hours.

778
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,100
But this dude built one that could store 40 kilowatt hours out of Australia.

779
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,360
And there's a whole DIY Powerwall form.

780
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,640
And I thought, this is pretty good, this is interesting, this is useful.

781
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:01,720
But if you combine this with a project that Joe and I covered on Linux Action News by

782
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,960
Eric Raymond, then you'd really be cooking with gas.

783
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,240
Eric Raymond, ESR, recently launched the Upside project.

784
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:17,440
And they're currently defining the requirements for a smart UPS, because UPSs suck.

785
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,740
They're bad, they don't really, they don't intelligently monitor the battery, they don't

786
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,180
intelligently watch the charge, they're just the worst.

787
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,320
And so ESR was sort of waxing on about this.

788
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,120
And from that, created the Upside project, people have joined on, and they've created

789
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:40,800
a full requirements now of what you need to do smart charging, to control the monitoring,

790
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,960
to fail into a bypass mode instead of completely failing off and cutting the power, what the

791
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,840
minimum runtimes should be.

792
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,400
I'm proposing that, I'm doing matchmaking right here on the show, these two different

793
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:58,680
initiatives, the DIY Powerwall, and ESR's Upside project, they should at least start

794
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,440
maybe flirting, take each other out to dinner or something, because this could be a great

795
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,720
combination of efforts.

796
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,920
Something that you could build yourself from your old crappy laptops, and then something

797
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,800
to actually manage and monitor and keep everything working well.

798
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,160
It's an example of two kind of side things that are going on out there.

799
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,440
People are discussing, people are trying to figure out, because the technology has just

800
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,080
kind of gotten there and made all of this stuff accessible, but they're not really coming

801
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,120
together yet.

802
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,940
Maybe they never will, but I love the idea of these two things.

803
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:35,880
You take Upside, the smart UPS, you take the DIY Powerwall, you bring them together, Wes.

804
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
It's a kumbaya.

805
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,640
Yeah, if you're already managing power, just do it at the whole house scale.

806
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,680
And you could then do it without any of that cloud crap or anything else.

807
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,360
Yeah, I mean, if we're not going to have reactors in our backyards, maybe we could have Powerwalls.

808
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Solar panels.

809
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
You don't?

810
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,360
No, I don't.

811
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,360
Oh, no.

812
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,360
They didn't make it out to the West.

813
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
They didn't make it here.

814
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
They didn't make it out here.

815
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,360
We're uncivilized.

816
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,360
Maybe someday.

817
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
All right.

818
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,440
Well, if that's not your thing, then you're one of those people, and you probably like

819
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
Electron apps.

820
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,220
Yeah, I'm onto you.

821
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,460
You like Electron apps.

822
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,960
You got Slack installed.

823
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,800
Oh, Skype and Spotify too?

824
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,000
Well, there's no helping you.

825
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,760
Then we might as well pile on.

826
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,600
How about an Electron-based terminal?

827
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Yeah.

828
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
You're right.

829
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
That's the last thing.

830
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,180
Every other thing I run is basically running Chrome somehow, right?

831
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,180
But not the terminal.

832
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,180
Mm-hmm.

833
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,180
You're welcome.

834
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,180
You're welcome.

835
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
My life is complete.

836
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,180
You see what I do for you?

837
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,180
You see, I do this for you.

838
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,280
It's called Hyper.

839
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,880
And it's a modern terminal built on web technologies.

840
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,880
That's what they say.

841
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,040
It's built on web technologies.

842
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,060
And you know what, Wes?

843
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,960
It actually looks kind of good.

844
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,960
Check it out.

845
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,960
Go to hyper.is.

846
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Hyper.is.

847
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,360
Take a look at this thing, and tell me at least some part of you doesn't kind of want

848
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,080
to run this.

849
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,600
Maybe Joe, the XFC user of the house, maybe this doesn't appeal to him.

850
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600
I don't know.

851
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
All right.

852
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,120
I'm launching the app image right now.

853
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,560
Do you see how they have effects when you type?

854
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,960
You see how they have the blasting?

855
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,280
They have destructo effects when you type.

856
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
Look at that.

857
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
You see that?

858
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
Whoa.

859
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
Fancy.

860
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,280
Yeah.

861
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,240
They have confetti blowing up from the cursor when you type.

862
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,960
I mean, obviously you want that.

863
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,280
Obviously you need that.

864
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,040
So why not get a terminal that uses Electron?

865
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
Wait.

866
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,040
What's the matter, Wes?

867
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
So there we go.

868
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
That was easy.

869
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
Yeah, that was.

870
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
It actually looks really, really good.

871
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,040
It's pretty sharp.

872
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
Yeah.

873
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,200
That looks really nice, actually.

874
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
I might just give it a try for a while.

875
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Why not?

876
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,200
The default font could be a little better.

877
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Yeah, right.

878
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
I'm not going to lie.

879
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,600
Wouldn't it be weird if there was multiples of these?

880
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Is there?

881
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Is that a thing?

882
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Upterm.

883
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Oh, really?

884
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Oh, no.

885
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
OK.

886
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
What's the URL?

887
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
What's the URL?

888
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Oh, yeah.

889
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
It's a GitHub repo.

890
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,880
A terminal for the 21st century.

891
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,880
Pretty nice scrolling.

892
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,880
Yeah.

893
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
It does have nice scrolling.

894
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,880
I agree.

895
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,880
Oh.

896
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
You know what?

897
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
I kind of like this better, actually.

898
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
Listen.

899
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
It's an IDE plus terminal thing.

900
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,880
Yeah.

901
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,100
With legit syntax completion, which is kind of nice.

902
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
I can't.

903
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,100
OK.

904
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,100
I'll put a link to this in the show notes, too.

905
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
Wow.

906
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,440
So not one, but two Electron terminals.

907
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,440
That's actually a thing.

908
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
I mean.

909
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
And it's in the AUR.

910
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
Is it?

911
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
Is nothing sacred?

912
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,800
Is nothing sacred?

913
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
The terminal?

914
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,480
Like on Windows, I can understand it, because the default command prompt on Windows sucks

915
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,600
so bad that, you know, they really need something over there.

916
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,480
But oh, man, I can't even with that.

917
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
All right.

918
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Well, so we so I guess.

919
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,420
So there's one app pick for you.

920
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,680
Two for one.

921
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,680
Hey, you're welcome.

922
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,560
Before you move on, Chris, there's one big question about these Electron terminals.

923
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,560
OK.

924
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,360
Do they have an option to give a black background and green text?

925
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
Well, you feel like you're in the matrix.

926
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,360
Right.

927
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,360
You've got to.

928
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Yeah.

929
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
You've got to.

930
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,360
Yes.

931
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
Yeah.

932
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
Yeah, of course.

933
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
That's that's like you don't even ship unless you've got that.

934
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,360
You don't even ship.

935
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,360
OK.

936
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,360
So if you don't like it, you can just edit the CSS because it's a problem.

937
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
Oh, gosh.

938
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
This is just gone.

939
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,240
This has gone a horrible direction.

940
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,600
I can't believe we're talking about editing the CSS of our terminal window.

941
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,760
OK.

942
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,240
Maybe I can redeem myself.

943
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,360
This is a native application.

944
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,620
How about that?

945
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,200
It's called MP4 Tools.

946
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:18,000
And what I like about MP4 Tools is that it's a collection of two applications that allow

947
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,280
you to muck about with your MP4 files without reencoding them.

948
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Nice.

949
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,280
That's always good.

950
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
Yeah.

951
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
It saves time.

952
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
You don't lose quality.

953
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,920
So MP4 Tools consists of two different applications available for Linux.

954
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:40,640
MP4 Joiner is a free application that will join multiple MP4 files into one without recoding

955
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,120
and without any quality loss.

956
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,300
So no retouching the file at all.

957
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,920
And then, so that's MP4 Joiner.

958
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,720
And then, as you would expect, you've got MP4 Splitter, which is a free application

959
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:58,400
that allows you to split MP4 files into multiple MP4 files without having to re-encode them.

960
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,080
I am going to be using this for some of our live stuff because I'm recording here in OBS

961
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,080
on this Linux box.

962
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,200
And then I'm going to take this MP4 file, and I'll probably just do a little chop and

963
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,520
drop and then upload it up to YouTube and upload it to Scale Engine.

964
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,760
And I'll be using AvidMux and MP4 Tools to do that.

965
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
Nice.

966
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,760
Why not spread the love?

967
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,080
MP4Joiner.org if you want to check that out.

968
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,680
And yeah, AvidMux too.

969
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,680
So there you go.

970
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,320
We've got Electron Terminals for you this week.

971
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,920
We've got MP4 Tools.

972
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,440
You can use your fun new tools in your fun new terminal.

973
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,440
There it is.

974
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Oh, great.

975
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,920
I was just waiting for that.

976
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,120
Fucking A. Did you look at it wrong again?

977
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,560
So when we're recording Linux unplugged or whatever we're recording and GNOME crashes

978
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,480
like it literally just did while I'm talking about this as if I did this on purpose, I

979
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,040
can now use MP4 Joiner to rejoin these files together so I can upload this live version

980
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,040
that's been recorded locally.

981
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,960
I mean, how perfect is that?

982
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,820
Like I was literally about to explain why I got these MP4 Tools because GNOME 3 crashes

983
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,080
on us so often when it just crashed on us.

984
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,760
That's proof is in the pudding.

985
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,500
That is amazing.

986
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,500
That is amazing.

987
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,680
MP4 Joiner.org, enough said there.

988
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,680
Go get your Electron apps.

989
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,040
Go get your MP4s.

990
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,120
I don't have any more to say about that.

991
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,400
Linux Academy.

992
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,960
Boy, if you want to go figure out why GNOME 3 crashes on you all the time, Linux Academy.

993
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,480
You need to get started somewhere and this is probably the best place to start.

994
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
Yeah.

995
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,240
You need to learn how to read the log, learn where all that stuff's on the file system.

996
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,120
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

997
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,360
Go there, support the show and sign up for a free seven day trial.

998
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:39,160
It's an advanced training platform that teaches you everything you need to know about Linux.

999
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,440
I was just going to say, Wes, you and I get a question, like a super generic question

1000
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,120
that comes into TechSnap that we really kind of identify with and it's, how do I get started?

1001
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,440
Where do I get training?

1002
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,240
What do I need to do next to take my career somewhere in IT or to get started in IT or

1003
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,500
to go to the next level in IT?

1004
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,640
Before the show started today, you and I were having a conversation literally about like,

1005
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,800
do we need to do like a dedicated segment in TechSnap addressing that question because

1006
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,800
it comes up so frequently.

1007
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,800
Right.

1008
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,800
Yeah, exactly.

1009
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,800
And it's hard to know.

1010
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,760
There's so many options and there's outdated, tons of outdated information.

1011
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,120
It can be really confusing if you don't already know.

1012
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,120
Yeah.

1013
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,680
And I think the other problem that the industry as a whole suffers from is all of these online

1014
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,120
training platforms that want to teach you everything and Linux is just one of the things

1015
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,120
that they want to teach you.

1016
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,960
You know, they'll also teach you After Effects.

1017
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,520
They'll also teach you how to do something on Windows Active Directory if you want.

1018
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,120
They're happy to teach you like all these stuff, like Photoshop.

1019
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,040
They don't care, but you do.

1020
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,040
You care.

1021
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,420
You want somebody who is dedicated to the topic that you need to learn about.

1022
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,160
You want the expert in that field.

1023
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,560
You want a company that is hiring full-time instructors that are going out there and taking

1024
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,980
the certification test, learning the material, eating and breathing Linux, and then writing

1025
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,200
courseware about it.

1026
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,600
That's what you want because you want to kick ass when you go out to take the test, when

1027
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,280
you want to get the next job, when you want to go somewhere in your career, or when you

1028
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,320
want to challenge yourself, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,480
Instructor mentoring is available.

1033
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,040
If you get stuck, you need help.

1034
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,000
They have real human beings that can help you and answer questions.

1035
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,760
They have self-paced, in-depth video courses, and if you're busy, they've got course schedulers

1036
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,200
to help you pick a time frame and stick to it.

1037
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,720
And if you're ready for certifications, they've got stuff dedicated for that, too, linuxacademy.com

00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,760
slash unplugged.

1041
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,400
We've been thinking recently, you know, with all the talk about plasma, that we need to

1042
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,080
kind of expand our horizons a bit, try different distros, try different desktop environments.

1043
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,080
Break out of these blinders.

1044
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,880
I mean, I never considered XFC because nobody ever suggests it.

1045
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,880
Not at all.

1046
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,880
Never.

1047
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,440
The only thing I've been thinking about recently is Fluxbox and Debian, and that's where Slacks

1048
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
comes in.

1049
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,600
Slacks 9.4 was released this week, and they've got a couple of unique features that I think

1050
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,800
are worth talking about.

1051
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,480
First of all, distro that is built to be a live distro, first and foremost.

1052
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,080
You flash it to your USB media, and then you run from there.

1053
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,120
Sacks also is doing a couple of other neat things, including ways to manage Wi-Fi and

1054
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:25,560
a couple other nice things, but there's something in here I find more fascinating.

1055
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:30,040
They are listing applications as installed.

1056
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,120
For example, say Chromium.

1057
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:38,280
They'll say Chromium is installed, there'll even be a link in your menu bar for a launcher.

1058
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,560
But when you click it, in the background, Slacks is like mounting an image, a squash

1059
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:50,040
FS file system, setting up paths, getting maybe even the latest binary download, depending

1060
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,040
on what it is, and then launching Chromium.

1061
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,320
Like it wasn't already in the main instance.

1062
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,100
It's just fascinating how they're doing this.

1063
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:02,840
But maybe even more interesting is the fact that the whole damn thing is based on Fluxbox,

1064
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,160
and it's a unique and interesting implementation.

1065
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,280
They've picked a background that is 100% ACES.

1066
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,600
This might be the best Linux desktop background I've ever seen.

1067
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,240
It's got a wood picnic table in the foreground, and then some fake artificial grass in the

1068
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,640
background, and it makes for a perfect presentation.

1069
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,120
You feel like there's a shelf, and the way the lighting works is it draws your eyes down

1070
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,120
to the bar.

1071
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,880
There's a nice transparent menu at the bottom.

1072
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,360
Looks very early Windows 7, minimal Windows 7, with a launcher that comes up that's very

1073
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,680
Gnome 3, a grid of icons, and there you'll see the web browser.

1074
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,720
If I click that, in the background, it's actually mounting the squash FS file system and then

1075
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,800
launching Chromium.

1076
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,460
This is a simple, clean, very Windows-esque inspired.

1077
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:02,920
It's like a hybrid of Windows 7 and Windows 10, theming and effects-wise, and you get

1078
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:08,100
minimum stuff, in a way that's very intentional on the Slack's team.

1079
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:15,120
They figure, for a lot of modern computers, you don't really need more than a web browser,

1080
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:21,840
a terminal, and a Debian base, so they figure, flash that on a USB drive, boot it up, despite

1081
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:27,880
its small size, Slack's will provide you a nice graphical user interface, and by default,

1082
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,440
the two programs, your browser and your terminal.

1083
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:35,500
You got Debian under the hood, you get the entire ecosystem of Debian, tens of thousands

1084
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,500
of pre-built packages.

1085
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,620
Yeah, apt just works like normal.

1086
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:44,940
They have a 32-bit, a 64-bit, and then a really fun version that you gave a shot, couldn't

1087
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,120
get it working, probably just have to spend a little more time monkeying with it, the

1088
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,120
Slack's IPXE version.

1089
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,120
Yeah, super handy.

1090
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,320
You can just, you know, boot that in over the network and boot it into Slack's.

1091
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,720
And what's nice is it loads it all into RAM.

1092
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,040
So the whole, I was joking about RAM disk, but the whole damn thing is running out of

1093
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,240
a RAM disk booted off of your network.

1094
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,180
It seems like a super nice, especially, yeah, if you're just doing everything in Chrome

1095
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,840
and a terminal and other machines, this is just a dumb workstation.

1096
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,120
Well, and let me pause you with this.

1097
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,400
Let's say you had your typical desktop OS.

1098
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,800
Maybe it's Windows 10.

1099
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,680
Maybe it's Plasma Neon, KDE Neon.

1100
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,960
But every now and then, you want a special environment for doing something, something

1101
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,000
private or something unique, or you just want, I can sit down at any computer on my network

1102
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,600
and I can boot into this environment.

1103
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,480
You could do that with the IPXE version.

1104
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,480
You see what I'm saying?

1105
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,480
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1106
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,200
Because if you've got one of those BIOSes that supports choose boot device, like, you

1107
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,440
know, mine is like F12, I hit F12 and then I get to choose my boot device.

1108
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,320
And one of my options is a Pixie boot server.

1109
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,320
Totally.

1110
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,280
I could choose that and it would boot off of that, but otherwise it would boot off my

1111
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,440
local disk and you could just have that available on your network.

1112
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,440
So that's another nice thing.

1113
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,560
Yeah, just diagnosing things, fixing stuff, reformatting disks.

1114
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,040
Yeah, and it's interesting too to check back in with Slack because we've talked about them

1115
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,280
in the past, but last time we talked about them, those guys were basing that thing on

1116
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,280
Slackware.

1117
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,120
Yeah, totally different.

1118
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,120
Totally different approach.

1119
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:14,640
They were going for like a Slackware user-friendly desktop distro.

1120
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:23,800
They've pivoted and now they are a live-only, modern, portable, Floxbox-based Debian distro

1121
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,240
that's actually kind of nice.

1122
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,240
It is kind of nice.

1123
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,560
I can't really put my finger on it, but playing with it today and yesterday, it's just been

1124
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,880
an entirely pleasant activity.

1125
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,880
Clean, fast.

1126
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,280
I don't know if I'll be putting it on my systems permanently, but I'll think of it if I have

1127
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,760
a need for this niche.

1128
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,760
Yeah, so the Slack team's got some good stuff here.

1129
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,920
I was coming in kind of being like, you know, I've used Slack before, nothing really new

1130
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,920
to see here.

1131
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,480
It's just another point release.

1132
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,480
No.

1133
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,400
No, they've really done some good stuff here.

1134
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,000
And they've got more stuff in the pipeline too.

1135
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,360
They have, I guess, one big disclosure we should make is they want legacy boot when

1136
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,360
you're using this distro.

1137
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,360
Yeah.

1138
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,360
Yeah, very much syslinux boot.

1139
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,120
I will also say over on their site, they've got a great internals page that describes

1140
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,960
a whole bunch about how it's set up.

1141
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,960
Oh.

1142
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,960
That's not something you see a lot.

1143
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,160
You know, maybe buried in a Wiki somewhere, but it is a unique distro in how it's configured

1144
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,640
and they're very open and transparent about it.

1145
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,300
So to that end, that's where I was going.

1146
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:27,840
So they have a slacks.org, that's S-L-A-X.org for English, E-N, slash next.php.

1147
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,920
And if you go to their next.php page, they have, oh, here's what we just released and

1148
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,920
they did this site, the slacks 940 came out yesterday, 940.

1149
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:42,680
And then they already have slacks next, which where they talk about we're going to get EFI

1150
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,440
support working, we're going to get virtual box support working, we're going to change

1151
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,040
some settings in the terminal and we have other things that are coming to the next version

1152
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,040
of slacks.

1153
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,640
So even though slacks 940 came out yesterday as we record this here show, they've already

1154
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,120
up on the website, got what they're working on.

1155
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,600
And our number one complaint, EFI support, is already on their radar.

1156
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,600
See that's awesome.

1157
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,600
It is.

1158
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,200
It is because it made it a little challenging to boot on some of my newer laptops, so it's

1159
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,840
really good to see them put that in there.

1160
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:15,120
You know, if they had snaps, snap packages baked right in, now that would also be very

1161
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,120
handy.

1162
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,560
That's good, particularly for a use case like this where you're booting it up fresh

1163
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,800
and you need to hit the ground and you just need to get running.

1164
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,440
I was really impressed though, came back to slacks kind of expecting this haphazard reboot,

1165
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:35,640
this sort of duct tape and string to get everything working on Debian and instead came away with

1166
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,280
one of the more unique desktop Linux experiences I've had in 2018.

1167
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,360
Yeah, and it's easy to like, the 64-bit version is 260 megs, so like I can also see myself

1168
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,360
just leaving this laying around somewhere in case I need it.

1169
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,360
Totally.

1170
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,120
Minimac, you bring up a good point of somewhere you'd like to see them go in the future.

1171
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:59,920
Yeah, I would love to see for low specs Chromebooks and on CPUs, I would love to see ARM support.

1172
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,920
That would be cool.

1173
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,520
That would be, ARM support would be great.

1174
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,320
Something like this on the Raspberry Pi with Fluxbox.

1175
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,320
Oh yeah.

1176
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:13,600
I don't know why I expected Fluxbox to be animation-free, sort of like no frills, but

1177
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:19,800
even in a software composite environment, the menus fade in and out nicely, the applications

1178
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,240
launch, the menu comes up nicely, like everything's polished.

1179
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:28,340
Fluxbox, I think, doesn't get enough appreciation because that's got to be one of the damn best

1180
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:32,040
looking implementations I've seen in a long time, which just tells me that if you just

1181
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,840
spend enough time with it, you can get it right.

1182
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,080
Yeah, a handsome desktop.

1183
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,340
It is indeed.

1184
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,240
And it's good to see it getting some coverage.

1185
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,700
For Onyx wrote about it as well.

1186
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:45,800
It's based on Debian stable, so if you're more of a Debian testing user, might not necessarily

1187
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,320
float your boat, but I sure liked it.

1188
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:53,780
And you know, if you're considering going to XFCE, why not give it a go?

1189
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:54,780
Check it out.

1190
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,780
slacks.org.

1191
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:01,040
We'll have a link in the show notes at linuxunplugged.com slash 242.

1192
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,340
And if you give it a go or something kind of like this, like did we just miss the mark

1193
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,340
a bit?

1194
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:09,440
Is there something like you're like, guys, guys, you've just got to try this out.

1195
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,640
Let us know, go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact, oh, that's right, at linuxunplugged.com

1196
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,640
slash contact.

1197
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:22,480
We got a new contact form, and the way I've set it up now is it in big all caps with like

1198
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,960
brackets and special stuff that I've set up for filtering says somebody responded to Linux

1199
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,920
Unplugged has sent you an email, Chris.

1200
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,620
Don't miss this one, you dumb arse.

1201
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,620
So nice.

1202
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,620
Yeah, yeah.

1203
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,620
You're taking it seriously.

1204
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,920
Taking it very seriously.

1205
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,120
So linuxunplugged.com slash contact, as seriously as I take email, because I have effing hate

1206
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,120
email.

1207
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,120
Amen.

1208
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,360
As seriously as I take any frickin email.

1209
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,640
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

1210
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,640
There you have it.

1211
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,960
I think, I guess with that, maybe we'll just leave it at if you want to check out Slack,

1212
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,360
slacks9.4 is the one you want if you want it based on Debut with all the goodies we

1213
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,600
just talked about.

1214
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:05,900
mp4tools is the mp4 joiner we talked about, and hyper is the terminal that we talked about.

1215
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,560
Just a whole bunch of, I just realized a whole bunch of names and picks that we just did,

1216
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,040
kind of all smushed together.

1217
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,560
Mr. Payne, is there anything else we should leave people with before we get out of here?

1218
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,800
I think we covered it today.

1219
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,800
I know, I feel good.

1220
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,280
We got it all in there.

1221
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,220
All right, well go get more Joe and me over at linuxactionnews.com.

1222
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,460
You can also go get more of just Joe and his friends at lateknightlinux.com.

1223
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,480
More Wes Payne over at techsnap.systems.

1224
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,680
You can go get more of producer Michael on his YouTube channel at Tux Digital, and with

1225
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:39,080
all of that, I think we'll wrap it up.

1226
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:44,640
Of course, if you're watching live over at the JBLive site, the Ask Noah program is coming

1227
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,640
up.

1228
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,060
You're always welcome to join us on a Tuesday.

1229
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:52,600
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get our live times, because it is a whole

1230
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,980
Linux celebration.

1231
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,460
It's Linux Tuesdays over on the jblive.tv live stream.

1232
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:01,600
We start with the unplugged program pre-show, and then we keep on going to Ask Noah, and

1233
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,640
we'd love to have you there.

1234
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,640
You can follow me.

1235
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,040
I'm Chris Elias, the network's at Jupyter Signal.

1236
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,000
He's at Wes Payne, linuxunplugged.com, and we'd love to have your feedback at linuxunplugged.com

1237
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,140
slash contact, and linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

1238
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,140
Thank you for joining us.

1239
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,640
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1240
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:45,440
See ya.

1241
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,880
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show that's too busy getting actual work

1242
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,880
done to care about what your silly display server.

1243
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,880
My name is Alan.

1244
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,880
BSD, guys.

1245
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,880
Those bastards.

1246
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,880
All right.

1247
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:02,160
So, what do you think we should call this one, guys, because JBot took the day off,

1248
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,360
so what do you think?

1249
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,520
We got to come up with something good.

1250
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,520
Oh, I see Mr. Colonel Linux there in the chat room.

1251
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,680
Hello, Colonel Linux.

1252
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:14,440
I was really kind of debating back and forth with Noah while I was at scale.

1253
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,320
What am I going to reload onto Hadia's systems in her acupuncture clinic, because I think

1254
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:28,920
she's on 1610 or 1604, I'm not sure, but one is Mate and one is Unity, and it turns out

1255
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:35,080
there's different little issues on each that they would just like resolve, and they would

1256
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,840
like it to be the same interface, so that way when the staff use the different computers,

1257
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,840
it's all the same.

1258
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:44,040
So, I was like, well, okay, so what distro and what desktop environment do I pick, because

1259
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:48,320
they were on Unity, but I think I'm going to do Plasma as long as it's the one I'm using

1260
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,320
is what my thought.

1261
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,320
What were you going to say?

1262
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,320
Shouldn't you beta test it first?

1263
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,320
Yeah.

1264
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,320
Oh, yeah.

1265
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,120
If you do Plasma, I would suggest checking out Kubuntu 1804.

1266
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,120
This is what I was thinking.

1267
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,840
There's a lot of polish.

1268
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,840
Yeah.

1269
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:05,640
Well, actually, not just that, right, but it's going to be Plasma LTS and Ubuntu LTS,

1270
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,120
right?

1271
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,120
And Qt LTS.

1272
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,120
Oh, but-

1273
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,400
Chris, I've got one word for you, right, to solve your problem.

1274
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Mutiny.

1275
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,400
I know.

1276
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,400
Yeah.

1277
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,400
I know.

1278
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,400
It crossed my mind.

1279
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,400
It really did.

1280
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,760
Hadia has been complaining to me, and it's not that I don't listen.

1281
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,040
It's just that I just sort of all kind of collect into a bag of, oh, I got to fix their

1282
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,040
computer problems.

1283
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,880
Does she know how to update the packages every month?

1284
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:35,000
Well, she gets the graphical prompt, and I have her do that.

1285
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,400
And so, for the most part, all that's been fine, with the exception of she's on those

1286
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,760
versions of Ubuntu where they fill up the boot, the slash boot, so about twice a year,

1287
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,120
her slash boot fills up on her computers, and then I have to walk her through the auto

1288
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,120
remove and-

1289
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,120
Yeah.

1290
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,120
Yeah.

1291
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,120
And she just hates that.

1292
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,800
So that's another reason to upgrade her, because that's something they finally fixed in Ubuntu.

1293
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,800
You know, with 18.04-

1294
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,800
That makes sense.

1295
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,800
Yeah.

1296
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,600
And with 18.04, with all that, with Kubuntu 18.04, all that stuff lining up LTS, seems

1297
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,320
like a pretty safe bet, but we'll see.

1298
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,320
The jury is still out.

1299
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,600
I will do some testing.

1300
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,600
I'm going to have her-

1301
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:15,280
Also, I'm contributing to Kubuntu 18.04, so that, by itself, should be an example.

1302
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,280
Well, there-

1303
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,280
Shh.

1304
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,280
Shh.

1305
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,280
God.

1306
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,280
Anything in particular?

1307
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,280
Anything?

1308
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,280
Just in moral support?

1309
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,060
The whole new design, I'm changing a bunch of defaults that I don't like, that they're

1310
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,240
willing to listen to me about.

1311
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,240
No kidding.

1312
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,240
That's great.

1313
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,320
The single click to double click, that's changing.

1314
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,320
Yes.

1315
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,320
Yes.

1316
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,320
I get to remove all the animations.

1317
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,320
Oh, ouch.

1318
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,320
Ouch.

1319
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,320
But then what would my GPU be doing?

1320
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:55,240
Technically, you could, you could, but then it wouldn't be as good.
