00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 38 for April 29th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's still a little hungover and still pretty dang happy from the most excellent Linux Fest Northwest. My name is Chris.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Matt.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hey there, Matt. How you feeling?

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Feeling pretty good.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Good, good. Well, I'm looking forward to today's show because we have some follow-up interviews that didn't make it into this Sunday's Linux action show from the floor of Linux Fest Northwest. If you watched our live stream, and a lot of you did, and we had a great show, but that was always at our booth.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We showed some clips from the floor, but there was still even more. Even the ones we streamed live on Saturday and ones that we showed on Sunday, guess what? We still have more interviews to show today, so we've got some great ones we're going to play, and I'm looking forward to that.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So we've got kind of a special show today because we've also got folks that have joined us in our virtual lug, the Mumble Room, who are also at Linux Fest Northwest. So it's going to be a little bit of a follow-up from this Sunday's show, but don't worry.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Even if you weren't there, that's actually even better for you because it's going to be stuff that you didn't get even a chance to ask these folks or talk to these folks.

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We've got guys from SUSE, we've got folks from Firefox OS, and others. So we're going to get to that, but first, Matt, before we get into our clips, I want to thank our first sponsor this week, and that is the great folks over at Ting.com.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Ting is mobile that makes sense, my mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider. Matt, of course you're a Fios customer, but last Thursday, I don't know if you heard about this, Comcast got their fiber connection completely cut, and we were out of internet connectivity for the entire day.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It started at 1 a.m. in the morning, and it lasted until about 4 o'clock in the evening. It was huge. Yeah, and Ting saved the day in a really big way because Ting is no contracts, and you only pay for what you use.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So I knew that I had the ability to just turn on Hotspot because it's included with my Ting service, and I was just going to pay for the usage for that day.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It was just absolutely critical because Alan had just flown in from Canada. That's another country, and he was here in studio to do TechSnap, and we didn't have any internet connectivity.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I mean, that was like worst case scenario because when does that ever happen? And Ting totally saved the day. I don't want to waste my Nexus, right? I grabbed Rekai's HTC One, put that down on the table, turned on the Wi-Fi hotspot mode, and boom, Alan and I were able to prep the show.

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We even started the first half of TechSnap live using the HTC One tethering. It was pretty crazy, and thankfully after the new segment, the regular internet connectivity came back up.

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But you know, I was getting like 15 megabits on my LTE connection. So here's what I want everybody to do. Go over to linux.ting.com. Yes, linux.ting.com, and check out what you would save by plugging into that savings calculator.

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I think you'll be pretty impressed. Go down also and watch the demo of their cool dashboard. It's really intuitive, and it makes it really straightforward to manage your account.

19
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And that's one of the things that now that I've been a Ting customer for over a year, I really, genuinely appreciate how great that interface is. And I feel like I've never, like Matt, when I got you to sign up with Ting, I was like, Matt, you got to try this out.

20
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Like even before they were really coming on as a sponsor, I was like, Matt, you got to look at this. And then also now with Rekai, I've given him a phone, and neither one of you did I ever have to say this is how you use the dashboard, this is where you log in, this is what this does.

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It just makes sense, like all of the Ting lineup does. And you know what's really great? It was stupid simple. Yeah, you could walk right into it and you were good to go.

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What's really great now is that now that we have multiple lines on that dashboard, it's really simple to just say, okay, this is the cost of X, this is the cost of Y, we can keep everything separate, we can set up alerts if we need to.

23
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The more devices you add, it still stays simple and intuitive, and that's what I love about it.

24
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But I've got great news. If you already have an HTC One that's compatible with the Ting network, and they have a BYOD page where you can check out what devices are, you can now bring it over to the Ting network.

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You can now bring the HTC One over to the Ting network, and that's pretty exciting because that is a really good phone. I really love the HTC One.

26
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Go over to linux.ting.com, that'll take $25 off your first month of service if you're going to bring, say, the HTC One or any compatible phone. If you don't already have a phone, then going to linux.ting.com will take $25 off your service.

27
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If you're like me, we'll pay for your first month of service. linux.ting.com. And a really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

28
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Love those guys. And the Ting devices were showing up representing at Linux Fest Northwest, and we were using Viber to stay in communication.

29
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I know Viber isn't perfect with security, but at Linux Fest Northwest, it was so great to have group chats with picture and voice capabilities, like quick, almost like radio.

30
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Roger that, I'm moving down to the lobby over, and it would just send it to everybody. But then also to be able to work on my laptop and also keep in the Viber discussion, that was really cool.

31
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And having those on the Ting devices was awesome. Okay, Matt, go ahead.

32
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was going to say that I was actually pleasantly surprised with Viber's capabilities because I found it to be not only easy to use, but I find myself probably going to stick with it now. I'm actually kind of addicted.

33
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, it seems kind of stupid simple. I think they could series up the UI a little bit if they wanted more people to take them a little more seriously.

34
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
True.

35
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But once you start using it, it's pretty useful. And I've read reports that there's ways you can get access to the pictures stored in clear text on their servers if you were super motivated.

36
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's not obvious, but there is a way to get to them. So it's not perfect with security. And the same with the voice memos. So it's got some issues.

37
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But for what we were using it for, like, I'm going down to the booth. That's fine.

38
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, exactly.

39
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, in fact, I remember, too. We were pulling up Sunday morning for the Linux action show after everybody had eaten at our hotel and we were driving towards the fest.

40
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And they're like, Chris, Mad Dog is waiting for you. And I'm like, yeah, well, we're not even set up yet. So we're not ready for an interview.

41
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They're like, no, you don't understand. Mad Dog's here. Guys, I know. But we were able to have this back and forth. So they were able to relay to him what was up.

42
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So it was super useful. All right. Well, while we're talking about Linux Fest Northwest, maybe we should play a couple of clips.

43
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know where to start exactly because these are all just really great.

44
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But one that I think just kind of stood out for me as kind of a funny moment and I'm sure the Mumble Room will agree with me later on in the show.

45
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Microsoft made a big splash, right? I think we kind of mentioned that last like they were the talk, weren't they?

46
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They were huge. I mean, not only were they just actually all around great guys to be around, but they were giving out food, which is always a win with the Linux crowd.

47
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Like cotton candy, cupcakes, donuts and then like full on shirts in tubes and in crazy shapes.

48
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So they really brought the swag. So that's why this chat we had with someone.

49
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't want to use his name. If he uses his name in the clip, that's fine. But I'm not going to say it if he doesn't.

50
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But we talked with an employee from Microsoft who came up not as part of the Microsoft crew.

51
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
In fact, I think he just kind of came up on the sly because he's a Linux user at Microsoft and he wanted to see what's up.

52
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So I talked to him a little bit and I just found the whole chat delightful.

53
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Say again in the microphone what your name is. My name is Jason Wagner.

54
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Jason. Oh, hello, Jason. Very nice to meet you. Tell the folks what you do. I work for Microsoft.

55
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I believe there is a pretty big presence of Microsoft here this year. Is there? Yeah.

56
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I've been hearing a lot about the Microsoft booth. Everybody stopped by to talk about the Microsoft booth. I'm not with them.

57
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm just by myself. Oh, okay. Very cool.

58
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So why do you think it is? I mean, you don't have to share. It's just in your opinion.

59
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Why do you think it is that Microsoft does have such a splash here this year?

60
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Does half the sponsor? Is making such a big splash?

61
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Very popular. I mean, you've got some great food. Cotton candy. That's pulling out all the stops. I like that.

62
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't know. Maybe we have conventions in the area and we just have to make a presence.

63
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Wow. I loved that answer. I couldn't believe what he said. I mean, I don't know, man.

64
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Basically, we have a budget and this one is local so it's easy for us.

65
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So what we kind of do is just figure, look, they have this much money so we just send them up.

66
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And it was just funny because if that's true, they don't project that. They seem genuinely interested to be there.

67
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I definitely felt like there was more of a genuine connection there for sure.

68
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah. All right. It continues on. So now he's going to talk a little bit how he –

69
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I eventually find out that he's a Linux user at Microsoft, but it takes me a little bit to get there.

70
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I thought you were going to tell me something more fancy than that, to be honest with you.

71
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's probably pretty simple.

72
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What do you do for Microsoft?

73
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What's that?

74
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What do you do for Microsoft?

75
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I do IT.

76
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, okay. Do you have much Linux at Microsoft that you end up working with?

77
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't work with it.

78
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But you're just kind of curious what goes on up here?

79
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah.

80
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So what do you think?

81
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm loving it. I'm running it at home now.

82
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh, yeah?

83
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah. My primary desktop is –

84
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What distro do you use?

85
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
At home or on my workstation I use Arch with GNOME 3.12.

86
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Look at you. Right on.

87
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And on my laptop I've got the new Ubuntu GNOME.

88
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What do you think?

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I love GNOME.

90
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah?

91
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah.

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Wow. So are you –

93
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I was the guy on your Google Plus who was posting the,

94
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
hey, this is kind of the best way – the best workflows for GNOME.

95
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah.

96
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah. That was actually kind of helpful because I've been using –

97
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I have a lot of different desktops.

98
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll use Unity right now.

99
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But, yeah, I agree.

100
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
GNOME has really gotten really great.

101
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

102
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So are you able to use that at work?

103
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Am I what?

104
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Are you able to use that at work?

105
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I use it – I work from home.

106
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, okay.

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So I can use GNOME as my primary environment and then I'll –

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have a VM that I run in GNOME boxes.

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So that's Windows 7.

110
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah.

111
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And I do everything for Microsoft there.

112
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's really interesting.

113
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
GNOME boxes.

114
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah.

115
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, I use GNOME boxes too.

116
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We even use the smart card readers and I'm able to pass that through USB.

117
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, nice.

118
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So is this the first Linux fest for you?

119
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is my first Linux fest.

120
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Very cool.

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Have you gotten any sessions?

122
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Have I gotten any what?

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Sessions? Any sessions?

124
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, yeah.

125
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And what do you think?

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's pretty good.

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Anything stand out?

128
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I went to a Python intro to Python.

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That was really great.

130
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So I'll be picking up some of that.

131
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah.

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Good.

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I just went to Brian's SUSE talk.

134
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Did you enjoy it?

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, I did.

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Good.

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What do you think of SUSE?

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm not sure yet.

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm going to have to try it.

140
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah.

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But I picked up a SUSE and Fedora CDs and we'll see how that goes.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You're going to give them a try, huh?

143
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, I think so.

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Good.

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Arch is – it really scratches an itch for me.

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah.

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,280
I love the AUR, but there's just a bit too much breakage that I can tolerate on my primary

148
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
machine.

149
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
Sure, sure.

150
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,840
The other day I couldn't update my system because some font thing got changed, whatever

151
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
that was.

152
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Yeah.

153
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
I'm using the Infinality packages.

154
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Yeah, yeah.

155
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Love them.

156
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Beautiful fonts, though.

157
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Beautiful.

158
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Yeah.

159
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Absolutely beautiful.

160
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,000
But I couldn't update for a day, so I figured out what the break was.

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,240
Were you able to fix it?

162
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
I was able to.

163
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,840
I had to find some forum post about it.

164
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Yeah.

165
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
I'm not – I'm not sharp enough to do it myself yet, but –

166
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Yeah.

167
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Yeah.

168
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
You know, I've had a few bumps like that, too.

169
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,440
It feels like it's only been a few times every couple of months maybe, but it's enough

170
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,760
that I could see how somebody could be kind of sensitive to it because if you're busy,

171
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,640
it gets kind of a – and then you don't want to fall too far behind.

172
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
Exactly.

173
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Yeah, especially in Arch.

174
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,880
So I try to do it every two or three days and then if something breaks and I've got

175
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,200
a day or two to kind of get on it and then I'm never really like a week behind or anything.

176
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Yeah.

177
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Well, very good.

178
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,360
So I stopped by – after he got up, you know what I said is – I said, yeah, it doesn't

179
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,120
break that often for me anymore, but I think if it ever broke to the point where it took

180
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,400
me more than 30 minutes to fix it, I'd probably wipe it.

181
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Oh, really?

182
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Yeah.

183
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I think that's how I feel about it.

184
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,160
Like right now, I've never had anything break that's taken more than – you know,

185
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,540
you figure five minutes to do the quick search, five minutes to read it, and then about five

186
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
minutes to fix it.

187
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,280
And if it – if it – you know, that's not too bad considering, you know, what I

188
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
get for the – in return.

189
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Sure.

190
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,360
Anyways, I just thought that was an interesting conversation with a Microsoft employee who's

191
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
running Gnome 3.

192
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,320
Now, he's doing it remotely though, but I like that one.

193
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
So we also –

194
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
But that's still clever.

195
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
That's still clever.

196
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Yeah.

197
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,160
And it's just – I wonder – I wonder how many other Closet Linux users there could

198
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,680
be hanging out at Microsoft.

199
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,800
So we had a chat with Peter from SUSE and Noah asked him a few great questions and I

200
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
wanted to roll that.

201
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,960
We're here with Peter Linell from the OpenSUSE and SUSE project.

202
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,160
How are you doing today, Peter?

203
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm doing fine.

204
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,400
I want to note you pronounce it SUSE like John Philip SUSE.

205
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,920
It's always a confusion for people.

206
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
SUSE.

207
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,840
Well, tell me a little bit about SUSE and OpenSUSE and what the differences are between

208
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
the two.

209
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,260
Well, for starters, SUSE, the company, is actually the oldest enterprise Linux company

210
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,000
started some 22 years ago in 1992 in Germany.

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,420
And in the SUSE timeframe when – after SUSE had gotten bought by Novell, the decision

212
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,020
was to open source all of the SUSE enterprise.

213
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,520
And from that, now OpenSUSE, the community project, is basically upstream for the SUSE

214
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,720
enterprise Linux product, which will have a new version coming out in the fall.

215
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Okay.

216
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,240
Now you work with both OpenSUSE and regular SUSE.

217
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
Is that correct?

218
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
That's correct.

219
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,040
I'm an OpenSUSE community member, which many SUSE employees are.

220
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,500
As well, I'm an Open – I'm an employee of SUSE, the enterprise Linux company.

221
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,560
I cover the West Coast as a sales engineer.

222
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Okay.

223
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,960
So even though one is more of a business model, one's more of an open model, they're both

224
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,200
technically open source software, correct?

225
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Correct.

226
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,320
99% of what SUSE enterprise Linux is actually GPL compatible software.

227
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
It's open source.

228
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,720
You can download the sources.

229
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,600
When you're a SUSE customer, you get all the source DVDs and source RPMs.

230
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,120
What exciting things are the OpenSUSE project working on?

231
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,320
Are the SUSE project working on?

232
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,720
What exciting things can we look to see that might be coming up?

233
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,920
Well, one thing we're doing is – and tomorrow I'm going to give a talk on it.

234
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,840
It's called the Open Build Server.

235
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,640
And we're almost a victim of our own success in that OpenSUSE of the community distribution

236
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,840
has grown dramatically in terms of the packages.

237
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:36,920
We went from 5,000 to near 9,000 packages now.

238
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,280
And the challenge is the release management.

239
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:46,400
So we're refining the tools behind the scenes to have a better release management plan for

240
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,280
the next version of OpenSUSE.

241
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,400
Other than that, we are continuing to push the envelope in kernel and things like that.

242
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,080
And the other great part is the SUSE engineers who work on the enterprise kernel are constantly

243
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,320
contributing back into OpenSUSE, their fixes, enhancements, and things like that.

244
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Perfect.

245
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Well, thank you very much.

246
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
I appreciate your time.

247
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Thank you.

248
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Thank you for talking with you.

249
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,120
Yeah, the SUSE booth was really one of the great ones.

250
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,520
They always have a great approach to it.

251
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
So that's one of the fun ones.

252
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,880
And they had it in a great spot this year, too.

253
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,240
So we had a chance to chat with Adam, who showed up with something kind of cool.

254
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,680
I gave it a mention last this week.

255
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
It's called Crouton.

256
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,280
And I'm particularly interested in it because I have this C720 that's a pretty good machine,

257
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,060
but I've had some flakiness under Linux, and I almost wonder if maybe I should try

258
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,320
to give Chrome OS more fare of a shake because there's some things I do like about it.

259
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,560
And I feel like to really have a well-rounded opinion, I should probably give it more than

260
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,740
a few hours like I did before.

261
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,400
So I was thinking, I would kind of like to go back to Chrome OS on the C720 for a little

262
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,280
while, but I'm just not quite ready to give up full desktop functionality.

263
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,880
I like the option of sometimes actually getting something considerable done on a laptop that

264
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
size.

265
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,680
And so Adam happened to show up at just the right time to talk to me about Crouton, and

266
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,360
now it's really got me thinking about juicing up my Chromebook.

267
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,120
Welcome to Linux Fest Northwest.

268
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Thank you very much.

269
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
2014.

270
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,400
I give Jupyter Broadcasting full credit in getting me out here from Flagstaff, Arizona.

271
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Oh, wow.

272
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Wow.

273
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,960
So you brought your Chromebook with you.

274
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Yes, I did.

275
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,040
But it seems to be a little schizophrenic.

276
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Very fine.

277
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,800
Because just a few seconds ago, I thought that thing was running Linux.

278
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,400
What's going on?

279
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,000
So it is running Linux at the same time as it's running Chrome OS.

280
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Sounds awesome.

281
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Let's see here.

282
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah.

283
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
All right.

284
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So...

285
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And how are you doing this?

286
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,120
Because I know there's dual boot, but this isn't dual boot, right?

287
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
This is a Chromebook.

288
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Yeah.

289
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
No, dual boot.

290
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
You're not using dual boot.

291
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
Oh, no.

292
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:55,600
There is a crewbuntu project where you can install in place of Chrome OS almost any distribution

293
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
of Linux you want.

294
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Yeah.

295
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
This is a different project.

296
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,160
It's up on GitHub.

297
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,040
I could pull up the link in just a second.

298
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,920
It's called crouton, C-R-O-U-T-O-N, if you...

299
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Like the kind I eat?

300
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Yeah.

301
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,600
Do a GitHub search for crouton.

302
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,440
And it's basically a shell script that you download that handles finding whichever desired

303
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,020
distribution you'd like to run in a CH root.

304
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,080
So it does all this with CH root.

305
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,960
So it's actually running under Chrome OS?

306
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Exactly.

307
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Ah.

308
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
That's the trick.

309
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
I gotcha.

310
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,080
And at the same time, you can keep one application running while you switch back and forth.

311
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,760
I can have YouTube playing on Chrome OS while I hop over into Linux to do some mono develop

312
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
or maybe my team speak or, you know, those...

313
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Cool.

314
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,040
Those few applications that I haven't been able to completely...

315
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Get away from.

316
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Get away from.

317
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Yeah.

318
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,280
And, you know, also, I love Linux.

319
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,380
I want to use Linux.

320
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,520
So it's nice to have it right there in my pocket whenever I need it.

321
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Yeah.

322
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Yeah.

323
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,080
So what kind of overhead, I mean, Chromebooks are kind of historically tight on resources.

324
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,160
So does this kill the resources on a Chromebook?

325
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,560
I found that my major complaint about this Chromebook itself is that as far as I know,

326
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,240
the RAM's not expandable.

327
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Four gigs?

328
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
I'm stuck at two.

329
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Two.

330
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Yeah.

331
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
And that's probably a bad choice on their part.

332
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Yeah.

333
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,560
They put the touch screen in it and, you know, the Haswell, so this has got great battery

334
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
life.

335
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Yeah.

336
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,600
But if you had four, that'd be great, right, or even more?

337
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
It would be.

338
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Yeah.

339
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,720
What I've noticed, and I can even show it on the system monitor, is that basically once

340
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,360
I have both of them running at the same time, I'm sitting at about 75, 80% RAM usage.

341
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,220
So I am somewhat limited on what I can do.

342
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,260
Up to that red line.

343
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
But it works.

344
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,260
It does.

345
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,260
Yeah.

346
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,260
It definitely serves my needs.

347
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,260
Do you...

348
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,460
So when you're in the truth, you just have your own walled-off file system.

349
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,920
You can't get to the Chrome OS file system or anything like that?

350
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
You actually can.

351
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Really?

352
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Yeah.

353
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,040
Anything you have in your Downloads folder.

354
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,200
If anybody's used Chrome OS, they know that there's usually a Google Drive with everything,

355
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,960
and then there's your Downloads folder, and that's what you work under.

356
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,200
And yes, you can get to all of those files.

357
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Holy!

358
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Look at that.

359
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Yeah.

360
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
That is really fancy.

361
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,080
So do you have to do anything special to Chrome OS before you install Crouton?

362
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
You do.

363
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
You do have to go into developer mode.

364
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Okay.

365
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,840
And for whichever Chromebook you have, there are lots of online instructions on how to get

366
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
into developer mode.

367
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Yeah.

368
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Which does reset it.

369
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
Yeah.

370
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Yeah.

371
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
It does.

372
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Yeah.

373
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,640
So if you're going to do this, do it early on before you get a lot of stuff set up in

374
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Chrome OS.

375
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,360
Well, Chrome OS is not so bad in most cases.

376
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
No.

377
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Yeah.

378
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Most of your stuff will repopulate pretty quickly.

379
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
So that's not a big deal.

380
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:51,440
But once you have it going, it's as simple as once you have run the Crouton script to

381
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,920
install whichever distribution you want or whichever desktop environment you want, then

382
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,760
it provides you with a handy dandy little shell script that you can run to just start

383
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
it up.

384
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,840
So if I can get this on the thing there.

385
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
On the thing.

386
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
All right.

387
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
So you're in Chrome OS.

388
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,440
And now you're running, is it booting right now?

389
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,280
Wait for it.

390
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
There it is.

391
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
There's a boot too.

392
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
And there we go.

393
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
I recognize Unity.

394
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Yep.

395
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,160
And I chose Unity because I wanted to see how it worked with the touch screen.

396
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Yeah.

397
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
And how's it been?

398
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Yeah.

399
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
So it's been really good.

400
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
Good.

401
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,400
I've been able to quickly launch things with a touch.

402
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,160
And then, you know, I've been really impressed with the responsiveness.

403
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
The way...

404
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,320
I was really shocked that the touch screen worked at all.

405
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,840
I was kind of just imagining that that's probably not gonna happen.

406
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,640
And I hopped over into it, and everything's been working.

407
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,320
I was just demoing, also running some applications in Wine.

408
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:54,040
So to me, I've got three different operating systems kind of working in tandem there.

409
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,880
You know, one of the things that kind of struck me, I don't know if you...

410
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Did you catch it?

411
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,960
We had a few people show up at the booth that were using touch screen machines.

412
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,080
I actually noticed that.

413
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
I was wondering if other folks caught on to that as well.

414
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,080
It seems like a trend.

415
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
Yeah.

416
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
I don't know.

417
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
I didn't see...

418
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
I saw a lot of tablets.

419
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,080
But I mean, I saw like Chromebooks.

420
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,200
And I know, Eric in here, you brought your laptop that has a touch screen.

421
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,560
You use Unity too, don't you?

422
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,720
Yes, I do, for that very reason.

423
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Yeah.

424
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,760
That seemed to be everybody that brought up to the booth that was using touch was using

425
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Unity.

426
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
Almost universally on a laptop.

427
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,120
Well, it only makes sense because really, in KDE, it doesn't have very good touch screen

428
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
support.

429
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,640
In fact, it even keeps the cursor wherever you touch it.

430
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,100
Have you tried the Plasma Active interface?

431
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
You know what?

432
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,200
There's nothing really working with Plasma Active yet.

433
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,780
You still have to compile it from source in most cases.

434
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,040
So there's that.

435
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,400
And then I tried Gnome.

436
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:54,560
And Gnome is not as easy to resize windows or even move windows as it is in Unity.

437
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,060
For instance, you can't drag it by the title bar in Gnome for some reason.

438
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,440
I don't even know why that is.

439
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,440
You think with those big client-side decorations, it may be easy to grab.

440
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Exactly.

441
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
It's not.

442
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
Exactly.

443
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
I can't do it.

444
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,040
I just put my finger on it.

445
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,720
I try swiping that thing over.

446
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
It won't do it.

447
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Yeah.

448
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
It doesn't follow my finger.

449
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Yeah.

450
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
All right.

451
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
All right.

452
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
I don't know if it's a trend.

453
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,440
I don't know if I'm ready to call it a trend, but it definitely was an observation I made

454
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,680
that seemed like people are taking to touch.

455
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,300
And I think what it is is so many of these Windows 8 laptops have shipped now with touch

456
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,840
support and people are buying those and loading Linux on them.

457
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,680
There's vendors like System76 also that sell touch.

458
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,160
And it's happening.

459
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
It's happening.

460
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,400
Speaking of something that's happening, our second sponsor this week is absolutely happening.

461
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,780
That is DigitalOcean.

462
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,560
Go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code UNPLUGGEDAPRIL.

463
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,480
It's going to work for a little bit longer, getting close to the end here.

464
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,680
But wouldn't it be great to give us a little boost towards the end of April and here's

465
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
why you want to do it.

466
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,520
You'll get a $5 credit or a $10 credit, which is great when you get the $5 rig, which, do

467
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,880
the math there, that's two months for free when you use our special promo code UNPLUGGEDAPRIL.

468
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,640
So what is DigitalOcean?

469
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,200
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

470
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,240
to spin up a cloud server.

471
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,800
Folks in our audience have gotten these things up and running in 40 seconds, 47 seconds.

472
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Most folks, and don't be ashamed if you're one of them, 55 seconds.

473
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:25,280
And pricing plans start at only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

474
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,800
which is awesome, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

475
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,800
And the best part is that DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco,

476
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,140
Amsterdam, Singapore, you name it, you can put a rig there.

477
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,280
The interface is simple.

478
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,360
The control panel is super intuitive.

479
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,000
The power users can replicate it on a larger scale with their straightforward API.

480
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,280
You might want to check this out because over on the DigitalOcean website, over at digitalocean.com,

481
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,660
click on the community tab, and then go look at view projects.

482
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:57,120
These are community projects that some of them are using this DigitalOcean API to really

483
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,080
provide some great functionality.

484
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,160
On Sunday, I talked about an application that ties in with the Ubuntu to manage your droplets,

485
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,240
to turn them on, turn them off, check their IP, their OS status, things like that.

486
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,880
And then almost, I think it was Monday, there was one out now for the Mac.

487
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,540
People are really kind of rallying around DigitalOcean and it makes sense because they've

488
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,560
been investing in SSDs for a long time and there's a reason.

489
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,280
You just get better performance, higher density when they pair it with tier one bandwidth

490
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,880
and the data centers all over the world, they've all been hand chosen by DigitalOcean to be

491
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,000
really excellent.

492
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,880
So go over to digitalocean.com and check them out and see why so many folks are using DigitalOcean,

493
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,000
not just for projects and learning like lots of our audience does, but also for hosting

494
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,520
the back end infrastructure for their critical applications.

495
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,920
DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code unpluggedapril and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

496
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,880
Linux Unplugged.

497
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,000
So let's go back to the Linux Fest Northwest coverage.

498
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,360
One of our very own was there, Brian2040 from the chat room and he had a booth to talk about

499
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,120
his distribution which has recently sort of changed course.

500
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,320
We're here with Brian from the DescentOS project, most people in the Jupiter Broadcasting community

501
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,480
are going to know him as Brian2040.

502
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,440
Mr. Brian2040, how are you doing today?

503
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,920
I'm doing pretty good.

504
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,280
Tell me a little bit about what DescentOS is and what you can do with it.

505
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,440
Mainly what DescentOS is, currently it's a Debian based distribution that actually

506
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,400
stands on the desktop.

507
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,280
We are in development of the 5 release right now where it is actually more for general

508
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,600
usage, that means you can use it for desktop servers, embedded systems and everything like

509
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,440
that and it's totally independent but right now what we're doing is mainly just going

510
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,400
out there with the desktop version and say hey, we're back, we've got this new version

511
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,360
of our 4.0 system out here which I actually released last year, on this day last year

512
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:03,640
and basically what we're doing is hey, it's back, let's see what we can do with this.

513
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,880
So you were telling me a little bit earlier that you are looking to push DescentOS more

514
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,040
into the embedded space and primarily focus on the embedded space.

515
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:21,500
How is the development of the embedded spin of your distro coming as opposed to the desktop

516
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,480
one that we see here on the laptop?

517
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
It's going pretty well.

518
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,240
Embedded is a whole other monster pretty much.

519
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,080
We're bringing support for the BagelBone Black initially.

520
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,720
We might end up bringing it to the Raspberry Pi right now but right now it's mainly for

521
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
ARMv7 not for ARMv6.

522
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,040
And if people wanted to find more information about DescentOS or what you guys are doing,

523
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,760
where could they go?

524
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,680
You could always email me.

525
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,840
My email is brian at descentos.org with no pipe in there and that's probably the best

526
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,600
way to get information from me right now.

527
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,260
We're bringing our site back up.

528
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,800
That would be at descentos.org.

529
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,580
We're bringing that up Monday.

530
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,240
So Tyler, you've been working on, you were there with Brian at the booth.

531
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,200
So what kind of big changes does he have coming to DescentOS because it sounds like he's got

532
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,000
a few ideas in mind.

533
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,880
I would say the biggest change that he does have coming up is going to be the package

534
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,400
manager he's going to be including in DescentOS 5 because it's not going to be based on anything

535
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
else.

536
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,480
It's called HPM which is a hybrid package manager that will do both binaries and compile

537
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
from source.

538
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Oh.

539
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Oh wow.

540
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
HPM.

541
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,080
So yeah, we'll get him in here soon to talk more about that because they've got a whole

542
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,860
new idea, a whole new approach that sounds pretty awesome.

543
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:41,200
So that was DescentOS and I think they're going to be hitting sort of that sysadmin

544
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,320
sweet spot if they keep on their current path from what I talked to them about it at LinuxFest.

545
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,320
All right, so we got a chance to talk with the folks from Firefox and I believe this

546
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
was Ben.

547
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
Hello, Ben.

548
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
There he is.

549
00:27:52,320 --> 00:28:01,160
Can you tell me a little bit about what the Mozilla Corporation is up to right now?

550
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,780
Yeah, we're doing a lot of things.

551
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,080
We're focusing on mobile a lot.

552
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,880
So we have a device coming out with an operating system that we've developed called Firefox

553
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
OS.

554
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,240
And with it, we're trying to bring, we're trying to kind of close the digital divide

555
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,000
a bit and bring smartphones to emerging markets.

556
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,120
So a lot of emerging markets are still using feature phones if the people who are lucky

557
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,880
enough to have them.

558
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,320
And we think that we can improve quality of life quite a bit for people if we bring them

559
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,560
from a feature phone to a smartphone.

560
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,040
And to that end, we do a lot of things like we're developing things and we're getting

561
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,680
feedback from a lot of the people in these countries.

562
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,120
So we've talked to some people in Argentina and we figured out that they really use FM

563
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,600
radio a lot on their phone and they rely on that as their main radio and they use that

564
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,920
a lot for communication.

565
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,480
And they might not necessarily have a computer.

566
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,280
So they need a lot of these features in phones that a lot of other markets don't have, like

567
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,540
sharing pictures over Bluetooth with their friends.

568
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,200
And so we're focusing on lower-end hardware.

569
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,680
So most people in these markets can't afford a $400 smartphone or something like that,

570
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,620
but they can afford a $25 smartphone.

571
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,040
So we have a $25 smartphone coming out geared for them.

572
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
It's not stripped down.

573
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,680
It still has a touch screen.

574
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,280
It'll still have a full smartphone experience.

575
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,240
It'll just be at a lower price point that people can actually afford.

576
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,280
That sounds outstanding and I think that really does fill a niche market.

577
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:28,200
If budget constraints weren't an issue and I was looking for a platform that was a little

578
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,200
bit less locked down than say, for example, Android, which is called Linux, but is it

579
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,360
really open source, a Linux operating system?

580
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,960
Is there something that Firefox OS can offer me that way?

581
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,140
Yes, definitely.

582
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,760
All of the development happens in the open.

583
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
You can go on GitHub.

584
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,800
You can watch our development.

585
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,060
And I mean, beyond that, it's a lot more open in that we actually interact with community

586
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,880
and you can see all of these things that happen as they happen and as such, it's a much more

587
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,560
open platform.

588
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:03,840
Now I know a big concern is the applications that run on the phone.

589
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,520
Is the Mozilla OS at a very locked down app store and if I buy my apps on Mozilla Firefox

590
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,400
OS, is that something I'm not going to be able to run on any other phone?

591
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,680
No, absolutely not.

592
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,760
That's not something we want.

593
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,120
And so we actually created a standard.

594
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,320
So all of the things, create apps for Firefox OS are now part of the upstream standards

595
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,660
that they use like JavaScript and programming languages, things like that.

596
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:35,080
And so you can actually write apps that are web apps and they have access to things like

597
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,160
hardware so you can write a web app to use your camera and you can write a web app to

598
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,280
make phone calls, things like that.

599
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,760
And these are also compatible with a desktop and they're compatible with other operating

600
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,860
systems like Ubuntu have said that they're going to be fully supporting Firefox OS apps,

601
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,860
for example.

602
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,660
So when you write an app, you can run it in many places.

603
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,360
Because they're web apps, wouldn't they technically work on any device that has a web browser?

604
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
Absolutely.

605
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,200
So you can actually share a lot of assets.

606
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,960
Obviously like a desktop browser is going to have a much bigger screen so you have a

607
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,600
different layout but you can reuse a lot of the same resources for that.

608
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Outstanding.

609
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Well, thank you so much.

610
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,040
And if somebody was interested in learning more about Firefox OS or if they wanted to

611
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:21,520
make a donation to the Mozilla organization, where would they go to find more information?

612
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,680
Mozilla.org is going to be a great resource on there.

613
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,040
It should have everything you need.

614
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
It's very intuitive.

615
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Sounds good.

616
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Well, thank you very much for your time.

617
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
We really appreciate having you.

618
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,840
Man, didn't Noah do a great job?

619
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
He really did.

620
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Yes, he sure did.

621
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,120
I thought that guy's answer regarding web apps where he said everybody knows the benefit

622
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,520
to web apps if you can make it truly integrate at the OS level but still then also have something

623
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,600
that works in the web browser, that really would be sweet because the thing about it

624
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,400
from a lazy developer standpoint, that really saves them a lot of time.

625
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,520
So I don't know, he says it can access the camera and all that good stuff.

626
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,200
Web apps are getting pretty good.

627
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,760
Maybe Firefox OS, whatever it's going to be called, has a shot.

628
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,040
I'm looking forward to at least getting something to play with it.

629
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,200
Personally speaking, I think if we can find an audience, because I see this as like the

630
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,080
perfect entry level, you know, virgin smartphone people type individuals that are looking to

631
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,640
kind of pop their chair and get into this realm.

632
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,840
My mom is a great example.

633
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,520
You couldn't get her to use a smartphone to save her life.

634
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,260
But something like that where it has a reasonable barrier to entry, especially at that price

635
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,360
point, that doesn't sound so scary.

636
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,360
What about Alan?

637
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
What about you?

638
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,920
I mean, you have a Nexus S, so you're not totally, you obviously don't feel the pinch

639
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,920
to have like the most crazy high-end smartphone, and I don't think you have too many apps on

640
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
there.

641
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,320
Would you consider a Firefox OS phone if it did calls, texting, email, and you know, maybe

642
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,800
Twitter and stuff like that?

643
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,040
I don't think he's there.

644
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,200
Well, that's too bad.

645
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,240
I'd be really curious because Alan's basically got one phone like at the start of TechSnap

646
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
and he's used the same phone.

647
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
Meanwhile, I've had like six phones.

648
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
I'm crazy.

649
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
This is true.

650
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,080
He's an individual when it comes to stuff, and I think he's really kind of got a system

651
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,520
that works for him, and he's probably just going to stick to that.

652
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,360
Yeah, and I think you probably nailed it.

653
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,000
I could see also a class of geeks out there.

654
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,680
I think there's a lot of geeks that walk around with a feature phone, a lot more than

655
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
we suspect.

656
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Oh, yeah.

657
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,160
Especially with like tablets, like you can get something like the Nexus 7 that fits in

658
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,240
your pocket anyways, and then if you just have a feature phone to make phone calls and

659
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,080
send a few text, quick text messages, no big deal.

660
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,080
I think there's...

661
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
Go ahead, Tyler.

662
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,360
I was saying, as somebody who currently has a Galaxy Nexus and wanting to look for something

663
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,120
more powerful, I think something like a Boon 2 phone would speak more to me than Firefox

664
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
OS.

665
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Yeah.

666
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
What do you think, Matt?

667
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,080
Boy, that's a tough one.

668
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,280
Trying to draw the comparables between a Boon 2 phone and Firefox.

669
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,000
I would need to spend some real quality time between the two devices because I think they

670
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,680
definitely scratch different edges.

671
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:53,480
I think as far as usability, I've actually had my hands on more frequently with a Firefox

672
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,840
phone and I would say that it seems like it's a very straightforward experience.

673
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,880
The Boon 2 phone is constantly developing and evolving, so I would need to see how that

674
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,800
really turns out in the long haul before I could really make that direct comparison.

675
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Yeah.

676
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,200
And it's always, you know, it depends on can it run what you want.

677
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Right.

678
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
And for some people, that's a...

679
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,160
Like you just point out, that list is smaller and for other people, that list is longer.

680
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
I think so.

681
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,640
I think the other thing to really consider too is that I think potentially they will

682
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,040
be tapping into much of the same market.

683
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,200
I think they'll be tapping into much of the same type of user.

684
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
People that just want...

685
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,920
Look, they want a smartphone, but then at the same time, they don't necessarily need

686
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
an Android market.

687
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,160
They don't necessarily care about that other stuff.

688
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,800
I mean, Firefox seems like it has a bit of a head start right now, but if Ubuntu starts

689
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,320
with a good splash, they'll essentially be in the same spot, kind of going for the same

690
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
customer.

691
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
All right.

692
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,280
Well, so we also had a chance to chat with Seth from the EFF.

693
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,080
We're here with Seth from the EFF, and Seth, how are you doing today?

694
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
Doing great.

695
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
How are you?

696
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
Excellent.

697
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,840
Can you tell me a little bit about what the EFF is and what you aim to do?

698
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Sure.

699
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,280
EFF is a non-profit, member-supported organization based in San Francisco.

700
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,600
We've been around for about 25 years, and we're the foremost organization promoting

701
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,560
individual rights online.

702
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,360
So we have lawyers, we have technologists like myself, we have activists, and we work

703
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,100
in the courts, we work in Congress, and we work with technology, explaining how things

704
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,640
work and trying to protect people's individual rights, like free expression and privacy,

705
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,560
in the context of technology.

706
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:32,000
Now how has maybe your role changed, or maybe not your role, how has the relevance and importance

707
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,800
of your organization changed since the revelation of Edward Snowden?

708
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,540
I would say we've gotten a lot more public attention to our work on surveillance issues

709
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,220
in particular.

710
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,400
And electronic communication surveillance is one of the core issues that we've worked

711
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,480
on and that we've always worked on.

712
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,720
So we were already, in fact, suing NSA over electronic communication surveillance, over

713
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,840
mass surveillance, years ago, starting back in 2005.

714
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,880
And so the Snowden revelations have certainly brought a lot of attention to our work in

715
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,400
the courts and our work in Congress.

716
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,640
Our membership is way up.

717
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,880
We're hearing from people all the time that they really care about what we do, that they

718
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,920
really care about the fight against mass surveillance.

719
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,240
Now I know you told me when we started that you're a little short on time, but if I can

720
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,080
ask you real quickly, if somebody was interested in supporting the EFF or getting more information

721
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,840
about the EFF, where could they go to reach out to you?

722
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:30,000
Well the best place is our website at EFF.org for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

723
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Thank you so much for your time.

724
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,200
Yeah, I don't know how much traffic they got, but I thought it was pretty cool that they

725
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,320
were there.

726
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:40,620
And Noah's question about, how's it been since Snowden was a good one?

727
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,880
That was an excellent question.

728
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,520
And I think that, no question, well it's really telling if you stop and think about it.

729
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,480
He mentioned that they've already been in the process of addressing the whole NSA thing

730
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
previously.

731
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,720
I honestly didn't see much of that in the news until the Snowden stuff happened.

732
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,640
I mean, all of a sudden everybody cares.

733
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,160
Everybody in the mainstream media suddenly cares at that point.

734
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,040
Previous to that, eh, you know, honestly, most people didn't, and that's sad.

735
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,040
So that's, we'll call it there for the clips from Linux Fest Northwest.

736
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,040
If you didn't catch the Linux action show, be sure, it's worth the watch just for the

737
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,800
chat with John Mad Dog Hall, but there's also a bunch of other great chats in there too.

738
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,760
So go watch episode 310 of the Linux action show if you haven't yet, and hopefully you'll

739
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
get a chance.

740
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,400
All right Mumbo, before we wrap up today, did anybody want to share any thoughts or

741
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,760
experiences from Linux Fest Northwest that made it this week?

742
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,640
I was thinking in the EFF clips, a funny story, I actually took one of the papers from the

743
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:40,320
EFF booth to use as a mouse pad because those tables sucked for a surface for using an optical

744
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,320
mouse.

745
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,480
That is not what I expected as an observation at all.

746
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,320
But it is a factual observation, not what we're going for.

747
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
Yeah.

748
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
All right.

749
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
Anybody else that want to chime in on their thoughts?

750
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
Go ahead, Poppy.

751
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,440
Yeah, Chris, as someone who was watching remotely, I thought you did a great job of keeping your

752
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,120
stream going and keeping people entertained remotely.

753
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,440
Oh, thank you, sir.

754
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
Good.

755
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
I'm glad.

756
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,840
So we basically started when the show floor opened, and we wrapped when it ended.

757
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:12,440
And then first night, we went out and got a whole bunch of pizza, although I wasn't

758
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,860
going to eat any of the pizza because it would have screwed me up.

759
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,680
So I had a salad bar, and I asked the guy, I'm like, so how's your salad bar?

760
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,480
And he's like, it's OK.

761
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Take the salad bar.

762
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
And I'm like, really?

763
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Wow.

764
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,920
And Alan's standing right there, and Alan's like, get the salad bar, Chris.

765
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,800
And I'm like, well, is it a bad salad bar, man?

766
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,360
And so then Alex, who walks over to the salad bar, and he's kind of surveying it, and he

767
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,120
looks over at me, and he shakes his head and gives me the thumbs down sign.

768
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,280
I'm like, man, I'm getting some advice here.

769
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,120
The salad bar is no good, and you're not selling me very much on the salad bar.

770
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,400
And he looks at me and goes, what?

771
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
No.

772
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
No, it's a good salad bar.

773
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
It's fine.

774
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
The salad bar is fine.

775
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Really.

776
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
I got the salad bar.

777
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
And you know what?

778
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
It was fine.

779
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
It was not that bad.

780
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
And now I'm glad I didn't go for any food.

781
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Yeah.

782
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Oh, yeah.

783
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Yeah.

784
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
I don't know.

785
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
The ultimate pizza was pretty good.

786
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Yeah.

787
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,200
Yeah, I was with Brian in 2014, and after the show at the museum, we went over to that

788
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,840
Bayou restaurant down the street.

789
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
How was that?

790
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,840
It was pretty good.

791
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,840
Yeah?

792
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Yeah.

793
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
Yeah, that smelled delicious.

794
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Oh, my gosh.

795
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,840
So there was a Cajun restaurant next to the Spark Museum where we went for the after-party,

796
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,880
and they're one of these guys, they're brilliant, Matt.

797
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,080
They put the smokestack on the outside of the building right there on the sidewalk,

798
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,200
so they're just like, as they're Cajun cooking, the smell from the grill is just going right

799
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
out into the street.

800
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
It smelled wonderful.

801
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Oh, my gosh.

802
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,320
The restaurants have a knack for really nailing it out of the park, and it's one thing I've

803
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,840
noticed, and that's a great example of it.

804
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,480
Yeah, it was like we were all standing in line like, oh, my gosh, that smells so good.

805
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,200
So the guy behind me, literally, I was saying that like a dozen times, the guy behind me

806
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
says, yeah, we just went in.

807
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,240
It was like, they're super fast.

808
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,520
So we went in there, we got some Cajun food real quick, we got some jambalaya, and then

809
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,200
we came back in line, and we just lost like 10 spots in line, no big deal.

810
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,960
I'm like, oh, that's interesting.

811
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,080
And then I get in the Spark Museum, and the Cajun place comes up because it smells delicious,

812
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,040
and people are like, yeah, I just jumped out of line and went in.

813
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
They're really quick.

814
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,160
And I just lost like a few spots in line.

815
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
It was totally worth it.

816
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
And then I'm like, oh, that's funny.

817
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
Somebody else says to me.

818
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,760
And then another guy walks up and says the same thing.

819
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
So it worked.

820
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
It made some money that night.

821
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
That was pretty cool.

822
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,080
The Spark Museum was really packed, but I felt like a sardine.

823
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,440
Isn't there some cool old tech in there, though?

824
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,280
It's amazing how far it's gone.

825
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,280
Watching a whole group of people try to figure out how to run that old cash register is funny.

826
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Oh, that was awesome.

827
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
That was hilarious.

828
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,800
I've never played Pokemon in real life.

829
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,440
Yeah, and I tried to play Star Trek on the, what's that thing called that I tried to play

830
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
it on?

831
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Theremin.

832
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
Theremin.

833
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,440
But I failed miserably.

834
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Because you're trying to play TNG on the TOS instrument.

835
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Yeah.

836
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,600
I thought of a Star Trek tune, and TNG came to mind, because TNG's awesome.

837
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Right.

838
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Right.

839
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,800
But I think the best part was just getting to meet a bunch of these people in person,

840
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,400
like Blaster, and Eric, and Fate, and Q5, and not Tyler.

841
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,480
Yeah, that was a really cool part.

842
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,000
And I mean, Matt, how awesome was our crew?

843
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,560
Oh, it was amazing.

844
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,280
Not only did we have all these great guys coming from all over the country, and even

845
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,480
from other countries, as Alan will attest to, but also our crew was just fantastic.

846
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,760
They literally enabled us to make this happen.

847
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
It was awesome.

848
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
Yeah.

849
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,960
I mean, it was like everybody just got to work and did their part.

850
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,240
Nobody was just slacking off.

851
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,720
Everybody had a job, and they found it naturally, and they just dug in and made sure it got

852
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,760
it done.

853
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,000
And Chase tore down his whole studio, his whole production setup.

854
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,520
Put it all in a bunch of bags, and then drove it up to Bellingham.

855
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,560
And then at the end of it all, Sunday night, I go back to his house late after we had a

856
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,680
little after-party here at the studio, and now he's got to hook all that stuff back up

857
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,880
before he can do shows.

858
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,880
So I really appreciate that.

859
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,280
Yeah, I was going to say, I hope he brought up the quality of the stream.

860
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,880
I was going to say something, if you didn't, that Chase deserves a shout-out, because I

861
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
think he really made this possible.

862
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
Yeah.

863
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,760
And his Wirecast mastery is serious coming through.

864
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
Yeah, he's got some serious food.

865
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,760
He knows what he's doing with that thing.

866
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,120
Yeah, and he had all the lower thirds we used in the live stream, he just kind of made up

867
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,800
on the fly as he grabbed assets.

868
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,240
He pulled the last logo from the subreddit.

869
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,520
He just went and found it.

870
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
So I loved lower thirds.

871
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,760
I thought that was something you threw together, but he did that?

872
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,960
He did it Friday night as we were setting up the booth.

873
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Yeah, I was sitting right next to him when he was doing that.

874
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,920
It was just like, boom, boom, boom.

875
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,040
It was like, I could not believe how fast he was getting it done.

876
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,120
The funny part is he was actually annoyed by something he did, and he fixed it during

877
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,120
the live stream.

878
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,440
He was just like, I don't like this, I'm going to fix it.

879
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
That's exactly what he did too.

880
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
He just...

881
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,440
Yeah.

882
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,440
It was great for me.

883
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
It looks familiar in the chat room.

884
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,640
It says, I had no idea Chase was so amazing.

885
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,880
Neither did I, but now I do.

886
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,120
I had an idea, but not...

887
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,120
He blew me away.

888
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,120
It wasn't confirmed.

889
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
Yeah, exactly.

890
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:47,440
I decided, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to tear down the studio after we just moved

891
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
in.

892
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,420
So I was like, if we didn't do that, I didn't know what we were going to do, maybe laptops

893
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,420
and microphones.

894
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,160
It was way beyond what we would have gotten.

895
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,000
The next year, now we know.

896
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,400
Now we know we're going to go whole hog every year now, because that was just great.

897
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,240
And if we have a crew like that again, assuming to enable us to be able to do it, we'll do

898
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,240
it.

899
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,240
So make your plans, people.

900
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,240
Probably have more.

901
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
Just the parallels.

902
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,180
I mean, it's like having that managed, having Chase master that entire setup so that we

903
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,680
could do what we needed to do was just...

904
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,680
Yeah, let us focus on our stuff.

905
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,680
Oh my God.

906
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,680
It was awesome.

907
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,680
Yeah.

908
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,680
Yep.

909
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,680
Absolutely.

910
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,680
It was super cool.

911
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,200
Plus, that's where Chase in your face was born.

912
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,200
Yes.

913
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,760
He was sure excited about that.

914
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,760
What is the website?

915
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
Chaseinyourface.tk.

916
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
Chaseinyourface.tk.

917
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,760
Chaseinyourface.tk.

918
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
Chaseinyourface.tk.

919
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
Chaseinyourface.tk.

920
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
Yeah.

921
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
He's like, you guys couldn't even do a.com?

922
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
I mean, like, really?

923
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
I was like, no.

924
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,760
He was just like, I mean, if you're going to do that, I was like, we're just going to

925
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
do it.

926
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
We have all these GoDaddy codes.

927
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,760
Yeah.

928
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,760
There you go.

929
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,760
Yeah.

930
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
Get them for a good deal, right?

931
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
Yeah.

932
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,880
But I think, too, I really wish more industry people who run these events would come to

933
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,200
this kind of event to see it.

934
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,640
Because you could take some of this format and apply it to other types of fest or cons

935
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,920
or whatever they are.

936
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,880
And I think there would be some winning recipes.

937
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,000
You wouldn't have to change the other formats very much.

938
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,100
But they call it a low stress fest, and that's very true.

939
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,100
It was very true.

940
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,100
It was very low stress.

941
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:16,280
I was amazed at how nonchalant, just easy it was, just the overall vibe was just calm.

942
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,560
And one thing that's kind of neat, because it's at a technical college, which, first

943
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,520
of all, is a beautiful campus.

944
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,720
And second of all, they really made that showroom really nice that we had as the main room.

945
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,280
But what's neat is to run the network.

946
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,920
It's like some of the networking students' final test, or not final, but one of their

947
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,760
big tests for the whole class is they run that wireless network.

948
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,560
They make sure that LAN stays up, and they are responsible for all of it.

949
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,240
And they're really helpful.

950
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,680
We were able to get a line punched through the firewall, so we were outside the firewall.

951
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,680
We got our own static IP address from their provider, and had a direct connection out

952
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,960
to Scale Engine.

953
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,400
So our stream was very steady.

954
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,600
There was one time when Albert decided to post a video, and he killed our stream.

955
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,600
He didn't.

956
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
I probably shouldn't have.

957
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,600
It was totally fine.

958
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
No hard feelings.

959
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
It just happens.

960
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,720
And so it was really great, because they worked with us.

961
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,840
And we got there, and we had an Ethernet LAN.

962
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,320
They specifically punched it down.

963
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,080
And wireless wasn't perfect.

964
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,400
We had issues, and we also had ways to solve that.

965
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,600
But for what you get at a conference with, I think now the number is actually up to 1,600.

966
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,400
I think it's even higher than what we said in the show.

967
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,000
To have 1,600 people who, all of them probably have a cell phone that has Wi-Fi.

968
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,040
Most of them have a tablet or a laptop that has Wi-Fi.

969
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,680
I had two devices on me.

970
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,000
I had my laptop and my cell phone that were taking up Wi-Fi.

971
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,440
So when you figure 1,600 people, many of which have two devices on the Wi-Fi network, it

972
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,640
gets pretty nuts.

973
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,920
And they still managed it.

974
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,760
I'm just thinking, as somebody who worked in education for a little while, or somebody

975
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,120
who was a student at one point, it would be so cool to have a last lesson like that.

976
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,880
So that's just kind of, at the end of the day, one of the neat little side things about

977
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,620
Bellingham and having the Linux Fest at the Bellingham Technical College.

978
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,620
So there you go.

979
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,840
They've done pretty well for themselves.

980
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,000
Yeah, I was really impressed with that, because I compare it to other conferences I've been

981
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
to.

982
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,880
I've been to conferences with way less people, way less devices, and the wireless was crap.

983
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,120
And you paid $500 or $600 to get into it.

984
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,360
It's like, wow, OK.

985
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,840
So you compare it to other events, it's like, this is really impressive.

986
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,340
And next year, I don't know how we're going to pull it off, because I loved having the

987
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,340
live stream.

988
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,340
So we'll always have that.

989
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,340
I want to do that every year.

990
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:28,440
But I also want to try to get to some of the sessions and just attend some of those.

991
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,440
So I think we'll do shifts or stuff like that.

992
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,920
But as it starts approaching, maybe the community can work together and we can find ways to

993
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,260
get folks out so they can experience it, because it's a really good time.

994
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,080
But Matt, with that, I think we'll come to the end of this week's Linux Unplugged.

995
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,640
Now, on Sunday, on the Linux Action Show, we're going to do a gaming episode.

996
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,600
Because honestly, it's just Matt and I have an itch that we need to scratch, and we still

997
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,800
have these loaner laptops.

998
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,620
So we figured, why not have some fun from System76 and run them through their paces.

999
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,080
So tune in on Sunday for that.

1000
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,240
We'll be live on Sunday at 10 AM Pacific for the Linux Action Show over at jblive.tv.

1001
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,240
Don't forget, we want your feedback.

1002
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,200
Go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click that contact link, and then choose Linux Unplugged

1003
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,200
from the dropdown.

1004
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,880
You can catch us on Tuesdays at 2 PM Pacific over at jblive.tv, or go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

1005
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,840
slash calendar to get that converted in your local time zone.

1006
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
All right, Matt.

1007
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,840
I'll see you on Sunday, OK?

1008
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,840
See you then.

1009
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,840
All right, everyone.

1010
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,840
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1011
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:33,080
See you next Tuesday.
