00:00.000 --> 00:14.320
Welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 385.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.320
My name is Chris.

00:15.320 --> 00:16.600
My name is Wes.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.680
And no hiding it, there's a Drew over there too.

00:18.680 --> 00:19.680
Heyo.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.560
You guys, you look good.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.560
You look real good today.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.000
We all dressed up for the tuxes.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.600
We're all wearing our going to town clothes because it's a very special episode where

00:29.600 --> 00:34.600
we get to say thank you to a lot of open source projects and see who our audience voted as

00:34.600 --> 00:40.340
some of the best in newcomers and distributions and text editors, just about everything you

00:40.340 --> 00:41.360
think we'd nerd out on.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.440
So it's a special episode today.

00:44.440 --> 00:50.280
We're also going to do a special holiday unboxing here in a little bit.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.920
And we have a special guest joining us to help us go over all of the new goodies that

00:55.920 --> 01:00.200
have landed in Plasma and just the state of Plasma in 2020. Nate, welcome back to the

01:00.200 --> 01:01.200
show, man.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.200
Hi there.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.200
Thanks.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
It's great to be here.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
Man, it's great to have you.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
So hold on.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
We're going to get to Plasma here in just a moment.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.520
But before we do that, I have to say thank you to a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.880
They're the leader in hands-on learning.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.200
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.600
And that's why ACG provides hands-on labs, Cloud Linux servers, and much more.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.720
So get your hands cloudy at a CloudGuru.com.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.600
I psyched your mind, Mumble Room.

01:23.600 --> 01:24.760
You thought I was going to call on you.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.760
Some appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:26.760 --> 01:27.760
Hello.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.760
Hello.

01:28.760 --> 01:29.760
Hello.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.760
Hello.

01:30.760 --> 01:31.760
Hello.

01:31.760 --> 01:32.760
Hello.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.760
Hello, everybody.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.760
Good to have you in there.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.480
Thank you so much for being here.

01:36.480 --> 01:41.240
I'm looking forward to our discussions as we analyze who the winners are this year.

01:41.240 --> 01:45.860
Also, I'm glad you're here for the surprise unboxing for Mr. West.

01:45.860 --> 01:50.600
And this year on Coda Radio, I've started talking a lot about how I think Plasma is

01:50.600 --> 01:56.400
a fantastic workstation for developers and administrators who want a really stable, rock-solid

01:56.400 --> 02:00.360
Linux base, but want something that's like a power tool.

02:00.360 --> 02:05.880
I've made the equivalence before that you know how you might have like a cordless drill

02:05.880 --> 02:09.560
in your garage that's pretty capable, but then you go into like a vehicle shop that

02:09.560 --> 02:15.560
has like one of these air-powered suckers and it just can take a thing apart in 10 seconds?

02:15.560 --> 02:19.880
That's what Plasma is, in my view, when you look at the different desktops out there.

02:19.880 --> 02:25.160
But they've managed over 2020 to really polish that thing and make a lot of these things

02:25.160 --> 02:29.520
that were rough edges in the past a lot smoother now.

02:29.520 --> 02:35.360
And Nate Graham has been tracking all of these developments week by week on his blog.

02:35.360 --> 02:39.680
Since we've had you on forever ago, you're still doing it like a soldier of the Plasma

02:39.680 --> 02:40.680
desktop.

02:40.680 --> 02:41.680
I really appreciate it.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.240
I love reading through these.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.240
Sure am.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.240
It's a lot of fun.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.040
I mean, like, first of all, thanks, man.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.040
You're welcome.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.160
Like, geez, that's got to be a lot of work.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.680
To do it every single week like that.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.880
I got to admit, it takes quite a while.

02:52.880 --> 02:57.720
I typically start writing each new post before I finish the old one.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.720
Wow.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.360
And I just kind of keep building them up throughout the whole week.

03:01.360 --> 03:06.200
I used to do it on like Saturday night right before I hit post, but it would take hours

03:06.200 --> 03:07.200
and hours and hours.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.700
So now I just keep the draft open all week and add new stuff as I see it get merged,

03:11.700 --> 03:14.280
which is a lot more a lot more reasonable to do.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.960
But yeah, it takes a while.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.540
I know those workflows very well myself.

03:18.540 --> 03:22.320
You know, we have a similar kind of approach with the shows is they're kind of in development

03:22.320 --> 03:26.240
from the moment we end them to the next one.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.360
You must be doing what?

03:27.360 --> 03:30.320
I mean, a bunch of VMs in some cases and whatnot.

03:30.320 --> 03:33.760
That way you can get a screenshot or try something because you got to kind of understand it to

03:33.760 --> 03:34.760
write about it.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.360
Actually, I don't use any virtual machines at all.

03:37.360 --> 03:42.400
I run my entire computer on built from source KDE Plasma stuff.

03:42.400 --> 03:47.780
So the first thing I do every morning is build every piece of KDE software from Gitmaster.

03:47.780 --> 03:49.940
And then use that stuff.

03:49.940 --> 03:53.400
So when I need to take a screenshot, I'm literally taking a screenshot of my own desktop.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.820
This is all stuff that's in in production in use.

03:57.820 --> 04:01.800
And I feel like personally, it's pretty amazing how stable our Gitmaster stuff is because

04:01.800 --> 04:05.920
so many people are actually running their their plasma sessions like this.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.600
So we actually have a lot of internal QA.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.820
But yeah, no VMs for me.

04:09.820 --> 04:14.920
Careful now you're giving Chris ideas and maybe not good ones.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.040
It's super stable, man.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.040
You can do it.

04:17.040 --> 04:21.460
And once once you use a rolling release distro, I've had people tell me that they read my

04:21.460 --> 04:25.860
blog posts and they say, Oh, man, I switched to arch, I switched to Manjaro or tumbleweed,

04:25.860 --> 04:27.360
because I wanted this stuff really fast.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.400
But now I feel like it's not fast enough anymore, because I want the new stuff.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.400
Now.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.400
I don't want to wait three months.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.520
Well, you make you make an art user look chill.

04:35.520 --> 04:42.120
But I need to kind of it kind of feels like it's a new form of of journalism.

04:42.120 --> 04:47.560
Like it's a it's a form of journalism that is unique, and only kind of possible with

04:47.560 --> 04:49.520
free software.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.460
And do you do you see it as a form of journalism?

04:52.460 --> 04:55.720
Or do you see it as a form of project advocacy?

04:55.720 --> 04:57.680
You know, I kind of see it as a bit of both.

04:57.680 --> 05:02.480
This is something that I thought myself about, because I didn't really set out to do something

05:02.480 --> 05:03.480
like this.

05:03.480 --> 05:08.560
I originally wanted to just categorize and tell people about what had gone on for the

05:08.560 --> 05:12.560
usability and productivity initiative that we had a few years ago.

05:12.560 --> 05:19.040
And what I realized over time was that it had become a form of like marketing, as well

05:19.040 --> 05:24.680
as just description, because people would be really interested in seeing what stuff

05:24.680 --> 05:27.400
was going to happen in the future, like they would get excited.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.220
And they would say, Oh, I want to use this stuff right now.

05:29.220 --> 05:33.000
And that was definitely not my goal to start out with, it was supposed to be descriptive,

05:33.000 --> 05:39.600
but it's, it's turned into something that's like a little bit between advocacy and journalism,

05:39.600 --> 05:40.600
I would say.

05:40.600 --> 05:45.840
And it also gives the users a sense of continued forward progress.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.560
That was actually the entire point.

05:47.560 --> 05:48.560
Yeah, yeah.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.560
Okay.

05:49.560 --> 05:53.400
When I when I originally started this a few years ago, I started using plasma and other

05:53.400 --> 05:54.440
KDE software.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.600
And I said to myself, Wow, this stuff is really great.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.680
But you know, I read all of this negativity all over social media, people seem to have

06:00.680 --> 06:03.080
this impression that it's like it's dead.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.840
Its developers are mean and rude.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.280
You know, there's all this stuff that doesn't work properly.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.280
It's really buggy.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.920
And like, that wasn't really my experience.

06:11.920 --> 06:18.600
And I felt like if I could be a voice for the opposite, showing just what I saw of the

06:18.600 --> 06:23.360
project, it would help to counter that narrative that to me seemed like it was very dated.

06:23.360 --> 06:29.460
Like maybe this was true 10 or 15 years ago, but it didn't seem true in in that moment.

06:29.460 --> 06:33.640
And I really feel like that was successful.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.360
Because I don't think those old stereotypes are true anymore.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.720
Like people used to say, Oh, it's so bloated, it takes up a gigabyte of RAM, I can't use

06:39.720 --> 06:40.720
it.

06:40.720 --> 06:44.780
But now, plasma is known as one of the most lightweight desktop environments out there.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.760
And like, we still see people who believe that old stuff.

06:47.760 --> 06:53.660
But you know, now there's there's always a cohort of people who understand the truth

06:53.660 --> 06:57.200
that all this performance work that we've done over like the last couple of years, or

06:57.200 --> 07:01.280
even like a decade or more, have paid off and everybody can benefit from it.

07:01.280 --> 07:06.520
So I think it's really important to have a direct line to your users so that you can

07:06.520 --> 07:11.240
be pushing a narrative that's true to counter misinformation out there.

07:11.240 --> 07:14.540
And sometimes the misinformation, it isn't like it isn't malicious, right?

07:14.540 --> 07:21.120
Like somebody who used KDE 15 years ago, their impression back then was was probably true,

07:21.120 --> 07:23.160
even though it doesn't match the state of reality today.

07:23.160 --> 07:28.160
So like, sometimes, countering that misinformation doesn't mean like putting somebody in their

07:28.160 --> 07:32.800
place, but just giving out the correct information that's true today.

07:32.800 --> 07:38.900
Yeah, and then letting another version be seen and read about and I think you I just

07:38.900 --> 07:46.160
watching it and seeing how the community discusses plasma now, it's, it's, it's really in a much

07:46.160 --> 07:47.160
more positive tone.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.260
I think it's had a significant noticeable impact.

07:50.260 --> 07:55.000
And so I thought, why don't we bring people up to date on kind of some of the stuff you've

07:55.000 --> 07:59.440
you've really thought was the most interesting in plasma in 2020.

07:59.440 --> 08:03.400
And maybe if there's other KDE apps to that you think we should include in there.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.500
But it's a big question.

08:05.500 --> 08:10.140
But you know, I took I kind of took most of 2020 off from plasma and then just came back

08:10.140 --> 08:12.520
to it a month ago.

08:12.520 --> 08:17.900
And I'm like, Oh, man, I can see even in that time, there's been noticeable improvements

08:17.900 --> 08:21.440
with with like the brightness controls and just all the widgets down by the clock that

08:21.440 --> 08:22.440
I use all the time.

08:22.440 --> 08:23.440
Oh, awesome.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.440
I was I was gonna talk about that quite a bit.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.440
So I'm glad you noticed.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.440
Well, do you want to start there?

08:27.440 --> 08:30.600
Because I've noticed there's nice little improvements that have landed and maybe that's one of them

08:30.600 --> 08:31.600
we should start with.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.560
So this, this was a specific improvement that we really set out to do.

08:35.560 --> 08:40.300
It's been in the planning stages for over a year, but the system tray, as I believe

08:40.300 --> 08:44.680
what you're referring to, and this was one of the oldest parts of plasma five, it was

08:44.680 --> 08:49.120
it was, you know, most of this code was years and years old.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.760
And it was like good for the time, but it could really stand a lot of modernization.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.340
And so Katie's VDG group, this is the visual design group.

08:56.340 --> 09:01.560
We also do interaction design stuff, we set out to improve and modernize the system tray

09:01.560 --> 09:02.820
applets.

09:02.820 --> 09:06.540
And over the course of 2020, we've we've done a ton of that.

09:06.540 --> 09:11.540
If you look at the current state in plasma 520, I think it's pretty good.

09:11.540 --> 09:13.800
And in 521, it just gets even better.

09:13.800 --> 09:20.360
And we made a bunch of improvements such as using a unified theming for all of the applets.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.400
So they don't seem so unique anymore.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.220
They all kind of have a common theme.

09:24.220 --> 09:27.180
We have like a defined header area on top.

09:27.180 --> 09:32.020
And in plasma 521, we're even going to have an almost like header bar style, where we

09:32.020 --> 09:37.860
have the title bar and the controls merged into the same row.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.260
We have common controls used for everything.

09:40.260 --> 09:43.760
So the amount of code and the bugginess is hugely decreased.

09:43.760 --> 09:48.620
We've worked on the visual presentation for system tray applets that have a visual component

09:48.620 --> 09:49.620
like the media player.

09:49.620 --> 09:52.220
Oh, the media player looks so nice now.

09:52.220 --> 09:53.700
It's really, really, really pretty looking.

09:53.700 --> 09:54.700
Yeah.

09:54.700 --> 09:55.700
And so on and so forth.

09:55.700 --> 10:00.280
We just we kind of went down the line with every individual system tray applet and reviewed

10:00.280 --> 10:05.380
the usability reviewed the aesthetics and just said, how can we polish this and make

10:05.380 --> 10:09.460
that individual applet the best version of itself.

10:09.460 --> 10:13.300
And then we went back to the whole system tray itself, which is like the containment

10:13.300 --> 10:14.440
for these applets.

10:14.440 --> 10:18.660
And we tried to make them integrate well into the system tray so that it seems like a really

10:18.660 --> 10:23.700
cohesive unit and just make it make it better, basically.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.020
And I feel like we've succeeded.

10:25.020 --> 10:28.620
So I'm really glad you noticed that and brought it up because that tells me that our work

10:28.620 --> 10:29.620
was impactful.

10:29.620 --> 10:30.620
Yeah.

10:30.620 --> 10:32.120
No, noticeable.

10:32.120 --> 10:36.060
It seems like and maybe this has been landing in bits over time to but system settings has

10:36.060 --> 10:38.020
seen a bunch of rework.

10:38.020 --> 10:40.700
It feels much more streamlined and easier to navigate.

10:40.700 --> 10:41.700
Awesome.

10:41.700 --> 10:45.420
It was a sensation that I just had to go hunt for everything and now it seems much more

10:45.420 --> 10:46.420
discoverable.

10:46.420 --> 10:47.420
That's great.

10:47.420 --> 10:48.420
Yeah.

10:48.420 --> 10:51.780
System settings is another example where we've done a lot of iterative design.

10:51.780 --> 10:56.260
Most people don't realize that system settings is actually one of the most complicated pieces

10:56.260 --> 11:01.580
of code we have because each individual page is actually a tiny app.

11:01.580 --> 11:07.700
So system settings is basically a shell around like 120 apps, which is kind of mind boggling

11:07.700 --> 11:08.700
to think about.

11:08.700 --> 11:13.740
And that's why a lot of this work gets done in a very incremental fashion instead of,

11:13.740 --> 11:15.940
you know, all at once and then it's done.

11:15.940 --> 11:19.060
But I'm glad you noticed that, too, because we have definitely done that.

11:19.060 --> 11:24.640
One thing that we're doing over time is rewriting the old system settings pages in QML, which

11:24.640 --> 11:28.520
makes them a lot easier to improve in the future.

11:28.520 --> 11:33.160
It gives us a chance to revisit the user interface for that particular page.

11:33.160 --> 11:37.660
And it also makes those pages usable on plasma mobile, too, because plasma mobile does not

11:37.660 --> 11:43.140
have the ability to use QWidgets based system settings pages, only QML ones.

11:43.140 --> 11:46.020
So we have the convergence aspect there, too.

11:46.020 --> 11:51.380
And over the course of 2020, we have rewritten eight pages in QML and there are a couple

11:51.380 --> 11:56.620
more that are in review and hopefully will be merged within maybe a week or two or something

11:56.620 --> 11:57.740
like that.

11:57.740 --> 11:59.380
So yeah, that's a bunch of stuff.

11:59.380 --> 12:02.820
But we also have a bunch of new features in system settings, too.

12:02.820 --> 12:08.180
We also have one thing that's been really popular among our users is an automatic syncing

12:08.180 --> 12:12.300
system for your KDE app settings to GTK apps.

12:12.300 --> 12:17.820
So like when you change the font size in your KDE apps, it changes the font size in GTK

12:17.820 --> 12:18.820
apps as well.

12:18.820 --> 12:22.940
When you change the color scheme in your KDE apps, it changes the color scheme in GTK apps,

12:22.940 --> 12:23.940
stuff like that.

12:23.940 --> 12:26.500
This used to be a manual process and you'd have to do it yourself.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.660
Now it's automatic.

12:27.660 --> 12:29.620
It just happens on its own.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.260
That's been very well received.

12:31.260 --> 12:35.460
We also have a feature in system settings that lets you highlight settings that you've

12:35.460 --> 12:37.760
changed from their default values.

12:37.760 --> 12:41.740
We did this because people would often say, oh, man, system settings is really complicated.

12:41.740 --> 12:45.020
I tweaked a bunch of stuff and now I don't know what I did.

12:45.020 --> 12:48.620
So we did that so that people could visualize what changes they actually made so that they

12:48.620 --> 12:52.100
could see whether they wanted to keep them or not once they found themselves in that

12:52.100 --> 12:53.100
situation.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.800
And there's tons of polish throughout the stack, too.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.060
This is really neat.

12:58.060 --> 13:02.740
I had not noticed this before, so essentially it marks them almost like with an unread indicator.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.380
And you want to know what's really cool.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.780
You're looking at the orange dot on the sidebar now, right?

13:06.780 --> 13:07.780
Yeah.

13:07.780 --> 13:08.780
Yeah.

13:08.780 --> 13:12.020
So if you click on one of those items that has an orange dot, it will actually highlight

13:12.020 --> 13:16.460
the individual settings on the page that have been changed.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.240
This was a ton of work, by the way.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.180
So it's I'm really happy with it.

13:20.180 --> 13:23.780
Yeah, it looks slick, but you can tell there's some logic behind the scenes there.

13:23.780 --> 13:24.780
Oh, tons.

13:24.780 --> 13:25.780
Yeah.

13:25.780 --> 13:29.760
There's tons of logic because, like I said earlier, every system's settings page is like

13:29.760 --> 13:31.060
a tiny app.

13:31.060 --> 13:36.100
So what this required us to do was rewrite a lot of these pages so that they used a common

13:36.100 --> 13:37.100
base.

13:37.100 --> 13:40.380
Previously, a lot of them were just like literally their own apps.

13:40.380 --> 13:45.980
And now to make this highlight change settings feature work, we created a sort of framework

13:45.980 --> 13:50.520
that they all inherit from so that when you write a new system settings page, you plug

13:50.520 --> 13:54.460
it into this preexisting framework and that feature just works automatically.

13:54.460 --> 14:00.100
And porting all, you know, 100 of those pages to use this thing was a Herculean task.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.980
So I'm really happy that it works as well as it does.

14:02.980 --> 14:03.980
Yeah.

14:03.980 --> 14:07.900
And that is that's a feature now that I will mention that when people I had no idea.

14:07.900 --> 14:10.820
I had noticed that button there, but I hadn't tried it yet.

14:10.820 --> 14:12.940
And I can only imagine the amount of work that went into it.

14:12.940 --> 14:14.500
And that's something I'll tell people to check out.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.860
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

14:15.860 --> 14:19.360
And a really cool thing is that because we've now ported all of these pages to use this

14:19.360 --> 14:23.480
common base, all of the pages now know what their default settings are.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.620
They know how they differ from their default settings.

14:25.620 --> 14:30.900
So this opens up the door for us in the future to add a much requested feature that will

14:30.900 --> 14:34.620
allow you to reset everything to its default settings because all the pages actually know

14:34.620 --> 14:35.820
what those are now.

14:35.820 --> 14:39.060
So we'll be able to do that without having to, like, brute force it by just blowing away

14:39.060 --> 14:40.060
the config files.

14:40.060 --> 14:42.900
You know, the chat room is, you know, the chat room is thinking they think, you know,

14:42.900 --> 14:47.660
what we want now is we want to sync those settings between plasma desktops.

14:47.660 --> 14:48.660
That's what they're thinking.

14:48.660 --> 14:51.040
So this is this is another feature.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.900
And again, it's something that's made possible by the plumbing work that we did for this.

14:54.900 --> 14:59.380
Now that every page knows what settings have been changed from their default values, it

14:59.380 --> 15:03.900
becomes really easy to, you know, reset them, export that.

15:03.900 --> 15:07.980
A syncing feature between plasma desktops would be amazing.

15:07.980 --> 15:11.340
But that, of course, requires a bunch more work on the on the server side.

15:11.340 --> 15:14.780
You need all sorts of sync and deduplication stuff.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.140
And that's a whole nother can of worms.

15:16.140 --> 15:17.140
But that'd be great.

15:17.140 --> 15:18.140
Sure.

15:18.140 --> 15:22.340
So finally, maybe something over next cloud would work, you know, sync file like I could

15:22.340 --> 15:24.780
see a DIY version of that working pretty well.

15:24.780 --> 15:31.060
Is there maybe anything you want to touch on that maybe isn't so user noticeable but

15:31.060 --> 15:34.020
still has been a good improvement, anything on your mind there?

15:34.020 --> 15:38.740
There's another big thing that we did, which is the optional system deintegration throughout

15:38.740 --> 15:40.300
plasma.

15:40.300 --> 15:45.220
This is something that probably nobody will even notice because it's not even on by default

15:45.220 --> 15:46.220
right now.

15:46.220 --> 15:50.540
We're hoping, I believe, to turn it on by default for plasma 521.

15:50.540 --> 15:53.440
But of course, because we're K to E, you can turn it off as well.

15:53.440 --> 15:59.180
But the gist of what's going on here is that we have refactored the way plasma starts itself

15:59.180 --> 16:06.300
and starts its components and starts apps to make use of systems, the slices and C groups

16:06.300 --> 16:07.340
and units.

16:07.340 --> 16:10.780
So now everything happens in a predictable order.

16:10.780 --> 16:13.820
Things can be parallelized without them running into each other.

16:13.820 --> 16:16.460
This means that startup times will be improved.

16:16.460 --> 16:19.980
This means that we have things that are scoped properly.

16:19.980 --> 16:24.380
So when you log out of your session, everything quits rather than having dangling processes.

16:24.380 --> 16:31.060
It means that we're able to group an app's individual child processes into that app itself.

16:31.060 --> 16:35.100
This is especially relevant for apps in Flatpaks and Electron apps.

16:35.100 --> 16:39.060
Like if you run Discord or something and you look at the process tree, it has like 10 processes.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.060
Yeah.

16:40.060 --> 16:42.340
So it's sort of hard to tell what it's actually doing.

16:42.340 --> 16:49.660
And when you now with this new feature activated, when you launch Discord using plasma, it will

16:49.660 --> 16:51.540
be scoped in its own C group.

16:51.540 --> 16:55.060
So all of its child processes will be able to be associated with the parent.

16:55.060 --> 16:58.700
And we can now have an applications view that says, hey, here's Discord.

16:58.700 --> 17:03.740
And it combines together all of the different resource usages of the child processes.

17:03.740 --> 17:04.740
That is so cool.

17:04.740 --> 17:05.740
I know.

17:05.740 --> 17:06.740
Isn't it great?

17:06.740 --> 17:07.740
It's super cool.

17:07.740 --> 17:10.700
This leads me to another really cool thing, which is the new system monitoring app.

17:10.700 --> 17:15.580
This is something that we have released as a standalone app and it's going to be, I believe,

17:15.580 --> 17:19.540
included in Plasma 5.21 by default, but we basically rewrote KSysGuard, which is our

17:19.540 --> 17:21.680
old system monitoring app.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.820
And the new one is now fully C group and slice aware.

17:24.820 --> 17:27.500
So it has that nice applications page.

17:27.500 --> 17:31.620
It has beautiful, pretty graphs that use a new hardware accelerated graphing framework

17:31.620 --> 17:34.940
that we wrote that now is used for other things.

17:34.940 --> 17:37.100
And it's 100% customizable too.

17:37.100 --> 17:41.620
So this actually reminds me of what you said before about Plasma being like a power tool

17:41.620 --> 17:43.240
used by pros.

17:43.240 --> 17:49.620
And I'm glad you mentioned that because this is like my personal idea of what Plasma should

17:49.620 --> 17:50.620
be.

17:50.620 --> 17:56.380
This is like a productivity tool for people who use their computers to make a living.

17:56.380 --> 18:00.280
And we designed the system monitoring app so that it's super customizable.

18:00.280 --> 18:06.460
If you monitor like a fleet of machines or if you monitor specific aspects of your system,

18:06.460 --> 18:11.620
you can actually customize the pages on this new system monitoring app in a 100% granular

18:11.620 --> 18:14.800
way to make it show exactly what you want.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.580
And because it uses this fancy charting framework, not only is it customizable and powerful,

18:18.580 --> 18:20.080
it's also really pretty too.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.780
So that's a pretty nice improvement.

18:22.780 --> 18:23.780
That's great.

18:23.780 --> 18:24.780
Oh yeah.

18:24.780 --> 18:25.780
Wow.

18:25.780 --> 18:32.740
So that's probably one of my favorite things to see is that those kinds of tools are still

18:32.740 --> 18:37.260
getting investment that they're not just sitting around and just, you know, ah, good enough.

18:37.260 --> 18:40.460
I really could have seen that argument made for something like KSYSGuard.

18:40.460 --> 18:41.460
Oh, it's good enough.

18:41.460 --> 18:45.180
If somebody wants something more, they'll go use something on the command line.

18:45.180 --> 18:47.740
One of those annoying top things we keep recommending.

18:47.740 --> 18:48.740
Yeah.

18:48.740 --> 18:50.620
I don't believe in good enough personally.

18:50.620 --> 18:52.960
I think everything can always be improved.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.780
So where does 2021 take us?

18:55.780 --> 19:01.180
It doesn't sound like anything too radical as planned, but more just continued investments.

19:01.180 --> 19:02.180
Yeah.

19:02.180 --> 19:06.500
A lot of what I've told you is stuff that users don't have yet because it's just been

19:06.500 --> 19:11.380
merged into Gitmaster and it's planned for Plasma 5.21.

19:11.380 --> 19:14.540
And that's going to be released in a few months in the early part of 2021.

19:14.540 --> 19:20.020
So to a large extent, getting this stuff to users is what's in 2021.

19:20.020 --> 19:24.660
Personally there are two things that I am really looking forward to for 2021.

19:24.660 --> 19:30.380
One is the remainder of our visual overhaul, which I believe it or not didn't even start

19:30.380 --> 19:35.780
to talk about, but we have throughout 2020 been landing all kinds of visual overhauls

19:35.780 --> 19:36.780
of other things too.

19:36.780 --> 19:42.300
Not just the system tray, but we've been doing Plasma, our breeze theme for apps, technically

19:42.300 --> 19:44.940
speaking lives in Plasma.

19:44.940 --> 19:49.260
It's in like a Plasma aligned release cycle product.

19:49.260 --> 19:52.100
So that's been happening there as well.

19:52.100 --> 19:56.460
And I think we're going to continue to do this and really make people think that KDE

19:56.460 --> 20:00.220
apps look amazing in 2021.

20:00.220 --> 20:03.820
One of the remaining complaints that I feel like I kept hearing about people saying, oh,

20:03.820 --> 20:08.940
it's lightweight now and it's really powerful, but KDE apps are really ugly.

20:08.940 --> 20:15.820
So we hear that and we're working on it very quickly to improve the look of KDE apps.

20:15.820 --> 20:20.580
You'll see that in 5.21 and Plasma 5.22 as well.

20:20.580 --> 20:24.540
Another thing that I think we're going to see in a big way in the year 2021 is more

20:24.540 --> 20:25.700
Wayland stuff.

20:25.700 --> 20:29.380
2020 was a huge year for our Wayland session.

20:29.380 --> 20:30.780
We got tons and tons of stuff.

20:30.780 --> 20:35.860
We got screencasting, we got shared clipboard support, we got middle click paste support,

20:35.860 --> 20:40.800
we got multi GPU output support, screen rotation, task manager window thumbnails, the global

20:40.800 --> 20:45.220
menu now works on Wayland, we got high DPI screenshots with Spectacle, we have the virtual

20:45.220 --> 20:50.580
keyboard working for GTK apps, and we have configurable mouse and touchpad scroll speed

20:50.580 --> 20:54.540
on Wayland, which is also a thing that you don't have on X11.

20:54.540 --> 20:55.740
So it was huge.

20:55.740 --> 20:58.300
It was gigantic.

20:58.300 --> 21:03.380
Actually for me, in 2019, Wayland was like a buggy mess.

21:03.380 --> 21:05.420
Our Wayland session, I just couldn't use it.

21:05.420 --> 21:07.500
It felt like a construction zone.

21:07.500 --> 21:16.140
Whereas today, in the end of 2020, I can almost use the Plasma Wayland session for day-to-day

21:16.140 --> 21:17.140
stuff.

21:17.140 --> 21:19.940
They're just like little mini annoyances and problems.

21:19.940 --> 21:24.380
So I feel like there's been a quantum leap in our Wayland compatibility.

21:24.380 --> 21:30.740
And I feel like in 2021, we're probably going to see people start using it by default.

21:30.740 --> 21:36.580
Fedora, for example, in Fedora 34, they're planning on using the Plasma Wayland session

21:36.580 --> 21:37.960
by default.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.820
They're shipping it to users and turning it on by default.

21:40.820 --> 21:42.780
So you have to opt into X11.

21:42.780 --> 21:45.420
That's how much they think it's come.

21:45.420 --> 21:48.420
And you know, Fedora, they're very technology-first forward people.

21:48.420 --> 21:52.860
They really like being on the bleeding edge, but they think it's ready.

21:52.860 --> 21:56.420
So that is, I think, a good vote of confidence.

21:56.420 --> 22:01.060
And I think we're really going to see Wayland become totally mainstream in Plasma in 2021.

22:01.060 --> 22:02.060
Wow.

22:02.060 --> 22:07.740
Well, you know, I have been testing it on Fedora Plasma, on my X1 Carbon.

22:07.740 --> 22:12.780
And it works really well for me unless I start using an external display.

22:12.780 --> 22:16.380
And then it gets a little wonky when I have both screens going.

22:16.380 --> 22:19.400
But otherwise, I can pretty much use it all day long.

22:19.400 --> 22:23.420
And I feel like it seems a little bit smoother to me.

22:23.420 --> 22:24.740
Yeah, it should be.

22:24.740 --> 22:27.700
So I like it.

22:27.700 --> 22:31.300
I am really looking forward to 2021.

22:31.300 --> 22:36.140
Like Jitty in the chat room said, that it's just kind of a no-brainer these days to use

22:36.140 --> 22:37.140
Plasma.

22:37.140 --> 22:38.620
Oh, I'm happy to hear that.

22:38.620 --> 22:42.140
Personally, I feel the same way.

22:42.140 --> 22:44.180
That's the way I want everybody to see it.

22:44.180 --> 22:46.540
You know, I think you shouldn't have to compromise to use our stuff.

22:46.540 --> 22:47.540
It should be lightweight.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.240
It should have lots of features.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.360
It should be stable without a lot of bugs.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.220
And it should be beautiful.

22:53.220 --> 22:54.220
That's my goal.

22:54.220 --> 22:55.220
And powerful.

22:55.220 --> 22:57.660
And, you know, I really feel like it's gotten there.

22:57.660 --> 23:01.180
You really could set it up in just, you know, pretty much any distribution set by default

23:01.180 --> 23:02.180
and use it that way.

23:02.180 --> 23:07.940
Or you could spend, like I spent about a day slowly going through and just setting something,

23:07.940 --> 23:10.380
using it a little bit like that and then adjusting it.

23:10.380 --> 23:13.980
And after about that day, I never touch it again.

23:13.980 --> 23:15.660
And it just stays that way forever.

23:15.660 --> 23:16.660
Awesome.

23:16.660 --> 23:17.660
It's great.

23:17.660 --> 23:18.660
I'm curious.

23:18.660 --> 23:19.980
What do you make to your plasma?

23:19.980 --> 23:21.500
It kind of depends.

23:21.500 --> 23:26.220
I, for some reason, didn't totally like the new taskbar and all of that.

23:26.220 --> 23:31.020
And I ended up trying Latte Dock and putting it in the plasma mode.

23:31.020 --> 23:33.720
So it's still more like a bar.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.380
And I just kind of have liked that a little bit better.

23:36.380 --> 23:40.840
Although on some of my plasma setups, the majority of them, I just have a standard taskbar

23:40.840 --> 23:46.420
at the bottom, you know, Kubuntu style, and have just left it like that on the work machines.

23:46.420 --> 23:47.420
And it's been fine.

23:47.420 --> 23:49.920
Even on the laptop, I like to play around a little bit.

23:49.920 --> 23:53.540
And so I went for kind of a smaller dock down there.

23:53.540 --> 23:55.300
It doesn't go all the way edge to edge.

23:55.300 --> 23:59.340
It's more in the middle of the screen, but it doesn't do all the fancy like magnification

23:59.340 --> 24:00.340
stuff.

24:00.340 --> 24:01.380
It looks like a plasma panel.

24:01.380 --> 24:02.660
You wouldn't even know it's Latte Dock.

24:02.660 --> 24:04.020
Yeah, it integrates really well.

24:04.020 --> 24:05.780
I know a lot of people love Latte Dock.

24:05.780 --> 24:06.780
I've liked it.

24:06.780 --> 24:07.780
Yeah.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.380
I may try going back sometime, you know, but it's worked pretty well for me.

24:10.380 --> 24:14.220
And then of course, I try different dark themes these days.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.220
I try out a couple of different ones.

24:15.220 --> 24:19.100
I really like how things now work with the global theme to just change it there instead

24:19.100 --> 24:25.540
of having to go to each individual colors and icons and application appearances, window

24:25.540 --> 24:27.940
frame appearances, just the global theme now.

24:27.940 --> 24:28.940
Yeah, that's great.

24:28.940 --> 24:30.740
That's our intention.

24:30.740 --> 24:35.620
As a fan of that, I actually have to mention in Plasma 5.21, we're shipping a new global

24:35.620 --> 24:40.740
theme called Breeze Twilight, which has a dark color scheme for Plasma and a light color

24:40.740 --> 24:41.740
scheme for apps.

24:41.740 --> 24:42.740
Oh, interesting.

24:42.740 --> 24:43.740
Hmm.

24:43.740 --> 24:44.740
That's great.

24:44.740 --> 24:49.820
Well, Nate, I could go on all day, but we have some tuxes to get to you.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.460
I really appreciate you coming on.

24:51.460 --> 24:55.900
And I also really, really appreciate and thank you for all the hard work you do documenting

24:55.900 --> 24:57.020
all of these improvements.

24:57.020 --> 25:02.740
We will have a link, of course, to your This Week in KDE posts.

25:02.740 --> 25:03.740
What do you have?

25:03.740 --> 25:04.740
Is that the title?

25:04.740 --> 25:05.740
Is that the official title?

25:05.740 --> 25:07.540
Yeah, it used to be Usability and Productivity back when that was a thing, but now it's This

25:07.540 --> 25:08.540
Week in KDE.

25:08.540 --> 25:09.540
Yeah.

25:09.540 --> 25:10.540
And you know what?

25:10.540 --> 25:11.540
It's not always just Plasma.

25:11.540 --> 25:15.660
I mean, there's sometimes other things in the KDE ecosystem in there as well.

25:15.660 --> 25:19.020
And I want to stress that this is my view of the project.

25:19.020 --> 25:21.260
KDE is so vast.

25:21.260 --> 25:25.780
We have like hundreds of apps, so I can only follow a small percentage of things.

25:25.780 --> 25:30.940
So there's always much more stuff going on than what I can document, but it's like Plasma

25:30.940 --> 25:35.460
plus what I consider to be sort of the core apps that most people are going to experience.

25:35.460 --> 25:36.460
Also we should say happy birthday.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.060
I think Kate just hit 20 years old.

25:38.060 --> 25:39.060
It did.

25:39.060 --> 25:40.380
So happy birthday to Kate.

25:40.380 --> 25:41.380
I just reinstalled it.

25:41.380 --> 25:42.740
I'm almost drinking the USA.

25:42.740 --> 25:43.740
That's right.

25:43.740 --> 25:48.780
The chat room is joking that the KDE Christmas party is spelled with a K. I like that.

25:48.780 --> 25:49.780
That tickles me.

25:49.780 --> 25:50.780
All right, Nate.

25:50.780 --> 25:51.780
Thank you very much for joining us.

25:51.780 --> 25:52.780
Thank you for having me.

25:52.780 --> 25:53.780
It was great.

25:53.780 --> 25:54.780
Yep.

25:54.780 --> 25:55.780
Keep up the great work and happy holidays.

25:55.780 --> 25:56.780
Thanks a lot.

25:56.780 --> 25:57.780
You too.

25:57.780 --> 25:58.780
All right, Wes.

25:58.780 --> 26:03.380
Well, I'll let you update your Plasma desktop over there while I take a moment and take

26:03.380 --> 26:10.800
a break here and say thank you to Linode at linode.com slash unplugged.

26:10.800 --> 26:14.060
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

26:14.060 --> 26:16.660
Try spinning up a server on their cloud infrastructure.

26:16.660 --> 26:20.580
They make it really simple to get a Linux server up in the cloud in seconds and they

26:20.580 --> 26:22.960
have 11 data centers around the world.

26:22.960 --> 26:27.560
They also have features like object storage and node balancers and a dashboard to manage

26:27.560 --> 26:31.060
all of this and API that makes it possible to do it all from the command line, which

26:31.060 --> 26:32.820
is actually how I do it.

26:32.820 --> 26:34.260
It's not as nerdy as it sounds.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.980
It's pretty easy and straightforward.

26:35.980 --> 26:38.900
But they also have, well, brilliant support.

26:38.900 --> 26:43.600
Mr. S writes into the show and he says, I was introduced to Linode based on your mentions

26:43.600 --> 26:44.600
on the show.

26:44.600 --> 26:49.260
I am not yet a paying customer of Linode, so having a somewhat particularly interesting

26:49.260 --> 26:54.300
challenge with an NGO I am volunteering for, I contacted Linode support.

26:54.300 --> 26:58.900
Now mind you, this was after I contacted several major cloud providers, some of which who I'm

26:58.900 --> 27:03.260
a paying customer, some who completely ignored me, others just simply brushed me off.

27:03.260 --> 27:06.080
But Linode was the complete opposite.

27:06.080 --> 27:10.560
Even after understanding that I'm not a paying customer and you know, to be honest, my particular

27:10.560 --> 27:13.320
problem won't generate any revenue for them.

27:13.320 --> 27:18.260
They went above and beyond to try to assist me coming up with a resolution for the sole

27:18.260 --> 27:20.200
purpose of doing good.

27:20.200 --> 27:23.220
Their support team was just brilliant, Mr. S says.

27:23.220 --> 27:27.540
He goes on to say they were responsive, kind, to the point and above all, with a genuine

27:27.540 --> 27:30.420
will to assist and resolve problems.

27:30.420 --> 27:34.900
I'm dealing with a major cloud service and their support teams on a daily basis and Linode's

27:34.900 --> 27:38.180
support team, based on my experience, really stands above and beyond.

27:38.180 --> 27:40.220
Kind regards, Mr. S.

27:40.220 --> 27:44.420
And I remember when I had that feeling too, when I was like, wow, you stuck with this

27:44.420 --> 27:46.540
problem when you didn't have to.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.420
And it really feels good when somebody goes above and beyond.

27:49.420 --> 27:50.780
And that's what Linode's support team does.

27:50.780 --> 27:54.940
And Mr. S, he was, he felt so impacted by it, he bothered to write in.

27:54.940 --> 27:55.940
I mean, think about that.

27:55.940 --> 27:59.340
When have you, you know, he had to take a minute to actually write that email to us

27:59.340 --> 28:00.620
to share that experience.

28:00.620 --> 28:02.300
That's how much it hit him.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.300
And that's Linode.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.460
That's one of the reasons I love them is they're independent.

28:05.460 --> 28:06.540
I get why they do this.

28:06.540 --> 28:08.220
They do this for a love of Linux.

28:08.220 --> 28:11.200
That's why they've sponsored projects like Kubuntu.

28:11.200 --> 28:15.280
That's why they sponsor this here podcast and other Linux creators out there, because

28:15.280 --> 28:19.340
they want to make it possible for independent content to give media about this away for

28:19.340 --> 28:20.340
free.

28:20.340 --> 28:21.340
That's part of what they're doing here.

28:21.340 --> 28:23.020
And it's just, it's a great company all around.

28:23.020 --> 28:27.760
Plus, you get that $100 credit when you go to linode.com slash unplugged.

28:27.760 --> 28:31.740
Go there and get yourself a special something, linode.com slash unplugged.

28:31.740 --> 28:35.260
And a big thanks to Linode for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

28:35.260 --> 28:37.920
All right.

28:37.920 --> 28:40.740
So I surprised Wes the other day.

28:40.740 --> 28:42.460
Are you ready for this, Mr. Payne?

28:42.460 --> 28:44.060
Oh, you sure did.

28:44.060 --> 28:45.700
And this was a lot of fun.

28:45.700 --> 28:50.980
So we were sitting in here just a day or two or three or eight ago, and we were doing one

28:50.980 --> 28:55.020
of the things we do, podcast, and I had a moment to surprise Wes.

28:55.020 --> 29:00.180
So I turned the mics on and I kind of didn't really tell Wes what was going on.

29:00.180 --> 29:02.340
I was just like, come on, sit down.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.220
Let's open up the Linux Unplugged profile.

29:04.220 --> 29:05.220
He's kind of looking around.

29:05.220 --> 29:08.180
He's thinking to himself, do I need to prepare?

29:08.180 --> 29:13.780
Just kind of going along, which was great, because it worked out perfect for a special

29:13.780 --> 29:16.700
secret Santa surprise we had for Mr. Wes Payne.

29:16.700 --> 29:21.420
You know what I love about you, Wes, is that we have been going at this all day, and I've

29:21.420 --> 29:24.460
told you all day long I wanted to record a Linux Unplugged segment, but you haven't actually

29:24.460 --> 29:28.300
really even bothered asking me until just now what we're actually talking about.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.020
I figured you'd tell me when you were ready.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.020
I am.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.700
But I forgot the box.

29:34.700 --> 29:35.700
So hold on.

29:35.700 --> 29:36.700
You stay right there.

29:36.700 --> 29:37.700
You don't move.

29:37.700 --> 29:38.700
I'll get the box.

29:38.700 --> 29:39.700
It's my treat, Wes.

29:39.700 --> 29:40.700
You're fine.

29:40.700 --> 29:41.700
You stay comfortable.

29:41.700 --> 29:42.700
I am comfortable.

29:42.700 --> 29:43.700
Behind the red curtain.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.660
I didn't realize you got this indoor jacuzzi, but I don't know why you put it on.

29:46.660 --> 29:47.660
You hold it for me.

29:47.660 --> 29:48.660
Oh, it's heavy.

29:48.660 --> 29:49.660
Yeah.

29:49.660 --> 29:54.340
There you go, because guess what, Wes?

29:54.340 --> 29:57.300
It is a surprise secret Santa for Wes Payne.

29:57.300 --> 29:58.300
What?

29:58.300 --> 29:59.300
That's right.

29:59.300 --> 30:00.300
It's a Christmas miracle.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.300
What?

30:01.300 --> 30:02.300
It's a Christmas miracle.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.300
Ooh.

30:03.300 --> 30:08.660
An unplugged miracle right here on the show.

30:08.660 --> 30:12.420
So go ahead and unwrap your box and tell us what it is.

30:12.420 --> 30:15.020
Well, first of all, it's some lovely wrapping paper.

30:15.020 --> 30:16.020
Yeah.

30:16.020 --> 30:18.580
I think that might be Hadia's finest, actually.

30:18.580 --> 30:19.980
Yeah.

30:19.980 --> 30:21.180
You got the wife's finest right there.

30:21.180 --> 30:22.520
You don't have to save it.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.520
You can rip into it.

30:23.520 --> 30:27.180
It's fine.

30:27.180 --> 30:28.180
I like that.

30:28.180 --> 30:30.040
I like that.

30:30.040 --> 30:34.540
So Wes has been a huge, huge help in the transition to Jupiter broadcasting going independent.

30:34.540 --> 30:39.900
I thought to myself, what can I get Wes for Christmas that would convey our appreciation

30:39.900 --> 30:42.580
for how damn hard he's worked for us?

30:42.580 --> 30:46.860
And you know, I thought about and I thought pretty much nothing because I can't afford

30:46.860 --> 30:47.860
to do anything.

30:47.860 --> 30:51.700
So I thought, okay, well, what I need here.

30:51.700 --> 30:52.700
Here, I got you a knife.

30:52.700 --> 30:53.700
Oh, thank you.

30:53.700 --> 30:54.700
You planned ahead.

30:54.700 --> 30:57.020
So I was like, because, you know, I'd like to get him something, you know, something

30:57.020 --> 30:58.180
to reflect the appreciation.

30:58.180 --> 31:00.700
I think the audience can tell you work really hard for us.

31:00.700 --> 31:03.620
And I'm sure they'd like to see you get something.

31:03.620 --> 31:09.580
So I started thinking, well, since I can't afford anything, what I need is a Secret Santa.

31:09.580 --> 31:14.540
So I emailed our friends over at Synology and I said, would you like to play Secret

31:14.540 --> 31:17.060
Santa for Wes Payne?

31:17.060 --> 31:18.060
So what you got here?

31:18.060 --> 31:21.860
And then I think I know which one it is, but I'm not actually sure because they just sent

31:21.860 --> 31:23.140
this to us.

31:23.140 --> 31:26.380
This is a Synology for you forever.

31:26.380 --> 31:27.380
It's not a review unit.

31:27.380 --> 31:31.420
It's keeps just for you for keeps and this is definitely one I would get myself.

31:31.420 --> 31:32.420
I can tell you that.

31:32.420 --> 31:34.660
Oh, it's got a handle and look at this.

31:34.660 --> 31:35.660
All right.

31:35.660 --> 31:36.780
What's the model on the box?

31:36.780 --> 31:38.780
This is the DS 920 plus.

31:38.780 --> 31:39.780
Yeah.

31:39.780 --> 31:40.780
Okay.

31:40.780 --> 31:42.660
This is the one with a little bit more memory so you can run some services on it.

31:42.660 --> 31:44.260
Scalableness for demanding environments.

31:44.260 --> 31:45.900
Hey, that sounds like me.

31:45.900 --> 31:46.900
Yeah.

31:46.900 --> 31:54.300
So the DS 920 plus has a SSD cache, but also one of the things that we were talking about

31:54.300 --> 31:58.340
is, you know, with this guy, it's got four core processor.

31:58.340 --> 32:01.340
You can put some serious applications on this thing.

32:01.340 --> 32:02.340
Yeah.

32:02.340 --> 32:07.820
ASNI support, expandable storage in RAM and hey, two NICs on board.

32:07.820 --> 32:08.820
Awesome.

32:08.820 --> 32:10.620
Also supports running virtual machines.

32:10.620 --> 32:11.620
What?

32:11.620 --> 32:12.620
Yeah.

32:12.620 --> 32:13.620
So you can run some VMs on it.

32:13.620 --> 32:16.380
Because I know, you know, you haven't really decided on what you're going to do for your

32:16.380 --> 32:18.380
home setup since you got in your new place.

32:18.380 --> 32:19.380
And I thought...

32:19.380 --> 32:20.380
That's true.

32:20.380 --> 32:22.020
This simplifies things significantly.

32:22.020 --> 32:24.180
And you know, I'm a self-hosting kind of guy.

32:24.180 --> 32:25.500
So this just seemed...

32:25.500 --> 32:27.460
You were worried about my cloud usage.

32:27.460 --> 32:28.460
Yeah.

32:28.460 --> 32:29.460
Yeah.

32:29.460 --> 32:33.980
Well, Angela's had a Synology for like seven years and it has run flawlessly.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.740
So I thought, you know, it'd be just enough where you could mess with it.

32:36.740 --> 32:40.140
But also if you get busy with the day job, you're not going to have to worry about it.

32:40.140 --> 32:43.900
It'll just sit there and run forever, you know, so it's best of both worlds.

32:43.900 --> 32:44.900
Well this is amazing.

32:44.900 --> 32:45.900
Isn't it great?

32:45.900 --> 32:46.900
Thank you Synology.

32:46.900 --> 32:47.900
Yeah.

32:47.900 --> 32:48.900
Wow.

32:48.900 --> 32:49.900
Fantastic.

32:49.900 --> 32:50.900
It was really cool.

32:50.900 --> 32:52.020
You know, it was one of those things that just worked out perfectly.

32:52.020 --> 32:53.460
So there you go, Wes.

32:53.460 --> 32:55.380
Merry Christmas and enjoy your new disk station.

32:55.380 --> 32:56.460
It's a Christmas project.

32:56.460 --> 32:57.460
What more could I ask for?

32:57.460 --> 32:58.460
Yeah.

32:58.460 --> 32:59.460
You know what else is?

32:59.460 --> 33:02.660
Now when you get it going and stuff, you come back, you have to tell us how it works.

33:02.660 --> 33:03.660
Deal.

33:03.660 --> 33:06.100
An unplugged Christmas miracle.

33:06.100 --> 33:10.100
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

33:10.100 --> 33:16.660
So it was the DS920 Plus, and I think they also put a couple of disks in there too, right?

33:16.660 --> 33:17.980
Oh, they did.

33:17.980 --> 33:18.980
Thank you Synology.

33:18.980 --> 33:23.500
They put two six terabyte Seagate IronWolf drives in there.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.500
That'll get you off to a good start.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.620
Yeah, right?

33:26.620 --> 33:29.820
You know what I love about this DS920 Plus?

33:29.820 --> 33:30.820
You know what I love about it?

33:30.820 --> 33:33.760
It uses ButterFS.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.340
And they're not shy about it.

33:35.340 --> 33:38.660
Actually they've got a whole page on their website talking about the benefits of ButterFS

33:38.660 --> 33:43.180
and how it helps make a robust product for you, which that's pretty neat.

33:43.180 --> 33:47.180
So this thing's got four gigs of RAM, expandable up to eight gigs.

33:47.180 --> 33:50.220
It's got two gigabit NICs on it.

33:50.220 --> 33:52.420
It's got an eSATA port.

33:52.420 --> 33:55.220
It has two USB 3.0 ports.

33:55.220 --> 34:00.340
I mean, this could probably last you a little while is what I was thinking, you know?

34:00.340 --> 34:01.900
Yeah, that's what's nice.

34:01.900 --> 34:05.820
It came with four gigs of RAM, but that's expandable up to eight.

34:05.820 --> 34:08.780
It came with two drives, but there's four slots in there and I think you can go up to

34:08.780 --> 34:14.220
like nine drives if you buy the Synology expansion unit, which I probably won't even need that

34:14.220 --> 34:18.260
much because, you know, drives just keep getting bigger and bigger.

34:18.260 --> 34:24.260
And it's got a pretty nifty little 10 watt Intel Celeron processor in there, which is

34:24.260 --> 34:29.260
actually kind of similar to the processor I've got in my Linux powered router at home.

34:29.260 --> 34:31.780
So it fits neatly into the family.

34:31.780 --> 34:33.200
That's cool.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.300
What's the setup process like?

34:34.300 --> 34:36.900
Because you're not like hooking a screen up to this than a keyboard, right?

34:36.900 --> 34:37.900
No, no.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.340
You know, unboxed at night, nicely packaged in there.

34:40.340 --> 34:44.260
The disks were actually already in the unit so I didn't have to do anything there.

34:44.260 --> 34:46.260
Disks in there, locked up tight, ready to go.

34:46.260 --> 34:49.420
So pretty much just found a spot for it, attach the power, plugged in.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.780
It's got two NICs, which is awesome.

34:52.780 --> 34:56.100
And then by default, before you've got it configured or anything, they've got a nice

34:56.100 --> 35:02.980
little quick connect service online, as well as a few other things like find.synology.com.

35:02.980 --> 35:06.720
And when you first boot it up, the firmware that it starts with goes and talks to their

35:06.720 --> 35:10.300
servers and sort of advertises like, hey, you've got an unconfigured Synology here.

35:10.300 --> 35:14.000
So all you have to do is go to find.synology.com.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.780
It does a little magic behind the scenes to locate where on your local network, like what's

35:17.780 --> 35:18.780
the new local IP.

35:18.780 --> 35:22.780
So you don't have to go browse to your router or do ARP scans or just ping around the network

35:22.780 --> 35:24.500
to try to find where this new box is.

35:24.500 --> 35:29.260
And then it pulls it up right for you, prompts you to upgrade, install, and then gives you

35:29.260 --> 35:32.300
a little screen to set up your first admin user and start configuring things.

35:32.300 --> 35:34.460
And it was just super painless.

35:34.460 --> 35:39.020
I mean, I have the know-how to find things on my network or go through whatever technical

35:39.020 --> 35:43.500
setup that I need, but just none of that was necessary all in the web browser.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.540
Could you do it over SSH if you wanted though?

35:45.540 --> 35:49.620
I don't know if you can do the setup over SSH, but once you've got it up and running,

35:49.620 --> 35:53.180
turning on Telnet or SSH is super simple.

35:53.180 --> 35:56.740
It doesn't feel like they're trying to hide any of the Linux underpinnings.

35:56.740 --> 35:57.740
It's not like a...

35:57.740 --> 36:03.380
Yes, it is a black box in some sense, but it just doesn't feel that way with all the

36:03.380 --> 36:06.900
applications that are available, with all the features that are available.

36:06.900 --> 36:10.780
Really what stood out to me was that this is clearly a robust and well-developed platform.

36:10.780 --> 36:15.740
Yeah, I would imagine because like I mentioned, Angela's had one now for, I mean, it's got

36:15.740 --> 36:17.700
to be nearly eight years actually.

36:17.700 --> 36:26.100
And I logged into it around Thanksgiving and did an update and everything just worked.

36:26.100 --> 36:29.940
I told her, I said, you know, there's got to be almost a zero chance that this thing

36:29.940 --> 36:32.900
isn't going to break because nobody's touched that thing in years.

36:32.900 --> 36:37.860
It went way too long and it just did it like a champ.

36:37.860 --> 36:40.100
How's the noise level on yours?

36:40.100 --> 36:41.580
Not bad so far.

36:41.580 --> 36:46.440
I mean, my apartment's not the quietest to be clear, but they've got actual configuration

36:46.440 --> 36:47.440
for that.

36:47.440 --> 36:50.820
So if you don't mind a little more heat on your device, maybe that affects the length

36:50.820 --> 36:53.360
of life, hard to say.

36:53.360 --> 36:57.620
But it's all configurable in the settings, so you can set like full fans on all the time.

36:57.620 --> 37:02.500
You can set it to a slightly louder adaptive fan mode or maximize quiet mode.

37:02.500 --> 37:05.940
You can also, which is nice, so after the first night I plugged it in, going to bed,

37:05.940 --> 37:09.940
I realized like, oh, where I've got my router, I just put it in the area I've got like my

37:09.940 --> 37:15.860
router and my wifi and all the networking stuff, all the infrastructure you might say.

37:15.860 --> 37:19.740
And I can almost see that bright blue LED when I'm laying in bed.

37:19.740 --> 37:22.260
I was like, okay, well, maybe I'm going to have to rethink this.

37:22.260 --> 37:27.500
But that was before I discovered you can totally configure that in the UI, no problem, from

37:27.500 --> 37:32.280
very dim to very bright or just all the way off, which is just another little sign I think

37:32.280 --> 37:36.420
of like they've been through this before, they've iterated on these platforms and they've

37:36.420 --> 37:39.100
figured out a lot of what you might need.

37:39.100 --> 37:41.780
That's nice, you can just turn it off even.

37:41.780 --> 37:43.340
That's pretty cool.

37:43.340 --> 37:47.720
The other part that impressed me was that, so they've got a quick connect technology

37:47.720 --> 37:51.180
where if you have like a Synology account, they'll run a proxy for you.

37:51.180 --> 37:55.060
You can log in there and then, you know, discover your Synology, go talk to it without having

37:55.060 --> 37:57.940
to actually forward ports on your network.

37:57.940 --> 38:01.340
You know, kind of common these days, but a nice service to have if you just don't want

38:01.340 --> 38:05.660
to expose your home network or don't have that technical know how.

38:05.660 --> 38:11.640
But if you don't want that, they've also got automation in place to talk to all kinds of

38:11.640 --> 38:13.960
different router brands and firmware.

38:13.960 --> 38:17.920
So first it checks to see if you've got UPnP enabled and it'll try to forward ports that

38:17.920 --> 38:20.540
way if you don't do a quick connect thing.

38:20.540 --> 38:25.300
But if you don't do that, you can choose your router brand and then it's going to go like,

38:25.300 --> 38:26.360
you give it your credentials.

38:26.360 --> 38:30.340
It logs in and basically goes through the web UI or APIs if they have them and sets

38:30.340 --> 38:31.340
up its port forwards.

38:31.340 --> 38:34.540
And then if that doesn't work, they've got online documentation with a whole bunch of

38:34.540 --> 38:37.540
router information for various brands about how to do it too.

38:37.540 --> 38:41.900
So it's kind of neat that they've got robust security support and upgrades and monitoring

38:41.900 --> 38:47.060
situations, SNMP support for instance, if you're running this in a business environment.

38:47.060 --> 38:51.700
And they've got helpers for your mom or dad who needs help getting it exposed so they

38:51.700 --> 38:53.380
can go see it when they're visiting you.

38:53.380 --> 38:56.700
You know, I kind of was chuckling when you were talking about it because I'm like, oh,

38:56.700 --> 38:59.480
I wonder how it handled your custom Linux router.

38:59.480 --> 39:05.560
But then I was thinking, but also being able to do that means that my mom could buy one

39:05.560 --> 39:09.500
of these and she could stop paying for cloud storage and she could have it right there

39:09.500 --> 39:13.380
at her house because she works with large graphics files and it's a constant challenge

39:13.380 --> 39:14.960
for her.

39:14.960 --> 39:19.060
But I also, while I could go over and set it up, I really would like getting her something

39:19.060 --> 39:21.100
that she could just do herself.

39:21.100 --> 39:23.180
I think she'd feel more empowered by that too.

39:23.180 --> 39:27.780
How did it handle, so with your setup, you just open up any ports you want or choose

39:27.780 --> 39:28.780
not to.

39:28.780 --> 39:30.580
I mean, you don't probably even need to bother with that, I would imagine.

39:30.580 --> 39:31.580
Yeah.

39:31.580 --> 39:33.620
I mean, it kind of depends on how you do, you know, your setup.

39:33.620 --> 39:37.140
Some folks just have a VPN and then VPN back to their house or you can forward things.

39:37.140 --> 39:39.700
So far I've not forwarded it because I don't know that I need to.

39:39.700 --> 39:41.660
I've got a couple other gateways on my router box.

39:41.660 --> 39:44.740
So for right now it just lives totally on my land.

39:44.740 --> 39:49.380
I think I will try the quick connect stuff just to give it a go.

39:49.380 --> 39:52.920
I could also see in the future where maybe some of those applications and services move

39:52.920 --> 39:57.440
over to the Synology, like it becomes the VPN host and maybe that's when you'd change

39:57.440 --> 39:59.660
some of the firewall rules.

39:59.660 --> 40:00.660
Yes.

40:00.660 --> 40:06.180
That's also pretty neat because it's got both support for virtualization and running Docker.

40:06.180 --> 40:12.500
So I loaded up a Fedora 33 box on there to give that a shot and it just pops open a VNC

40:12.500 --> 40:13.860
window right in your web browser too.

40:13.860 --> 40:16.240
So it was really easy to get that configured.

40:16.240 --> 40:21.440
And then on the Docker side of things, I got Jellyfin going, I loaded up a couple of media

40:21.440 --> 40:24.540
files to test things out and it worked no problem.

40:24.540 --> 40:28.820
I mean, the CPU in there is not like a beast or anything, but it has a nice balance of

40:28.820 --> 40:33.260
power usage to performance and it was totally fine for like just me playing back on my local

40:33.260 --> 40:34.260
network.

40:34.260 --> 40:35.260
I don't think it was enabled.

40:35.260 --> 40:38.420
It didn't have the configuration, but that model even has quick sync.

40:38.420 --> 40:39.420
No way.

40:39.420 --> 40:40.420
Yeah.

40:40.420 --> 40:41.420
Right?

40:41.420 --> 40:42.420
Oh, man.

40:42.420 --> 40:47.980
So we're just talking about that on self-hosted and that's a big game changer, not just in

40:47.980 --> 40:53.340
terms of CPU overhead, but a lot less power usage too by the CPU when you're using quick

40:53.340 --> 40:54.340
sync.

40:54.340 --> 40:55.580
I'm legit jealous.

40:55.580 --> 40:56.580
That's awesome.

40:56.580 --> 40:57.580
I'm really glad.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.580
I'm glad.

40:58.580 --> 40:59.580
It sounds like a really nice rig.

40:59.580 --> 41:02.780
So what you should do is use it for a little while and then we should do long-term reviews

41:02.780 --> 41:07.460
because I'm going to try to do a long-term review with the X1 and I'd love to hear a

41:07.460 --> 41:09.260
long-term review for your Synology.

41:09.260 --> 41:10.260
Yeah, definitely.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.580
I've actually got a few more spare drives around.

41:12.580 --> 41:15.700
So this was really just a test setup, sort of evaluate things, put it through its paces

41:15.700 --> 41:19.860
before I committed to a particular setup because they've got a lot of different sort of like

41:19.860 --> 41:23.300
integrated volume and storage pool options even before you choose if you're going to

41:23.300 --> 41:25.940
use ButterFS or EXT4.

41:25.940 --> 41:28.780
So I'm going to play with that a little bit more, maybe install two more drives just to

41:28.780 --> 41:33.100
fill the thing out and then, yeah, I'm going to move over from my previous solution, which

41:33.100 --> 41:35.040
definitely needed an upgrade.

41:35.040 --> 41:37.540
So thank you, Chris, and thank you, Synology.

41:37.540 --> 41:38.540
All right.

41:38.540 --> 41:41.660
It is time for the Tuxes.

41:41.660 --> 41:46.360
Ladies and gentlemen, the first annual Linux Unplugged Tuxes.

41:46.360 --> 41:51.300
Our audience voted on the best open source newcomers, projects of the year, text editors

41:51.300 --> 41:52.300
and more.

41:52.300 --> 41:58.600
And it's our chance after a real ball buster of a year to say thank you.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.540
The Unplugged Tuxes 2020.

42:00.540 --> 42:07.140
We had a total of 221 submissions, which I love that number because having done some

42:07.140 --> 42:09.860
submission challenges before, that's a decent turnout.

42:09.860 --> 42:13.860
So you can get a kind of somewhat representative sampling.

42:13.860 --> 42:16.940
But I hope that we will crush it next year.

42:16.940 --> 42:18.820
I hope we get like 800 submissions next year.

42:18.820 --> 42:21.900
And then I want to, I'd like, you know, every year I'd like us to double the number because

42:21.900 --> 42:24.820
I really would love this to eventually be representative.

42:24.820 --> 42:29.060
But we put out a form for a few weeks and we said, tell us who you think is the best

42:29.060 --> 42:31.740
in these categories.

42:31.740 --> 42:37.780
And the results have been tabulated and we're going to run through the categories and then

42:37.780 --> 42:39.640
their winners.

42:39.640 --> 42:44.980
And of course, your hosts do reserve the right to challenge a result.

42:44.980 --> 42:50.900
But we will have to make our case in a court of a public opinion and to Drew, who is here

42:50.900 --> 42:51.900
to play arbiter.

42:51.900 --> 42:52.900
Hello, Drew.

42:52.900 --> 42:53.900
Welcome back.

42:53.900 --> 42:54.900
Hello.

42:54.900 --> 42:57.940
And so we could, if we want to challenge one of the results, we have to make our case and

42:57.940 --> 43:00.540
then the other hosts have to buy off on it.

43:00.540 --> 43:05.960
But here are the categories for 2020, ladies and gentlemen.

43:05.960 --> 43:09.140
Number one, the best open source project.

43:09.140 --> 43:13.000
Number two, best newcomer project.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.060
Number three, best Linux game of the year.

43:16.060 --> 43:20.040
Number four, best text editor of 2020.

43:20.040 --> 43:23.140
Number five, favorite desktop distro of 2020.

43:23.140 --> 43:26.320
Number six, favorite server distro of 2020.

43:26.320 --> 43:31.620
Number seven, best desktop environment of 2020, and these are all of 2020.

43:31.620 --> 43:33.500
Then we'll just do a general best of tech.

43:33.500 --> 43:39.400
And then we asked you all what your most life changing hardware or gadget was this year.

43:39.400 --> 43:46.300
We've tabulated the results and we'll go through them and let you know what everyone voted.

43:46.300 --> 43:49.980
So we'll start with, why don't we start with the best text editor?

43:49.980 --> 43:52.000
Because I think that's a good place to start.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.380
So get the divisive one right out of the way.

43:54.380 --> 43:55.380
Yeah.

43:55.380 --> 43:57.020
That's the elephant in the room.

43:57.020 --> 44:01.100
And this is the one that I think maybe we even want to contest right off the beginning,

44:01.100 --> 44:08.240
but with 53 entries out of 208 answers for this category, 25% thus the winner went to

44:08.240 --> 44:12.620
Vim, Vim.

44:12.620 --> 44:18.300
And there was a couple of runner ups in this category, VS Code came in at number two, Emacs

44:18.300 --> 44:22.280
at number three, VS Code beat Emacs.

44:22.280 --> 44:28.780
And if you include the VS Codium votes, VS Code handily beat Emacs.

44:28.780 --> 44:35.180
26 submissions for Emacs, 29 for just VS Code alone, but then there were additional five

44:35.180 --> 44:38.500
submissions for VS Codium.

44:38.500 --> 44:40.620
Kate's in the list.

44:40.620 --> 44:41.660
But Wes, what do you think here?

44:41.660 --> 44:45.140
Do you think Vim actually maybe performed better than the numbers suggest?

44:45.140 --> 44:46.140
Well, yeah.

44:46.140 --> 44:50.100
I mean, there's also Neo Vim in there and some entries for VI.

44:50.100 --> 44:56.540
So I think its lead would be even stronger if we had done a little more assertive tallying,

44:56.540 --> 44:57.540
you know.

44:57.540 --> 45:00.460
I did do a little cleanup here to try to make things fit into nice categories where there

45:00.460 --> 45:04.660
were some, you know, a lot of fun comments that people wrote in, which was awesome.

45:04.660 --> 45:11.100
Like one of my favorites for this entry is we got one vote for LibreOfficeWriter.

45:11.100 --> 45:18.380
We got some votes for Sublime Text and Kate and Micro and GEdit and Mousepad and KWrite.

45:18.380 --> 45:19.380
Didn't get much.

45:19.380 --> 45:24.140
Only 0.95% of the vote for KWrite, which I've been using recently.

45:24.140 --> 45:28.300
Vim, though, I feel like it handily wins.

45:28.300 --> 45:32.620
I was going to try to make the case for VS Code, but even when you combine the VS Code

45:32.620 --> 45:37.380
with the VS Codium, I think Vim still won pretty strong by the audience.

45:37.380 --> 45:40.300
I mean, it's a pretty strong lead there.

45:40.300 --> 45:42.300
I don't really think I'm going to challenge this one.

45:42.300 --> 45:46.160
I feel like Vim is a little boring.

45:46.160 --> 45:52.920
So there is a trick in place to solve this problem, and it'll be employed if Vim ever

45:52.920 --> 45:54.280
wins again.

45:54.280 --> 46:00.880
And then they just get, if they win two shows in a row, they'll get the Hall of Fame award

46:00.880 --> 46:03.660
and they are disqualified from winning in a future show.

46:03.660 --> 46:06.740
But we could give it to Vim this year, but that means if they win it next year, then

46:06.740 --> 46:09.180
they win the Lifetime Award and they're out.

46:09.180 --> 46:14.580
Well, I also think that VS Code, you know, edging out Emacs, that's something to watch,

46:14.580 --> 46:15.580
right?

46:15.580 --> 46:18.980
One, that's a good idea because we just, you know, we should mix things up, keep it interesting.

46:18.980 --> 46:23.500
But then two, I think on its own, probably next year, VS Code is going to be doing better

46:23.500 --> 46:25.100
against Vim, not worse.

46:25.100 --> 46:30.380
Also, what's up to my Nano brothers and sisters out there, solid representation from the Nano

46:30.380 --> 46:31.380
community.

46:31.380 --> 46:33.380
I mean, could have used a few more of you.

46:33.380 --> 46:35.140
All right, I'm not going to challenge this one.

46:35.140 --> 46:43.980
We will award the first Tuxy of 2020 for Best Text Editor to Vim.

46:43.980 --> 46:46.040
Congratulations to Vim, you've earned it.

46:46.040 --> 46:48.900
Now our plan here is, of course, I still got to get my crap together and I could use some

46:48.900 --> 46:54.060
help if anybody could help me figure out how to take a two dimensional graphic, a flat

46:54.060 --> 46:58.300
graphic and convert that into a 3D printable object.

46:58.300 --> 47:04.980
Somebody's actually done it before, but I want to take the last bearded penguin and

47:04.980 --> 47:08.220
I want to take the ring around him that we have where he's holding the rocket and the

47:08.220 --> 47:12.240
ring around it, I want it to say 2020 Tuxys and I want to print that and send that out

47:12.240 --> 47:13.820
to the award winners.

47:13.820 --> 47:15.180
So that's a bit of an effort.

47:15.180 --> 47:16.900
So I need to figure out how to do that.

47:16.900 --> 47:20.180
Alex has volunteered to do the printing, though, which is awesome.

47:20.180 --> 47:23.060
And then we'll just have to start tracking down the projects and figure out where to

47:23.060 --> 47:24.060
send this.

47:24.060 --> 47:26.860
And Vim, you're going to be one of the first.

47:26.860 --> 47:29.940
Now we get into the more interesting category.

47:29.940 --> 47:34.200
This one I think is, I don't know, this one's going to be challenged, I think.

47:34.200 --> 47:38.060
This is the best open source project in 2020.

47:38.060 --> 47:44.460
And with 7% of the votes, wow, this is really spread out, but with 15 out of 217 submissions

47:44.460 --> 47:51.300
for this category, the winner for the community is the Linux kernel.

47:51.300 --> 47:54.540
I like to stretch it out a little bit.

47:54.540 --> 47:58.580
The Linux kernel, and the reason why I'm a little hesitant with this one is it feels

47:58.580 --> 48:01.820
kind of boring in a way.

48:01.820 --> 48:07.380
But I actually think maybe it's appropriate at the same time that for our first Tuxys,

48:07.380 --> 48:10.340
maybe it should go to the Linux kernel, you know?

48:10.340 --> 48:13.360
You know, I mean, there was, Debian was a runner up here.

48:13.360 --> 48:15.760
But then after that, things got a little more interesting.

48:15.760 --> 48:19.420
Things like Nextcloud and Firefox were also high up on the list.

48:19.420 --> 48:24.700
Yeah, I'm disappointed that it wasn't Home Assistant, I have to be honest with you.

48:24.700 --> 48:29.220
I think Home Assistant is just not a, it's just people don't appreciate how awesome it

48:29.220 --> 48:30.460
is, man.

48:30.460 --> 48:37.420
But really, you know, we can talk about text editors and stuff, but Home Assistant has

48:37.420 --> 48:38.720
changed my life.

48:38.720 --> 48:41.140
It's made my quality of life better.

48:41.140 --> 48:44.660
My particular living situation, heating, can be challenging.

48:44.660 --> 48:50.540
And having an automation system that has managed that has made this winter and last winter

48:50.540 --> 48:52.980
more comfortable than I've ever been in LadyJuice.

48:52.980 --> 48:58.440
And then I combine that with a bunch of smart lighting that makes it much nicer and cozier

48:58.440 --> 49:03.780
and tolerable when it gets dark out at 3.55 p.m. in the Pacific Northwest, I have a bunch

49:03.780 --> 49:07.340
of lighting that comes on automatically that tracks the sunset and sunrise.

49:07.340 --> 49:12.120
So it's always adjusting with the sunlight of the time of year and it monitors the weather

49:12.120 --> 49:17.600
for me and it brings together so many aspects of automation, even security aspects that

49:17.600 --> 49:22.300
when you start to use a project like Home Assistant, it actually changes your day to

49:22.300 --> 49:23.300
day life.

49:23.300 --> 49:28.540
And it changes how my family interacts with my home and how they interact with technology

49:28.540 --> 49:31.020
and what their perceptions of what it's capable of.

49:31.020 --> 49:36.800
And it has bridged all of these commercial cloud connected products all together in one

49:36.800 --> 49:43.660
local LAN based system that has a nice, easy to use dashboard.

49:43.660 --> 49:45.980
It's very family tolerable.

49:45.980 --> 49:50.180
But I understand that it's it even spent a good portion as the number one project on

49:50.180 --> 49:51.820
GitHub in 2020.

49:51.820 --> 49:55.420
That's why I really thought maybe it had a shot at the best open source project.

49:55.420 --> 49:59.660
So that's why I'm a little I'm tempted to challenge this one.

49:59.660 --> 50:04.180
But when you stack that up to the impact of the Linux kernel, I don't think I can argue

50:04.180 --> 50:05.180
that.

50:05.180 --> 50:06.620
You know, they clearly are.

50:06.620 --> 50:10.580
They've had a little more impact than a single open source project, regardless of the personal

50:10.580 --> 50:11.580
impact it's had on me.

50:11.580 --> 50:16.180
Yeah, you are in a particularly automatable setup, I think, right?

50:16.180 --> 50:19.860
I mean, you have some different needs, you have a very changing environment, you have

50:19.860 --> 50:21.940
a custom setup.

50:21.940 --> 50:26.500
But having watched Home Assistant rise the past few years, I mean, I remember we did

50:26.500 --> 50:33.700
a comparison with OpenHAB and a couple other stuff here on LUP in I don't know, 2017, maybe.

50:33.700 --> 50:36.460
And back then it was kind of like, well, what's, you know, there's a couple of solutions out

50:36.460 --> 50:37.740
here in the market.

50:37.740 --> 50:41.540
They're all pretty decent, but don't you know, not everyone supports everything.

50:41.540 --> 50:43.500
And that's just totally changed.

50:43.500 --> 50:45.820
I mean, Home Assistant is king now.

50:45.820 --> 50:52.660
Also the Home Assistant project has come across what may be a uniquely great, sustainable

50:52.660 --> 50:55.300
profit model for an open source project.

50:55.300 --> 50:58.060
So Home Assistant is all land based.

50:58.060 --> 51:02.740
But if you would like for like less than $10 a month, I think it's like $8 a month, you

51:02.740 --> 51:07.460
can subscribe to Nebuchadnezzar's Home Assistant cloud service.

51:07.460 --> 51:13.780
And that gives you secure remote access through their proxy system to your Home Assistant

51:13.780 --> 51:14.780
instance.

51:14.780 --> 51:20.740
And it works even with some crazy double carrier grade NAT system like I have.

51:20.740 --> 51:25.780
And it also allows for easy tie in with the smart cylinders if you want.

51:25.780 --> 51:30.060
You can also custom build this stuff so you don't have to use the cloud service if you're

51:30.060 --> 51:33.700
comfortable with setting up your own cloud service yourself and you want to manage all

51:33.700 --> 51:38.060
of it and you want to manually connect to the different APIs, you can do all of this

51:38.060 --> 51:39.060
yourself.

51:39.060 --> 51:43.420
But they give you just a couple of checkboxes for like $8 a month that does all of this

51:43.420 --> 51:45.080
stuff.

51:45.080 --> 51:50.980
And on top of that, they give you a kind of like this peace of mind because you can now

51:50.980 --> 51:55.780
check in on like your system itself, the health of your system remotely, which is great.

51:55.780 --> 51:59.460
You know, so anyways, that then goes into funding the developers.

51:59.460 --> 52:04.780
And now they've hired eight full time people at Nebuchadnezzar who are contributing back

52:04.780 --> 52:09.060
to Home Assistant with the sole purpose of making Home Assistant better.

52:09.060 --> 52:14.380
So that way they can pick up a few more subscribers and it just kind of is a really nice, sustainable

52:14.380 --> 52:19.260
development model where you're not the product, but they also have found a way to give something

52:19.260 --> 52:22.780
away that's extremely intricate and a lot of work.

52:22.780 --> 52:24.520
It's an intense amount of work.

52:24.520 --> 52:30.180
They've figured out a way to give that away for free, absolutely free, while also funding

52:30.180 --> 52:34.820
the people who love to work on it and give them full time work that keeps the project

52:34.820 --> 52:35.820
going.

52:35.820 --> 52:41.980
I just think that's something really special and the way they've grown over 2020 is extremely,

52:41.980 --> 52:44.880
it's just, it's an open source success story.

52:44.880 --> 52:49.580
They've had a groundswell of support from people out in the whole world that are developing

52:49.580 --> 52:50.820
these integrations.

52:50.820 --> 52:56.220
The core team has come together under some pretty clear and I'd say concise leadership.

52:56.220 --> 52:59.780
They've had a couple of missteps here and there with community communication, but then

52:59.780 --> 53:04.840
they listened to the feedback in both instances and righted the ship in a significant way

53:04.840 --> 53:08.980
that actually made a difference and addressed the complaints the community was making and

53:08.980 --> 53:10.940
they pulled that off.

53:10.940 --> 53:17.260
It's such an open source success story, but when people don't try it, even if you have

53:17.260 --> 53:21.100
a simple home automation system, you maybe have one or two smart plugs or a light bulb,

53:21.100 --> 53:23.700
so maybe you don't try it, you don't get to see it.

53:23.700 --> 53:27.740
I understand that's why it isn't represented here in the votes, but as someone who has

53:27.740 --> 53:33.700
watched open source projects and developments for a long time, it's so great to see something

53:33.700 --> 53:37.140
like that happening in 2020.

53:37.140 --> 53:43.340
It frees me from proprietary lockdown cloud services and it lets me have a higher quality

53:43.340 --> 53:45.500
standard of living in my home.

53:45.500 --> 53:51.100
It's that kind of project, but again, all that said, I can't argue that the Linux kernel

53:51.100 --> 53:53.020
has been more impactful in this year.

53:53.020 --> 53:55.660
It's just the math of it.

53:55.660 --> 54:01.820
I don't think I can overrule it, but I wonder, Drew and Wes, you guys, feel free, but do

54:01.820 --> 54:06.660
you think, what about an honorary best open source project of the year?

54:06.660 --> 54:12.900
Well, I think it can absolutely get something like the crisp pick of the year, but considering

54:12.900 --> 54:20.360
that it's tied for sixth, I have a hard time saying this particular project needs a special

54:20.360 --> 54:25.900
award from the whole group when there are so many other projects that are above it that

54:25.900 --> 54:28.380
really are hugely impactful too.

54:28.380 --> 54:33.300
We're not just talking about the Linux kernel, which obviously is hugely impactful to all

54:33.300 --> 54:35.060
of our day-to-day lives.

54:35.060 --> 54:43.900
There's also Debian and Nextcloud, both of which are huge and touch a lot of people.

54:43.900 --> 54:50.180
Then there's Firefox and KDE, and then Home Assistant is tied with Fedora.

54:50.180 --> 54:58.860
All of these are huge projects that really have massive contributions to our world.

54:58.860 --> 55:06.220
So I'd say make a new category for a crisp pick, but respect the will of the voters.

55:06.220 --> 55:07.220
It's down there, isn't it?

55:07.220 --> 55:08.940
It's down in the votes.

55:08.940 --> 55:09.940
That's the math of it.

55:09.940 --> 55:14.900
I'll just give it, I'll just say, unofficial appreciation to the project.

55:14.900 --> 55:16.660
I think you guys can tell why I appreciate it.

55:16.660 --> 55:17.660
You're right.

55:17.660 --> 55:19.740
You're right.

55:19.740 --> 55:21.740
It is what it is.

55:21.740 --> 55:22.980
But how does this not happen next year?

55:22.980 --> 55:24.820
Linux kernel wins again next year could be a problem.

55:24.820 --> 55:26.860
Well, didn't you make the rule for this already?

55:26.860 --> 55:28.040
If they win again, then...

55:28.040 --> 55:30.020
If they win again, lifetime achievement award.

55:30.020 --> 55:33.360
It almost seems like they should just get one, but no, we'll see, we'll see.

55:33.360 --> 55:34.360
You never know.

55:34.360 --> 55:35.380
2021 could be crazy.

55:35.380 --> 55:39.140
So I'll just say this, thank you to Home Assistant.

55:39.140 --> 55:44.820
You are my arbitrary appreciation pick of the show.

55:44.820 --> 55:47.460
And you get a little love explosion right there.

55:47.460 --> 55:52.360
Okay, let's step into a territory that until just a couple of weeks ago was not very controversial

55:52.360 --> 55:59.220
at all, but thanks to recent changes with CentOS and people are still adjusting as we

55:59.220 --> 56:05.560
record this, the favorite server distro of 2020 results might be a little more interesting

56:05.560 --> 56:07.300
than we were expecting.

56:07.300 --> 56:12.460
And we had not as many people submit this category, but we got 208 submissions here

56:12.460 --> 56:16.300
and we had a winner, a pretty clear signal on this one.

56:16.300 --> 56:22.580
The community voted with 40% of the vote to give it to Ubuntu.

56:22.580 --> 56:31.880
Yeah, Ubuntu got it with 84 votes out of 208, followed by Debian in second place and CentOS

56:31.880 --> 56:39.660
in third place, Fedora in fourth, Red Hat Enterprise 9 in fifth, and there's OpenSUSE

56:39.660 --> 56:44.620
just above arch at sixth place with six votes.

56:44.620 --> 56:47.180
You know what's interesting about this, Wes?

56:47.180 --> 56:51.420
Doesn't this kind of track close to what the actual web server market share stats are that

56:51.420 --> 56:52.420
we looked up?

56:52.420 --> 56:53.740
Yeah, it kind of seems like it, right?

56:53.740 --> 57:00.340
I mean, Ubuntu is way up there at the top and probably rightfully so, it's just a trusted

57:00.340 --> 57:04.640
server platform these days with a lot of niceties, all the software you could want and a good

57:04.640 --> 57:05.640
track record.

57:05.640 --> 57:10.140
Oh, the orange one says that an honorary mention should go to Alpine for being pretty much

57:10.140 --> 57:13.320
all of the Docker containers out there that are getting used.

57:13.320 --> 57:14.320
That's a good one.

57:14.320 --> 57:15.320
Good point, orange one.

57:15.320 --> 57:20.460
I actually am a little surprised Ubuntu is this far ahead in our crowd.

57:20.460 --> 57:24.320
I actually don't doubt the numbers at all, but I think it shows you this is reflective

57:24.320 --> 57:26.980
of what the audience is out there running.

57:26.980 --> 57:27.980
Manjaro came in at two.

57:27.980 --> 57:29.660
Now remember, this is a server.

57:29.660 --> 57:32.940
Unraid with one vote, Void Linux is on there.

57:32.940 --> 57:36.660
I don't think, oh yeah, Alpine did get two votes.

57:36.660 --> 57:39.620
So Alpine did get some representation.

57:39.620 --> 57:43.420
Although that was the same number as the folks who decided to still answer, but write in

57:43.420 --> 57:45.780
I don't have any servers.

57:45.780 --> 57:47.180
Yeah, right.

57:47.180 --> 57:48.180
That's fair enough.

57:48.180 --> 57:49.180
Fair enough.

57:49.180 --> 57:51.460
So are you guys okay with officially giving that one to Ubuntu?

57:51.460 --> 57:52.780
I don't see any reason not to.

57:52.780 --> 57:54.620
I mean, the people have spoken.

57:54.620 --> 57:57.500
I think it makes perfect sense, yeah.

57:57.500 --> 57:59.020
They've worked hard on that LTS.

57:59.020 --> 58:02.660
And at this point, you don't get fired for choosing Ubuntu.

58:02.660 --> 58:10.520
All right, then Ubuntu gets our official 2020 Tuxy as the server distro of the year, which

58:10.520 --> 58:13.700
means we move on now to the desktop.

58:13.700 --> 58:18.980
So favorite desktop distribution, not desktop environment, but desktop distribution.

58:18.980 --> 58:22.540
This one got a 19% winning vote.

58:22.540 --> 58:25.580
There's 219 submissions for this category.

58:25.580 --> 58:34.260
And the winner for the favorite desktop distro of 2020 is Fedora with 43 out of 219 votes.

58:34.260 --> 58:35.260
How about that?

58:35.260 --> 58:38.980
Ubuntu wins the server, but doesn't win the desktop this year.

58:38.980 --> 58:39.980
Isn't that interesting?

58:39.980 --> 58:43.940
Fedora gets 43 votes, and Ubuntu gets 29 votes.

58:43.940 --> 58:49.820
Manjaro coming in at a solid third with 25, and Arch right after that, followed by PopOS

58:49.820 --> 58:50.820
and then KDE Neon.

58:50.820 --> 58:51.820
Yeah, after PopOS.

58:51.820 --> 58:55.820
I mean, there's kind of a close little running for the second-third category this year.

58:55.820 --> 58:56.820
It's interesting.

58:56.820 --> 59:02.340
MX and OpenSUSE and Solus and Mint all kind of fighting for the same territory.

59:02.340 --> 59:05.620
Zubuntu, Kubuntu, and Budgie and Monte, et cetera.

59:05.620 --> 59:10.660
All of those, we put those down as not Ubuntu the primary, but one of the derivatives of

59:10.660 --> 59:13.260
Ubuntu got nine votes.

59:13.260 --> 59:18.940
So if you added the nine votes for all of the Ubuntu derivatives, Ubuntu looks a little

59:18.940 --> 59:23.180
bit better, but Fedora actually still wins, even when you add in all of the derivatives

59:23.180 --> 59:27.140
to the results for Ubuntu.

59:27.140 --> 59:31.340
It's a stronger second place, but Fedora is still a winner there.

59:31.340 --> 59:35.140
So that's a clear vote for Fedora.

59:35.140 --> 59:38.340
I can't really think of any reason to challenge that.

59:38.340 --> 59:40.340
Honestly not what I expected.

59:40.340 --> 59:45.740
I expected Ubuntu and Fedora to be swapped, that Ubuntu would be in first place and Fedora

59:45.740 --> 59:46.740
would be in second place.

59:46.740 --> 59:51.500
I'm just a little bit happy because I feel like it validates some of the fawning we've

59:51.500 --> 59:53.500
been doing over at Fedora lately.

59:53.500 --> 59:55.980
Maybe or maybe we've just pissed off all the Ubuntu users.

59:55.980 --> 59:58.460
That also could be it.

59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.380
Well Fedora did have a great year.

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.740
They're shipping on laptops from Lenovo.

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:07.740
I mean they had Fedora 33 release, has been stellar.

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:10.740
There's a lot to really like in Fedora this year.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:16.180
Yeah that's true and Fedora 33 got a lot of recognition for pushing the envelope and I

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:22.100
think you can attribute a lot of that to the switch of ButterFS as the default.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.860
You've got to be pretty happy about these results here Neil.

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:28.220
Oh my goodness yeah I'm super happy about this.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:36.620
I honestly didn't expect it given how much I tend to hear how Ubuntu is the way of the

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:44.420
beast or whatever but like holy crap I'm blown away and I know and I feel like maybe some

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:49.980
of what I've done over the past year might have helped tilt things in our favor but I

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.620
don't know what to say except for like thank you?

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:57.900
Well and I think the switch to ButterFS and the project also you know they took a couple

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:01.420
of other bold steps like switching to Nano as a default editor in some instances you

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.820
know bold steps Neil that made a big change.

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:08.780
It's fun too to still see all this cool stuff happening in 2020.

01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:14.220
It's been kind of a weird year and so to see to see these shift around I'm really going

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.540
to be interested to see if Fedora wins again next year.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.820
I wouldn't necessarily bet on it.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:22.540
Well I'm going to try hard to you know you know within the Fedora community me and many

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:27.560
others will try our best to try to earn the vote for next year as well and also keep an

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.540
eye on Fedora server that's coming back in a hopefully in a big way next year.

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:37.420
So hey Wes do a little back of the napkin math for me before we fully lock this in because

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.820
we haven't locked it in yet.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:49.220
If we took all of the Ubuntu derivatives and we took Pop OS does that put Ubuntu ahead?

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:52.900
Are we counting KDE Neon in here?

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:58.420
Well hmm see the reason why we separated these out is I actually wanted to get a signal to

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:03.020
people like the stock Ubuntu desktop or do they like the derivative desktops.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.540
So I actually think this is the vote result that I wanted.

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:10.740
I wanted to know and it is clear by these numbers that the stock Ubuntu desktop is the

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:16.460
most popular but on its own it isn't the most popular in our audience.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:22.540
Yeah so if you add up all the ones not including some controversial things like like KDE Neon

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:26.780
or other things that might be vaguely based on Ubuntu but actually like Ubuntu MATE,

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:33.580
Zubuntu, things like that it's a four vote margin so it's pretty darn close 43 to 39

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:36.100
but Fedora is still in the lead.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:41.260
Okay yeah and then if you add in Pop OS it's kind of a it's kind of a smash and then if

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:46.960
you add in KDE Neon on top of that as yet another derivative it's Ubuntu is far and

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.580
away the most but.

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:52.980
And elementary if you put elementary in there which only got three votes in this in this

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:58.340
lineup but you know that's still three votes and yeah you really you could if you combine

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:03.980
all of the derivatives which I think you could argue is fair but it's not the signal we wanted

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:04.980
from the audience.

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:10.980
We wanted to know how many people were using the stock experience.

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:13.740
I don't know what do you think Drew what's your what's your judgment on it?

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.900
Oh I think it's still Fedora.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:22.420
I think if we wanted to categorize you know the base OS that would be a different category

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:23.420
altogether.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:27.980
All right so I think we're good then we're agreed we're gonna lock it in for Fedora as

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:34.940
the best desktop distro of 2020 as voted by the audience.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:41.180
It is locked in so let's wander off into the best tech land the best tech of 2020 as voted

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.900
by the Linux Unplugged audience.

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:50.500
This one got a hundred and fifty five submissions and the winner with eight percent of the vote

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.820
which actually isn't a significant number but it's enough to make it the winner it is

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.740
ladies and gentlemen the PinePhone.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:04.620
The PinePhone was voted as a best tech of 2020 in our audience and that out beat the

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:11.660
Raspberry Pi 4 and Home Assistant which got somebody included in this count so Home Assistant

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.460
got a few more votes over in this category.

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:17.060
It's well represented across the board I will say.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:24.260
And Librem 5 is in here too but only two votes so the PinePhone got 13 votes in this category

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.380
followed by the Raspberry Pi and then WireGuard.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.500
Yeah I could see that I could definitely see that.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:37.060
PineBook Pro got five votes Apple's M1 got four votes interesting interesting.

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:41.820
That stood out to me you know in multiple categories including the next one there were

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:46.940
a lot of references to the M1 although an entertaining number also included sorry I

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.980
know it's not really Linux.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:53.500
We want it we didn't we specifically did not limit the category it did not have to be Linux

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:58.100
I just wanted to know so that way we could get a sense of where things fit get a get

01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.100
a sense.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:03.420
So what do you think PinePhone that seems I mean 13 votes is a pretty clear signal.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:09.060
I think people are excited about you know this this open hardware run whatever you want

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.660
embrace Linux on the phone potential maybe maybe it's not the thing that you're running

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:17.020
as your daily driver in 2020 but it's the thing that you have as your second phone that

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.860
you're playing with and excited about.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:25.180
Now I do have to bring up one thing here and that is the Raspberry Pi 4 versus the Raspberry

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:33.700
Pi 400 combined those two equal up to 14 which just barely edges out the PinePhone.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:42.900
Yeah but I feel like because they are separate products I think I think that is okay.

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:50.500
Yeah that's a good one I don't know though yeah okay I feel like probably that's a little

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:55.140
bit of cheating though because that you know the Pi 4 came out almost like a year before

01:05:55.140 --> 01:06:01.540
the 400 and the 400 isn't exactly the same it's got a revved CPU and a different board

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:05.820
so not really they're not really the same product they're the same platform.

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:11.300
Yeah and I buy that although that said how many revisions of the PinePhone have there

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.300
been.

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.300
Fair.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:19.100
Now remember we're also we're looking at 2020 here and I think the PinePhone has had

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:23.860
a they like they met their ship windows they got the devices out into people's hands and

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:29.340
we've seen a lot of open source projects just in 2020 alone spin up development on these

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:33.180
things and make it actually getting towards usable.

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:37.460
Yeah I think I'm with you there and it's also worth pointing out that it's not just the

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:42.940
PinePhone that's on here Pine64 in general is all over this list you've got the Pinebook

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:50.780
Pro Pine64 as a company you know there's PineSil.

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:54.780
Pine is all over this people are really excited about Pine this year.

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:59.700
True true good to see OBS is in here Plasma got in here I actually really like to see

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:07.780
that YouTube DL made it in here as well only one submission for Best Tech for Rust.

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.260
Podman that must have been you Carl.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:18.300
That's awesome yeah Plasma got a KDE and Plasma were in here as two separate things.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:23.180
Yeah one thing ZFS was stood out in this too I don't think it made to the top of any of

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:27.700
these but it was held had a healthy number of votes in several categories this year.

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:31.580
Yeah it was nice to see Matrix and Blender and Docker all kind of in the and Nextcloud

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:36.980
all kind of in the same region too all of them getting three votes.

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:41.780
So this is obviously a challenging category because it's so broad and the submissions

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:50.120
could be kind of variable and you know PinePhone, PineSpacePhone, Pine64Phone like a lot of variability

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:55.460
to it so that's one of the things we'll refine next year but this is after taking several

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:59.840
passes at trying to account for all of that and I think that you know the PinePhone still

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:05.220
kind of comes out strong when you look at what has been accomplished not just by Pine64

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:08.980
but the community around it too so I say we lock it in gentlemen.

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:11.980
Pull that trigger.

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:17.740
All right now we move on to the most life-changing hardware or device or gadget for you this

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.740
year out there in the audience.

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:28.280
This one had 142 submissions and with 11% of the vote we have a winner the Jupiter Broadcasting

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:36.420
audience Linux Unplugged Tuxi nominations go to the Raspberry Pi 4 and there you go

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.020
they just win the next category.

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:42.940
The Raspberry Pi 4 has been the most life-changing hardware for 2020 or gadget.

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:46.560
See if this is your vindication Chris you know you didn't get the Home Assistant thing

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.900
before but I think I think this one.

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:55.660
That's true this has been this is I'm really kind of I'm just as all in on the Raspberry

01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:01.660
Pi's as I was when they first launched I mean it's really been great because on the desktop

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:06.340
side Manjaro has been the way I've gone on the desktop and then same with the Pi 400

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:13.220
Manjaro worked great on there and on the server side Ubuntu LTS 2004 has been exactly like

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:18.940
running it on an x86 box and with the USB disk support so I'm not using SD storage I

01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:24.860
can unlock a lot more performance out of a Raspberry Pi 4 and I have gone off-grid many

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:31.240
times running off just lithium-powered batteries and the power draw matters so much in that

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:39.340
circumstance and I literally sleep well knowing that I just have these Pi's two of them now

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:43.780
that are just sucking just a tiny bit of power you know it's not like an x86 machine that's

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:50.860
pulling down 120 watts and it has made it possible for me to do things like go out and

01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:56.420
camp in the woods for longer periods of time because they are using less power and that's

01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:02.500
awesome and it's it allows us to go off-grid and still have essentially a full online experience

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:07.700
I talked about this and self-hosted but I have a lot of local media and reading and

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:16.180
audio and some wiki stuff cached locally on my Raspberry Pi's and we very much have like

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:21.860
a near online experience when we go offline but we're not getting notifications and messages

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:26.420
all of our smart controls still works home assistant running on the Raspberry Pi all

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:30.820
of our video streaming still works because the media stored there locally on a butter

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:36.780
FS volume of two USB disks it actually all works and this is also where I started to

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:42.900
really kind of reevaluate butter FS again when I was like looking at the use case of

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:49.060
laptop servers and Raspberry Pi servers and no longer these massive chassis with eight

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:54.100
disks in them but now something that's running over maybe a USB but USB bus or even on SD

01:10:54.100 --> 01:11:00.420
card or or some other less than ideal scenario and I realized there's a real need for a flexible

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:06.860
powerful file system out there in a serious workload capacity and when I brought butter

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:14.820
FS together with the Raspberry Pi 4 using Ubuntu LTS 2004 when when that like trifecta

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:20.100
of Linux technology came together I was able to up my home hosting game to a whole other

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:26.140
level and the Raspberry Pi has dutifully been running for me 24 7 and I even took him down

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:33.140
into Texas where the ambient temperature outside was 117 degrees and they're inside a tiny

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:39.340
enclosed booth often never even getting below 100 degrees at night inside the booth and

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:45.940
they I brought them back they're still running they they ran and they they they one time

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:50.580
one time I ran into some thermal throttling issues one time when we were streaming multiple

01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:56.500
videos from a Pi 4 but now that we're back in the Pacific Northwest it's a literal non-issue

01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:02.460
it really is a solid machine and then you know you look at the price and you look at

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:08.180
what you get it it just it's it's so awesome that that tech of is available to us as consumers

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:15.780
when when the world is dominated by $1,000 Macbooks and $10,000 desktops and all these

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:21.700
crazy things it's really nice to be able to find a computer for $35 that can do so much

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:25.460
and this year they upgraded it to eight gigs of RAM to really the buying is better than

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:31.140
ever you can use it for more things and this wasn't even it didn't even need conflation

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:37.740
with the Raspberry Pi 400 to win this category because it's just regardless it's so darn

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:44.060
handy the pine phone also got submissions here so to the ThinkPad system 76 got three

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:48.420
votes in this category home assistant got another three votes here as well I noticed

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:53.540
you skipped right over to the Apple watch though yeah so that's the awkward thing about

01:12:53.540 --> 01:13:00.780
this category the Apple watch got seven votes the Apple watch is actually our number two

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:07.320
life-changing tech of the year and I think I can understand why it was a year of work

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.040
from home and people needed help probably with their fitness more than ever remembering

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:18.100
to stand tracking what they're doing tracking their sleep the Apple watch is just simply

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:23.780
the best wearable computer watch if you want a computer watch that is modern and well-built

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:28.420
and has great battery life you know you can find die-hards out there that are they're

01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:34.460
still rockin all the other kinds of watches but the Apple watch is just taking off this

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:40.180
year so I really last couple years I don't know is it had a particularly great 2020 I

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:44.580
mean must have it got a lot of votes and and this is on this is from a Linux audience right

01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:50.060
so think about that so if you're walking around out there listening to this show and you're

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:55.380
controlling the playback from your Apple watch have no shame it got second place it got second

01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:00.580
place out of a lot of nominations for the most life-changing hardware of 2020 all right

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:09.840
then we are officially giving it to the Raspberry Pi 4 for 2020 as the most life-changing tech

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:14.300
the best Linux game of the year this probably won't be surprised this won't be a surprise

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:21.100
to anyone that has kids my age or has gotten sucked into the latest game with 99 submissions

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:30.960
the audience has elected among us as the best Linux game of 2020 ironically not actually

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.340
a Linux game so that's where this category gets interesting right I don't know that we

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:39.880
gave clear instructions because yeah this is um you can only play among us via proton

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:45.500
although it is number four on their ratings for ten most popular over at the proton DB

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:49.540
so clearly there are a lot of Linux users who are playing among us and sounds like it

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:56.300
works pretty decently yeah it is rated gold so as far as non Linux native games being

01:14:56.300 --> 01:15:03.180
played on Linux it seems like it's pretty well supported at least yeah my son extensively

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:08.860
tests it on Linux for me so that way I can be up to date on the latest among us developments

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:15.940
and a little junior show researcher over there and yeah and I did say proton was fine it's

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:20.020
really I think I want to celebrate the fact that we have more game options to us and I

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:23.700
think the great thing about proton it's not just Windows compatibility but it's about

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:30.240
preserving art as time goes on the platforms will move on but proton and the different

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:36.140
releases of proton will be around and you'll be able to play games that you know are are

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:40.260
you able to preserve games and still actually play them you won't just have to look at them

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:44.940
so I think among us deserves it you know it was it was an extremely popular game it's

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:51.780
on it's on all of the platforms my kids played on mobile and on on their Linux boxes and

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:56.980
as a parent I had that moment when they came to me and said dad can we play among us on

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:02.860
our computers and I always dread that conversation of hey I know all of your friends are talking

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:06.460
about this at school it's like the biggest thing on YouTube right now for the YouTube

01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:11.500
algorithm that you get subscribed to and by the way you can't play it on your Linux box

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.060
because it Dylan already knows well there's Windows 10 and you could put that on the same

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:20.980
hardware because this come up before and I was just dreading that moment and I went on

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:25.380
Steam I saw it was available and I go on the proton DB and I look it up and I saw I had

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:29.380
gold support I installed it I had to make like I don't know I think I had to change

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:33.620
like one launch option or something it was it was documented and it fired right up and

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:38.660
it has worked flawlessly since then and I felt I don't know man I just had like I don't

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:42.980
know a sense of like I done right by him you know I got him a good computer it's running

01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:47.220
Linux and he can play the latest games that his Windows and iOS using friends are playing

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:52.600
right now and I think it deserves recognition for that and same with same with cyberpunk

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:59.140
you know we were able to get that running on Linux day one super hyped game and it came

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:04.620
in at third place so Nautic which is an open source first person shooter came in at second

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:08.740
place super tux cart came in at fourth place and then the list kind of goes off from there

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:13.560
to all the great games you've probably ever heard of even Skyrim is on there but I really

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.820
think it's appropriate to give it to among us this year even though it's technically

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:21.080
a proton game I think the fact that we're getting these games on day one while the hype

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:27.380
cycle is at peak that means a lot for gamers yeah we're all proton gamers now right yeah

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:30.740
actually yeah I mean I have a little bit of both I definitely still prefer Linux native

01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:34.980
it's a lot simpler ironically like the one of the few I've been playing a lot of proton

01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:40.540
games and I've been playing one Linux native game and that one is buggier than some of

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:46.220
the proton ones it's funny how they can go both ways so the chat rooms making the argument

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:49.100
and I'm gonna pitch this to Drew to see what you think Drew they're good they're making

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:53.720
the argument that we should actually we should give this award to proton for best Linux game

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.640
of the year even though it's not technically a game it has made it possible to play so

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.740
many new games you know it's to get the core of this among us story it's at the core of

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:09.780
cyberpunk of being available on day one it's not technically a game though that's a tough

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:16.300
one I don't I don't know I mean I do think that we should definitely be giving proton

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:21.580
a lot of credit here because it is doing a lot of heavy lifting for us but it's not a

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:28.260
game I don't know like I really want to show my appreciation for it but it just it's it's

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:32.540
not a game yeah I mean it could have won the best new tech and it didn't right I guess

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:36.420
because it wasn't new this year I guess if you look at 2020 it's been more of it being

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:42.460
really awesome and it's great to see continued development but it's not like it's breakout

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:50.140
year either mm-hmm all right so you think we should give it to among us I think so yeah

01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:58.620
I do all right the best new game for 2020 as awarded by our audience I'll have to figure

01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:02.940
out who gets the tuxy for that one that's gonna be interesting so we have our best newcomer

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:10.180
open source project in 2020 and this one had a lot of possibilities there proton is on

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:16.900
this list again so as Vulcans on this list oh my gosh this is there's a lot of submissions

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:23.280
on this one the pine phone again showed up on this list things like rocky linux and then

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:28.620
project linux are on here pipe wires on here I think rocky linux could still qualify in

01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:34.660
2021 to be honest with you but eight out of 154 different submissions five percent of

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:41.000
the audience voted for wire guard wire guard and you know that's even up against things

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:48.460
like proton OBS jellyfin bpy top it's a close one too because obviously we've been talking

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:55.340
about wire guard for way too long but it was just this last January that it really made

01:19:55.340 --> 01:20:00.320
it into the kernel so I think we have to count it right yeah I checked I sound like you did

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:06.620
too it was indeed mainlined in 2020 it seems like it's because we followed it for so long

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:15.480
it seems like it's been around forever and I use it still nearly on the daily it's fantastic

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:22.220
I have no qualms about awarding this prize to wire guard and I think I even know how

01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:26.420
to send them the tuxi what do you think drew should we give the best newcomer project any

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:34.360
any objections no objections here I do think we should recognize that bpy top getting a

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:40.300
close second place is impressive because we've only just discovered it ourselves true also

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:46.400
nice to see pop shell getting some recognition in here system d home do you got four votes

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:52.740
that's as many as rocky linux open zfs got a few pipe wire got a couple yeah there were

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:56.500
some good submissions in that category all right this is the one I was kind of getting

01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:02.100
us to because this is the one I think we've all been waiting for let's see how this one

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:10.740
goes this is as voted by the unplugged audience the nominations for the best desktop environment

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:25.540
of 2020 with 218 submissions 34 percent of those went to gnome shell gnome shell wins

01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:30.460
with 34 percent of the vote from the jupiter broadcasting audience as debt as best desktop

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:35.180
environment of 2020 you know you're supposed to hide some of your disappointment in your

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:40.500
voice chris when you're reading it well i'm no i i'm waiting to be convinced actually

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:45.020
um i i would have loved to have seen plasma as demonstrated earlier in the show i would

01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:50.380
have loved to have seen plasma win this category and they did come in at a solid number two

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:56.300
interesting to see sway come in at number three with 12 votes i3 after that then mate

01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:02.540
cinnamon xfce then budgie pantheon an awesome window manager and then from there it goes

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:08.260
to lxde lx cute and uh well there's actually even an emax on there as you would expect

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:14.020
only one x nomad gnome shell had a good year they really did they really really did uh

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:19.100
i i have ultimately ended back up on plasma but you know different strokes different folks

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:26.260
and you have to acknowledge the extremely hard work that that project has received from

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:32.300
um multiple parties and it's shown the work is shown so i i could i could go with this

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:36.100
i don't know wes or drew do you have a counter argument why we shouldn't give it to nomshell

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:40.780
no i i i do think you're right they've had a big year the work continues and probably

01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:46.020
next year is going to be even more exciting for the gnome shell show i'm excited for it

01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:53.180
and even if that's not what we are using day to day in the studio or on our personal machines

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:57.740
a lot of people are it's shipping in a ton of major desktops and it's a backbone of the

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:04.580
open source you know linux desktop community yep yeah i agree and hey look i live in georgia

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:10.720
currently so i know a little bit something about uh nail biting elections but the difference

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:18.420
between gnome shell and plasma here 74 to 68 that's not huge it absolutely is a nail

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:28.820
biter but gnome shell definitely won all right then we give the 2020 best desktop environment

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:33.880
tuxi to gnome shell congratulations everybody over there you've done you've done a really

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:39.140
kick butt job and i this has been a lot of fun now the work begins on getting these issued

01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:43.220
thank you everybody who took the time to submit and go through this we'd love to get your

01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:47.620
ideas on how to refine the process for the future also if you'd like to support this
