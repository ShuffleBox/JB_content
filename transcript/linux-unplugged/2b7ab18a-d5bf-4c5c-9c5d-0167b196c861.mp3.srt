1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
How about this for a little bit of troubleshooting?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A second-hand television wiped out the broadband

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,120
for an entire village.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,080
And this went on for months and even impacted

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,760
neighboring communities at time.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,480
And poor broadband was just a way of life

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,760
starting at 7 a.m.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
despite repeat visits by engineers

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,560
to try to find and fix the fault.

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,160
They replaced equipment, large sections of cable even,

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,360
but the problems remained.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,480
Local Openreach engineer, Michael Jones,

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,080
was determined to find the Aberrosian broadband smoking gun.

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,040
And I should note there,

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,560
I don't know if I'm saying that town right

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,880
because my Welsh is a little rusty.

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,680
That's strange.

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,840
Well, they say on their blog post about this,

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,800
as a last resort,

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,200
we decided to bring in a crack squad of engineers

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,040
from the chief engineer's office

22
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,680
who were based in other parts of the UK to investigate.

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
Accommodation was understandably hard to find

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,840
due to COVID-19 lockdown,

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,000
but we eventually found a field where we camped

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,480
and made the 55-mile journey back to the town

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,360
the next morning.

28
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,200
They exhausted all avenues.

29
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,280
So they wanted to take a final test

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,320
to see if maybe a phenomenon known as shine,

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,840
single high-level impulse noise

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,520
was causing this interference.

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,240
I love this, right?

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,280
It's sort of a moonshot like,

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,960
okay, we've tried everything we know.

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,800
What about this weird random thing?

37
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,240
Well, by using a device called a spectrum analyzer,

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,680
we walked up and down the village

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,560
in the torrential rain at 6 a.m.

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
uphill both ways, I'm sure,

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
to see if we could find an electrical noise

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,760
to support our theory.

43
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,760
And at 7 a.m., like clockwork, it happened.

44
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,520
Our device picked up a large burst

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,840
of electrical interference in the village.

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,600
The source of the electrical noise

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,120
was traced to a property in the village.

48
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,800
And it turned out that at 7 a.m. every morning,

49
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,000
the occupant would switch on their old TV,

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
which would in turn knock out broadband

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,320
for the entire village.

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,840
As you can imagine,

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,520
when we pointed this out to the resident,

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,480
they were mortified that their old second-hand TV

55
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,680
was the cause of an entire village's broadband problems.

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,080
And they immediately agreed to switch it off

57
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,440
and not use it again.

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,360
And since then,

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,640
there has been no reported issues with the network.

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,520
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,480
My name is Chris.

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,600
My name is Wes.

63
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,120
Well, hello, Wes Payne.

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,440
You are a gentleman that looks good in uniform.

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,640
It's looking good on you today.

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,080
I thought you might like this cap.

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,800
I do.

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,080
You know me too well.

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,160
Today's episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru,

70
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,600
the leader in hands-on learning.

71
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,400
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,120
in Cloud Linux servers and much more.

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,000
Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,440
Well, here we are with episode 372.

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,200
And we are going to ask a question that has been evolving

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,760
in the back of our minds, I think, for a couple of years.

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,800
We ask it with all sincerity.

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Is there really just no room for new boutique distributions?

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
Is it essentially a three distribution world

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,320
with Ubuntu derivatives, Arch, Fedora, Red Hat?

82
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,400
There's some Debian flavors.

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
It's a small world of Linux distributions these days.

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,240
And Wes and I recently tried out some really great distributions

85
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,080
and wonder why more people aren't using them.

86
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,040
And so we'll talk about that.

87
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,600
But of course, we have a bunch of community news to get into.

88
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,240
And we have a special guest joining us today,

89
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,520
the CEO of System76, an all-around great guy.

90
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,480
Carl is here.

91
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,280
Hello, Carl.

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,560
Welcome back to the Unplugged program.

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,360
It's been a while.

94
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,920
Hey, Chris.

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,960
Thanks for having me.

96
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,240
Carl, we're going to get into a new story from System76 here

97
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,360
in a little bit.

98
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,680
So feel free to chime in on everything.

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,240
But of course, we'll go to the source for that one.

100
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240
But I wanted to start with some news

101
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,600
that I'm super excited about.

102
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,400
So to help us analyze all of the community news this week,

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,720
we have to bring in our team of detectives,

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,920
our crew of captains.

105
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,520
Why, yes, it is our virtual lug.

106
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,320
Hello, Mumble Room.

107
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,800
Hello.

108
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,440
Hello.

109
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,640
Hello.

110
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,600
Bienvenido.

111
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,760
Absolutely.

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,640
Good to see.

113
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,480
Good to see we got 21 in there.

114
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,880
We're shy a little bit today of a few folks.

115
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,800
I guess they didn't know you're wearing your uniform today.

116
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,320
Or maybe you scared them off, Wes.

117
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,880
I look a little too authoritarian today, I think.

118
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,520
But don't worry.

119
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,280
We're friendly here at Linux Unplugged,

120
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,200
as long as you comply with our orders.

121
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,680
That's right.

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,960
Thank you.

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,000
Got to make that disclaimer.

124
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,600
All right, now, some news I'm actually super excited about.

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,640
I haven't got to mess with it yet.

126
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,200
In fact, I'm not even sure if it's fully shipping anywhere yet.

127
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,960
I just saw this on GitHub and wanted

128
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,320
to talk about it immediately.

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
It appears that if not right now,

130
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,280
very soon the Raspberry Pi 4 will officially

131
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,480
be able to directly boot from USB.

132
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,920
This sounds pretty cool, Wes, because this

133
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,440
is kind of like the big performance

134
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,120
limitation in my Pi setup.

135
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah, it was.

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,680
You know, I think this change is basically

137
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,760
that the support had been in beta,

138
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,160
and now they're finally saying, yeah, all right.

139
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,640
Everyone can use this now.

140
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,560
You don't have to jump through even more hoops.

141
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,080
Although I still think updating the firmware on a Raspberry Pi

142
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
is a little non-standard.

143
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,000
And so that part can be a little confusing.

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
You got to do like a full upgrade

145
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,680
and then use the firmware-specific commands

146
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,240
that OSes like Raspbian have to make sure

147
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,520
that you've got the right firmware

148
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,840
and the right configuration so that you can actually

149
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,920
use these handy new features.

150
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,440
Tricky, tricky firmware.

151
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,960
I think we'll talk more about that in a moment.

152
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,400
But something else I noticed is it,

153
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,520
and I don't know if you saw this,

154
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,040
but it looks like they're playing around

155
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,120
with treating the USB disks or block devices more

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,160
like SCSI devices, which could also improve performance.

157
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Have you seen this?

158
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,360
Yeah, it seems like people are taking it seriously,

159
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
that you might actually use these things, well,

160
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,040
I guess like you do, Chris, and host your whole home

161
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,080
infrastructure.

162
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,640
And if a whole bunch of the audience is running from USB,

163
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,800
it makes sense to maybe invest in whatever technology

164
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,040
you can find to make that work a little more efficiently.

165
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,200
It's not just a drive there that's

166
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,360
going to have big files from your NAS

167
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
that you never access.

168
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
It might be your whole OS.

169
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,840
Wes, anyone could have a whole home off-grid internet

170
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,120
hot cache in their house as long as they're

171
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,040
willing to have like four Raspberry Pi.

172
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,240
That's all it takes, four.

173
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,360
Is it really only four?

174
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,360
Actually, at the moment, it's only three.

175
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
Once I got on the ButterFS sauce and started

176
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,880
combining my volumes and reloaded everything

177
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,440
onto LTS Ubuntu 20.04, I'm like rocking with less pies

178
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,240
than I ever had to.

179
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,560
It's kind of ridiculous, actually, how great

180
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,760
these Raspberry Pis are.

181
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,320
And now, I can say I have driven them

182
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,400
into the summer of Texas and back, where the booth got up

183
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,840
to 104 degrees in there where these things were running.

184
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,600
And they kept on delivering.

185
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,560
There was a couple of times where thermal throttling kicked

186
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,200
in and the Plex stream cut out or something like that.

187
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,080
But I mean, really, I am very impressed.

188
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,440
They're still running right now.

189
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
And I have like no reason to replace them.

190
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,760
Like I fantasized about an x86 system in there,

191
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,800
just one x86 box with Proxmox that runs everything in VMs

192
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,360
and then just keep it super easy to do snapshots

193
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,640
and swap it to a new box.

194
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,920
But the reality is not only have they been problem-free,

195
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,240
but their low power draw is great for somebody

196
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,600
who's trying to run on solar.

197
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,040
So it's kind of just been a win-win.

198
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,920
I think they're really cool.

199
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,040
And so I'm glad to see the community picking up

200
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,800
around them and making them even more serious boxes in a way.

201
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,440
Now it just has all those little architecture problems

202
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,560
to work out.

203
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:24,960
Yeah.

204
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,320
I mean, it's still probably not an ideal home server,

205
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,280
but with faster disk access coming online,

206
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,680
maybe support for trim, things like that,

207
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,960
it's getting closer.

208
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
I was talking to Alex in the old self-hosted podcast

209
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,480
about a future where I netboot these things.

210
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,800
And maybe one Pi has all the storage

211
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
and the rest all just netboot.

212
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,200
And in that netboot environment, it could just be one cable

213
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,560
because you can get a PoE hat for Raspberry Pis

214
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,960
and you could power them with the ethernet cable

215
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,880
you're using to supply them networking.

216
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,800
And so I could run all these Pis with just a single clean cable

217
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
that goes back to the switch.

218
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,600
That sounds perfect.

219
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,760
And the Raspberry Pi sounds like a great candidate

220
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,680
for being a little netbooting server, right?

221
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,720
I mean, maybe.

222
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,280
We'll see.

223
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,640
I'll see how far I take it.

224
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,840
But the possibilities seem like they're pretty appealing

225
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,400
with the Raspberry Pi platform because it's low power,

226
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,680
because you could run it off PoE,

227
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,640
and now you can netboot or USB boot.

228
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,920
For the kind of setup I'm using,

229
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,000
it just sort of seems to be a perfect little device.

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
I don't know if I'd recommend it for everybody.

231
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
And such a low-cost investment, right?

232
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
I mean, you don't have to go all the way

233
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,080
to configuring a smaller x86 system or something like a NUC

234
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,480
and invest in all that, where you're thinking a lot about,

235
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,680
oh, I got to buy extra hardware.

236
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,080
What memory and SSD am I putting in here?

237
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,760
You're just assembling these Pis, you know,

238
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,440
as you've got a few extra bucks here and there

239
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
because the price point's so low.

240
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,480
Pretty low risk.

241
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,560
And in fact, the last thing I'll say about it

242
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,440
is because it's not going to break the bank,

243
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,600
even to buy an 8-gigabyte one, when you're comparing it

244
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,560
to the cost of a traditional x86 computer,

245
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,760
and if you just need, like in my case, a test one,

246
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,240
I have, I know it sounds silly, but I basically

247
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,680
have a bench Pi that I just use for testing things

248
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,760
before I roll it out on my home setup.

249
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,600
And it's just sort of one of the things you can do

250
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,440
when the thing just costs $40.

251
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,400
Yes, right.

252
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,760
And I mean, in your old life as a professional admin,

253
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,960
you would have spare machines.

254
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,760
You have backups.

255
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,680
You might have hot standbys.

256
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
That's also something that's a little more accessible

257
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,320
in the home lab when your base is a Raspberry Pi

258
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,720
and not a big old x86 server.

259
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,200
Yep.

260
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,120
And actually, to that point, I carry a spare Pi in the RV,

261
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
fully ready to go in the case.

262
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
All I have to do is just pop in an SD card,

263
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,440
or a USB drive, and it's functional again.

264
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
And the idea was that when I went down to Texas,

265
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
if I burned out a Pi, because it seemed very possible.

266
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,640
Literally burned out.

267
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,200
Yeah.

268
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
I would pull that Pi, pull its storage,

269
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,640
and then pop in the new Pi, which are literally Velcro

270
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,680
to the inside of this booth.

271
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,960
So it's literally, you pull it off,

272
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,560
and you slide in the new one to the Velcro

273
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
and just reconnect all of the accessories,

274
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,480
and it just picks up and takes right over.

275
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,320
And because it's a $40 device, for me, it's worth it.

276
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
It's like an insurance policy to just have one.

277
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
To just have one in the cupboard ready to go.

278
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
So there's advantages to it.

279
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,160
But there is those tricky things like the firmware.

280
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,800
Yes.

281
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,720
And that's why it's the perfect opportunity

282
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,880
to chat with Carl Rochelle from System76, who, I got to say,

283
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,520
has really delivered on a promise that didn't seem all

284
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,080
that deliverable.

285
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,120
How often do people say, buy this product from us,

286
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,280
and it's running this type of firmware today,

287
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,840
but we promise one day we'll make it possible for you

288
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,720
to replace that firmware.

289
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,920
That's just often one of those promises that gets missed.

290
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,720
And I think System76 has delivered here.

291
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,760
Because if I'm not mistaken, not only has the OpenFirmware

292
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,160
project at System76 gotten continued development,

293
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,640
which is awesome, but it looks like it's

294
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,120
been widened to previous machines

295
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,400
that have already shipped.

296
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,360
Is that right, Carl?

297
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,640
Well, you're hitting on, I think,

298
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,520
what is the most notable part of this work.

299
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,760
I mean, first, it's quite an achievement

300
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,480
to get OpenFirmware on machines on day zero.

301
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,360
Meaning, when they're available from Intel or AMD,

302
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,480
we have OpenFirmware.

303
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,400
Well, AMD coming soon.

304
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,520
But Intel, we have available on day zero

305
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,000
when the chipsets are available and when the CPUs are available.

306
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
And that was quite a lift.

307
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,880
But once you start building the infrastructure

308
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,560
and the knowledge and the know-how to do it,

309
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,600
things start moving faster.

310
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,920
And so being who we are, we like to try

311
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,280
to push it further to more things

312
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,440
that will further liberate our customers and their computers.

313
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,120
And so we went to the OpenEC, which to me

314
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,880
is the most exciting part about all the firmware,

315
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,440
because the EC is what controls the things

316
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,640
that you feel about a machine, like the fan curves,

317
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,880
the hotkeys, and the interaction between the-

318
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
And we're talking about the embedded controller here,

319
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,440
right?

320
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,560
Right, the embedded controller.

321
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
Yeah, the interaction between the computer,

322
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,520
the hardware, and the operating system,

323
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,040
those things that you really see as a user,

324
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,000
that happens at the EC.

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
So with the Lemur, when that came out,

326
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,720
that was our first model that had an open source EC

327
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
that we wrote all the firmware for.

328
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,360
As you had alluded to, even though all that's super exciting,

329
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,960
something that we were able to do

330
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,800
that I don't think most companies would do

331
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,280
is invest in bringing this technology

332
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,520
to existing customers for products

333
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,800
that we're already shipping,

334
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,760
and we're working on bringing it to customers

335
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,440
whose products we aren't shipping any longer.

336
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,120
So you're going to get those advantages

337
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,560
from that work that we've done,

338
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,600
and we really are starting at a chipset level.

339
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
So we can say the chipsets in the current Gazelle

340
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,760
and Adder and Serval were the same chipsets

341
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,560
as the previous models, although there were some changes,

342
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,240
but that means the bulk of the work was done,

343
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,120
so we can port to those previous models,

344
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,720
run through the QC team,

345
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,920
and ship our customers liberated firmware.

346
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,880
Well, congratulations.

347
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,680
So I have a question about that.

348
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,520
But just on the side, Karl,

349
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,120
has Intel's protracted development cycle

350
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,800
enabled this in any way?

351
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,360
No, not really.

352
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,560
What enabled it was Intel reaching out to us

353
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,600
and asking us to partner on making open source firmware.

354
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,320
Oh.

355
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,280
Right, yeah.

356
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,640
Okay, wait a minute.

357
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,360
Hold on, hold on a second.

358
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,200
That's not something I understood about this before.

359
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,120
Intel is aware of what you are doing

360
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,800
and copacetic with it?

361
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,720
Oh, not only that, we have a Slack channel

362
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,400
where we chat with their firmware engineers

363
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,920
How is this a thing?

364
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,960
Yeah, well, that's what got it all rolling.

365
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,480
Wow, that's amazing.

366
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,680
Yeah, they reached out to us and said,

367
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,280
hey, we want to do open firmware.

368
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,960
And then their team came out.

369
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,240
They had, it was quite, it was kind of wild.

370
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,480
Their firmware team came out

371
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,120
and they had this long presentation

372
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,640
that after eight hours, they're like,

373
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,600
okay, let's come back tomorrow.

374
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,800
We have some more to show you.

375
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
Wow.

376
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,800
So we cut for the day, we come back the next day,

377
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,880
so we cut for the day, we come back the next morning.

378
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
They have like a few more slides to go through

379
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,400
and they were back chatting

380
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,160
and they're like, they say,

381
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,960
hey, so will you guys partner with us on firmware?

382
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,200
And we essentially said, you had us at open source.

383
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,880
So that was enough.

384
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,320
You had us about 12 hours ago.

385
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,440
Well, that's really neat.

386
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,360
I didn't quite realize that.

387
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,960
Yeah, we have access to the documentation

388
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,520
that's necessary to enable hardware,

389
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,000
things like Thunderbolt that we just couldn't do before

390
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,040
that now we're able to do

391
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,920
and offer on products with open firmware.

392
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,320
And now the same thing's happening with AMD.

393
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,360
We're working with Google and AMD

394
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,080
on open source firmware for AMD platforms.

395
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,040
How is that developing?

396
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,360
Is that also going pretty smoothly?

397
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,320
It's going pretty well.

398
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,840
We were working,

399
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,760
well, we've just been working through legal for a moment,

400
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,440
but I think we're past the-

401
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,640
Sure, I bet there's a lot of that.

402
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,120
Yeah, there's a bit of that,

403
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,040
but I think we're past the legal as of this week

404
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,080
and that means, it didn't slow us down too much,

405
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,360
but it does mean certain,

406
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,480
just want to be on good sound footing

407
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,560
when you're doing any kind of open source work.

408
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,280
Sure, absolutely.

409
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,720
Yeah, we'll be able to move more quickly

410
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,800
now that that's past us

411
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,000
and onwards and upwards with open firmware.

412
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,920
Well, so here was my actual original question

413
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,200
before that aside is,

414
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,640
practically speaking as an end user,

415
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,560
what is the benefit for me?

416
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,240
I mean, I like the idea

417
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
of the world having a better understanding

418
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,960
of what makes my computer run,

419
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,120
but what is an actual practical benefit that I get?

420
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,720
Right, because this is like a big investment

421
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,680
for you guys, right?

422
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
You're putting engineering hours

423
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,960
investing in making all these changes.

424
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,560
What does that mean to a customer?

425
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,240
Right, well, the first thing is

426
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
that we can very rapidly respond to our customers

427
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,400
in ways that we couldn't before.

428
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
If there's a problem or an enhancement

429
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
that we can do through the firmware,

430
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,960
something simple like, for example,

431
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,880
when you close the lemur lid,

432
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,480
with a customer reported to us,

433
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,600
it's a little scary to do,

434
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,520
but if you put enough pressure on the lid,

435
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,960
you can touch one of the keys underneath

436
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,560
on the keyboard and turn on the machine.

437
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,200
So now we can very quickly spin out,

438
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,680
work on a fix and roll that out to our customers

439
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,000
and that keyboard when the lid is shut,

440
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,240
will no longer activate or resume from suspend.

441
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,400
So our response, our ability to respond

442
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,120
is a lot faster.

443
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,680
And the really cool stuff

444
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,640
you're gonna start seeing

445
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,240
coming over the next few months.

446
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,760
That's things like battery thresholds

447
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,400
that are built in to the embedded controller

448
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,240
or can be controlled in the embedded controller

449
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,760
in the operating system.

450
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,080
So in Pop OS, you can do things

451
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,680
to extend your battery life

452
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
or the life of your battery.

453
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,800
The life of your battery.

454
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,080
Is that, so are you implying like

455
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,440
charge control settings?

456
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,400
Charge control, right.

457
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,080
Yeah, battery thresholds and charge control.

458
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,320
So...

459
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
Oh, that's great.

460
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,560
Yeah, in GNOME settings,

461
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,760
you'll see options for maximum,

462
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,960
charge it all the way up

463
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,920
or charge it 80%

464
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,600
and or maximum battery longevity, 60%.

465
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, that's fantastic.

466
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,120
It's, you know, again,

467
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
those are things that you can't do

468
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,480
without control of the firmware.

469
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,160
And then one that I'm really excited about

470
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,720
because I like altering my keyboards.

471
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,480
I like to change the key map around

472
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
to things that I'm more efficient with.

473
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
So I like to do that.

474
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,880
Are we talking Dvorak here or something else?

475
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,040
No, mostly I like to use,

476
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,160
I like to move around the things

477
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,200
down by the space bar.

478
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,920
Oh, sure.

479
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,400
Yeah, see, I like to use my thumbs when I can

480
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
and having alt next to my space bar

481
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,440
is basically useless

482
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
and then don't do anything with it.

483
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,640
So with this, with open source firmware

484
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
and the embedded controller,

485
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
we're working on an application

486
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,320
that will ship as a utility with our products

487
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,920
that you can move the key maps around.

488
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,200
You can create function layers.

489
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,920
You can alter...

490
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,280
Is this firmware level changes?

491
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,880
So it would be persistent or is this...

492
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,560
Right, right. And it's persistent.

493
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,280
So when you save them, it saves it to the EC

494
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,520
and those changes are persistent.

495
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,720
All right, well, I mean,

496
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,840
I bet you have a whole other list,

497
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,040
but you've got me convinced.

498
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
So my question is, what is the risk

499
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,520
do you feel like as a company

500
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,160
for reflashing these firmwares

501
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
on machines that are in production?

502
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,640
They're out in the wild doing who knows what

503
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,720
connected to who knows what

504
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,040
and you're updating a pretty core part.

505
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,120
That must have been at least some point

506
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
of heart burning consternation for a bit

507
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,160
to figure that out.

508
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,200
Well, that is challenging

509
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,960
and it hasn't gone without some hiccups.

510
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,760
Usually what we'd like to do

511
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,240
is roll it out into the factory first.

512
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,480
So that means the factory is going to see

513
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
a lot of different configurations

514
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,640
that might not be in the wild

515
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,320
or that are in the wild,

516
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,680
but we're on proprietary firmware.

517
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,840
And through that process,

518
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,480
we can catch a lot of problems

519
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,920
that might happen.

520
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,960
But yeah, it is risky.

521
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,880
And so we also enabled rolling back

522
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,280
so that if there's something

523
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,560
that we haven't caught,

524
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,160
a customer can roll back to price

525
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,520
proprietary firmware.

526
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,080
We can examine what might be the cause

527
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,840
and get it fixed.

528
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,640
Oh, OK.

529
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,080
So there is an escape hatch.

530
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,360
So that's always nice.

531
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,720
That's the best you can really go for

532
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,000
when you're doing these kinds of things,

533
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,480
really.

534
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,440
Wow, well, this is pretty exciting.

535
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,800
So what customers starting now

536
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,400
can get this that didn't have this before?

537
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,080
It looks like it's the Adder workstation

538
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,640
and the Gazelle.

539
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,360
Is that right?

540
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,400
The Adder and the Gazelle.

541
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
We're also looking at the previous

542
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,960
generation Adder,

543
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,480
previous generation Oryx.

544
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,080
And I think that's going to probably

545
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,760
fill out the product line for where

546
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
our starting point is.

547
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
And from there on out,

548
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,880
we will be working with open firmware.

549
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,680
Wow.

550
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,400
Well, I guess my last obligatory question

551
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
is, do I have to be on Pop OS

552
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,520
to get these new firmwares?

553
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,720
Or is there a means for people

554
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,760
outside of Pop OS?

555
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,280
Outside of Pop OS to get it too?

556
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,120
No, you can get it with any Linux

557
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,320
distribution or Windows.

558
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,160
You just use a USB stick

559
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,840
and you boot to the USB stick and run it.

560
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,280
It's like a it's like a mini operating

561
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,400
system, really, that will

562
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,080
will update the firmware for you.

563
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,600
Could you do it from within Pop OS,

564
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,000
though?

565
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,440
You can do it from within Pop OS

566
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,480
and you could do it within

567
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,240
I think any Ubuntu base would be

568
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,600
essentially the same.

569
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,240
OK.

570
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,560
The features that we're working on that

571
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,960
to improve the operating system

572
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,160
experience of the hardware experience

573
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,040
through the operating system

574
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,800
with this firmware are things

575
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,840
that we're going to have.

576
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,520
Some of them will be add on applications

577
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,520
like the keyboard mapping

578
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,120
and that that utility.

579
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,360
But we're working upstream with Gnome

580
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,640
on battery thresholds.

581
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,240
We just filed some issues up there

582
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,440
and we're working on design.

583
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,480
So we hope that that's something

584
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,760
that will be usable not only

585
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,120
by System76 customers, but

586
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,320
there are standard interfaces,

587
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,600
kernel interfaces for this.

588
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,800
So that means if we can get

589
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,040
this work done, other laptops

590
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,640
that do have this type of

591
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
functionality in their firmware

592
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,320
will be able to take advantage of it, too.

593
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,600
Carl, don't you know how capitalism

594
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,080
supposed to work?

595
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,120
You're supposed to keep all this stuff

596
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,680
for yourself.

597
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
You know, I don't think that's

598
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,360
the way to do it anymore.

599
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,800
You might be onto something.

600
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,520
You might be.

601
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,920
Yeah.

602
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,800
You know, I don't know.

603
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,320
You know, this does make me curious.

604
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,480
You know, you guys have been exploring

605
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,760
more, you know, with the Thelio

606
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,560
making your own stuff.

607
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,720
And there's talk maybe someday

608
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,800
of a, you know, in-house laptop

609
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,960
has working at this low level of hardware

610
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,240
given you guys any insights there

611
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,520
to future designs?

612
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,600
It has. Well, in some ways,

613
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,360
in that we want the work that we do

614
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,200
to be as open source as

615
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,480
is possible, given the resources

616
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,520
and supply chain we have.

617
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,200
So we've learned things from that.

618
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,040
But where we've learned,

619
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,320
where I think we're learning more

620
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,920
is actually in our keyboard project,

621
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,560
believe it or not.

622
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,440
Because in that project,

623
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,800
we've designed a PCB.

624
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
There's some secret sauce

625
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,040
in the keyboard project

626
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,120
that enables us to learn

627
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,080
some other things

628
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,520
and had great gain experience

629
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,360
with laptops.

630
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,040
But the third thing it does is

631
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,720
we're working on precision milling

632
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,520
with the keyboard.

633
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,480
Oh, sure.

634
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,000
So with precision milling,

635
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
we'll have a better understanding

636
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
of how to approach laptop chassis design.

637
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,760
What an interesting way to kind of

638
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,000
step to that kind of project

639
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,560
and learning at this level

640
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,720
is not only safer for the business,

641
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,640
but you'll also no doubt

642
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,680
end up making a product

643
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,600
that I think the community would be

644
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,560
interested in purchasing.

645
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,840
So it's kind of a win win.

646
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
It's kind of clever, Carl.

647
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,800
I didn't expect all of the perks

648
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,000
that you mentioned with the open firmware.

649
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,640
And I got to say,

650
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,760
I didn't expect the...

651
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,360
I don't know how I missed that detail

652
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,400
about the fact that you guys

653
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,280
were working with Intel,

654
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
but all this stuff looks really good.

655
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,640
You know, as long as...

656
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,760
As soon as I can get a laptop

657
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,960
with a 2K screen, Carl,

658
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
soon as I think you might have

659
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,080
a new customer.

660
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,040
It's just a dream.

661
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,440
It's a dream.

662
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,800
But it's the panel manufacturers

663
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,520
that need to deliver.

664
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,880
Have you seen the Adder?

665
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,680
I just have to ask.

666
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,480
I don't recall.

667
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,440
I do know about the Adder,

668
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
but does it have a dedicated GPU?

669
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,160
It does.

670
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,800
Oh, okay.

671
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,040
Let's see.

672
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,640
I thought it was Intel GPU.

673
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,440
It's dedicated,

674
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,040
but with hybrid graphics

675
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,760
and it has an OLED display

676
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,120
that is the absolute

677
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,640
most gorgeous display.

678
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,120
Really?

679
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,840
Possible.

680
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,400
Yeah.

681
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,120
It's striking.

682
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,440
Really?

683
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
I can't even put my laptops next to it.

684
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,840
This might look terrible next to it.

685
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,880
Okay.

686
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,600
Too good.

687
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,100
Yeah.

688
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,760
All right.

689
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,240
All right.

690
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,640
Okay.

691
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,080
I'll have to give that one a look.

692
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
Well, Carl, thanks for coming on

693
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,320
and chatting about that.

694
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,680
You're welcome to hang out

695
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,400
for the rest of the show

696
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,440
or you are cleared free

697
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,560
to navigate as Unique.

698
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,760
I'm sure you got lots to do too,

699
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,000
but I appreciate the update on stuff.

700
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,200
He's got keyboard settings to tweak.

701
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,840
Come on, Chris.

702
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,040
Thanks for having me, guys.

703
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,360
Yeah.

704
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,000
Thanks, Carl.

705
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,480
It was great.

706
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,960
Linode.com slash unplugged.

707
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,200
Get a $100 60-day credit

708
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,560
on a new account.

709
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,440
Linode solves the problem of servers,

710
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,880
whether it's a big powerful GPU powered server

711
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,560
or something that just gets a job done

712
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,040
in the background

713
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,920
that you never think about.

714
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,480
They've got the whole range to choose from.

715
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,280
I go with Linode

716
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,800
for not only my personal stuff,

717
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,440
but for all of our

718
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,840
Jupiter broadcasting infrastructure as well.

719
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,160
And Linode costs 30 to 50% less

720
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,000
than competitors like AWS.

721
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
And they have a much better interface

722
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,560
and dashboard.

723
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,080
But I think more importantly for us,

724
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,040
Linux is baked into their culture.

725
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,240
You might recall Jeff Dyke,

726
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,680
who was an active Linux contributor,

727
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,800
had developed a technology

728
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,520
called User Mode Linux a decade ago.

729
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,560
Plus now.

730
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,280
Wow.

731
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,880
User Mode Linux allowed developers

732
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,840
create virtual machines

733
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,080
within Linux computers.

734
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,280
And at the time,

735
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,720
single use applications

736
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,160
seemed like the way to go.

737
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,920
But some developers saw a different path.

738
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,960
And one of those developers

739
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,000
was a young technologist

740
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,280
named Christopher Acker.

741
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,480
He saw an opportunity

742
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,560
to use the hypervisor technology

743
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,600
not only to build something

744
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,040
like Salesforce or Amazon,

745
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,640
but to build something

746
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,000
that made cloud computing

747
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,360
less complicated,

748
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,560
less expensive,

749
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,440
and more accessible

750
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,320
to every developer,

751
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,080
regardless of where they're located

752
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,840
or what their resources were.

753
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,520
He built a company around that idea.

754
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,280
And that company is Linode.

755
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,280
They helped pioneer cloud computing.

756
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,520
And now, two decades later,

757
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,600
Linode is the largest independent

758
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,440
open cloud provider in the world

759
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,760
with 11 global data centers.

760
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,280
The culture and experience

761
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,240
in the Linux community

762
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,000
is baked into every aspect

763
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,800
of the company

764
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,160
from their own internal culture,

765
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,560
but also the controls they give you

766
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,480
over the servers themselves.

767
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,520
For my infrastructure,

768
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,360
I generally go with a mid-tier system.

769
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
But for the boxes that do encoding,

770
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,040
we went with dedicated CPUs.

771
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,720
And for my system that essentially

772
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
just acts as a jump host,

773
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,760
well, that's a $5 a month system.

774
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,280
I take advantage of object storage

775
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,800
is backed by native SSDs

776
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,680
and enterprise grade

777
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,440
40 gigabit connections.

778
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,480
It's really fast.

779
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,440
It's easy to use.

780
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,680
And they're part of the Linux community.

781
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,720
You get started by going

782
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,560
to linode.com slash unplugged.

783
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,640
You get that $100 60 day credit

784
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,600
on your new account

785
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,960
and you're off to the races.

786
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,160
Go see what you can build.

787
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,880
linode.com slash unplugged.

788
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,280
I fantasize about an open power,

789
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,440
you know, like an open power PC laptop.

790
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,560
Who doesn't?

791
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,400
And it turns out

792
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,840
that the Open Power Summit

793
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,720
was this week.

794
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,440
And there has been an update

795
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,320
on the status of a power PC laptop.

796
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,360
It's not power PC

797
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,160
like you used to note.

798
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,920
IBM has really been promoting

799
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,360
how in they are

800
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,640
with how open this thing is.

801
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,520
They also released

802
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,400
a bunch of other stuff

803
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
open source over the week.

804
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,800
We'll have a link

805
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,640
to all of the video presentations

806
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,520
which cover a ton

807
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,400
of the announcements

808
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,560
in the show notes.

809
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,000
But the Linux Foundation

810
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,280
had the Open Power Summit

811
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,680
North America edition

812
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,240
is what it's called.

813
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,920
I guess there's multiple editions.

814
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,400
I didn't realize that,

815
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,840
but the recordings are online.

816
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,200
So we're going to leave

817
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,720
most of the homework up to you.

818
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,440
But there was one

819
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,960
that did catch our attention.

820
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,360
Roberto Inocenti provided an update

821
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,680
on the power 64 laptop

822
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,960
and still being worked on

823
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,120
via community donations

824
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,760
as an open hardware platform.

825
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,640
Now we should know

826
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,160
before you get too excited.

827
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,960
Mostly this is R&D right now

828
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
as opposed to being focused

829
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,440
on making or selling

830
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,720
a physical product.

831
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,320
But you got to start somewhere.

832
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,240
We have this difficult know

833
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,200
how to solve this

834
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,640
was not simple to find

835
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,680
even already built

836
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,640
body, notebook body.

837
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,680
But at the end,

838
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
thanks to Slimbook

839
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,520
we was able to find this solution.

840
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,880
So nowadays we have the possibility

841
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,440
we have designed our motherboard

842
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,760
especially for Slimbook's Eclipse.

843
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,080
This is the model

844
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,600
that is a game oriented

845
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,960
the notebook body.

846
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,680
Yeah, the Slimbook Eclipse chassis

847
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,160
is what they're aiming at.

848
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
And they think that it's kind of like

849
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,680
it's kind of like you got to know

850
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,880
the chassis you're building for

851
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,520
to really do all

852
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
the electrical stuff properly.

853
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,680
So this is going to great

854
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,640
to just get this nailed down

855
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,760
and they're going to include

856
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,800
a GPU in there.

857
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,160
I don't I don't know where it really

858
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,840
stacks up in the grand scheme of things.

859
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,800
But this entire project

860
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,120
really been going since 2014.

861
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
It's it's slow R&D

862
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,400
but there's been various points

863
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
along the way where they've

864
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,840
done a community fundraiser

865
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,440
to get over whatever

866
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,640
particular mountain they happen

867
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,160
to be climbing at that moment.

868
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,440
And they're reaching another

869
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,960
one of those moments right now.

870
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,200
And I got to say,

871
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,560
it's not going very well.

872
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,000
This is getting really close

873
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,840
to an actual laptop here,

874
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,600
an actual power PC laptop

875
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,000
that isn't a known good chassis.

876
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,720
But the funding is stalled.

877
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,080
They are aiming for five thousand

878
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,160
and they've got eight hundred and ten

879
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,320
of non-U.S. funny money.

880
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,280
And the reality is,

881
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,400
is that that trajectory,

882
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,520
they're just not going to get there.

883
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,760
There's been a couple of two hundred dollars.

884
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,560
Well, not dollars.

885
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,280
It's funny money.

886
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
There's been a couple of donations

887
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,060
here and there.

888
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,400
But I don't think

889
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,280
it's going to make it, Wes.

890
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,160
I don't unless unless this changes

891
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,040
or they get the word out

892
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,920
and this has been running

893
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,280
since the 7th of September.

894
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,800
Unless they get the word out,

895
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,920
I don't think it's going to make it.

896
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,320
Yeah.

897
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,600
I mean, if you're interested,

898
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,120
I guess now's the time.

899
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,800
We were recently debating,

900
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,880
discussing, contemplating

901
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,800
the future after the Nvidia

902
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,920
ARM acquisition.

903
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,160
And we sort of jokingly

904
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,840
threw out open power.

905
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,520
But it does turn out that there's

906
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
there's a lot going on in this space

907
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,840
and maybe maybe we all need to be

908
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,960
paying a little more attention

909
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
and just investing a little bit more.

910
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,760
Maybe it's a pipe dream.

911
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,640
Maybe everybody just feels like it's

912
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,600
you know, they're writing it off.

913
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,000
It's just it just seems like it's

914
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,680
it's been going since 2014.

915
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,800
And by the time they're done,

916
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,520
it's not even going to be

917
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,640
really a competitive system.

918
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,240
It's just going to be a right.

919
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,600
I mean, you're still in those stages

920
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,880
of trying to get it to work

921
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,480
at all, really, right?

922
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,040
To get it, you know,

923
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,000
get it all pieced together,

924
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,280
get it in the right form factor.

925
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,800
And then by the time you're done,

926
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,320
well, it's hardly going to be

927
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,640
competitive with the latest XPS 13

928
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,480
or system 76 offering.

929
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,600
Yeah, yeah.

930
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,960
Well, OK, speaking of arm.

931
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,960
You know, Endeavor OS,

932
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,440
which born out of integrals.

933
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,840
Well, they're aiming

934
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,000
for an arm launch themselves.

935
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,720
So you'll be able to get

936
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,320
Endeavor OS on arm,

937
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,440
which since Manjaro has been

938
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,800
pretty much the only arch

939
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,840
derivative targeting arm,

940
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,280
they've kind of ran away with it.

941
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,720
But now Endeavor OS realizes

942
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,920
maybe we missed the mark.

943
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,000
Now, we probably should note

944
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,440
that Endeavor OS at the moment

945
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,040
is still a small team,

946
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,800
so they haven't tested it on

947
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,160
all possible arm devices

948
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,240
because that's just crazy.

949
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,880
But if you're, you know,

950
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,080
running like an Odroid

951
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,120
or, of course, a Raspberry Pi 4,

952
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,480
well, then, yeah, you're in luck.

953
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,080
Yeah, let's let's file

954
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,000
Endeavor OS away for talking about

955
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,280
later on in the show today,

956
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,880
because I think that kind of comes up

957
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,560
in the area that we're

958
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,520
going to be talking about.

959
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,520
Yes, in the meantime,

960
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,880
let's do a little housekeeping.

961
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
Now, this here program is live

962
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,240
on a Tuesday at noon Pacific

963
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,520
over at jblive.tv.

964
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
We were off last week,

965
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,160
but we're back.

966
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,360
I mean, if you get the download,

967
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,880
we were never away.

968
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,480
You won't notice a thing.

969
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,640
But we're back in our regular lifetime,

970
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,280
and we'd love to have you

971
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,640
join us in the Mumble Room.

972
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,280
Also, if you're around on Sunday

973
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,080
at the same time,

974
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,960
just a different day,

975
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,400
the Luplug is going.

976
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,120
You can get in there

977
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,000
and just chat Linux

978
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,280
with like-minded folks

979
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
in our Mumble Room lobby.

980
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,240
And then, you know,

981
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,280
your mobile is all set up.

982
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,720
So when you're playing

983
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,440
hooky from work,

984
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,800
you could jump in there

985
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,160
and join us on the show.

986
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,960
That's great.

987
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,760
You're already set up.

988
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,400
Why not do it?

989
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,800
And also, last but not least,

990
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,560
thank you to our members.

991
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,320
Our core contributors are helping

992
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,840
not only this show run independently,

993
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,360
but right now they're helping

994
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,080
do the production.

995
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,280
Like it just wouldn't be possible

996
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,840
without them.

997
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,760
It's it's fantastic.

998
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,360
If you'd like to be a core contributor,

999
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,120
you can go to unpluggedcore.com.

1000
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,440
You get two feeds to choose from

1001
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,400
the live version,

1002
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,800
which is a lot longer of a show.

1003
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,320
So if you have a long commute

1004
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,800
or you just want more Linux unplugged,

1005
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,960
you want to hear all of our mistakes.

1006
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,920
Yeah, or, you know,

1007
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,840
welcoming guests on as they join us

1008
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,880
and we get all set up

1009
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,520
and all of our friends

1010
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,320
join the Mumble Room.

1011
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,920
We all catch up with each other.

1012
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,440
That's what's going on there.

1013
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,080
And then, of course,

1014
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,640
in the post show,

1015
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,360
we're usually fired up

1016
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,880
about something from the show.

1017
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,640
We usually get into something

1018
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,160
and it just doesn't make into the show

1019
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
because we also want to have

1020
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,360
a tight edited version

1021
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,640
available for everybody.

1022
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,440
And if you're a member,

1023
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,360
that's where that second feed comes in.

1024
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
You get a version of that show

1025
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,520
with limited ads.

1026
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,720
There's some that are contractually

1027
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,760
obligated to be in there,

1028
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,880
but most aren't.

1029
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,480
And we cut them out.

1030
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,160
You still get the same great production,

1031
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,080
just no ads.

1032
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,760
And those are available for our members

1033
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,080
at unpluggedcore.com.

1034
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,280
Unpluggedcore.com.

1035
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,360
Thank you, everybody who joined up.

1036
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,240
We really appreciate it.

1037
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,840
And Mr. Payne with that.

1038
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,480
That's the housekeeping.

1039
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,160
Still keeping it pretty tidy these days.

1040
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,360
Yeah, it looks good in here.

1041
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,480
I got the natural light,

1042
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,160
a few more houseplants,

1043
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,200
ship shape.

1044
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,400
You got houseplants?

1045
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,880
Really?

1046
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,160
Do you really have houseplants?

1047
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,720
Of course.

1048
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:19,920
Huh.

1049
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,400
I don't know.

1050
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,640
I just I didn't picture you as

1051
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,720
not that you wouldn't have houseplants

1052
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,440
because I mean,

1053
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,480
I'm sure you have a lovely place.

1054
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,160
But what I didn't picture

1055
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,360
is you being the kind of guy

1056
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,520
who takes an afternoon

1057
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,360
to go out and buy plants,

1058
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,600
you know,

1059
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,560
because it's not like you just

1060
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,680
it's not like a precision thing

1061
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,320
where you just run out

1062
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,800
and get a plant.

1063
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,920
You got a plant shop.

1064
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,560
You got to figure out

1065
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,240
what plant place you're going to go to.

1066
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
You got to get plant maintenance supplies.

1067
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,600
And that's where I just didn't really

1068
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,720
see you being into it.

1069
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,840
Well, it helps when you have

1070
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,560
too many friends

1071
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,160
who are also into plants

1072
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,000
and just offering you cuttings

1073
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,720
all the time.

1074
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:50,960
I see.

1075
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,000
So they come over and they go,

1076
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
Wes, plant pushers.

1077
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,520
Wes, we got to do something about this.

1078
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,880
We got to liven it up in here.

1079
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,680
There's no green.

1080
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,680
These poor dogs.

1081
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,880
Well, OK, so let's talk about

1082
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,840
some poor distributions

1083
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,280
that despite how interesting

1084
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,240
and compelling they might be,

1085
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,760
I don't know if they're ever

1086
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,960
going to get traction.

1087
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,560
It might be my bias.

1088
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,600
You may have noticed

1089
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,560
in this here program,

1090
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,000
we don't do a lot

1091
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,200
of distro reviews anymore.

1092
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,240
Used to do a lot

1093
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,120
of distro reviews.

1094
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,520
But now we kind of just

1095
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,920
do the big heavy hitters

1096
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,840
because I think

1097
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,400
and it's just been

1098
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,440
an unspoken bias

1099
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,360
that may have developed.

1100
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,360
I can't really see me

1101
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,320
coming on this show

1102
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,240
and telling you about

1103
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,840
how great Deep in 20 is

1104
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
and getting more than five percent

1105
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,320
of you from actually switching

1106
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,200
from your actual

1107
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,240
daily driver Linux.

1108
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,520
It just doesn't seem

1109
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,400
like it's going to happen.

1110
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,880
Yeah, you know,

1111
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,680
this really started

1112
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,960
quite the discussion between us.

1113
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,160
Just we were, you know,

1114
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,200
Deep in 20 came out

1115
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,480
and it was it was on our radar.

1116
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,600
We were interested in it.

1117
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,320
I mean, there's a lot

1118
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,000
about it to like, seemingly,

1119
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,880
at least from the bit

1120
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,840
that I've played with it.

1121
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,680
But yeah, who are we

1122
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,720
recommending it for?

1123
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,200
And where does that fit

1124
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,480
in where Linux is going

1125
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,160
and where desktop Linux

1126
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,760
fits in 2020?

1127
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,880
And here's a scenario for you.

1128
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,560
OK, so we're not going to be able

1129
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,000
to convince a diehard

1130
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,800
arch user or a person

1131
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,160
who believes in the elementary

1132
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,120
way of designing

1133
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,480
an operating system or somebody

1134
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,760
who has been an Ubuntu user

1135
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,280
and used it for work for years.

1136
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,560
We're not going to convince them

1137
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,000
that Deep in 20 is something

1138
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,800
that's even worth them

1139
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
really trying because they've

1140
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,720
got work to do.

1141
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,920
They're set in their ways.

1142
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,880
You have people who like to

1143
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,560
hobby hop and they'll try it out,

1144
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,280
but you're not going to get

1145
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,320
actually any real traction.

1146
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,360
Like the distribution isn't going

1147
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,720
to see millions in growth.

1148
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,720
And so then I thought, well,

1149
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,920
maybe it's for new users,

1150
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,000
new users who are already

1151
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,040
not set in their ways.

1152
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,080
You know, they're open to the

1153
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,320
possibilities that the many,

1154
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,520
many distros provide.

1155
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,320
But then I thought, wouldn't

1156
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
that be a disservice to that

1157
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,240
end user if you set them up

1158
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,400
on a niche distribution

1159
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,920
and then expect them to just go

1160
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,920
about their computing life

1161
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,280
as if they can just get

1162
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,400
everything done that they could

1163
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,600
if they are on Windows or Mac

1164
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,320
or Ubuntu?

1165
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,600
No, of course not.

1166
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,800
Now, now that they're on this

1167
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,080
niche distribution, it's much

1168
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,120
harder for them to do any

1169
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,080
research and find support,

1170
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,040
especially if their Google

1171
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,400
foo isn't tuned to years of

1172
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,280
Linux searching.

1173
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,000
That's just it.

1174
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,160
Sure, Deepin has a Debian base,

1175
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,280
but if you don't really

1176
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,720
understand how all of that

1177
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,840
works and you're Googling

1178
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,360
specifically for the OS that

1179
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,480
your system tells you you're

1180
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,160
running, that might be more

1181
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,640
trouble.

1182
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,760
Well, and how would they even be

1183
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,600
able to deduce what the base OS

1184
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,000
is? Right.

1185
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,680
I mean, that's just they're

1186
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,720
just not thinking like that.

1187
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,560
That's not how a consumer that

1188
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,000
isn't actively selecting and

1189
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,200
choosing an operating system

1190
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,120
like this conceives of the

1191
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,160
construction of the computer.

1192
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,280
That's just not that's not where

1193
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,240
their head is at.

1194
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,800
Right.

1195
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,160
So Deepin isn't great for new

1196
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,240
users, then necessarily unless

1197
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,440
it's a managed environment,

1198
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,800
perhaps where there is an

1199
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,160
administrator who can guide and

1200
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,960
help users.

1201
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,560
But that's a pretty niche case

1202
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,000
for a pretty niche distribution

1203
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,560
all of a sudden.

1204
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,720
And so as you whittle it down,

1205
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,840
you start to you start to

1206
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,440
realize like we really have no

1207
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,680
shot of convincing an arch user

1208
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,120
to move off arch or a Fedora

1209
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,200
user to switch to Ubuntu.

1210
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,240
I mean, they may elect on their

1211
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,960
own based on some of the

1212
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,480
features we talk about, but I

1213
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,600
think I just started realizing

1214
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,440
there's almost no point to it

1215
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,520
other than just for the

1216
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
technical exploration, which I

1217
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,720
enjoy and I think is worth it on

1218
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,360
its own.

1219
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,800
But it doesn't really seem to go

1220
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,360
beyond that.

1221
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,080
And and so I can't really fathom

1222
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,000
a reality where a distribution

1223
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,440
like Deepin or a distribution

1224
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,680
like Endeavor OS really has a

1225
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,200
shot of ever going beyond a few

1226
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,560
hundred thousand users.

1227
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,000
You know, Mini Mac over in the

1228
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,560
IRC raises the question if if

1229
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,160
we're not going to be, you know,

1230
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,560
spreading the word, who will?

1231
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,760
Yeah, I guess the question,

1232
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,960
Brent, is what is their what is

1233
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,240
their definition of success?

1234
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,000
If it's perhaps to scratch

1235
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,080
their own itch, then, you know,

1236
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,640
check.

1237
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,960
But if it's to attract a rich

1238
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,640
community, then there needs to

1239
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,920
be a way of spreading that

1240
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,800
regularly.

1241
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,120
Right.

1242
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,800
And maybe there's a fatigue

1243
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,040
there, fatigue for finding new

1244
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,880
interesting stuff.

1245
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,840
Yeah, I could definitely see

1246
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,080
that.

1247
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,200
And I think there's also the

1248
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,560
question of relevancy, the

1249
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,240
operating system as a whole.

1250
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,200
If you were to just take the

1251
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,800
base temperature of the

1252
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,480
computing industry, the

1253
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,080
importance of the desktop has

1254
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,920
rescinded a bit and the

1255
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,520
importance of the web browser

1256
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,680
and the importance of mobile has

1257
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,880
ascended quite a bit.

1258
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,920
And I think you have to

1259
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,080
consider that has to have some

1260
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,840
sort of perceptive knock on

1261
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,120
effect on the Linux desktop as

1262
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,280
well.

1263
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,000
It has to.

1264
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,400
You could imply from that that,

1265
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,000
well, if the desktop itself has

1266
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,720
become less important, then the

1267
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,240
operating system it runs has

1268
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,360
become less important.

1269
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,000
And then the distro has become

1270
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,040
less important.

1271
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,000
And it's really can I run

1272
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,480
Firefox and Chrome?

1273
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,920
And then there's the essential

1274
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,200
question of what's the base aim

1275
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,080
of the distro, Neil?

1276
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,280
Like what what market is it

1277
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,920
going after?

1278
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,080
And to that, that seems like

1279
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,040
that's where it appeals to each

1280
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,240
individual user.

1281
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,520
There's usually two different

1282
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,160
aspects.

1283
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,640
What is the novel aspect of the

1284
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,920
distribution and what is what is

1285
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,000
the goal of the distribution?

1286
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,680
So, for example, if I take my

1287
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,800
preferred distribution Fedora,

1288
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,160
the novel part of Fedora is that

1289
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,960
it's a community that attempts

1290
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,400
to integrate all the software

1291
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,440
and make it work together while

1292
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,880
simultaneously working with the

1293
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,920
upstream projects.

1294
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,200
So like things fit together, but

1295
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,520
not in a way where nobody else

1296
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,400
benefits from it.

1297
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,200
Now, then, you know, that's that

1298
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,040
fits the novel and the aim

1299
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,720
because it's both about bringing

1300
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,480
the latest stuff in, which is

1301
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,560
which is part of the aim of it to

1302
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,760
support, you know, bringing the

1303
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,720
latest stuff and making it

1304
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,080
available to people.

1305
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,840
And, you know, what is the novel

1306
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,440
aspect of it is that instead of

1307
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,880
just doing it on its own in its

1308
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,200
own island, it, you know, it aims

1309
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,560
to contribute and benefit the

1310
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,920
larger Linux community.

1311
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,480
Now, if you look at, let's say,

1312
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,320
a pop OS, the system 76 pop OS

1313
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,200
platform provides them an

1314
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,280
opportunity to to experiment and

1315
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,800
develop a more integrated

1316
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,560
experience with the hardware and

1317
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,520
software.

1318
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,800
That doesn't necessarily imply

1319
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,160
that it needs to be an Ubuntu

1320
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,080
base or a Debian base or Fedora

1321
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,440
base or an OpenSUSE base.

1322
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,600
But having a platform in that

1323
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,360
sense that they can ship with

1324
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,200
their hardware allows them to

1325
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,040
demonstrate in the best possible

1326
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,920
light the possibility of using

1327
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
their hardware.

1328
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,240
I agree with your point to an

1329
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,720
extent, except for I would argue

1330
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,800
that the Ubuntu base was not only

1331
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,440
a safe bet for system 76 and an

1332
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,560
encouraging bet for their

1333
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,000
existing customers at the point

1334
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,360
in time had been using Ubuntu

1335
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,960
that shipped with the laptops,

1336
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,480
but it also was a signal to

1337
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,000
enterprises and customers that

1338
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,040
if your software works on

1339
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,360
Ubuntu, it'll work on pop OS.

1340
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,400
Just like Carl mentioned in the

1341
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,760
interview, if you know, if

1342
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,880
you're on any Ubuntu base, you

1343
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
can use the system 76 updater.

1344
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,720
That, I think, is a contributing

1345
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,080
factor to its success.

1346
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,600
But it is also an outlier here

1347
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,120
because it is so highly coupled

1348
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,920
with the OEM's overall ambitions

1349
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,520
and goals that it clearly serves

1350
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,120
a purpose in multiple respects.

1351
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,040
It's a distribution appealing to

1352
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,600
end users.

1353
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,640
I have it running myself and I

1354
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,760
think it's pretty good.

1355
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,480
And it's obviously serving some

1356
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,680
of their longer term goals.

1357
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,120
So I think pop OS is kind of an

1358
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,080
exception here.

1359
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,440
Well, actually, it's not an

1360
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,400
exception because PC maker,

1361
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,480
boutique PC maker that actually

1362
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:16,960
does this.

1363
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Tuxedo Computers has Tuxedo OS.

1364
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Yeah, but have you looked at

1365
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,280
Tuxedo OS?

1366
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,080
I think you can make this

1367
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,280
argument with Manjaro.

1368
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,880
I think Manjaro demonstrates it

1369
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,480
was a niche distribution that now

1370
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,520
actually has some significant

1371
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,120
momentum and hardware deals.

1372
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,320
So it's clearly possible.

1373
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,840
Elementary OS has seen a similar

1374
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,640
trajectory.

1375
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,840
Without a combination of purpose,

1376
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,680
which, you know, elementary OS is

1377
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,880
demonstrating their Pantheon

1378
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,160
desktop environment, trying to

1379
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,080
show an integrated design centric

1380
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,000
user experience, you know, that's

1381
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,280
very tightly controlled.

1382
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,920
And, you know, without that, with

1383
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,960
that, you don't really have a lot

1384
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,440
of value.

1385
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,600
Deepin attempts to showcase the

1386
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,640
Deepin desktop, and maybe they

1387
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,360
actually do ship on hardware in

1388
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,680
China.

1389
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,720
We don't know because we don't

1390
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,400
really go down that route.

1391
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,640
Like the usual suspects for why a

1392
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,400
distribution tends to exist and

1393
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,080
has some staying power usually

1394
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,680
has to conclude some kind of

1395
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,520
purpose that is novel and

1396
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,760
distinct, as well as some kind of

1397
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,400
avenue in which it satisfies or

1398
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,960
fulfills a particular market

1399
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,520
demand.

1400
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,800
Yeah, we were talking about this

1401
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,880
like package managers, desktop

1402
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,400
environments, installation,

1403
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,480
thoughts to, you know, how you

1404
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,600
treat the whole end user

1405
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,720
experience.

1406
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,160
When we talk about distros, those

1407
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,920
all get lumped in together.

1408
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,200
So, Brent, let me see if I've got

1409
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,760
this right.

1410
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,040
You have a distribution that

1411
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
right. You have if it's serving

1412
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,800
the right audience and if it's

1413
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,400
built in the right philosophy,

1414
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,520
using the right tools with the

1415
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,600
distribution and then which

1416
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,640
reflects itself in the way

1417
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,920
packages are handled and

1418
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,320
installed.

1419
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,080
But then you also have the

1420
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,160
support aspect of it, which I

1421
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,200
think for a lot of us in this

1422
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,720
conversation is trickier to

1423
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,640
think of because we are often our

1424
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,440
own support.

1425
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,800
Being your own sport also means

1426
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,760
finding the answers.

1427
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,920
And so I know for my own

1428
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,320
trajectory into the Linux world,

1429
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
I've had to work hard at, you

1430
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,600
know, typing into the keyboard,

1431
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,040
into the search engine to find a

1432
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,760
bunch of answers.

1433
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,720
And it seems to me that, you

1434
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,360
know, I'm not a crazy super user

1435
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,440
like some of our wonderful

1436
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,680
guests here, but I've, you know,

1437
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,720
been around Linux for a long

1438
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:28,960
time.

1439
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,360
And so my ability to find

1440
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,520
answers about the little tiny

1441
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,680
things that go wrong on any

1442
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,960
system has been a big decision

1443
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,240
in my choice of which

1444
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,680
distribution to run and my

1445
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,080
hesitation to jump to some of

1446
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,040
the lesser knowns.

1447
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,560
And it's too bad that that's a

1448
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,400
reality for me personally, and

1449
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,600
it may be for many others.

1450
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,760
But I, you know, I just want to

1451
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,160
get work done most of the time.

1452
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,040
Sometimes I play.

1453
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,240
But that's a hesitation for me,

1454
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:00,800
for sure.

1455
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,640
I have to say, I mean, you know,

1456
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,080
there are some resources that I

1457
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,040
always go back to.

1458
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,200
And it's often the best

1459
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,280
resources I find are, and I'd

1460
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,800
say in this order, Arch because

1461
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,000
of the Arch Wiki, roll your

1462
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,440
eyes, then Ubuntu because you

1463
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,880
have the Ask Ubuntu community

1464
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,960
and all of the related blogs

1465
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,400
and then Fedora, which not only

1466
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,680
has a big community, but also

1467
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,360
has really good documentation.

1468
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,800
But I think this is for us,

1469
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,280
Wes.

1470
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,480
And, you know, a couple

1471
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,240
episodes ago, we had Wimpy on

1472
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,160
and he got us thinking about

1473
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,720
the younger generation like,

1474
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,920
you know, my kids age and a

1475
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,200
little bit older and a little

1476
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,920
bit older than that that are

1477
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,720
going to be coming over to

1478
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,920
Linux and open source.

1479
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,520
The next generation of Linux.

1480
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,880
Yeah, yeah.

1481
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,920
And you got to wonder what's

1482
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,320
where are they going to land?

1483
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,440
Yeah, you do have to think about

1484
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:43,920
that, right?

1485
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,240
And what makes sense in a world

1486
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,160
where we're trying to, you

1487
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,400
know, seduce them over to the

1488
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
to the light side of things?

1489
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,920
And I mean, it's not it's

1490
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,120
probably not going to be a niche

1491
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,760
distro, right?

1492
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,360
It's going to be one of the big

1493
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,280
ones or maybe not.

1494
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,360
OK, how about this for a theory?

1495
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,760
The niche distro pulls in the

1496
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,840
technologically curious out on

1497
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,440
the edges there, like if you

1498
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,760
look at it as a sales funnel,

1499
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,600
the niche distros are on the

1500
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,120
edge of the funnel and then they

1501
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,400
get people in because they look

1502
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,840
flashy and do something new and

1503
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,400
cool.

1504
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,240
And then as people try them and

1505
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,440
and they get more experience and

1506
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,560
more practical, they move

1507
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,160
inwards into the funnel.

1508
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,600
And by the end, they're coming

1509
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,400
out the other end running a

1510
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,840
boon to that stuff.

1511
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,480
I mean, you're right.

1512
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,880
I think that works for the the

1513
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,960
very curious or the the folks

1514
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,200
who are willing to do more

1515
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,640
troubleshooting on themselves.

1516
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,160
But the advantage to just

1517
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,520
starting with whatever the latest

1518
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,680
amount to is, I mean, you've got

1519
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,960
all the Stack Overflow answers,

1520
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,200
right?

1521
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,280
You can Google any random error

1522
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,320
that you come up to when you're

1523
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,760
trying to first try out this

1524
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,120
strange new Linux thing.

1525
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,320
And it's just an easier upload

1526
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:52,820
path.

1527
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,560
Yeah, and then you obviously see

1528
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,320
some specializations getting a

1529
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,040
lot of success.

1530
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,600
I think that's a clear point.

1531
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,920
Brent, you have some examples.

1532
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,280
Yeah, what came to mind right

1533
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,440
away was the Cali's and the

1534
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,080
cubes who just kind of do one

1535
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,840
thing and do it really well.

1536
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,120
And maybe, you know, that's the

1537
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,200
Unix philosophy coming in there.

1538
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,040
But we also see some really

1539
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,000
popular ones like Raspbian and

1540
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,280
the likes that are just

1541
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,760
targeting, you know, a small

1542
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,280
selection of the problems to

1543
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,640
solve. And they're seeing a lot

1544
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,140
of success.

1545
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,120
So maybe what we're going to see

1546
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,440
moving forward is just a lot of

1547
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,280
this sort of, you know, if you

1548
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,720
want to play in this specific

1549
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,000
playground, you know, is

1550
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Raspberry Pis and such, then

1551
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,360
you have a distro of choice or

1552
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,000
two or three, but expecting them

1553
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,080
to be your daily driver.

1554
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,680
I think we've pretty much sorted

1555
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,440
those out for most people.

1556
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,120
Cali is a great example.

1557
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,800
That's for sure.

1558
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,160
Well, I don't know really where

1559
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,640
to go with this.

1560
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,600
Other than now, I kind of feel

1561
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,800
good about niche distros when I

1562
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,680
thought of the whole funnel

1563
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,720
thing, which kind of made me

1564
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,280
feel better.

1565
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,960
And I also have to say, just

1566
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,320
look at Deepin20.

1567
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:00,960
Yeah, you should.

1568
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,080
You really I mean, it looks like

1569
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,120
a lovely release.

1570
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,320
And I don't want to come off too

1571
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,960
harsh here in that I think that

1572
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,160
some of the wonderfulness of

1573
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,120
Linux is just this.

1574
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,320
You know, you have all this free

1575
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,360
and open source software that

1576
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,720
you can experiment with.

1577
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,960
And we have a rich ecosystem of

1578
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,720
different contributors all

1579
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,920
playing around with things.

1580
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,280
And all right, you might not use

1581
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,880
Deepin, but down the road, maybe

1582
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,840
you use their desktop

1583
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,960
environment on your favorite

1584
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,160
distro of choice.

1585
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,920
I'd also love to get the

1586
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,520
audience's perspective on the

1587
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,000
future of niche distributions and

1588
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,760
this overall topic.

1589
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,360
So go to linuxunplug.com slash

1590
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,040
contact and drop us a line of

1591
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,680
feedback and we'll cover it on a

1592
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,480
future episode.

1593
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,640
Nathan wrote in, I was listening

1594
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,720
to episode 227.

1595
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,680
OK, so this is this is 372 right

1596
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,320
now.

1597
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,000
OK, it was about the one which is

1598
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,760
how I like to say it and system

1599
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,520
D, which is how I like to say it.

1600
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,640
He says, I just wanted to add my

1601
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,680
two cents to it.

1602
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,200
I'm not as strong as some are

1603
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,080
against it.

1604
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:02,160
But he says, I do not want it on

1605
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,680
my system personally.

1606
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,320
Not all alternative units are

1607
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,800
dead, such as open RC, which is

1608
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,720
the closest de facto replacement.

1609
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,440
Personally, I use six, which is

1610
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,360
fast and also maintain interesting.

1611
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,200
But he goes on to say what I have

1612
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,880
against system D is that it feels

1613
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,320
like it intends to replace

1614
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,040
everything in which now they have

1615
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,800
replaced my home with it.

1616
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,400
At this rate, it wouldn't surprise

1617
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,840
me if it eventually replaces the

1618
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,960
kernel in the future.

1619
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,320
This may be a bit dramatic, but I

1620
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,440
think you get my idea.

1621
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,800
I just like simpler systems

1622
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,480
myself. You know, I can certainly

1623
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,120
appreciate that.

1624
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,400
And that's one of the reasons I

1625
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,840
might be drawn to an arch base

1626
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,600
distro just to talk about our last

1627
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,960
topic a little bit more there.

1628
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,040
But really, Nathan, I just

1629
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,880
appreciate that you're still you

1630
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,680
know, you're listening.

1631
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,120
You're giving us feedback, even if

1632
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,200
you aren't exactly caught up.

1633
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,280
Yeah, I agree with him.

1634
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,440
And I also recognize the trouble

1635
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,320
it causes.

1636
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,240
So since that episode, I think I've

1637
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,840
come to the conclusion that Dev

1638
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,600
one is it's a good outlet for that

1639
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,360
idea of a system.

1640
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,280
And what I kind of think would

1641
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,520
have been better is if that whole

1642
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,440
shenanigans had just left the

1643
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,600
Debian project with that.

1644
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,720
And that's not a disparaging

1645
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,720
remark. I just simply mean let

1646
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,400
each project have its own clear

1647
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,120
path.

1648
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,160
There was a news item we were

1649
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,640
debating coverage that is just

1650
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,600
some silly technical arguments

1651
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,920
going on once again in development

1652
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,560
in Debian land around system D.

1653
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,320
And it's it's like one of these

1654
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,440
super simple maintainer versus

1655
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,640
somebody submitting the patch

1656
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,240
thing and maintainer has a hard

1657
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,440
line position and a bunch of

1658
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,520
other people would like this

1659
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,960
thing to support both system D

1660
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,640
and on system D systems.

1661
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,240
And it's just turned into a kind

1662
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,600
of a nasty debate that's now

1663
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,360
making circulation on social

1664
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,680
media and kind of painted

1665
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,960
individuals in a bad light.

1666
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,240
And it just comes down to this

1667
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,160
core conflict around system D and

1668
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,960
Debian.

1669
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,320
Well, and the issues that, you

1670
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,440
know, the trickiness of

1671
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,360
managing the support when so

1672
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,040
much of upstream has just

1673
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,240
totally, you know, gone the

1674
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,360
system D way.

1675
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,120
And then to what extent are

1676
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,320
downstreams obligated to

1677
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,280
continue, you know, keeping

1678
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,600
support for these other systems,

1679
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,520
which to be clear, I think we

1680
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,160
should support.

1681
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,360
I mean, it's nice that we can

1682
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,960
have that diversity folks that

1683
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,160
want a simpler system or just

1684
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,360
don't buy into the whole system

1685
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:19,840
D mess.

1686
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,480
I'm fine with it.

1687
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,400
But if you're not, that's cool.

1688
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,560
It's interesting to watch what

1689
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,160
that means that like what what

1690
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,200
buy in do you have from your

1691
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,560
users? What is worth it from a

1692
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,240
maintainers perspective in

1693
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,360
ongoing maintenance to keep

1694
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,480
making sure that that works,

1695
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,080
especially if maybe at this

1696
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,280
point none of the systems that

1697
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,560
you actually have access to test

1698
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,720
on are using any of those old

1699
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,280
units?

1700
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:39,840
Yeah.

1701
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,360
And what should their burden be

1702
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,960
probably worth addressing this

1703
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,240
system D home folder stuff.

1704
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,520
Carl, you've experimented a

1705
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,240
little bit with it.

1706
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,600
My understanding is you install

1707
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,280
your distribution and it

1708
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,560
immediately takes over your home

1709
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,920
folder, removes all your data

1710
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,840
and encrypts it with a password

1711
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,040
that it doesn't share with you.

1712
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,000
Is that is that how you

1713
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,120
that is that how it works?

1714
00:49:59,120 --> 00:49:59,600
Of course.

1715
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,640
Take over the world, right?

1716
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,280
No, that's obviously you're

1717
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,640
joking that doesn't work at all

1718
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,280
like that home.

1719
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,760
D is 100% optional and I really

1720
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,000
don't get the consternation

1721
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,040
about it in the community.

1722
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,320
It's if you don't like it,

1723
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,040
don't use it.

1724
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,400
It's just it's a thing that's

1725
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,520
there for you if you want it.

1726
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,320
Yeah, absolutely.

1727
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,280
And it's one of those things,

1728
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,720
too, where you look at it and

1729
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,080
you go, oh, yeah, OK, if we were

1730
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,600
making an operating system today,

1731
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,720
that's just absolutely how we

1732
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,680
would do home directories.

1733
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,240
So I mean, it makes total sense.

1734
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,040
We've covered it in the show

1735
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,320
before and why it's cool technology.

1736
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:28,960
So you could always check

1737
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,480
our back catalog, but yeah,

1738
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,920
it's still early days, too.

1739
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,040
There's a lot of integration to go

1740
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,480
with PAM and SC Linux and other

1741
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,160
things on various distros.

1742
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,520
So it's a tool if you don't want

1743
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,880
to use it, you can completely ignore

1744
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,360
it.

1745
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,680
Yeah, but I I do appreciate him

1746
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,160
sending that feedback in and I

1747
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,520
guess we're just still in this

1748
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,360
phase and there are resources

1749
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,000
out there for everybody.

1750
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
It's a big Linux world.

1751
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,600
Steve writes in about Emacs comp

1752
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,440
speaking of a big world.

1753
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,880
Yes, Emacs comp.

1754
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,920
Have you heard about the recent

1755
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,080
announcement for Emacs comp 2020?

1756
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,320
It's a free two day online

1757
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,160
Emacs conference scheduled

1758
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,920
for the weekend of November

1759
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,800
28th and 29th, 2020.

1760
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,480
Those of us on the Pacific Coast

1761
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,680
have to get up early to catch

1762
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,360
the first few sessions, but

1763
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,280
recording should be available

1764
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,320
online. The conference is

1765
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,400
currently asking for proposals

1766
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,640
at Emacs comp dot org slash

1767
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,440
2020.

1768
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,240
That's amazing.

1769
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,840
I mean, when you're finally over

1770
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,680
nano, Chris, it might be just in

1771
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,120
time to join and attend this

1772
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:27,680
conference.

1773
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,120
You know, one or two things is

1774
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,840
going to happen.

1775
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,120
I'm eventually going to win you

1776
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,600
over somehow with nano or we're

1777
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,720
all just going to be using VS

1778
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,680
code on the command line.

1779
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,360
Wait for it.

1780
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,360
I think the latter is more

1781
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,160
likely.

1782
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,000
OK, so how did we end up with

1783
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,560
this huge

1784
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,720
mess of picks?

1785
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,840
I'm looking at this like in two

1786
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,120
ways, like we could save some of

1787
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,280
these and we could just coast for

1788
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,400
a while or we could like toss

1789
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,600
out a whole batch of them, which

1790
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,120
is kind of the one I'm starting

1791
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,000
to lean towards just because we

1792
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,120
have so many.

1793
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,200
But I look at this list.

1794
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,280
There's two obvious ones I think

1795
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:01,840
we should do.

1796
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:02,960
Yeah, OK.

1797
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,160
I think I know which ones you

1798
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,600
mean, but let's find out.

1799
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,120
Oh, yeah.

1800
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,120
OK, well, that's a clear clue.

1801
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:09,520
That's right.

1802
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,800
We got two rust picks.

1803
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,080
Now, the first ones for you

1804
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,440
server types is the cloud

1805
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,240
hypervisor.

1806
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,760
It's a rust virtual machine

1807
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,600
manager based on Intel's open

1808
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,200
source project, if I recall

1809
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,960
correctly, called cloud

1810
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,760
hypervisor.

1811
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,440
And it's a tool written in rust

1812
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,320
because, well, it's the language

1813
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:28,880
of choice now.

1814
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,720
Well, so I think this is kind of

1815
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,280
interesting.

1816
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,120
It's early days for the cloud

1817
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,640
hypervisor project, but, you

1818
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,680
know, we've talked a bit about

1819
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,640
firecracker.

1820
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,640
Google's got their own sorts of,

1821
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,240
you know, tiny little virtual

1822
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,520
machine monitors that are

1823
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,080
implemented.

1824
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,840
And those are really focused on

1825
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,640
running these like super

1826
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,920
lightweight, containery

1827
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,480
workloads.

1828
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:46,960
Right.

1829
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,800
But cloud hypervisor is a little

1830
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,840
more general.

1831
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,120
It wants to handle more of your

1832
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,400
day to day like, you know, you

1833
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,080
want to run the regular Ubuntu

1834
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,840
cloud image on this thing, but

1835
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,440
you want to host it.

1836
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,040
Cloud hypervisor might be the

1837
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,960
virtual machine monitor for you.

1838
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,320
And the point about rust is

1839
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,520
mostly that, you know,

1840
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,200
firecracker and some of the

1841
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,280
Google work, they're all powered

1842
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,440
by this rust VMM crate.

1843
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,120
So it's a shared upstream

1844
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,400
library that these are all based

1845
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,080
on contributing to.

1846
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,200
So it seems like rust is

1847
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,800
becoming something of a good

1848
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,000
place to do this kind of

1849
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,800
development.

1850
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,000
Yeah, it's KVM based.

1851
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,040
So it checks that box.

1852
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,880
They are going for minimal

1853
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,640
emulation and lowest latency

1854
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,720
possible, low complexity, small

1855
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,760
attack surface.

1856
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,280
Check, check, check.

1857
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,400
Not only are they targeting the

1858
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,400
x86 64 platform, but they're

1859
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,680
also going for the arm 64

1860
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,960
architecture as well with with

1861
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,240
obvious functionality differences,

1862
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,280
which they've documented.

1863
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,400
And you're right.

1864
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,840
It actually does look

1865
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,240
legitimately like it could be a

1866
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,840
great way to self host VMs.

1867
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,960
You know, I was mentioning

1868
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,960
Proxmox before, but, you know,

1869
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,800
there could be a future where

1870
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,000
it's something like that instead.

1871
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,600
Now, on the other end of the

1872
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,680
rust picks, we have song rec,

1873
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,400
which is an open source Shazam

1874
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,600
client for Linux, which, as you

1875
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,800
guessed, is written in rust.

1876
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,160
What's kind of notable about

1877
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,480
this particular rust app is that

1878
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,840
this is a GUI.

1879
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,200
It does have it has a command

1880
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,720
line version as well, but this

1881
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,040
is a graphical desktop rust app

1882
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,040
application. Is it like Python

1883
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,320
rust? What is this?

1884
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,840
Yeah, we were sort of debating

1885
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,920
like how common is that?

1886
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,960
Because most of the pics that

1887
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,160
we've been finding these days.

1888
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,240
Well, they're all neat, but

1889
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,920
they're all command line apps.

1890
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,800
Yeah, all right.

1891
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,680
So there you go.

1892
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,400
There's a couple now.

1893
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,440
Here's a couple more that have

1894
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,640
nothing to do with rust at all.

1895
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,840
These are pretty cool that we've

1896
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,880
been sitting on for a little bit.

1897
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,480
So now crazy Chris is giving away

1898
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,320
picks. It's more than two picks.

1899
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,080
It's going to be probably four

1900
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,320
picks. This is one I think is

1901
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,360
probably going to improve your

1902
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,160
quality of life.

1903
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,520
Temp mail, TMP mail, a temporary

1904
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,840
email right in your freaking

1905
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,680
terminal, right?

1906
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,560
I mean, the reason to use this

1907
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,320
is obvious. What else do I need

1908
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,680
to say? It's a command line

1909
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,800
utility that allows you to create

1910
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,680
temporary email address and

1911
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,800
receive emails to a temporary

1912
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,520
email address. It's using was it

1913
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,680
one sec mail then their API, I

1914
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,160
think.

1915
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,200
Oh, they've got a few they've tied

1916
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,560
in with proton mail with some of

1917
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,560
the other popular sort of just

1918
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,000
accounts that let you easily set

1919
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,880
up a pseudo anonymous mailbox.

1920
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,320
But you don't have to go log into

1921
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,920
a, you know, use a set of

1922
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,680
different guis on the web.

1923
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,960
You've just got one command line

1924
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,760
interface.

1925
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,480
That's so cool. And really minimal

1926
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,800
dependencies. W3M, curl, jq and

1927
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,640
knock and you're you're off to the

1928
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,040
temporary email races. And that's

1929
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,640
pretty neat. All right, I'm looking

1930
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,480
at the mix here, Wes. Do you want

1931
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,440
to pick our final crazy giveaway?

1932
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,680
Oh, more pigs. Let's do it. All

1933
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,480
right. Well,

1934
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,800
we have too many good options here.

1935
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,200
How how to choose?

1936
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,720
Well, how about for those self

1937
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,280
hoster fans out there? What about

1938
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,200
my pass? My PAAS or platform as a

1939
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,680
service. It's basically a system to

1940
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,720
enable you know, if you've used

1941
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,240
something like Heroku, you've

1942
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,280
already you're already running

1943
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,560
things with Docker compose and

1944
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,080
Docker tooling in your local

1945
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,320
dev environment. And you want your

1946
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,760
own self hosted cloud platform

1947
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,960
that's as easy as Docker push. Well,

1948
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,040
maybe give my pass a try. It's

1949
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,800
powered by Docker traffic, another

1950
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,800
one of our favorites. And it really

1951
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,800
espouses its excellent analytics.

1952
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,400
It's got some dashboards built in

1953
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,760
for you so you can actually see

1954
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,280
what the heck's going on on your

1955
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,360
new platform. Yeah, it does. I love

1956
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,520
these. This is really cool. So this

1957
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,120
is one this is one I did not open

1958
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,440
the tab to. And then I open it up as

1959
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,960
you're talking about it. I love

1960
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,320
it up as you're talking about it. And

1961
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,160
I had not seen these the screenshot

1962
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,920
with the all the stats and stuff.

1963
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,640
I love this stuff. That's really

1964
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,560
cool. So we basically gave people

1965
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,160
two picks to just turn their

1966
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,400
their network into like their own

1967
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,280
AWS is really what we just did. You

1968
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,640
know what? You're welcome,

1969
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,840
everybody. How about that? So yeah,

1970
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,800
this is just sitting on top of

1971
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,200
Docker and traffic. It utilizes

1972
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,440
let's encrypt to get your SSL TLS

1973
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,720
certs and my pass, which I didn't

1974
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,600
know really much about it, but looks

1975
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,880
pretty cool. Nice pick. That was a

1976
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,480
good one, Wes. That was absolutely

1977
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,880
what I'm going to say. Right. Oh, if

1978
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,080
you've got some you'd like to share

1979
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,280
with the community, head over to

1980
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,800
Linux unplugged dot com slash

1981
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,280
contact or link me up on social

1982
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,280
media. I'm at Chris last. What about

1983
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,920
you, Wes? I'm at Westpain, our

1984
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,000
sponsor, a cloud guru. You can find

1985
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,080
them at a slash cloud guru at

1986
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,920
YouTube, Twitter or Facebook. Go get

1987
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,840
them on social media. The show is

1988
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,840
at Linux unplugged. I don't think

1989
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,520
it's Linux unplugged show. Some of

1990
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,880
them are on the Twitter and then,

1991
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,080
of course, the network. That one I

1992
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,800
do know for sure at Jupiter signal

1993
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,160
links to everything we talked about

1994
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,000
today are Linux unplugged dot com

2011
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,800
lot to us and we never forget that

2012
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,080
we talk about the live stream and

2013
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,680
we talk about about the members.

2014
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,040
But in our hearts, it's you

2015
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:41,840
downloaders. See you next Tuesday.

2016
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:12,640
So we have a complicated

2017
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,240
hardware situation we have. We

2018
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,720
have one machine that's doing

2019
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,000
great, and that's the least

2020
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,440
important machine. And then we

2021
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,560
have the recording machine that

2022
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,160
has bad blocks on the recording

2023
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,520
hard drive. And it's also just

2024
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,760
sort of shoddily put together. And

2025
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,240
now after this weekend, the

2026
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,840
Reaper machine seems to be in a

2027
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,280
bad state. We had a power outage.

2028
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,560
We lost one of our audio

2029
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,880
interfaces, and Jack audio has

2030
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,640
been wonky ever since that audio

2031
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,960
interface died. The machine has

2032
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,760
what I can only describe is like

2033
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,600
these blink out sessions where

2034
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,040
the entire system sort of locks

2035
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,560
up in the screen flashes.

2036
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,080
Initially, we thought it was

2037
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,520
Gnome Shell. So we switched to

2038
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,880
plasma and it went away for

2039
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,240
about a year. And now it's back

2040
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,160
in plasma and it just creates

2041
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,240
such a headache. So I got two

2042
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,760
machines right now that are in a

2043
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,240
super bad shape and no money to

2044
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,160
replace them. I'm trying to get

2045
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,600
clever. I'm trying to think if

2046
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,120
we were to. So this this Reaper

2047
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,480
machine is also the machine we

2048
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,520
used to do mumble. It's the

2049
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,120
machine we do remote interviews

2050
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,880
and hosts with and recordings.

2051
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,160
How beefy are your individual

2052
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,160
machines other than like the I

2053
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,320
seven, you know, six core area,

2054
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,840
but nothing. Nothing incredibly

2055
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,960
powerful because we're not

2056
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,280
doing video. How old are they?

2057
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,200
Ah, that's that's the problem.

2058
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,200
It's been probably I think we

2059
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,760
built them in twenty sixteen,

2060
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,040
twenty seventeen. All right. I've

2061
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,720
just got one question for you,

2062
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,320
Chris. Yeah. How many pies have

2063
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,640
you ordered? Yeah, just just a

2064
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,000
fleet of pies to replace the

2065
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,440
West. It's going to take sixty

2066
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,840
two pies by my math, but it'll

2067
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:56,800
be totally worth it.
