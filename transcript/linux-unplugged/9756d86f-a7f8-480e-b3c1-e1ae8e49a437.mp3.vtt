00:00.000 --> 00:03.480
You know, I just noticed you actually still have the Intel sticker on your laptop.

00:03.760 --> 00:04.560
I suppose I do.

00:04.600 --> 00:09.520
You're not like a sticker remover, but you also you haven't added any more stickers in that general region.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.800
You do have the stickers on the lid, though.

00:12.200 --> 00:16.680
Yeah, I mean, it's been a while since I've collected new stickers, so I haven't I haven't thought about it for a bit.

00:16.840 --> 00:20.480
What about you, Brent? Are you a no stickers guy or are you some stickers?

00:20.520 --> 00:22.320
You take off the stickers the machine comes with.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.800
I traditionally did because I didn't want to have all that.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.640
It's the difference in texture that got me.

00:27.640 --> 00:33.040
But I'm looking at my laptop now and I'm embarrassed to say there's actually a Windows Pro sticker on the bottom.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.160
Oh, no.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.120
Brent, I know.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.560
Do you still have that license key?

00:38.840 --> 00:40.360
Hey, you never know. I'm sure I do.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.640
Maybe it'll come in handy one day.

00:50.080 --> 00:54.040
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.800
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

00:55.840 --> 00:56.720
And my name is Brent.

00:56.720 --> 00:57.840
Hello, gentlemen.

00:58.080 --> 01:02.320
You know, coming up on the show today, we thought, oh, boy, we've done a lot in the last few weeks.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.320
We have the tuxes.

01:03.600 --> 01:10.400
We rolled out a new server and we chatted about ways that might be a little bit outside the box to fund free software.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.960
And we realized we need to take a minute and catch up with everything you've been writing in.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.160
There's a ton of feedback that's coming in, some really good, deep thoughts.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.280
People have spent some time.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.600
They've really wrote some compelling arguments.

01:21.600 --> 01:27.960
So we want to give it all a little bit of a fair share and take the counter perspective in, talk about those things.

01:28.360 --> 01:33.680
And then we're going to round out the show with some picks and some, I don't know, do we actually have any picks?

01:33.760 --> 01:36.240
I don't actually. I mean, I have some surprise picks.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.760
We could do a surprise pick.

01:38.000 --> 01:38.880
That could be kind of fun.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.600
Oh, yeah.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.320
OK, we should think about how we can make that fun.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.280
Also, later in the show, we got to do a check in on our new server.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.880
There is a new kernel and it's time to upgrade.

01:47.880 --> 01:48.960
Oh, yep.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.800
We're going to see how that ZFS array holds up.

01:50.800 --> 01:55.600
So before we go any further, we got to say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.520
Hello, Mumble and Jitsi room.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.520
Hello.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.640
Hello, everybody. Thank you for being here on a Sunday on our new time.

02:04.160 --> 02:08.640
Since we've moved to Sundays, we've been co-running a Jitsi room, which we're still working out.

02:08.960 --> 02:17.720
But it's also a very interesting technical challenge from like a jack audio routing side to have Mumble, Jitsi recordings and all of that on one box.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.400
So it's been a fun experiment.

02:19.400 --> 02:24.080
You can hang out in there and get the video feed, which is pretty much just the chat room, which you could just pull up on your own.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.560
Maybe a random Brent shows up on screen from time to time.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.560
I bet so.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.400
Or you could just come here and maybe you'll see him in person, although maybe not.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.440
This is Brent's last day.

02:32.440 --> 02:36.720
Oh, oh, well, not tomorrow, I suppose, is the day I try to get out of here.

02:36.720 --> 02:37.880
Not last day in general.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.080
You're not dying. You're not leaving.

02:39.080 --> 02:39.600
Right, right, right, right.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.240
Well, we don't know how his travel is going to go.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.480
I mean, it was pretty rough getting here.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.320
So I mean, I saw you guys whispering back and forth earlier.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.680
I don't know. Maybe you're inspiring to have me stay.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.640
I don't think the shackles arrived in time.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.200
We're just trying to find somebody that could just maybe take a test for you.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.840
We don't have to get you sick, but we just want the test to fail so they won't let you leave.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.600
That's all. Yeah.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.080
So that's that's coming up.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.680
But it's been fun. You know, there's been some construction projects.

03:02.680 --> 03:07.840
The studio has a new door and a new a new floor around the pooper upstairs.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.320
That's been pretty great.

03:09.720 --> 03:14.200
We're really getting this place ready because on the 30th, we're having our meetup and hang out.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.600
We're going to do a live lap.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.400
We're going to open up the door to the audience.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.880
Have you come over? We'll show you the hard work that Brent did.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.480
Probably not. But, you know, because it'll be covered up.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.680
But, you know, you can still come out, hang out.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.440
I can't guarantee Brent will be here, though.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.240
Well, you can never guarantee that.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.760
No, but I think you're going to be here.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.840
I'll be probably a pretty good guarantee of that.

03:31.840 --> 03:32.840
Definitely.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.360
Probably, you know, Levi will be here.

03:34.840 --> 03:35.840
So that's really all you need.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.920
So meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.200
If you want to come chow, bring your favorite meal is encouraged.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.960
You don't have to. We'd still love to have you.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.440
But, you know, maybe it'd be nice if you brought something, not your mother.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.440
You know what I'm saying?

03:47.440 --> 03:48.960
I mean, unless she's into Linux.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.640
Yeah, actually, bring your mom. That'd be great.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.640
I'd love to meet her.

03:52.200 --> 03:56.160
So we have put out a couple of fun episodes and I say that legitimately.

03:56.160 --> 03:57.680
You know, sometimes people say, oh, they're fun.

03:57.680 --> 04:03.880
No, they actually were a lot of fun because Brent and I kept the microphones rolling

04:03.880 --> 04:05.680
during our road trip this summer to Denver.

04:06.760 --> 04:11.400
We captured some good stuff and we just published two episodes from the trip.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.160
We published two episodes from that series.

04:14.600 --> 04:19.280
One is just kind of our memories of the road trip and what some of the harder moments

04:19.280 --> 04:23.080
were like and some of the hashtag RV life moments that Brent had to learn.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.720
I had to learn them the hard way and the quick way.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.840
Yeah, I think that was pretty a pretty fun way to do it.

04:28.840 --> 04:32.920
If I remember, I got to say, we must not have wrecked you because Brent spent the

04:32.920 --> 04:34.520
night last night at Lady Jupes.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.760
And it's like coming home, right?

04:36.760 --> 04:38.640
And the slide was working this time.

04:38.640 --> 04:39.160
Right.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.840
Thirty percent bigger. I don't know. Great, great stuff.

04:42.040 --> 04:42.920
Isn't that nice?

04:42.920 --> 04:45.000
Yeah. Oh, it's just high fluting.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.880
And then the second episode we just published, we actually recorded while we were on the

04:49.880 --> 04:51.840
road and we just been we've been waiting to release it.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.640
And it's all of the tech that we used.

04:53.920 --> 04:59.880
So from Internet connectivity and VPN and how we use the audio equipment and how we

04:59.880 --> 05:04.040
did all of that, I mean, just the whole range plus the automation stuff I do in the RV.

05:04.440 --> 05:05.600
That's all in that extra.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.880
My ever happy we recorded that when we did, because you and I were trying to remember

05:09.880 --> 05:14.160
all the tech that we used and it was a mountain of tech to make all of that happen.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.760
I was impressed for sure.

05:15.800 --> 05:19.800
Yeah. Remember how you just kept doing all the shows pretty much right on schedule while

05:19.800 --> 05:21.520
you traversed across the West?

05:21.680 --> 05:24.440
Yeah. And even held up in Tucson, which was really putting into the test.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.360
So that's all over at extras dot show.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.040
And there's some more in the pipeline.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.040
You can always subscribe to that.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.080
It's not a very active feed, so we're not going to spam you with a ton of shows.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.880
We are trying to do a little bit more in there just because we like to hang out as a

05:36.880 --> 05:39.320
group. And sometimes we like to do that online.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.000
So we thought maybe we try to capture that more often.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.800
And now that we're doing the show on Sundays, Tuesday is kind of opened up and it's not

05:45.800 --> 05:48.480
something we're going to do long term, but at least for the short term, we're kind of

05:48.480 --> 05:52.960
hanging out. And sometimes I'm releasing kind of the best bits from that in that feed

05:52.960 --> 05:55.000
as well. And it has to be of a certain bar.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.280
I'm not just going to throw anything in there unless, you know, unless I got nothing else.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.040
I mean, let's be honest.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.160
I think the fun quotient is really how we're measuring it.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.400
Yeah, it was a good time.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.400
It was a good hang.

06:05.720 --> 06:08.160
So go get you can grab that at extras dot show slash subscribe.

06:08.440 --> 06:12.760
So let's let's just kind of make a whole episode out of everything that people have

06:12.760 --> 06:14.120
been writing into the show about.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.920
And let's start in our feedback grab bag.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.560
Simon wrote in with some feedback about the tuxes.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.480
I think that's probably a pretty good place to start.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.080
Yeah. Simon wrote, Hey, gang, really love the tuxes show.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.120
Thanks so much for that.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.360
Just one comment.

06:27.360 --> 06:32.080
Not sure I agree with the two year Hall of Fame bit where the winners are not involved

06:32.080 --> 06:37.280
next year. So, for example, when Plasma wins next year, it'll be a bit of a hollow victory.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.480
I think Gnome should be able to fight to keep their crown.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.440
I think Simon touched on something that I was really conflicted about.

06:44.440 --> 06:50.440
Right. Gnome is a great example because Gnome is the default for so many popular distributions

06:50.720 --> 06:53.960
that it just has this massive advantage in the marketplace.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.760
We kind of we don't want it to always win.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.520
Right. That's boring.

06:56.520 --> 06:57.720
Right. Exactly.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.320
So, like, the idea is if it wins a couple of times in a row, you can assume this is a

07:01.320 --> 07:05.000
people's favorite. And now out of what's left, what do the people like?

07:05.000 --> 07:09.400
That was sort of the philosophy, but I'm not sure it's the right solution to the problem.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.760
And I don't know if you guys have any thoughts on it.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.960
Yeah, it does seem like the implementation has has a few issues.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.320
And we have time to figure it out.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.080
I mean, maybe there needs to be a higher bar.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.360
Do we just not do it?

07:19.360 --> 07:20.560
Do we need better categories?

07:20.560 --> 07:22.240
Hmm. I think that's fair.

07:22.240 --> 07:27.560
Let's imagine a world where you don't exclude Gnome because it's been a two time winner.

07:28.280 --> 07:34.480
The day that it does get dethroned is more significant because whatever, you know,

07:34.480 --> 07:40.120
replaces it or surpasses it, it's a well-earned accolade at that point.

07:40.440 --> 07:44.040
How do you strike the balance and still make it interesting and not just have, well, no one

07:44.040 --> 07:46.080
again this year? Like, how do you get that right?

07:46.400 --> 07:51.680
Well, I think it's it's more interesting to look at how the ratios work out year to year.

07:51.680 --> 07:57.200
So, for example, sure, Plasma and Gnome have been closing the gap over the past two years,

07:57.200 --> 07:58.520
even though no one twice.

07:58.920 --> 08:03.640
I think it's pretty fair to say that was something that's an interesting trend was the gap

08:03.640 --> 08:06.680
between the Gnome and Plasma for the viewers has closed.

08:07.240 --> 08:11.400
What happens? You know, the day that that flips is going to be a very interesting day,

08:11.400 --> 08:13.080
indeed. Yeah, that's a good point.

08:13.080 --> 08:18.920
I agree with that. So, like keeping the options on the table also lets you fairly judge how

08:18.920 --> 08:22.240
people are feeling about everything on a year to year basis. And that gives you more

08:22.240 --> 08:27.400
reasonable, more useful data over time to judge trends.

08:27.400 --> 08:32.840
Like, if you remove Gnome next year, then you're basically saying by default you accept

08:32.840 --> 08:36.920
that Gnome is going to be number one forevermore until it comes back into the list.

08:37.160 --> 08:39.760
And so these are all jockeying for number two.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.760
I think that's an unfair position for people to have.

08:43.240 --> 08:48.400
And I think that's somewhat flawed because you're also changing the way you're

08:48.400 --> 08:50.720
judging the way people think about their choices.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.680
And so you don't necessarily know if they're actually voting for number two or number

08:54.680 --> 08:59.920
one. So it throws into question what the value of the data is year over year when you're

08:59.920 --> 09:01.440
trying to figure out what the trends are.

09:01.560 --> 09:06.360
All right. So I think it sounds like the solution is to keep it, not do the Hall of Fame,

09:06.360 --> 09:11.240
but for us to kind of watch the difference in the numbers and the proportions to the

09:11.240 --> 09:14.840
votes. If something's pulling ahead, you know, that kind of thing.

09:14.840 --> 09:21.480
Yeah. And have a podium. So each year there's a first, second and third place.

09:21.480 --> 09:26.680
And then you can talk about how the movement has been affected in that top three position

09:26.680 --> 09:31.560
because you can see potentially who the up and comer is and how they're performing

09:31.560 --> 09:37.200
against sort of the incumbent and maybe at some future date when they, you know, surpass

09:37.200 --> 09:42.680
it. So, yeah, I think track the data, podium finish, and then, you know, you've got a

09:42.680 --> 09:47.480
more accurate reflection of like how trends move because, you know, there was a time

09:47.480 --> 09:50.560
when, you know, Ubuntu would have been at the top of everything.

09:50.560 --> 09:54.040
And that's not the case anymore because there's many high quality distributions out

09:54.040 --> 09:55.680
there and they're all doing different things.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.960
And people's interests are reflected in the way that they vote.

09:59.240 --> 10:05.120
I feel like part of the answer is also to ask the right questions in the form of the

10:05.120 --> 10:10.600
categories. You know, we can formulate the categories in such a way that it might hint

10:10.600 --> 10:14.280
at the up and comers as well and bring those to light.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.080
So there's there are multiple ways.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.800
All right. Well, then meeting adjourned, the feedback has been taken and we will make the

10:19.800 --> 10:21.200
change to the tuxes. I like it.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.760
I knew it felt kind of weird to me, but I was trying to come up with the right solution.

10:25.000 --> 10:25.720
But I like this.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.920
It also feels like this is the strength of feedback.

10:28.920 --> 10:33.040
Like we love when you challenge us on our ideas and then we get to change for the better

10:33.040 --> 10:34.040
for everyone. So thank you.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.720
Absolutely. All right.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.480
How about our next one?

10:36.480 --> 10:40.680
Yeah, Max writes in asking, Is Apple helping Asahi?

10:41.360 --> 10:46.760
Mid-last month, Apple, perhaps inadvertently, helped the Asahi team by adding raw image

10:46.760 --> 10:48.000
mode for kernel files.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.400
It was a minor thing, but according to Hector Martin, it's actually a pretty big deal for

10:52.400 --> 10:58.000
them. Do you think that Apple will continue to help the Asahi team in little ways or at

10:58.000 --> 10:59.960
least stand aside and not interfere?

11:00.320 --> 11:05.680
Or do you think that as the chip transition completes, there's a possibility of them

11:05.680 --> 11:07.320
introducing some major roadblock?

11:07.480 --> 11:10.680
Hmm. I have some conspiracy bacon in this regard.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.360
Oh, get that frying pan out, buddy.

11:12.400 --> 11:18.800
I think it's possible that we might be seeing maybe a bit of a movement internally at Apple

11:18.800 --> 11:25.640
when the engineers, simply put, I think the Apple engineers realize there's some areas

11:25.640 --> 11:30.760
where they can make modest improvements and it doesn't really get noticed by upper

11:30.760 --> 11:32.920
management because it's so low level in the stack.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.440
And it makes it easier for Asahi Linux to have future updates.

11:36.680 --> 11:41.920
And according to Hector Martin, he's really pretty convinced that there's no benefit to

11:41.920 --> 11:43.760
Apple directly by making this change.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.240
It simply helps Asahi Linux.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.720
And my thought is really simple.

11:50.760 --> 11:58.160
If I were making badass system on a chips that had great performance and had a bunch of

11:58.160 --> 12:03.080
specialized processors that were exactly the kind of processing load you'd need on the kind

12:03.080 --> 12:07.000
of cloud that I have, like the photo cloud, I'd be wanting to run these in a rack.

12:07.440 --> 12:12.040
You know, no stupid casing, just like Google does, just motherboard on the rack, running

12:12.040 --> 12:14.400
as many of these M1 boxes as possible.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.600
Oh, a beautiful Mac rack.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.120
And I'm not going to want thousands of Mac OS systems.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.000
That's ridiculous.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.440
I am going to want thousands of Linux boxes.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.960
And it's in Apple's best interest to have this community do all this R&D for them.

12:26.960 --> 12:31.360
And if an engineer can slip in how it handles a boot image and make a little tweak to make

12:31.360 --> 12:35.560
it easier to run Linux, so that way a year down the road, they're popping Linux onto

12:35.560 --> 12:36.120
their boxes.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.600
I think it's a no brainer for them.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.040
And it's not like anybody's going to notice that up the stack, right?

12:41.320 --> 12:45.280
From the work I've been doing on QuickMU, I've got quite acquainted with the Mac OS

12:45.280 --> 12:49.240
internals and certainly tracking the way that the I.O.

12:49.240 --> 12:56.240
support has been increasingly added to and improved over several Mac OS releases.

12:56.240 --> 13:02.120
My feeling is Mac OS do now have a very desirable silicon platform.

13:02.160 --> 13:07.480
And particularly when you look at where Nvidia is dominant and where Intel and AMD want to

13:07.480 --> 13:13.760
compete with Nvidia, it's in the compute AI ML arena for data centers.

13:14.240 --> 13:19.760
And Apple have got a silicon platform that could enter that world in a meaningful way,

13:20.160 --> 13:22.440
but not running Mac OS.

13:22.440 --> 13:28.160
So I can see that Apple would be interested in seeing how they can further improve the

13:28.160 --> 13:34.000
way that they can deliver their hardware platform into the data center for use for those

13:34.000 --> 13:36.760
increasingly popular workloads.

13:36.760 --> 13:42.880
And also the main driver for developer orientated laptops, you will notice, are always

13:42.880 --> 13:44.520
equipped with high end GPUs.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.080
That's like an absolute staple and a given.

13:47.080 --> 13:52.960
So I can see that Apple, this may look innocuous and maybe benevolent, but I think there's

13:52.960 --> 13:53.960
a method to the madness.

13:53.960 --> 14:00.640
I fully anticipate that we'll see a return to blade like devices from Apple going into

14:00.640 --> 14:06.440
data centers rather than racks and racks of Mac minis in rather cumbersome and awkward

14:06.440 --> 14:08.520
aluminum squares.

14:08.520 --> 14:09.800
I hate those things.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.080
But I also think that there's another aspect to this, right?

14:13.080 --> 14:21.360
So Apple runs their own private cloud infrastructure for their services, and they probably

14:21.360 --> 14:26.920
want to be able to run it on the Apple hardware platform for themselves.

14:27.200 --> 14:33.320
They are almost certainly blocked from contributing their internal Linux spring up into

14:33.320 --> 14:35.160
the upstream projects.

14:35.160 --> 14:42.680
But if a saw he does it and it just happens to work enough, then they're going to be

14:42.680 --> 14:47.560
then they they get less work on their front and they can run Linux on arm internally for

14:47.560 --> 14:48.640
their infrastructure.

14:48.960 --> 14:54.640
And that also has the knock on effect of making Linux virtualization on Mac OS smoother,

14:54.640 --> 15:01.640
because right now, if you do Linux virtualization on Mac OS on an M1, it air quotes works.

15:01.840 --> 15:07.520
But like the it is imperfect and a lot of stuff just doesn't work quite right, because

15:07.520 --> 15:10.680
the current platform assumptions are wrong.

15:10.680 --> 15:14.600
And so a lot of what this is going to do is make that even smoother.

15:14.600 --> 15:20.560
And then eventually bare metal Linux on M1 platforms will be or M2 or Apple arm or

15:20.560 --> 15:23.360
whatever you want to call it will be a thing.

15:23.640 --> 15:29.120
Maybe they will do X serve back from the grave and start doing like server arm platforms.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.560
I'm not holding my breath for that.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.640
But what I do think they're going to do is they're going to do it for themselves.

15:33.720 --> 15:34.920
Yes, for sure.

15:35.040 --> 15:40.000
I can't remember the exact figure, but they their contract that they agreed with AWS a

15:40.000 --> 15:45.520
couple of years ago, it was an ungodly amount of money that they committed themselves to

15:45.520 --> 15:50.320
for their AWS sort of committed usage.

15:50.760 --> 15:54.960
Now, Apple are not short of money, but nevertheless, you don't become one of the

15:54.960 --> 15:57.720
richest companies in the world by spending frivolously.

15:57.720 --> 16:03.160
So, yes, I could absolutely see what Neil's explaining where they create a private cloud

16:03.160 --> 16:05.280
environment and they run Apple on Apple.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.240
Well, we know how much they like having, you know, full control of things up and down.

16:08.240 --> 16:12.560
When they do have those, I think they have what, at least two ginormous data centers

16:12.560 --> 16:15.280
in the United States that are just monsters.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.320
So, yeah, we could see it.

16:17.440 --> 16:21.640
I think that's definitely, definitely likely is it's an internal effort to just keep it

16:21.640 --> 16:26.520
going. Now, unfortunately, that probably means they're not going to be super motivated to

16:26.520 --> 16:29.080
like make the GPU easier to get working.

16:29.240 --> 16:33.800
Well, the GPU is a function of the of the CPU itself and the way that they're the way

16:33.800 --> 16:38.280
that their hardware platform is designed, the operating system driver in macOS is

16:38.280 --> 16:39.840
intentionally super dumb.

16:40.440 --> 16:45.880
And that means that a lot of the smarts happen at firmware initialization time rather than

16:45.880 --> 16:47.640
operating system initialization time.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.080
At least that's what Hector Martin said in one of his live streams.

16:51.320 --> 16:55.240
It's also kind of funny that I think there's there's some subset of us that are just there's

16:55.240 --> 16:58.440
this fear, right? Like, I don't know, it just seems like to me it's one of these things

16:58.440 --> 17:00.320
that if it happens, it happens.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.880
But like Hector's incredibly clever.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.160
The community is incredible.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.760
So we'll deal with that when we get there.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.560
Exactly. Like, I'm not going to fret about it right now.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.760
I want PyCrash to get the last word, then we should probably move on because PyCrash,

17:09.760 --> 17:13.440
you point out it may also be some other element of this.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.720
There could be a legal aspect to this.

17:14.880 --> 17:21.280
Yes. So if I can phrase some conspiracy vague on myself, it could actually help them with

17:21.280 --> 17:22.320
undergras issues.

17:22.760 --> 17:30.080
If they say, hey, Apple is blocking us and they get an undergras lawsuit, they can say,

17:30.080 --> 17:35.760
hey, we don't show an internal memo that they allowed Linux to continue or something like

17:35.760 --> 17:36.920
that. Like that idea.

17:37.160 --> 17:40.840
Look, here's this email thread where we encourage our developers to support this.

17:40.840 --> 17:44.200
That would actually be really clever because they'd never have to produce it unless

17:44.200 --> 17:46.400
something came up. I can see that.

17:47.480 --> 17:53.000
Last week on the show, Wes wasn't here, Wes, but we ended up talking to Dave Jones from

17:53.000 --> 17:54.120
the podcast index.

17:54.680 --> 17:58.520
And in there, Dave talked about monetizing podcasts with the Lightning Network.

17:58.520 --> 18:01.880
And then after the show, as we do, or after the interview with Dave, I started thinking,

18:01.880 --> 18:07.160
what if this is a way, something, you know, what if this is one of the ways to monetize

18:07.160 --> 18:10.480
free software development to help developers pay for their work?

18:11.120 --> 18:15.360
Because one of the things that's interesting about the Lightning Network is you can send

18:15.360 --> 18:16.720
very small amounts very quickly.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.840
You can also run your own node so you can avoid sort of a middleman.

18:20.840 --> 18:24.440
But you can also, if you're in part of the ecosystem and you have an open channel, you

18:24.440 --> 18:26.120
can also make a little bit of money from that, too.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.640
So a project could, it would have a like a channel fee.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.400
And then after the show, like, I think it was like the next day.

18:32.400 --> 18:36.480
I mean, it feels like it was forever ago now as we record, but like the next day, I think

18:36.480 --> 18:40.680
we found out that the developer of FakerJS and was it ColorsJS?

18:40.680 --> 18:41.680
Ah, yes.

18:41.680 --> 18:46.600
That he kind of like just totally, totally flamed out, you know, put malicious code in

18:46.600 --> 18:47.840
there that caused a loop.

18:47.840 --> 18:51.760
And it was a big story.

18:51.760 --> 18:57.520
And it really, once again, put a spotlight on this, we've really got to figure out how

18:57.520 --> 18:58.520
to pay these developers.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.720
And there was just another story just a couple of days ago.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.840
I'm drawing a blank of the developer's name.

19:02.840 --> 19:06.400
I mean, it's a, if you listen to Coda Radio, this, I mean, you guys are talking about this

19:06.880 --> 19:07.640
perennially.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.440
Yeah. And we all know it.

19:10.040 --> 19:14.320
We've been honestly kind of enjoying sort of this software world of software abundance

19:15.040 --> 19:21.160
that we kind of just type in a command, we get the thing we want and all of the dependencies

19:21.160 --> 19:23.280
that it needs and it's up and going.

19:23.280 --> 19:26.600
And we don't think about like the fact that each one of those packages has a person behind

19:26.600 --> 19:26.800
it.

19:26.800 --> 19:30.360
And, you know, I think we have some worries, too, that there's this sort of subset of

19:30.360 --> 19:34.280
software that interacts with what these large companies, what their goals are.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.080
And those tend to be well supported in service.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.400
But then there's other, you know, we as various communities might have other goals.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.400
And that's not always, doesn't have always the resources we might want.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.400
Yeah.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.400
Oh, boy.

19:45.440 --> 19:49.920
This is something that you guys know about here, but we've just had a lot of struggles

19:49.920 --> 19:54.760
just even even when we wanted to pay a developer, definitely like had a lot that just refused

19:54.760 --> 19:55.760
to work with PayPal.

19:56.240 --> 20:01.920
And this was a bigger problem when we were part of a larger company because larger companies

20:02.560 --> 20:05.000
really don't even want to touch something like PayPal.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.440
They don't want they want they want you to invoice them.

20:07.680 --> 20:11.200
They'll pay you that way, either write a check or do an ACH or a wire payment.

20:11.200 --> 20:19.600
All of those require access to the Western banking system, which is also has something

20:19.600 --> 20:23.360
we've run into issues with multiple times, is that people just don't have access to that.

20:24.440 --> 20:30.920
And so I have had more failures trying to pay free software developers than I have

20:30.920 --> 20:32.200
actually been able to pay them.

20:32.200 --> 20:38.000
And it's to the point where, like, we don't really talk about like, let's do a fundraiser

20:38.000 --> 20:44.760
on the show, because my nightmare scenario is we raise like five grand and then I can't

20:44.760 --> 20:48.200
get it to somebody because I've run into that so many times.

20:48.840 --> 20:53.240
And I know it's frustrating for these developers because I've been told a lot that they just

20:53.240 --> 20:57.440
don't even bother asking for donations or contributions because it's such a pain in the

20:57.440 --> 20:58.640
ass for them to deal with it.

20:59.480 --> 21:03.000
Now, there's no universal solution to this, right?

21:03.000 --> 21:06.760
Like, this is a really complicated problem because there's a lot of countries involved.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.840
There's a lot of laws that don't necessarily work with other countries' laws.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.560
So I don't want to make it sound like it's a it's like an easy problem to solve.

21:15.240 --> 21:20.200
But as time goes on, I start to feel like it might be an urgent, desperate problem to

21:20.200 --> 21:22.680
solve because we do see these developers flaming out.

21:22.680 --> 21:29.240
But in background, we get so much more like there's so much more, I guess it's common

21:29.240 --> 21:32.960
knowledge in the free software community that just about everyone is totally burned out.

21:32.960 --> 21:39.280
And everybody is kind of overtapped and it's kind of it's just that's the starting point.

21:39.760 --> 21:43.520
And people that are in the community that speak with these developers, it's just common

21:43.520 --> 21:44.040
knowledge.

21:44.840 --> 21:49.920
But maybe those of us out here consuming things like a Linux distro package manager or MPM,

21:50.320 --> 21:52.520
we don't really kind of have that exposure to it.

21:52.880 --> 21:56.960
And so we don't really appreciate how bad the problem is because we're not really exposed

21:56.960 --> 21:56.960
to it.

21:56.960 --> 22:01.400
We kind of have a luxury of just getting to consume it at the top level.

22:01.400 --> 22:06.600
So it was sort of after listening to Dave talk about ways to monetize content with this

22:06.600 --> 22:11.160
lightning network, I started thinking, what if there was a way because all of the

22:11.160 --> 22:15.720
technology is there, the ability to send payments around the world, the ability to automate

22:15.720 --> 22:18.960
it, maybe, you know, you do a pull request and automatically you have a wallet that

22:18.960 --> 22:22.520
automatically has a few SATs set aside and it sends a developer a contribution.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.320
You set the amount kind of like a pay for what you want model.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.720
That's how they're doing it with the podcast index.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.520
And I thought, man, it's all there.

22:29.520 --> 22:31.720
And on top of it, it's all free software.

22:32.200 --> 22:37.160
But we definitely, you know, we touched a nerve because it's considered a third rail topic

22:37.160 --> 22:38.600
right now, like so many things have become.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.520
And I think a lot of it comes from a good place.

22:42.520 --> 22:48.280
The concern comes from honestly, people have just kind of had it with inaction with climate

22:48.280 --> 22:48.760
change.

22:49.240 --> 22:54.880
And so they see these block chain technologies and there's two kinds.

22:54.880 --> 23:00.640
And one is the proof of work style, which is what Bitcoin is, that just grinds it out.

23:01.120 --> 23:07.600
And I think people have the view that that's sort of like the world's on fire and now Bitcoin

23:07.600 --> 23:11.360
is coming along and it's throwing fuel on that fire.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.880
You know, like we're at a point where we can't add anything more.

23:15.560 --> 23:21.720
And I definitely appreciate that because I know multiple friends who have chosen not to

23:21.720 --> 23:25.920
have kids because of the climate impact that having children has.

23:26.400 --> 23:30.600
So I totally can appreciate like how strong people care about this.

23:30.960 --> 23:33.800
And this is probably the number one thing that I heard about.

23:34.800 --> 23:39.000
So as we as we kind of cover this, I just I have a couple of things that I want to mention and

23:39.000 --> 23:41.040
then we're going to get into the email and we'll just kick it around.

23:41.760 --> 23:45.520
Consider a world where crypto automates large swaths of the financial services, just does

23:45.520 --> 23:50.960
things, basic contracts, financial transactions, you know, you know, you know, you know,

23:50.960 --> 23:52.800
transactions, paying for goods.

23:53.360 --> 23:56.240
It just does that. And it does it in an automated fashion.

23:56.840 --> 24:00.240
If you look at the banking system, I don't know if people listen for a while, you might

24:00.240 --> 24:01.800
recall I used to work for a local bank.

24:02.920 --> 24:07.640
We had at one point one hundred and fifteen, one hundred and twenty servers for our 40

24:07.640 --> 24:09.480
branch operation, right?

24:09.480 --> 24:13.600
We had a mainframe, we had a data center, we just that one little bank.

24:13.600 --> 24:17.560
Right. And there's so many of those kinds of banks in the United States, not to mention

24:17.560 --> 24:20.120
MasterCard and Visa and your Bank of America's and your Wells Fargo.

24:20.120 --> 24:23.080
It's currently estimated, although these numbers are hard to track and they don't really

24:23.080 --> 24:27.360
like to publicize it, but it's currently estimated that the footprint of the global

24:27.360 --> 24:30.440
financial system is about three percent of all emissions.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.880
And it's estimated that Bitcoin is zero point one percent.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.840
And I think there's a common misconception that if Bitcoin was doing more transactions,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.120
it would use more power. But that's not how the network works.

24:41.800 --> 24:46.000
Bitcoin uses the same amount of power for one transaction or for a thousand transactions.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.360
That's how the system works.

24:47.360 --> 24:51.280
And when it comes to the environmental impact of these kinds of things, things have

24:51.280 --> 24:52.280
changed recently.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.920
China changed the variables this summer.

24:55.880 --> 25:00.320
China kicked out all Bitcoin miners and they were getting to be a large part of the

25:00.320 --> 25:03.040
Bitcoin network. People are uncomfortable about that in the Bitcoin community.

25:03.400 --> 25:08.920
It was getting close to like 70 percent of the capacity was in China and China kicked

25:08.920 --> 25:13.360
them all out. Also, anecdotally, just 50 percent of the coal consumed in this last year

25:13.360 --> 25:14.800
was consumed by China for their power.

25:14.800 --> 25:18.600
So they have a real problem over there. Right. So they had to shut this thing down.

25:19.120 --> 25:25.000
The vast majority of that mining power moved to the United States, but they did it in

25:25.000 --> 25:28.760
2021 where the environmental impact is a big concern.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.080
And these are businesses now. These are data centers.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.960
Right. These aren't bros with mining rigs in their mom's basement that are hooked up to

25:34.960 --> 25:36.240
the wall. Right.

25:36.240 --> 25:40.080
Each rig starts at fifteen thousand dollars and they need thousands of them.

25:40.720 --> 25:43.200
These are companies, they're public companies now.

25:43.200 --> 25:47.800
And they have an image and they also have a bottom line and for their mining operation

25:47.800 --> 25:50.720
to be profitable, they have to chase cheap renewable energies.

25:51.280 --> 25:54.760
So as that business moved over to the United States, they did an interesting thing.

25:54.760 --> 25:58.200
They played it really smart. For example, there's a mining facility now in Niagara

25:58.200 --> 26:04.600
Falls. And they buy and sell surplus energy from the plant right there, hydropower right

26:04.600 --> 26:05.800
there at the facility.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.280
They previously were coal powered in China.

26:08.280 --> 26:12.240
And so they can buy energy cheap from the power plant. And if the power plant needs

26:12.240 --> 26:15.040
that energy back, they sell it back and they shut down their mining.

26:15.040 --> 26:18.560
So they still make money because they sell the power back and they spend down their

26:18.560 --> 26:20.320
mining operation. So there's more availability.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.600
And there's also a huge explosion in 2021.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.880
This just happened since the summer. So this is new stuff.

26:27.440 --> 26:33.000
But there has been a big utilization of what they call stranded or flared natural gas.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.040
And this blew my mind.

26:35.040 --> 26:39.760
In just North Dakota alone, 20 percent of the natural gas is what they call stranded.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.200
It's too difficult to take care of it.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.440
So they just burn it.

26:44.920 --> 26:48.520
Have you ever seen one of those big smokestacks that has a flame at the top?

26:49.160 --> 26:53.880
That's a byproduct and it's natural gas and they just burn it because it's kind of hard.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.800
So they can now build these facilities with these miners there.

26:57.800 --> 27:01.920
And because these are data centers that don't require high speed connections like the

27:01.920 --> 27:05.720
these are data centers that don't require high speed connections like maybe a Google

27:05.720 --> 27:07.280
data center. They just need to get the blockchain.

27:08.040 --> 27:11.880
They can be out in these remote areas and they're unique business partners with these

27:11.880 --> 27:15.240
operations because they optimize for the lowest kilowatt hour.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.080
And so they're kind of this energy of the last resort buyer, the kind of junk energy.

27:20.080 --> 27:24.840
And when people get really kind of fired up about the energy use of Bitcoin, it's kind

27:24.840 --> 27:28.000
of the first flag that maybe they don't really understand how the energy market works.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.360
There's a bunch of this wasted energy that hasn't been monetized.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.240
And there's also a category.

27:33.240 --> 27:37.280
This is happening in Texas and some people are dismissing it because Ted Cruz has

27:37.280 --> 27:38.400
attached his name to it.

27:39.080 --> 27:43.040
But if you set that aside, if you don't collapse this down to a single variable, Ted

27:43.040 --> 27:47.480
Cruz, and you look at what they're doing, they're stabilizing the renewable grid so

27:47.480 --> 27:51.640
that there's consistent demand because there's a massive efficiency loss when they have

27:51.640 --> 27:54.280
to ramp these operations up and then ramp these operations down.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.560
And it's not like they have like a big bank of Elon batteries where they're storing

27:57.560 --> 27:58.560
this stuff.

27:59.360 --> 28:04.440
So these mining operations work as a bit of a computational battery that absorbs the

28:04.440 --> 28:07.920
load that makes the renewables profitable.

28:08.400 --> 28:14.920
So these rich who are never going to make renewables a thing unless they get rich off

28:14.920 --> 28:16.640
of it are now making money.

28:16.640 --> 28:20.480
They're now getting paid to use renewables and they're making these renewables actually

28:20.480 --> 28:23.240
profitable. They're making them acceptable to the market.

28:23.240 --> 28:27.080
And this is obviously to the best interest of these mining operations as well.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.760
That's the market dynamics here.

28:29.240 --> 28:33.280
And if we figure this out, if if we figure out a way to kind of leverage this junk

28:33.280 --> 28:37.760
energy, this burn off energy, then not only have we solved a problem that may make

28:37.760 --> 28:40.760
renewables easier to adopt, which is great because a lot of people are going electric

28:40.760 --> 28:42.800
with their cars. So we need a better grid.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.040
The power use problem is coming one way or another.

28:45.040 --> 28:49.440
So what would be great is if we could kind of find a way for the industry to work

28:49.440 --> 28:50.960
together. And here's my thinking on the problem.

28:50.960 --> 28:55.560
Blockchain and the Bitcoin stuff, no matter how much you hate it, it's not going away.

28:56.240 --> 29:03.760
And if you shun it and if the Congress creators fight it and you shame people for

29:03.760 --> 29:06.240
using it, it'll just go into the shadows.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.480
It's never going away.

29:09.560 --> 29:10.600
For better or for worse.

29:10.800 --> 29:15.040
So why not direct it in a positive direction, something that can help everyone?

29:15.240 --> 29:19.200
And then if we solve the market dynamics around renewables, we've also just been

29:19.200 --> 29:23.680
able to get this incredible blockchain technology that has a secure, decentralized

29:23.680 --> 29:26.960
transactional system that also provides sound, hard money.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.960
The upshots of this are so enormous.

29:31.360 --> 29:35.240
And the entire reason we say let's not do this because we're concerned about the

29:35.240 --> 29:38.120
possible environmental impact, the possible energy use.

29:38.440 --> 29:42.440
So we're saying let's not do something because of what might happen instead of

29:42.440 --> 29:46.960
let's figure out a way to make this work and we'll deal with the problem and we'll

29:46.960 --> 29:49.880
innovate our way through the problem like you're seeing the industry start doing

29:49.880 --> 29:52.600
since the China crackdown, you're already seeing it happen.

29:53.480 --> 29:56.040
You're seeing the market incentives drag them in this direction.

29:56.440 --> 29:57.800
It's because that's what makes them money.

29:58.360 --> 30:03.240
So if we could somehow harness that greed for better and get all of this incredible

30:03.240 --> 30:05.960
decentralized blockchain technology, everyone wins.

30:06.600 --> 30:10.520
Now, Ben wrote in, he said, you talked about how the blockchain is an audible on a

30:10.520 --> 30:15.200
public ledger, but the podcast index does not have any public governance documents

30:15.200 --> 30:15.960
or finances.

30:15.960 --> 30:20.600
I agree that there's a problem with 501c3 organizations, but as a private

30:20.600 --> 30:24.440
organization, the podcast index has no requirement to release anything.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.920
And as far as I can tell, they haven't released any finances or governances.

30:28.320 --> 30:31.440
I believe that the folks in charge are currently on the top or on the up and up.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.280
But if they leave, that could change.

30:33.840 --> 30:38.400
I just don't really necessarily agree with the point that they need to release that

30:38.400 --> 30:39.040
information.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.600
I mean, they're just a small LLC company.

30:40.920 --> 30:44.080
I think we could use something better for these kinds of things and maybe we're

30:44.080 --> 30:49.280
building those tools right now, but I like, I just don't necessarily agree that in

30:49.280 --> 30:53.480
order to run a useful index for podcasting that isn't managed by a mega

30:53.480 --> 30:58.160
corporation, they don't have to be the absolute opposite and be some sort of, I

30:58.160 --> 31:02.080
guess, what would that be a charity, I guess, maybe that where you'd be fully

31:02.080 --> 31:02.680
transparent.

31:03.160 --> 31:03.360
Yeah.

31:03.360 --> 31:07.960
Or a commercial interest corporation, sorry, community interest corporation is

31:07.960 --> 31:09.080
what we call them in the UK.

31:09.320 --> 31:11.600
There's an awful lot to unpack in what you've said there.

31:11.600 --> 31:17.840
There's several shows worth of discussion topics tucked away in there.

31:18.080 --> 31:22.440
I think a couple of the interesting points I want to touch on aside from the

31:22.440 --> 31:29.480
crypto, so rewarding open source contributors and open source contributors

31:29.480 --> 31:30.760
burning out, flaming out.

31:31.400 --> 31:35.760
If you're working really hard on something and you're not receiving any

31:35.760 --> 31:40.440
compensation for your time and effort, then the motivation that you're getting

31:40.440 --> 31:45.160
the motivation to flame out and stop working on it is higher than if you found

31:45.160 --> 31:49.640
a way to get some compensation for your, you know, the effort that you've

31:49.640 --> 31:50.680
invested in something.

31:51.000 --> 31:56.000
So that's kind of a catch 22, because I know from personal experience, it is

31:56.000 --> 32:02.560
hard to put the necessary legal and financial frameworks in place to receive

32:02.960 --> 32:08.800
financial contribution for your projects and effort that then becomes a

32:08.800 --> 32:12.760
continuing motivator to keep those projects and what have you alive.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.120
I've been through that.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.440
It is difficult.

32:15.880 --> 32:20.120
I'm currently going through a tax assessment at the moment because of

32:20.120 --> 32:21.880
things to do with the Ubuntu podcast.

32:21.880 --> 32:26.440
Even, you know, we had a crowd funder for that for 18 months and that, that

32:26.440 --> 32:30.880
shone a light on me from the tax authority in the UK.

32:31.280 --> 32:36.080
And I've had to do an additional tax assessment just from, I don't know, 170

32:36.080 --> 32:39.560
pounds or something, you know, so it's a, it's a lot of, you know, personal

32:39.560 --> 32:43.200
investment to take a relatively small amount of money for, you know, something

32:43.200 --> 32:47.120
that, you know, somebody thinks I'm giving a couple of pounds to, you know, a

32:47.120 --> 32:48.600
podcast that I, I like.

32:49.440 --> 32:55.360
So that's difficult, but overcoming that then creates a feedback loop for

32:55.360 --> 33:00.400
developers to then get some reward for their effort and then be motivated to

33:00.400 --> 33:05.360
continue working on something and not get burned out by it because they're

33:05.360 --> 33:07.160
getting something in return for their effort.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.240
Hopefully something that is equitable.

33:10.520 --> 33:14.640
That's the bigger challenge to solve is what is, you know, reasonable

33:14.640 --> 33:16.960
return on your time and effort.

33:17.800 --> 33:21.720
Now, the other thing you talk about is the way that the energy markets work

33:21.760 --> 33:24.920
in relation to vast compute resources.

33:24.920 --> 33:29.360
And what's interesting in this country is the largest data center providers

33:29.360 --> 33:32.280
in the UK now are the energy companies.

33:32.280 --> 33:36.920
So it is the energy companies operate the largest, most cost

33:36.920 --> 33:39.760
effective data centers in the UK.

33:40.320 --> 33:45.480
Years ago, when I started working on data suites, bandwidth was the premium

33:45.480 --> 33:50.560
thing that you used to pay for and energy was just something that was racked and

33:50.560 --> 33:53.120
monitored and you would pay for as you go.

33:53.360 --> 33:58.880
But today bandwidth is in air quotes free, and it's all about your energy

33:58.880 --> 34:04.160
consumption and also more importantly, your AC requirement, your cooling

34:04.160 --> 34:06.400
requirement, it's all about energy delivery.

34:06.720 --> 34:10.120
So the economics of the data center have been completely tipped on their

34:10.120 --> 34:12.320
head in the last sort of 15 years.

34:12.800 --> 34:17.320
And here in the United States, our ancestry for data centers goes to

34:17.320 --> 34:21.280
telecommunications rather than to energy companies, though energy companies

34:21.280 --> 34:22.320
have always been part of it.

34:22.800 --> 34:27.280
So from pretty much the very beginning, bandwidth was considered basically

34:27.280 --> 34:29.200
the cheap part of having a data center.

34:29.200 --> 34:32.560
So the way that it works in the UK now is basically the way it's always

34:32.560 --> 34:33.680
kind of worked in the United States.

34:33.680 --> 34:38.720
You pay for space, you pay for HVAC and you pay for energy.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.960
Those are the primary things you pay for.

34:41.360 --> 34:45.400
The bandwidth is like minuscule compared to all the rest of it.

34:45.960 --> 34:48.880
But when it comes to some of the other things that you said, Chris, like you

34:48.880 --> 34:54.080
mentioned the 501c3 thing, like the correct thing for something like this

34:54.080 --> 34:56.080
would probably be a business association.

34:56.080 --> 35:01.200
I'm not a financial expert or lawyer or whatever, but like typically

35:01.200 --> 35:06.480
organizations like that one would be organized as a 501c6, like the Linux

35:06.480 --> 35:10.720
foundation is, it's officially organized as a trade association or a business

35:10.720 --> 35:12.880
association as a non-for-profit.

35:13.200 --> 35:17.680
That gives you considerably more flexibility than a organization for the

35:17.680 --> 35:21.440
public interest, which is what a 501c3 is legally defined as.

35:21.440 --> 35:26.800
And so that's a thing from the funding perspective, I want to kind of echo a

35:26.800 --> 35:31.280
little bit about what Martin said about how difficult that initial hump is

35:31.280 --> 35:35.840
difficult, but then after you're there, it's probably smooth sailing.

35:35.840 --> 35:40.000
Like it's still a bumpy ride all the way through, but like, regardless of

35:40.000 --> 35:43.280
what country you're in, like I've told you before about like why I don't take

35:43.280 --> 35:45.840
money because it's not that I'm not set up to do it.

35:45.840 --> 35:50.640
I used to do freelancing, so I do actually have the experience.

35:50.640 --> 35:54.960
To set up a structure to take in money for donations and whatnot, but it's a

35:54.960 --> 36:00.160
bunch of extra work and the IRS or your equivalent in whatever country you're

36:00.160 --> 36:04.800
in, they will spend an inordinate amount of effort to audit you for so little

36:04.800 --> 36:07.920
money and it is such a waste of everyone's time.

36:07.920 --> 36:11.200
And this problem doesn't go away when you switch to cryptocurrencies.

36:11.200 --> 36:14.800
In most countries, cryptocurrencies make it worse, not better.

36:14.800 --> 36:19.280
If you take a tiny amount of money in crypto, like the IRS flips out at you.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.560
Like super hard.

36:20.560 --> 36:24.560
So like it sort of depends on the attitudes of the individual regulators,

36:24.560 --> 36:26.880
the countries where they live, how things are structured.

36:26.880 --> 36:30.960
Like most countries are not El Salvador who have decided to recognize a

36:30.960 --> 36:34.240
cryptocurrency as an official secondary currency.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.720
That is a huge pain in the butt area right now.

36:36.720 --> 36:41.600
I kind of take a like a five, 10 year view of those sorts of issues because

36:41.600 --> 36:44.880
you are starting to have like the mayor of New York and the mayor of Miami are

36:44.880 --> 36:46.240
now getting paid in Bitcoin.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.360
So there are fairly public officials that are starting to do this.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.440
So it's going to move this thing forward here in the States.

36:52.080 --> 36:55.360
I think that when I'm reading through Ben's email here, what kind of struck me

36:55.360 --> 36:59.360
was he's just he says he considers himself a blockchain skeptic, which that

36:59.360 --> 36:59.920
seems pretty fair.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.640
But he says, you know, when we're talking about the climate impact of

37:02.640 --> 37:06.240
Bitcoin, one of the things you have to consider is like, I don't think this is

37:06.240 --> 37:10.640
Ben, he says, I don't think it's proven itself to even be necessary or justified.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.880
So like, what are we getting in return?

37:12.880 --> 37:16.640
And see, that's an area where people who maybe aren't familiar with what's going

37:16.640 --> 37:20.320
on, because it's such a dense community with all these different terms and

37:20.320 --> 37:23.360
languages, that's a pretty reasonable perspective to have.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.640
But I've been looking at this and I'm very impressed.

37:26.640 --> 37:30.640
There's a lot of different things from different access to financials that are

37:30.640 --> 37:33.600
maybe available to people that don't have the best credit or really bad credit.

37:34.400 --> 37:38.080
That's something that's becoming more common using decentralized technology,

37:38.080 --> 37:40.000
and it's still very early and risky right now.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.360
It's now possible also for people to get take loans out against their Bitcoin,

37:43.360 --> 37:46.720
giving people access to some financing that maybe have bad credit or maybe have

37:46.720 --> 37:48.880
maxed out a credit card and they're in a tough situation.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.200
Like myself, I have no medical insurance.

37:52.160 --> 37:56.320
If I were to get in a car accident and I had a big bill, I would take a loan out

37:56.320 --> 37:57.120
against my Bitcoin.

37:57.120 --> 38:00.000
It wouldn't be something I'd want to do, but that's the situation I find myself

38:00.000 --> 38:00.500
in.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.240
It may save my life.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.000
It gives me that kind of access.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.520
Every piece of equipment in the studio that we're using right now to record with

38:07.520 --> 38:12.320
the exception of the mic Brent is using was bought with Bitcoin, and I turned it

38:12.320 --> 38:14.800
into something that then I used to make a living off of.

38:15.760 --> 38:19.200
I think there's some uses there, but there's a fascinating area of development

38:19.200 --> 38:21.440
because one of the things that's complex about this is there's lots of different

38:21.440 --> 38:24.400
blockchains and all these different things that are happening.

38:25.120 --> 38:29.040
One of the things that's interesting is there are types of blockchains like

38:29.040 --> 38:33.440
Chainlink that are bringing in outside information that's verifiable and secure

38:33.440 --> 38:35.280
and providing it as a feed to the blockchain.

38:35.280 --> 38:38.880
An example of this is they've partnered with AccuWeather, and they've partnered

38:38.880 --> 38:42.160
with some ground sensor stations and some satellite sensor stations.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.240
I'll have links about this in the show notes if you're curious.

38:45.040 --> 38:49.120
What they are able to do with this information is they are now providing through

38:49.120 --> 38:51.920
a series of different decentralized exchanges and funding methods and some

38:51.920 --> 38:55.600
companies they're working with, they're providing insurance to farmers in

38:55.600 --> 39:00.160
countries that have no insurance framework, where their land perhaps suffers

39:00.160 --> 39:02.800
some kind of disaster, some sort of climate-related disaster.

39:02.800 --> 39:08.320
Because it is provable, was there rain, they're using seismic sensors, they have

39:08.320 --> 39:12.960
satellite data that's coming in via these oracles into the blockchain, they can see

39:12.960 --> 39:16.560
all of this, it's not like a disputable thing, so they are able to provide

39:16.560 --> 39:20.480
insurance to these farmers now that have no access to insurance.

39:20.480 --> 39:23.920
Now you zoom that out, and you think about where something like that could go.

39:24.880 --> 39:29.200
That blockchain is using what's called proof of staking, so it doesn't actually

39:29.200 --> 39:34.720
use the intensive CPU GPU mining either. It's very environmentally friendly.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.960
So you zoom out where there's different types of technologies, it's not all just

39:38.960 --> 39:44.800
one thing, and they're able to offer things that it could be possible that in 10, 15,

39:44.800 --> 39:51.280
20 years, we have alternatives that are just simply never been available to people, like

39:51.280 --> 39:55.120
people that have never had access to banking, maybe they've never had access to insurance,

39:55.120 --> 39:59.920
maybe they've never had access to credit and loans, that would be me on all three counts.

40:00.720 --> 40:04.720
And I'm sitting here in the Seattle area living a fairly comfortable lifestyle,

40:05.200 --> 40:09.200
and I still have those problems, and it's just getting worse, not to mention people

40:09.200 --> 40:14.160
all around the world. So they have legitimate uses today, right?

40:14.160 --> 40:17.920
There's people that are in this virtual room right now that have paid for their home

40:17.920 --> 40:23.680
using Bitcoin. There's real value to that, that gave wealth to the people that are using it.

40:23.680 --> 40:30.720
Gave wealth to the middle class during a time where we've had a dot-com boom, a 2008 recession,

40:30.720 --> 40:35.200
now we have the financial issues and the supply chain issues and the inflation issues that are

40:35.200 --> 40:40.160
going on now, and it gave the generation, my generation that's coming up during all of that,

40:40.880 --> 40:46.960
access to wealth. I now have a sustainable business because early on, I warmed my studio

40:46.960 --> 40:51.840
by GPU mining Bitcoin. That's something. And that made a difference. And now I provide for

40:51.840 --> 40:56.400
a family with that. And everybody out there, so these things, they have real uses, and it's just

40:56.400 --> 41:00.160
getting more and more adoption. But it's really early days, and there's a lot of risk, and there's

41:00.160 --> 41:04.800
still a lot of scams. A lot of things are going to go wrong. There's still a lot of regulation

41:04.800 --> 41:10.000
issues that are going to come up. But I feel like there's actually more opportunity with some of

41:10.000 --> 41:14.240
this, and it's kind of thrilling that it's free software. Brent, you've been kind of exposed to

41:14.240 --> 41:18.160
a lot of this recently, and I know that you've kind of come around a little bit on this subject,

41:18.160 --> 41:20.720
too. You probably came into it a little skeptical, I would imagine.

41:20.720 --> 41:24.800
Yeah, I got to say this trip has totally informed me in this area. I didn't,

41:24.800 --> 41:29.920
you know, I was always interested in Bitcoin, but it seems like such a thick pool to jump into

41:29.920 --> 41:37.520
to even gain some basic knowledge. But thankfully, you and I started this lightning node project up

41:37.520 --> 41:43.760
in your office. And I think you mentoring me through some of the jargon, but also some of

41:43.760 --> 41:49.120
the concepts and some of the problems that this is really solving. It's really made me

41:49.120 --> 41:57.280
realize that the future seems a bit bright in many ways. Many of us would probably be interested in

41:57.280 --> 42:03.760
the technology that goes into even making these coins possible. I mean, it's a fascinating

42:04.320 --> 42:10.720
landscape of mostly open source technology, as far as I understand. And the fact that we could

42:10.720 --> 42:16.400
run that on a little node on an old computer upstairs and really participate in a low level,

42:16.400 --> 42:21.600
like it's, it's almost like if a little bank in your computer upstairs, it's it's super fascinating.

42:22.160 --> 42:26.320
And so if anyone's not really sure about all these concepts,

42:27.680 --> 42:33.040
dig in, like, there doesn't need to be a risk to dig in and read a whole bunch. There's some

42:33.040 --> 42:39.680
fascinating podcasts, even I want to mention only one. It's called what Bitcoin did. There's some

42:39.680 --> 42:46.400
amazingly intelligent people who are on there from all walks of life that are very informed in

42:46.400 --> 42:51.600
these topics and have come often from the traditional world, and are suggesting the value

42:51.600 --> 42:58.480
of what Bitcoin and related technologies can solve. And so I've been just super fascinated to

42:58.480 --> 43:02.640
the point, Chris, where you have to say, No, no, we got to focus on Linux content to not just

43:02.640 --> 43:06.720
Bitcoin stuff. And I think that drives a little bit of this conversation. But I think it's one

43:06.720 --> 43:13.360
that many of us who are interested in open source technologies and desktop Linux, even that's kind

43:13.360 --> 43:18.560
of the stuff that got us excited in the first place to dive into this realm. And I think Bitcoin

43:19.360 --> 43:27.440
and all of the cryptocurrencies can be fun in that same way of sort of discovery and solving real

43:27.440 --> 43:33.760
world problems with some alternative technologies. Yeah, it feels very much like we are at the stage

43:33.760 --> 43:38.960
with this technology, where things were right before the dot com boom, we are leading up to

43:38.960 --> 43:44.800
the dot com boom for crypto. And there will be a kind of a pop at some point could be I don't know

43:44.800 --> 43:50.080
how many years and then there will be a few obvious valuable contenders that remain your

43:50.080 --> 43:54.640
Amazons, right, you'll have your pets.com and you'll have your Amazons, and your Ask Jeeves

43:54.640 --> 43:57.840
and your Googles. And that's what we're gonna see shake out over time. And it's just super early

43:57.840 --> 44:02.320
days. But Wes, what do you think about this idea, though, that, you know, it hasn't really

44:02.320 --> 44:07.440
necessarily proved itself and the potential bad seems, seems bad enough that we probably shouldn't

44:07.440 --> 44:11.200
even attempt it? Yeah, I'm not sure I find that super compelling. I mean, I think I can understand

44:11.200 --> 44:16.240
the argument, but I think we're just gonna, we're gonna see, I tend to agree with you that once

44:16.240 --> 44:20.560
these sort of genies are out of the bottle, I mean, not that we can't put them back in, but that

44:20.560 --> 44:26.080
that just goes against a lot of human nature. And I mean, it seems like a lot of this stuff is gonna

44:26.080 --> 44:30.880
end up, especially as you say, after after bubbles after this, you know, the hype cycle, right,

44:30.880 --> 44:35.200
like, I think there are some valuable concepts, maybe the current implementations aren't the thing

44:35.200 --> 44:40.480
that we need, right. But we're lowering barriers to entry, we're making things more programmable.

44:41.040 --> 44:44.400
There's a lot of excitement, I think, Brent, as you've seen, right. And yeah, okay, maybe a lot of

44:44.400 --> 44:48.880
this stuff, maybe most of it doesn't go anywhere. But we need to remind ourselves that it's useful

44:48.880 --> 44:53.120
to be open. And I think we can, you know, as long as we've set up the appropriate guardrails and

44:53.120 --> 44:57.120
such, and where that's a, that's another whole other thing that we can do. And I think that's

44:57.120 --> 45:01.280
another thing that we can, you know, as long as we've set up the appropriate guardrails and such,

45:01.280 --> 45:05.440
and where that's a, that's another whole other thing to debate and talk about. But

45:05.440 --> 45:09.840
Technology Connections on YouTube just had a great video, but it's about can openers nominally, but

45:09.840 --> 45:15.040
just talking about how not open we can be at times. And look, I don't, I don't, I don't know that this

45:15.040 --> 45:20.000
can take over everything. But some ideas might stick around. And it's, it's worth letting ourselves

45:20.000 --> 45:24.160
explore. I think too, one of the things that Brent and I found fascinating when we were sitting,

45:24.160 --> 45:29.680
he's so many parallels with the Linux community. Yeah. Brent's over there shaking his head like,

45:29.680 --> 45:34.880
yeah, totally. Like, uh, I sure am just all of like the, the types of conflicts that they have

45:34.880 --> 45:39.760
and the ideals. There's some groups that they are like, you know, how in the Linux community,

45:39.760 --> 45:44.080
you have like people that are like really extreme about the GPL and, and really the, you know,

45:44.080 --> 45:48.480
strict definitions of freedom. Well, in, in the cryptocurrency communities, you have people that

45:48.480 --> 45:52.800
are like super, super opinionated about decentralization, right? It's like they,

45:52.800 --> 45:56.240
everything has to be hyper decentralized or it's garbage. And then you have other people on the

45:56.240 --> 46:00.400
other end. They're like, no, centralization is efficient, right? And it's this, it's this whole,

46:00.400 --> 46:04.960
it's just a different debate, but it's the same exact dynamic. And you have all of these open

46:04.960 --> 46:10.480
source projects. Some of them are managed like a clown show and some of them are like professional

46:10.480 --> 46:16.480
operations. And you can kind of look at them from like that kind of standpoint. And there's a lot

46:16.480 --> 46:23.040
of parallels there. I agree that just because it's open source doesn't make it necessarily good,

46:23.040 --> 46:28.080
but I think like all tools, it just really depends on how we use it. And in a way pushing against it

46:28.080 --> 46:35.600
seems counterproductive and trying to figure out how to work with it seems proactive, but maybe

46:35.600 --> 46:41.920
we're about to get more information in just a couple of days. There is a hearing that sounds a

46:41.920 --> 46:46.560
little hostile cause it's called the cleaning up cryptocurrency, but there is a hearing in the United

46:46.560 --> 46:52.560
States government on January 20th, 2022. They're going to have a hearing on the energy use and

46:52.560 --> 46:57.520
they're going to specifically look at proof of work, which is the style that Bitcoin is.

46:58.160 --> 47:02.320
So there may be more information there. My, you know, my expectations are set to low,

47:03.040 --> 47:09.120
to be honest, but perhaps in the show notes though, if you're curious about this topic and

47:09.120 --> 47:12.400
really we're not trying to go on about this, hopefully this is the last word for a while.

47:12.400 --> 47:18.240
I will link to a incredibly good report. It's a little jargon heavy because they're deep in

47:18.240 --> 47:22.480
the industry, but this guy really knows his stuff. It's a PDF. It's like 160 pages.

47:23.280 --> 47:27.120
It's quite the report on this ecosystem. If you want one definitive resource to kind of come up

47:27.120 --> 47:33.760
to speed on things, that's the PDF. And then also I have the Cambridge university's Bitcoin electricity

47:33.760 --> 47:39.200
consumption index where they're doing a real time monitoring of the, uh, you know, comparatively to

47:39.200 --> 47:44.160
some industries. I think they left out banking, but if you want some numbers on the current

47:44.160 --> 47:49.360
energy usage as we know it and where it's all distributed, that is in the show notes as well.

47:49.360 --> 47:51.840
And with that, hopefully we're done talking about this.

47:54.720 --> 48:00.000
Linode.com slash unplug. Head on over to Linode and get yourself a hundred dollars for 60 days

48:00.000 --> 48:04.560
on a new account. And you support the show Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting. You should

48:04.560 --> 48:08.720
really try it for yourself. Maybe your next project, maybe the next thing you want to try out,

48:08.720 --> 48:13.280
they have sent off stream nine on there. Now Alma Linux and Rocky Linux are all available on Linode.

48:13.280 --> 48:17.520
If you've been wondering what that user experience is like, why not create an account, support the

48:17.520 --> 48:21.600
show and try it out. And with a hundred dollars, you could actually deploy some really nice systems

48:22.240 --> 48:27.200
or mess around with some serious storage. In fact, they've been rolling out MVME PCA storage.

48:27.200 --> 48:32.160
So you're going to get fantastic performance on those systems. They have some super high

48:32.160 --> 48:36.240
end CPU rigs as well. So if you're a performance hound, there's definitely some stuff over there

48:36.240 --> 48:40.080
that you're going to love. If you're also, I guess, would it be called a value hound?

48:40.080 --> 48:45.200
I don't know if that's a thing, but if that's what you do, Linode can be 30 to 50% cheaper than the

48:45.200 --> 48:49.760
big hyperscalers and these big hyperscalers, you know, maybe they're going to try to like pull you

48:49.760 --> 48:54.480
in with their offers. Sure. They got their offers, but once they got you, they've really got you in

48:54.480 --> 49:00.160
their own ecosystem, right? With their own vernacular, their own dashboards, the whole

49:00.160 --> 49:05.680
thing. And once you're in, man, you're really in. Linode's not like that. It's just a nice,

49:05.680 --> 49:10.720
clean user interface, like really kind of the apex of what you'd want when you get to use a cloud

49:10.720 --> 49:13.760
provider's dashboard. Simple to understand, but you can go deep when you need to. They have a

49:13.760 --> 49:18.880
fantastic API and a command line client that works great too. So it's just like that nice package.

49:18.880 --> 49:23.200
So, you know, it's also a great option maybe if you want to do something like a multi-cloud setup,

49:23.200 --> 49:26.240
you know, tie it all together with a little Nebula backend. Do you know what I'm saying?

49:26.240 --> 49:30.880
Go try it out. Linode.com slash unplugged. Get a hundred dollars for 60 days on a new account

49:30.880 --> 49:34.800
and you go there to support the show. Linode.com slash unplugged.

49:37.680 --> 49:44.240
Okay. So we have a little tradition here on the show where we run a rolling server because nobody

49:44.240 --> 49:49.360
should ever do that. And we thought let's do it. So you don't have to. And also just to kind of

49:49.360 --> 49:54.480
make West sweat because nothing really bothers West. You got to put them really on the spot.

49:54.480 --> 50:00.880
We thought let's own our updates right here, live on the air. And it's our first time for the Tumble

50:00.880 --> 50:20.640
Weed. And we have, we have a new, we have like a new theme. We have like a new kernel, the whole thing. So let's do it.

50:20.640 --> 50:25.120
Okay. West Payne. We've got a brand new kernel. Plus we have our ZFS packages.

50:25.120 --> 50:32.640
What are we looking at in terms of update work here? 985 packages to upgrade, three to downgrade,

50:32.640 --> 50:38.720
seven new and 67 to remove. That's an overall download size of just over a gig.

50:39.680 --> 50:44.240
After the operation, an additional 300 megs will be used. Okay. Not quite the arch numbers

50:44.240 --> 50:49.760
we're used to seeing, but I'll take it. And it looks like we've got Linux kernel 5.16 rolling in.

50:49.760 --> 50:53.760
Oh, all right. Is the download kicked off? No. All right. Let's do it. Yeah. Let's do it. All right.

50:53.760 --> 51:01.200
And hey, you know, Zipper does handily note here, a system reboot is required. Yeah. Good. That'll be

51:01.200 --> 51:06.160
fun. We'll see how that goes. All right. So here we go. We actually have some feedback to this too,

51:06.160 --> 51:10.720
that we're going to get to a little bit in the show. So we'll come back to this. We'll let the

51:10.720 --> 51:16.000
updates run. So standby West, let it go. And then maybe after we do a few more server emails,

51:16.000 --> 51:23.840
we'll check on it. Okay. Fingers crossed everyone. All right. So while that goes,

51:24.880 --> 51:30.320
there was a few bits of email about how we configured the server. And I think it was Joe,

51:30.320 --> 51:34.720
listener Joe, who wrote in about our ZFS setup. And he said, you're really not going to want to

51:34.720 --> 51:40.400
do your V devs that way. So he wrote, I just finished listening to episode 439 and I was

51:40.400 --> 51:46.960
really sad. Oh, we made listener Joe sad West. I think this is really sweet too, because Joe

51:46.960 --> 51:51.840
obviously cares about our data. I know. Seemingly more than we do. Perhaps. And he says, I was

51:51.840 --> 51:57.040
really sad to hear about the Zpool design. With 20 plus disks, you should have at least two,

51:57.040 --> 52:00.880
if not three V devs to help for all the reasons you mentioned, which is the rebuild, the resiliency,

52:00.880 --> 52:07.200
and honestly just ZFS stability. ZFS has a history of not handling 15 plus drive V devs well. And

52:07.200 --> 52:13.520
then they, uh, provides a handy TrueNAS link. I can see people nodding their head in the, uh,

52:13.520 --> 52:20.960
gypsy room. I warned you. I know. I know. And so, uh, we have been, we've been debating it

52:20.960 --> 52:25.680
back and forth and I'm open to this. I don't love it cause we're going to lose some storage. That's

52:25.680 --> 52:32.640
why we're storage maximalists here. And we just wanted, uh, all of the storage, but I also don't

52:32.640 --> 52:37.760
want to have a problem child, you know, like how much is it that you do want the server to work?

52:37.760 --> 52:42.160
I want it to stay up. Like if it's actually going to affect stability. All right. Now you got my

52:42.160 --> 52:47.040
attention. That's where I draw the line risk of data loss. Okay. Maybe cause we were going to have

52:47.040 --> 52:52.000
a clone server. And so in C in theory we'd have a mirror, but when you start saying like the server

52:52.000 --> 52:55.200
is going to be crashing or going up and down or I'm going to have issues, that just drives you

52:55.200 --> 53:01.600
crazy. We should at some point, Chris, like, you know, off to the side, have like a dedicated

53:01.600 --> 53:07.840
discussion about your storage configuration, what you actually want to do and what your actual

53:07.840 --> 53:13.040
options are for your current storage plan and your growth plan. Because I think we just haven't

53:13.040 --> 53:17.600
seriously thought through that, um, for your, for your server storage design. Cause I think you'd

53:17.600 --> 53:21.760
kind of take it, you're kind of assuming that nothing is going to change and we should really

53:21.760 --> 53:27.200
seriously think about what it would look like if we change some of those knobs and, and, and thought

53:27.200 --> 53:32.320
about like what you actually would like to get to closer to an ideal state for your storage setup.

53:32.320 --> 53:37.520
All the storage, all the storage, that's what I'm trying to get to the storage is not exactly a

53:37.520 --> 53:42.560
well-defined option. So we should, we should figure that out. Like at some point, you know,

53:42.560 --> 53:47.120
cause I've been doing, I do a lot of this like professionally and personally, we should,

53:47.120 --> 53:52.240
you know, spend some time and like actually sit down and like maybe even make diagrams and charts

53:52.240 --> 53:56.240
and stuff of like figuring out what your options are. So we can actually do some proper planning

53:56.240 --> 54:01.520
here because once you fully initialize this and you start, like you, you don't have a,

54:01.520 --> 54:05.680
a backup system to shift data around, to be able to reorganize your storage, you're basically

54:05.680 --> 54:10.000
stuck. So we have this really small window where if like you're going to regret this choice,

54:10.720 --> 54:16.480
we can fix it. But like once you start piling stuff on, um, we can't fix it anymore until

54:16.480 --> 54:22.960
you get another machine. Stay a while and listen. We got a fork of the road, son. Um, okay. So all

54:22.960 --> 54:27.600
right. Okay. Let's slow down. Brent, we got some other server. We got a lot of emails about building

54:27.600 --> 54:32.080
a rack and about what we can do with these Dell servers. So let's maybe start there while Wes has

54:32.080 --> 54:36.960
down updates. How's your updates going in progress? Okay. All right. So Brent, you want to start with

54:36.960 --> 54:41.680
maybe our first one in that regard that we'll work our way down the list. Shouter in our matrix room

54:41.680 --> 54:47.680
suggested a few things about the new server, which will inform our server rack build. So here we go.

54:47.680 --> 54:56.000
He says Dell 12th gen is fresh air compliant. So it was built to operate at up to 113 Fahrenheit.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.720
Whoa. Ambient temps. I think that might help us in that garage for a given number of hours

55:00.720 --> 55:06.000
per year without losing warranty. Perfect for Jupiter hosting garage colo. All right, let's

55:06.000 --> 55:11.840
load it up. So I was originally under the assumption because last August when you and I

55:11.840 --> 55:17.280
were leaving on the trip, it was darn hot in that garage. So I even remember doing a few band-aid

55:17.280 --> 55:20.880
solutions in the ceiling and stuff to try to keep the temps down. But it may have even gotten as

55:20.880 --> 55:25.760
high as 120. Well, that's it. And I wondered, Chris, do you have any data recorded on the

55:25.760 --> 55:29.040
temperatures in that place? No, I should get a sensor in there. It really should. I think you

55:29.040 --> 55:32.800
have the means. Alex, I can see him listening, just shaking his head. I just don't want to set

55:32.800 --> 55:37.360
up a Z-Wave network. But you know, the other thing that's tricky about that, right, is sometimes in

55:37.360 --> 55:42.160
the summer you pull in there with a hot car too. So there's that as well. Yeah. So I wondered,

55:42.160 --> 55:48.640
you know, he suggests that 113 for a number of hours per year. But this could be, you know,

55:48.640 --> 55:52.480
a few months at a time. That is impressive, though. Strong argument for doing nothing.

55:56.560 --> 56:00.160
All right. You got another one. Keep going. Keep going. All right. He says the number two,

56:00.160 --> 56:04.080
Podman. Awesome. Please produce some content around networking,

56:04.080 --> 56:10.800
rootless and handling PID, PGID is different from Docker. Some comments around Linux server

56:10.800 --> 56:16.880
I O two and how you'd apply a multi service user setup for jacket torrent plex setups,

56:16.880 --> 56:22.720
and VPN wire guard slash swag setup with the networking namespaces and routing between pods.

56:24.480 --> 56:30.560
I'm already regretting that we did it. I am. Because twice in the last week, you know,

56:30.560 --> 56:34.880
there's been times where I'm like, oh, this all this documentation assumes only Docker,

56:34.880 --> 56:40.560
or this easy try this script only only assumes Docker. And it's just like, I ended up setting

56:40.560 --> 56:45.280
up blank systems just so I could run Docker and not run it on my super nice new server.

56:45.840 --> 56:50.160
That's what happened. That's a that's maybe a small backfire. Because the idea was is

56:50.160 --> 56:53.680
I'll figure it out. I'll try it and I'll get it working. And it'll be it'll be awesome. We'll

56:53.680 --> 56:57.360
talk about on the show. And the reality was, is I just want to get this going because I got five

56:57.360 --> 57:01.920
other things to do. And this isn't what I sat down to do. I didn't sit down to solve this problem

57:01.920 --> 57:07.680
right now. And that's just human nature, I suppose. So don't do like we do stick with what

57:07.680 --> 57:13.360
you know. You know, and he also calls for us to like post some of our our information on get

57:13.360 --> 57:16.240
maybe we'll get to that point. I don't really think we want anybody using what we're using

57:16.240 --> 57:20.960
right now. I'll tell you what. All right. There's a lot of feedback. Are we good on that? We get on

57:20.960 --> 57:25.600
the feedback? I think I feel good about that. And I just want to say, thank you, everyone,

57:25.600 --> 57:29.760
for your feedback. Yeah, it's making us think this we have so many wonderful audience members

57:29.760 --> 57:33.680
who know so much more about this and have much better ideas. Yeah, we got to be grateful for

57:33.680 --> 57:36.320
that. And we got some of the most pushback we've got in a while. But they were all good

57:36.320 --> 57:40.960
conversations. Linux unplug dot com slash contact. Thank you very much. We'd like to hear more. Yeah,

57:40.960 --> 57:46.400
keep them coming. Now go refill our inbox. You know, that's what happens next. All right. So

57:46.400 --> 57:51.760
here's a pic that's really only going to be great for you plasma users. But you know how I've gone

57:51.760 --> 57:58.240
on and on for a while about how tiling would be best for me if I could designate some virtual

57:58.240 --> 58:04.080
desktops or some some desktops as tiling and some virtual desktops as just free floating. Yeah,

58:04.080 --> 58:10.000
right. Like partial but desktop separated. Yeah. So like I'd probably have like my email and chat

58:10.000 --> 58:15.600
app as a tiled desktop and maybe like a terminal. And you know, but then maybe I want my browser

58:15.600 --> 58:23.920
and my notes to be free floating. Well, I think it's called bismuth or bismuth. I love this part

58:23.920 --> 58:28.320
of the show. I know. It always comes time to pronounce something for the first time out loud.

58:28.320 --> 58:35.600
And it is a KD Plasma extension lets you tile your windows automatically. Oh, manage them via

58:35.600 --> 58:42.720
a keyboard just like a regular tile and desktop. And it lets you apply it to only one particular

58:42.720 --> 58:47.040
virtual desktop. Chris, you seem to say all this like you wish you knew this like a year or two

58:47.040 --> 58:51.520
ago. Oh, man, this is so great. This is exactly what I was talking about. And I like the way it

58:51.520 --> 58:56.320
does it. And this is I'd love to see system 76 support this in their cosmic desktop. I think

58:56.320 --> 59:01.520
that'd be so great. This does look okay. Yeah, I'm trying this after the show. This extension

59:01.520 --> 59:05.840
seems familiar. Yeah, I forget who sent this to me. We had some feedback that suggested it,

59:05.840 --> 59:10.240
I think a month ago or so. Oh, never says it's not so great. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. Now I remember

59:10.240 --> 59:14.960
because I think I mentioned this to you like six ish months ago as a Wayland compatible alternative

59:14.960 --> 59:20.800
to what's that one that everybody used to talk about for a wayfire? Cronkite. That's it. Oh,

59:20.800 --> 59:25.440
Cronkite. This one is forked from Cronkite. I suppose if you're a connoisseur of these kinds

59:25.440 --> 59:32.640
of things, it may be lacking. So we'll have a link to bismuth, bismuth, bismuth, barksmith,

59:33.360 --> 59:39.200
barksmith forage for plasma. You know, I realize it's not for everybody, but you know, maybe give

59:39.200 --> 59:43.600
it a go. See what see if it works for you. It links to all that kind of stuff at linuxonplug.com

59:43.600 --> 59:49.760
slash four four one. Remember, we do get together every Sunday at noon Pacific. We get going around

59:49.760 --> 59:54.320
1230 Pacific. And well, this week we got going a little bit late. Well, sometimes we just like to

59:54.320 --> 59:59.120
hang out. And if you're a member, you get access to what was essentially an entire show that we

59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.440
did before we sat down to record sometimes several shows. Yeah, but this week was definitely at least

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.560
one show in the pre show. So you can go to unplug core.com to support the show directly. Or if you'd

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:13.680
like to support the entire network, that's a Jupiter party. Then you get all the shows ad free.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.000
That's pretty sweet. Right. It sure has been great having you down here at the students. Thanks for

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.520
being such a great host. You're definitely leaving it better than you found it. Yeah.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:26.320
Yeah. That's what I try to apply to every place. All of that bathrooms in rough shape. But I think

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.080
we got it from here. But you know, I'm just noticing like the lights are down. The floor is

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.680
missing. Just a disaster up there. There's a giant monument to Brent installed in there now, too.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.080
Yeah. And it's dirty. I mean, is that is that copper? One of the kids actually wrote

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.200
good luck Brent on the wall and then we painted over it. So yeah, forever.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.520
That's true. That always be there. All right. Well, thank you so much for joining us on this

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.760
week's episode. You're always welcome to join us live or just grab the feed at Linux unplugged.com

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.880
slash subscribe. Always appreciate you downloading, listening and sharing the show with anybody.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.240
That's also that's also really nice. Word of mouth is really how podcasts grow. So we really

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.400
do appreciate that. All right. That's it. Thanks so much for joining us. And we'll see you right

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:18.400
back here next Sunday.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:49.120
Well, one of my predictions may be coming true faster than I expected. It looks like

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:55.360
the Flat Hub community is looking at ways to pay developers in 2022. And they have a whole thing

01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.640
here about it. I'm really pleased to see this. It looks like Flat Hubs getting serious in 2022. They

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.040
got a whole outline of stuff that they have for ideas on growing the Flat Hub community. And

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.720
we'll link to it in the show notes. It looks looks great. The most important thing is that

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.200
they're going to set up a foundation through the Linux Foundation to make it so that there's

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:17.280
somebody who could take the money. Like the reason Flat Hub couldn't do it before is because there

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:22.880
was nobody to take the money. Hey, we're ready for update over here. You know what? Good thing.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:28.880
We just put one more thing in the power of the Linux Foundation. That is great. Update complete.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:35.760
We're ready to reboot. Let's do it. Let's kick it off, Westpain. This is going to be a long reboot

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:42.160
too, because it's got all them disks. What distro is it? Tumbleweed. Yep. This is our first big

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.960
upgrade since we switched to Tumbleweed. We've been waiting to do it on air. How long between

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:55.760
updates? Well, two weeks. Two, three weeks. New kernel. And we are using ZFS. So the ZFS is the

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:01.200
wild card. Hey, Chris. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just to let you know, I was running Tumbleweed up until

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:05.360
yesterday and I applied probably many of these same updates that you're installing now and

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.160
actually broke my system and broke the kernel. Where were you at the start of the show? Couldn't

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.720
you tell us that before we hit reboot? For what it's worth, I knew that this was going to I knew

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.800
about this because other people had told me about it as well. All right. Oh, no. Are you saying

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.640
there's a there's a deal breaker in here that's known like this? Is this something we should have?

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.560
Is this like an arch check the news page? We never did that, but I did never buy it.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:34.160
Not wash a love plug room in the. I was just there. I was just there watching the love plug

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.840
room. If you just watch that like you, you would have seen me complaining about like how I try to

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:45.600
open. OK, so like Tumbleweed is like the one district that I really want to run. But the

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:52.800
Bistro just really, really, really hates me because I can I can just do like a simple desktop installation

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.720
just run an update and it breaks. I am reasonably confident that your upgrade will succeed because

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.960
the conditions in which it will fail are not present on your system. Well, I have good news.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:08.320
It is booting right now. I see the system coming up. It's mounted. But the condition in which it

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:15.040
fails is that you have the NVIDIA driver installed. OK. All right. Because NVIDIA driver is not for

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:20.960
516 compatible yet. Hey, look at Wes. Wes, I think I think we got a console. Let's see if we.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:25.760
Oh, I've got some pings over here. The IP didn't change to see if it came online.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.120
Yeah, that's the win. If the ZFS is there, it's a win. I thought we were doing butter.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.200
Butter fest for the root. But that doesn't we don't have to worry about that. Yep. Here we go.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:40.720
Levi is. Oh, yeah. Take that everywhere. It passes its first on the air upgrade successfully.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:47.120
Let's see how long it keeps that streak.
