WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.120
I wonder if you could place what that sound is.

00:11.120 --> 00:17.040
I would not be able to, but it's something actually pretty nerdy.

00:17.040 --> 00:23.240
There is a post by Dan Maloney on Hackaday about how they were able to connect a Crunch

00:23.240 --> 00:32.080
Bang Linux box to a teletype, a 1930s teletype, and print out the console information right

00:32.080 --> 00:33.760
there on the teletype.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.760
Here's what it sounds like when the dude logs into his machine.

00:36.760 --> 00:37.760
I should do it.

00:37.760 --> 00:57.600
I'll put myself in lowercase mode here, so.

00:57.600 --> 01:05.120
I have a shell prompt, so that's where we'll see if my lowercase works.

01:05.120 --> 01:09.000
And you're seeing right there character returns and every command prompt that would come up.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.600
You have to sit there and wait for it to print.

01:10.600 --> 01:14.920
Yeah, it turns out at 45.5 bps, things are pretty slow.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.880
Also, this was way before ASCII was invented.

01:17.880 --> 01:22.080
It was the Bado code, so they had to use a custom little mega chip, or you could use

01:22.080 --> 01:25.920
an Arduino or something to tune the translation because ASCII didn't exist yet.

01:25.920 --> 01:26.920
Pretty wild.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.480
It's really worth the link in the show notes.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.840
Linux Unplugged dot com slash 350.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.400
You gotta check this out.

01:33.400 --> 01:43.880
It's super nerdy.

01:43.880 --> 01:49.520
Hello friends and welcome into episode 350 of your weekly Linux talk show.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.520
My name is Chris.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.520
My name is Wes.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.520
350 feels good, Wes.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.520
It's an achievement.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.520
That's all right.

01:54.520 --> 01:55.520
It feels real good.

01:55.520 --> 02:02.120
Coming up on today's program, we're taking a look at Ubuntu 20.04, the next big LTS from

02:02.120 --> 02:05.960
Canonical, the Fuchsia, if you will.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.600
We're going to look at the main release, as well as some of the details in the flavor,

02:09.600 --> 02:14.040
some goodies you can expect in there, our experience of it on the kernel, my experience

02:14.040 --> 02:21.200
with the Raspberry Pi 4, and as well as just our general impressions using this new release.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.660
Plus, we have a whole bunch of community news, some pics to get into, and a lot more.

02:25.660 --> 02:29.440
So before we go any further, I gotta say hello to that virtual lug.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.080
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.080
Hey.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.080
Hello.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.080
Hello.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.080
Linux Tuesday happiness.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.080
Howdy.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
Oh my goodness.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.080
Whoa.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.080
Woo.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.520
I mean, how incredible is that, really?

02:41.520 --> 02:45.040
I mean, you can't make heads or tails of it, but you can tell it's impressive.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.880
It's sheer Linux passion.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.000
It is so much passion.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.140
There are like 58 people in here.

02:50.140 --> 02:51.460
It's a record, I think.

02:51.460 --> 02:52.460
It's pretty great.

02:52.460 --> 02:53.460
So hello, everybody.

02:53.460 --> 02:54.460
Glad to have you there.

02:54.460 --> 02:55.760
It's a fun episode.

02:55.760 --> 03:00.600
And some of you were there for our virtual lug hangout on Sunday that wrapped up after,

03:00.600 --> 03:02.400
I think, Computer Kid was saying eight hours.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
I was only there for a couple.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.400
Wow.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.080
But that was a lot of fun.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.320
So we have a lot to get into today.

03:09.320 --> 03:13.600
I wanted to start with the news like we usually do, pulling in a few more headlines these

03:13.600 --> 03:18.620
days that may have made it in LAN into Linux Unplugged to try to give them some attention.

03:18.620 --> 03:23.500
And one that got my attention is some improvements that Tuxedo is making to the user experience

03:23.500 --> 03:28.720
with a new power and thermal control center for their Linux systems.

03:28.720 --> 03:33.360
Yeah, if you don't remember, Tuxedo is a German Linux PC vendor, and they've launched the

03:33.360 --> 03:38.840
Tuxedo Control Center to provide a GUI driven control plane for management thermal and power

03:38.840 --> 03:43.420
settings on your systems, provides a basic dashboard and control area for creating power

03:43.420 --> 03:47.960
and thermal profiles, tuning the CPU power management behavior and related features.

03:47.960 --> 03:52.720
Now, of course, much of this functionality has already been available via third party

03:52.720 --> 03:53.720
utilities.

03:53.720 --> 03:57.400
But it's nice to see this sort of baked right in, especially for maybe new Linux users,

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
right?

03:58.400 --> 04:01.760
Maybe they're exact customer base who wants something that's a little more out of the

04:01.760 --> 04:03.240
box and ready to go.

04:03.240 --> 04:07.240
The Tuxedo Control Center is open source.

04:07.240 --> 04:11.200
It initially will be available with easy access for Ubuntu and openSUSE users.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.560
But there's no reason it really couldn't be packaged up more broadly.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.600
I'm not sure what they've used to build this.

04:16.600 --> 04:22.120
But what you end up with is icons that represent things like cooling and power.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.640
And then you just sort of click around to get the desired configuration.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.480
Going to look at GitHub, it does seem to be an Electron app.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.200
Now, there are some downsides there.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.600
But it should mean getting it running on whatever distro you eventually choose to use should

04:33.600 --> 04:34.600
be a snap.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.600
See what I did there.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.600
I do.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.480
And it is actually even simpler than so you probably will see it and like like we were

04:40.480 --> 04:43.280
kind of thinking it's using just back end tools that are already available, but it's

04:43.280 --> 04:44.560
bringing it all in one place.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.360
So it seems like that should be pretty notable.

04:47.360 --> 04:53.280
Speaking of Linux laptops, though, you got me a Lemure Pro from System 76.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.080
It may actually arrive while we're recording.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.980
So if you hear old ding dong on the door, that's probably my laptop and then I'll be

04:57.980 --> 04:58.980
very distracted.

04:58.980 --> 04:59.980
I know, right?

04:59.980 --> 05:04.320
I went through and kind of did like a pre configure on what I would buy if I was going

05:04.320 --> 05:05.520
to get a little more pro.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.140
I decided I'd keep it with the base 4.2 gigahertz i5.

05:09.140 --> 05:12.960
It is tempting to go to the i7 4.9.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.480
It's only $200 more.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.360
But I just don't know if I'd really notice the difference and I might save a little power

05:18.360 --> 05:19.360
and temperature.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.360
Yeah.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.360
Look at you being reasonable today.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.680
I know.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.480
And because I'm a gentleman, I went with 24 gigs of RAM.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.480
I don't need 40.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.480
Oh, come on.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.480
But 40.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.480
I know.

05:29.480 --> 05:30.480
How could you resist?

05:30.480 --> 05:31.480
What's the price difference?

05:31.480 --> 05:32.560
It felt like the sweet spot.

05:32.560 --> 05:33.560
It was a $60 upgrade.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.560
That's not bad.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.560
Yeah.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.840
And then to go to 40 gigs, it's like a lot more than that.

05:37.840 --> 05:45.220
And then for OS, I upgraded from the standard 240 gigabyte SSD to a one terabyte MVME.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.420
That's what I would go with.

05:46.420 --> 05:51.920
And that was a $280 ish bump in price, but that seems like it'd be worth it.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.440
You can get a second MVME drive, but I didn't bother.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.880
Again, going supes reasonable.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.400
And I didn't tweak anything else with it.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.400
That's all I changed.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.080
I just adjusted those couple of things.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.960
So I kept the one year warranty.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.520
I didn't buy the extra power adapter.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.800
Actually, I almost always buy the extra power adapter.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.320
I mean, you're going to lose one of them.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.320
Yeah.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.320
So I'll go ahead and add that.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.320
Let's be real real sticker.

06:12.320 --> 06:20.240
If I was going to buy this, my grand total for the new LeMouwer Pro would be $1,564.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.240
Not too bad.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.240
Probably not.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.200
When you consider you can hardly even get into a decent MacBook for less than two grand.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.720
I mean, this will be a multi year machine for sure.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.720
Yeah.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.200
So that's coming and I'll have a review for it.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.880
I don't actually know what configuration they sent because it's a review unit and I did

06:33.880 --> 06:37.000
not spec it, but I am very much looking forward to trying it.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.320
It's good timing for me right now.

06:38.320 --> 06:43.560
I'm sort of in the zone for a new laptop, you know what I mean?

06:43.560 --> 06:45.280
ThinkPad's great, but that screen.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.920
Yeah, that's really the limiting factor.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.800
And those speakers.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.080
So bad.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.960
You know what, I use my speakers.

06:51.960 --> 06:52.960
I use my speakers.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.880
Turns out there's a lot of audio clips to listen to.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.780
It's just so bad.

06:56.780 --> 06:59.960
We still laugh about how bad the speakers are on our ThinkPads.

06:59.960 --> 07:00.960
Almost every week really.

07:00.960 --> 07:04.200
It's a great machine, powerful, gets work done, great battery life.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.120
I love it, but there could be some improvements.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.120
Yeah.

07:08.120 --> 07:12.980
So I checked the old UPS shipping tracker and it is in our town right now.

07:12.980 --> 07:14.160
So it's supposed to get here today.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.160
It's coming for us.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.160
So listen for the ding dong.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.160
It may be here.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.360
Wouldn't that be great if it just got here during housekeeping or something?

07:20.360 --> 07:24.200
The Limor Pro will be probably in next week's episode or the week after, just depending

07:24.200 --> 07:26.680
on how much time I get to spend reviewing it properly.

07:26.680 --> 07:31.520
If you've got any questions, LinuxUnplug.com slash contact or at Chris LAS on the Twitter.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.520
Start sending them in now and let me know and I'll try to incorporate them into the

07:33.520 --> 07:34.840
old review.

07:34.840 --> 07:41.360
Now we don't always talk about software forks here on the podcast because let's be honest,

07:41.360 --> 07:42.700
there's a lot of them.

07:42.700 --> 07:46.280
But when we do talk about software forks, we talk about the good ones.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.400
And this seems like one of them.

07:48.400 --> 07:54.280
I have so much appreciation and respect for what the entire Plasma project team has done,

07:54.280 --> 07:57.360
but specifically the folks that work on Kaywin.

07:57.360 --> 08:02.240
However, in this last week, a new fork was announced.

08:02.240 --> 08:08.320
It's called Kaywin FT with a goal to accelerate the development and better improve Wayland

08:08.320 --> 08:09.960
support.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.840
And maybe the more interesting thing about it is who's doing the fork.

08:14.840 --> 08:19.300
Yeah, this was announced by Roman Gilk, the same developer who became a contractor for

08:19.300 --> 08:20.980
Valve last year.

08:20.980 --> 08:24.180
And part of his work there was actually to improve Kaywin.

08:24.180 --> 08:28.880
So it looks like this may have come as a result of that previous work.

08:28.880 --> 08:33.360
What's interesting about Kaywin FT, as the fork is known, is that it's supposed to be

08:33.360 --> 08:39.760
a drop-in replacement for KDE's window manager Kaywin and the accompanying underlying Kay

08:39.760 --> 08:41.220
Wayland library.

08:41.220 --> 08:45.480
So for the moment, this may break as you know, more changes are added to the project.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.760
But right now, you can just drop it in.

08:47.760 --> 08:52.160
Okay, so that drop-in replacement thing, I guess that makes sense.

08:52.160 --> 08:55.120
You know, if you're just starting to fork, you're making probably minimal changes at

08:55.120 --> 08:56.880
first, so it would be compatible.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.920
And you want it to be sort of easy for developers to write, actually get it running on their

08:59.920 --> 09:01.840
system and test those changes.

09:01.840 --> 09:06.160
That said, it's pretty freaking cool that if you're on Manjaro and you have the unstable

09:06.160 --> 09:13.960
repos turned on, you can just replace Kaywin with this, and it's supposedly in a lot better

09:13.960 --> 09:14.960
shape.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.640
Essentially, what the developer says, what Roman said was that he looked at making these

09:18.640 --> 09:25.360
changes directly in mainline Kaywin, but the project has a very real-world constraint.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.400
And that is people use it.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.520
A lot of people use it.

09:28.520 --> 09:33.160
I mean, it can be really difficult to totally re-architect, fix, you know, things that have

09:33.160 --> 09:36.880
been assumed and at the base of the project for years and years, especially when there's

09:36.880 --> 09:39.240
so many passionate Plasma users out there.

09:39.240 --> 09:43.840
And you have what we all love to call as stakeholders.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.440
You got lots of stakeholders with a project like Kaywin.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.440
We love Kaywin.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.480
But wouldn't you be pretty mad if you just upgrade, you didn't realize there'd been these

09:49.480 --> 09:52.240
major changes were in there and suddenly your desktop starts crashing?

09:52.240 --> 09:53.240
I would be.

09:53.240 --> 09:55.960
Yeah, there's all those use cases they have to accommodate.

09:55.960 --> 10:03.080
So I think when the developer, Roman Gligg, or Gilg, when he came up against

10:03.080 --> 10:10.440
these constraints and saw what he classified as really significant problems, and I don't

10:10.440 --> 10:16.640
know how true that is, but when you read his actual post, his original post, in his estimation,

10:16.640 --> 10:21.840
there were alarmingly, like, I think he used the word shockingly bad.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.080
It is always a little difficult to tell.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.880
I mean, one developer's shock is another developer's like, yeah, we know about these problems.

10:26.880 --> 10:30.140
We're working on them, but it's hard to fix.

10:30.140 --> 10:33.960
One developer's shock and awe is another developer's everyday technical debt.

10:33.960 --> 10:34.960
Right.

10:34.960 --> 10:35.960
Yeah, exactly.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.960
There are some interesting things that have already been included, including a rework

10:38.960 --> 10:40.800
of Kaywin's composition pipeline.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.920
That sounds like a big deal, especially since according to some early feedback, it improves

10:44.920 --> 10:49.040
the presentation greatly on both X11 and Wayland.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.940
Plus there's a new timer that helps minimize the latency from image creation to actually

10:52.940 --> 10:53.940
getting it on your screen.

10:53.940 --> 10:55.840
And we all want things to be fast.

10:55.840 --> 11:03.920
The other thing that's nice is support for the Wayland viewporter extension, which enables

11:03.920 --> 11:05.180
better presentation of content.

11:05.180 --> 11:11.400
For example, video players and with the next X Wayland release, emulating resolution changes

11:11.400 --> 11:12.460
for older games.

11:12.460 --> 11:16.760
So if you've got some older game, it expects to be run at some super tiny resolution that

11:16.760 --> 11:18.800
should just work better under Wayland.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.800
That actually will be nice.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.720
I have ran into that.

11:21.720 --> 11:25.720
In fact, I was just talking about in our love plug meeting on Sunday why I had to stop

11:25.720 --> 11:28.000
gaming on Wayland after months of it working.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.840
And that was one of the reasons I ran into an issue like that.

11:30.840 --> 11:31.840
This is an early thing.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.680
I mean, we're talking about the very first release.

11:34.680 --> 11:38.880
It's basically packaged for arch systems at this point.

11:38.880 --> 11:41.520
It's very early days.

11:41.520 --> 11:48.720
But this fork phenomenon is both a bad thing and a good thing.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.120
But I want to talk about why it's a good thing just for a moment.

11:51.120 --> 11:58.840
It is a bypass switch that does not exist in other forms of business or software development.

11:58.840 --> 12:04.960
When you in business or in regular commercial software development, when you hit a group

12:04.960 --> 12:11.040
of stakeholders who are unwilling to make changes because of justifiable reasons, insert

12:11.040 --> 12:14.440
whatever they might be here, you're dead in the water.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.440
There's nothing you can do about it.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.560
There's no alternative choice.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.640
But with open source and free software, if you get to the point where you feel like the

12:22.640 --> 12:28.480
organization is perhaps hampering the future of the actual software development itself,

12:28.480 --> 12:29.860
you can fork it.

12:29.860 --> 12:34.800
There's not copyright law and IP law, I mean, in some cases, but in most genuine free software

12:34.800 --> 12:37.160
project cases, they can't come after you for it.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.160
Right.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.000
I mean, there's no guarantee that your fork will be popular or anyone will use it, but

12:41.000 --> 12:42.960
you totally have the freedom to go explore.

12:42.960 --> 12:47.560
And sometimes those changes eventually make it back upstream or things re-emerge or you

12:47.560 --> 12:49.400
just end up with two healthy projects.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.160
But think about how empowering that is for software developers.

12:52.160 --> 12:56.120
Because imagine yourself, imagine maybe you have a situation at work or with family or

12:56.120 --> 13:01.500
your church or whatever it is where you've been advocating for something to be done differently,

13:01.500 --> 13:07.000
but for justifiable reasons, quote unquote, nothing's happening.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.320
Nobody will do anything and you're just dead in the water.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.000
You can take no action.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.320
How empowering is it that as a software developer, you can fork in these cases?

13:15.320 --> 13:20.000
And I think we can all think of some very, very, very, very successful forks that have

13:20.000 --> 13:21.880
eventually become the main project long term.

13:21.880 --> 13:25.960
I mean, it also sort of underscores to me that it's not, you know, this isn't the KDE

13:25.960 --> 13:26.960
projects code.

13:26.960 --> 13:27.960
It's not some developers code.

13:27.960 --> 13:28.960
It's everyone's code.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.200
It's free software.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.200
That's a good point, too.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.800
It's the people's code, Wes.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.000
I say fork away.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.320
And I'd like to see where this goes.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.820
Maybe eventually some of these things get incorporated back into mainline Kwin.

13:39.820 --> 13:40.820
Who knows, right?

13:40.820 --> 13:41.820
Right.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.280
And it might just be end up as an experimental project to sort of explore the possibilities

13:44.280 --> 13:47.880
for future directions without committing to those changes in the upstream project.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.240
Now, of course, it's not perfect with forks.

13:50.240 --> 13:54.600
There are downsides that we've talked about all the time, including splitting labor and

13:54.600 --> 13:57.680
might just end up with no one using the fork for a lot of wasted effort.

13:57.680 --> 13:58.680
Right.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.160
It's not a guaranteed thing, is it, Minimac?

14:00.160 --> 14:02.780
Yeah, it's always the same of these forks.

14:02.780 --> 14:07.840
You have to find some other developers supporting you, otherwise it stays a one man show.

14:07.840 --> 14:08.840
Yeah.

14:08.840 --> 14:09.840
And you got to get users.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.660
It's not a slam dunk.

14:11.660 --> 14:16.100
It's an interesting feature of free software that I don't think is very prevalent in other

14:16.100 --> 14:19.480
software development or even just general business practices.

14:19.480 --> 14:20.480
Certainly fascinating to watch.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.480
Yeah, it is.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.480
All right.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.980
I want to debate something with you guys.

14:23.980 --> 14:25.620
See what you all think about this.

14:25.620 --> 14:28.000
Are you familiar with Bleach Bit?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.960
That sounds familiar, but no, not really.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.680
Well, I heard the name Bleach Bit.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.660
I was thinking it was like, like DBAN.

14:34.660 --> 14:36.760
You know, somebody went in a white, you know, a hard drive wiper.

14:36.760 --> 14:41.840
Now I remember Bleach Bit is, it's like a, think of it as like a Linux desktop maintenance

14:41.840 --> 14:42.840
program.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.680
Oh, like something you might use in Windows to clean things up.

14:44.680 --> 14:45.680
Yeah.

14:45.680 --> 14:46.680
Like CCleaner was.

14:46.680 --> 14:47.680
Yes, exactly.

14:47.680 --> 14:48.680
Yeah.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.680
Like you would see in Windows.

14:49.680 --> 14:56.780
Bleach Bit is a Python application that goes through and cleans out your Firefox, Chrome,

14:56.780 --> 15:00.440
your Opera cache, and it'll go through if you use G Potter and clean up some of the

15:00.440 --> 15:01.440
old files there.

15:01.440 --> 15:05.360
If you've got some VLC caches that haven't been updated in a long time.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.040
I didn't even know that existed.

15:07.040 --> 15:11.980
It'll do some small fixes too, like fixing some pop-up notification things.

15:11.980 --> 15:15.880
It's all just specific to the Linux desktop and they've added specific support for different

15:15.880 --> 15:20.200
distros to try to accommodate the way they lay things out and whatnot.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.100
And the idea is, is you run Bleach Bit.

15:23.100 --> 15:26.560
It says, all right, I've detected this software on your Linux box.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.000
This is my, this is my recommendation to go clean it up.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.440
You're going to save 2.3 gigs or whatever.

15:32.440 --> 15:36.000
What is your opinion, Wes Payne, on using these kinds of tools on your desktop?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.660
I'm going to go out on a limb and guess you've never run this on your computer.

15:38.660 --> 15:39.660
I have not.

15:39.660 --> 15:40.800
Although I did just install it.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.080
I've never run it either.

15:42.080 --> 15:47.800
I've run CCleaner on Windows boxes before though, so I kind of get the concept.

15:47.800 --> 15:52.520
I also don't think that Linux is immune from needing some kind of maintenance, especially

15:52.520 --> 15:54.360
a box you've been running a while that's collected some files.

15:54.360 --> 15:57.080
I mean, hey, we've all looked under.config and been a little horrified.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.080
Yeah.

15:58.080 --> 16:02.400
I'm surprised that like things that are still alive in some temp directory years later,

16:02.400 --> 16:03.520
you know, I've definitely done that too.

16:03.520 --> 16:07.300
It does seem a little more difficult on Linux just because there's so much more variation

16:07.300 --> 16:09.240
than on the Windows platform.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.760
But a lot of this stuff is integrating with things like Firefox and Chrome, which I'm

16:11.760 --> 16:13.560
sure are huge offenders.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.880
And those are at least standardized.

16:15.880 --> 16:19.680
In some sense, it might be nice to see because users coming from other platforms who are

16:19.680 --> 16:24.280
not yet familiar with the strange directory layout in our Unix world.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.320
These are hard to find.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.940
You might not know if they're safe to delete.

16:26.940 --> 16:31.060
So if this is the sort of helping hand you need to feel like you can actively maintain

16:31.060 --> 16:34.040
and administer your system, I guess I'm all for it.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.040
What do you think about these types of tools, GZ?

16:36.040 --> 16:39.000
Is Linux too much of a moving target for something like this to work?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
That's exactly it.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.760
I mean, personally, I would never use anything like this.

16:42.760 --> 16:46.200
But you know, it does raise a valid point that if you're coming from another operating

16:46.200 --> 16:50.000
system, you might find a tool like this helpful.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.160
But for me, it seems like that the ever evolving state of Linux kind of prohibits this and

16:56.160 --> 16:59.760
you always just end up chasing your own tail.

16:59.760 --> 17:03.800
And the devs just have to keep going back over top of these things.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.640
And here's this latest iteration.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.800
Here's kwin-ft or how do we handle this?

17:08.800 --> 17:09.800
How do we handle that?

17:09.800 --> 17:12.520
So I think that for me, it's not something I would use.

17:12.520 --> 17:18.320
I guess if you feel some sort of, you know, provide you some sort of safety net, use it.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.560
But I would never personally use it.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.700
So Brent, I'm curious to know what you think.

17:22.700 --> 17:26.080
You probably often are managing disk space with lots of photos.

17:26.080 --> 17:29.160
You could probably eke out a few gigs here and there with a tool like this.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.400
Is this something that would appeal to you?

17:30.400 --> 17:34.460
Well, I would say in the past, it felt like, you know, those two point whatever gigs that

17:34.460 --> 17:36.720
you get back felt really important.

17:36.720 --> 17:41.520
But I just feel like these days in the last year or two, maybe three, four, for some of

17:41.520 --> 17:48.080
us, hard drive space and solid state space is just so cheap that I don't really think

17:48.080 --> 17:49.080
about that anymore.

17:49.080 --> 17:53.200
Like, it's, of course, with my photos, I end up filling up directories pretty quickly.

17:53.200 --> 17:57.640
But the effort, even with a great tool like this to kind of wrap my head around cleaning

17:57.640 --> 18:01.220
those little files up, it kind of doesn't seem worth the time for me.

18:01.220 --> 18:04.040
So I don't know, maybe that's just me.

18:04.040 --> 18:08.400
Yeah, disks are cheap and there's a ton of space on there.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.400
What about new users?

18:09.400 --> 18:10.400
Computer kid?

18:10.400 --> 18:12.160
This seems like it could be used for people that haven't really learned the file system

18:12.160 --> 18:13.160
yet.

18:13.160 --> 18:22.440
Yeah, I would say that if we're going to have Linux go mainstream as a like desktop platform,

18:22.440 --> 18:26.800
we're going to need tools like this because for new users, this would be a very nice thing

18:26.800 --> 18:35.000
to have, especially new users with Chromebook level ish under storage filled devices.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.480
This would be helpful, but probably not for like production and stuff.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.480
Right.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.480
I could see that.

18:41.480 --> 18:44.640
Colonel, you're not necessarily a new user, but you've used, I believe, Bleachbit in the

18:44.640 --> 18:46.040
past and liked it, right?

18:46.040 --> 18:47.040
Yeah.

18:47.040 --> 18:52.080
So where I've used Bleachbit in the past is it makes it really easy to find caches for

18:52.080 --> 18:53.560
certain programs.

18:53.560 --> 18:58.920
And I've had desktop environments glitch out on me and I've used Bleachbit to go and wipe

18:58.920 --> 19:02.720
its caches and it fixes the problem.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.480
Same thing with a few other programs.

19:04.480 --> 19:08.000
You know, like Cheezy was saying, I think part of the problem here is that Linux is

19:08.000 --> 19:09.680
a big moving target.

19:09.680 --> 19:13.840
And so this application would have to get updated all the time.

19:13.840 --> 19:18.720
However, that's also perhaps an argument for the application because you could then say,

19:18.720 --> 19:20.600
well, Linux is a moving target all the time.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.720
I don't have time to learn where stuff's getting relocated.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.100
So I will just trust that these developers who will probably know more than me will programmatically

19:27.100 --> 19:28.760
solve this for me.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.920
So I could see that as a justification for it too.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.360
It does seem to have some nice safeguards.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.480
Like I was going to select some stuff to clean up Firefox and it warned me that I was about

19:35.480 --> 19:39.320
to delete any saved passwords I have, which I don't manage them that way, but it's good

19:39.320 --> 19:40.320
to know.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.480
How does this registry cleaning function work?

19:42.480 --> 19:46.000
Oh man, Windows.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.740
It really seems more necessary on Windows, but a nice to have on Linux, basically.

19:50.740 --> 19:55.560
And I do wonder if there isn't maybe two or three or four things it does that are actually

19:55.560 --> 19:57.320
pretty handy that you couldn't then just go do manually.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.320
Well, yeah.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.600
I mean, there's one here like clean up broken desktop files, which I'm not auditing those

20:01.600 --> 20:02.600
things.

20:02.600 --> 20:03.600
That's nice to have a tool for.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.600
Yeah.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.720
I've had dead desktop files that just sit around forever.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.740
Why doesn't something check the path of those things?

20:09.740 --> 20:11.000
What an obvious idea.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Okay.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
I can kind of see it.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.200
Maybe that's what Fedora needed to do because unfortunately Fedora 32, which I think was

20:18.200 --> 20:25.240
going to be releasing today as we record, has been bumped as of right now to the 28th

20:25.240 --> 20:26.240
of April.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.200
So a week from about now, a week and change.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.200
We'll find out more.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.460
There's going to be another meeting to sort of talk about if that release date looks plausible

20:32.460 --> 20:35.480
this coming Thursday, the 23rd.

20:35.480 --> 20:41.960
If you missed our fun with early out of memory killers, okay, Umar, go check out that episode

20:41.960 --> 20:45.920
of Linux Unplugged because we did play around with one of the more fun features of Fedora

20:45.920 --> 20:50.200
32 and that's going to whet your appetite, I think, for this new release.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.200
Episode 348.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.200
Thank you, Wes.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.440
So you just have to wait a few more days to get Fedora 32.

20:55.440 --> 21:00.860
And we will actually, it kind of works out for your humble Linux talk show because now

21:00.860 --> 21:03.800
we can do Ubuntu this week and we can do Fedora next week.

21:03.800 --> 21:04.800
A little awkward otherwise.

21:04.800 --> 21:05.800
Yeah.

21:05.800 --> 21:09.440
Fitting two distro reviews in, it's just not really very doable.

21:09.440 --> 21:10.440
It's a lot.

21:10.440 --> 21:14.120
The target release date now, of course, things can change.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.120
They will meet together.

21:15.120 --> 21:20.080
They have a, they have a no go, go meeting, kind of like a space launch for an Apollo

21:20.080 --> 21:21.080
rocket.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.080
With similar consequences.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.680
Go, no go flight.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.780
Yeah, very similar.

21:25.780 --> 21:28.240
And then they decide if they're going to release and they'll meet again.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.760
And it looks like the target release date is April 28th.

21:31.760 --> 21:36.360
Carl, did I butcher anything in there that you want to fix before we move on?

21:36.360 --> 21:37.880
Does that sound about all right to you?

21:37.880 --> 21:38.880
I approve.

21:38.880 --> 21:39.880
Okay, good.

21:39.880 --> 21:40.880
Thank you, sir.

21:40.880 --> 21:41.880
Woo.

21:41.880 --> 21:42.880
With no authority.

21:42.880 --> 21:43.880
Yeah.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.960
No, but you're at least closer to the grapevine than I am.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.120
Carl says grapevine.

21:48.120 --> 21:49.120
You'd probably know.

21:49.120 --> 21:53.120
How about a little housekeeping?

21:53.120 --> 21:54.120
Yes, please.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.120
You down for that?

21:55.120 --> 21:56.120
I'm down for that.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.120
Yeah.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.120
There's kind of a smell in here.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.120
Yeah.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.120
We needed to get this done.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.000
Go check out Linux Spotlight episode 44.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.880
Our very own Drew DeVore, editor of this year podcast, was featured with Rocco on Linux

22:08.880 --> 22:09.880
Spotlight.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.020
Drew, you're on the line.

22:11.020 --> 22:12.760
Is there anything you want to tease?

22:12.760 --> 22:15.680
Really, I just want to say thank you to Rocco.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.280
It was a really good interview.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.280
His style is fantastic, very laid back.

22:21.280 --> 22:26.720
And we had a lot of fun talking about really just everything surrounding Linux and the

22:26.720 --> 22:31.840
community and the future of it and really where things stand.

22:31.840 --> 22:36.560
So it was really nice to sit down with him and yeah, go check it out.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.760
I like that.

22:37.760 --> 22:41.440
You can tell, can't you, Drew, when you're working with him that Rocco works really hard

22:41.440 --> 22:42.440
on Linux Spotlight.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.440
Oh yeah.

22:43.440 --> 22:48.200
It is a fantastic program and he has put a lot of love into it.

22:48.200 --> 22:53.720
Also longtime community member Tyler Brown was interviewed on episode 43, so you can

22:53.720 --> 22:54.720
go check out that too.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.200
Lots of good stuff in that feed.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.200
Yeah.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.200
Yep.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.200
So go check out Linux Spotlight.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.200
We'll have links in the show notes.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.080
And I encourage you to join us live.

23:02.080 --> 23:05.840
We do this here show on Tuesdays at noon Pacific.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.960
Get it converted at your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

23:09.960 --> 23:16.280
Also I mentioned it already, but we're doing another get together on Sundays at the same

23:16.280 --> 23:17.280
live time.

23:17.280 --> 23:22.840
So noon Pacific, but on Sunday we're all jumping in that mumble room, we're having a good time.

23:22.840 --> 23:26.520
I think you and I, we were there for like maybe two and a half hours, two hours.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.080
And it was really just getting started by that point.

23:29.080 --> 23:30.080
No kidding.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.320
I'm like, I'm going to go eat.

23:32.320 --> 23:35.920
I should have just brought the pizza because the guys just had a great time.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.440
Popey showed up a little bit later.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.440
Computer kid ended up buying a 3D printer.

23:39.440 --> 23:40.440
Like the whole thing.

23:40.440 --> 23:41.600
Sounds like it was a lot of fun.

23:41.600 --> 23:44.040
It's a really nice way to sort of break up the Sunday.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.680
Just chat with like-minded folks.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.340
I think if people keep showing up, they're going to keep doing it.

23:48.340 --> 23:51.120
And we're going to make an attempt to show up from time to time, just like I'm sure everybody

23:51.120 --> 23:52.120
else was.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.720
You know, a Sunday opens up for you, jump on mumble and come hang out.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.580
If you can't make it during the week, it's also a great opportunity.

23:57.580 --> 24:03.080
But there's something really nice about having just prolonged conversations with people that

24:03.080 --> 24:06.280
know what the hell you're talking about when you're talking about Linux and things like

24:06.280 --> 24:07.280
that.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.280
A nice, casual atmosphere.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.280
No pressure.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.280
Yeah.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.280
Say what you want.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.520
And if you want to join us in a text conversation throughout the week when the shows are off

24:13.520 --> 24:19.040
the air or send us some quick feedback, check out jupitabroadcasting.com slash telegram.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.360
That is our official telegram channel.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.760
You know, maybe Brent should tell us to a brunch just came out this morning.

24:24.760 --> 24:25.760
That's right.

24:25.760 --> 24:26.760
Mr. Brent.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.160
The new brunch has landed.

24:28.160 --> 24:33.680
And for those of us that are fans of the gnome persuasion, it's a definite must listen.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.240
Yeah, I had a lovely conversation with Sri Ramakrishna.

24:37.240 --> 24:43.660
He's been part of the gnome community for since 98, which I can't fathom.

24:43.660 --> 24:49.920
So we kind of explored his, well, things he's seen since then, little shifts in community,

24:49.920 --> 24:53.120
the different bridges that have been building in the last year and a half between a bunch

24:53.120 --> 24:54.120
of communities.

24:54.120 --> 24:57.440
It was a really great chat, so I encourage people to check it out.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.520
I love a fresh brunch.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.080
Extras dot show slash 71.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.080
Thank you cheese.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.360
Yeah, so go check that out.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.920
Also go check out chrislast.com.

25:05.920 --> 25:10.080
I got some projects that I'm working on there and any future projects, you'll probably find

25:10.080 --> 25:11.680
them there at chrislast.com.

25:11.680 --> 25:14.240
If you're ever wondering, hey, where's Chris?

25:14.240 --> 25:15.240
What's he up to?

25:15.240 --> 25:16.240
chrislast.com.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.240
So go check that out.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.840
The Unfilter show's back.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.640
That's linked over there as well as a few other things.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.820
Check out chrislast.com.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.320
That's my personal site.

25:23.320 --> 25:29.000
Also just, I should have mentioned this earlier, that virtual lug meeting on Sunday also has

25:29.000 --> 25:30.440
their own chat room.

25:30.440 --> 25:34.800
It's on geekshed, irc dot geekshed dot net, and it's in pound, lup, lug.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.800
Hey, that's easy.

25:35.800 --> 25:36.800
Super easy.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.800
Sundays, noon, Pacific.

25:37.800 --> 25:42.160
There's a lot to check out, a lot going on these days, and more down the pipe, so be

25:42.160 --> 25:44.000
sure to check back.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.400
chrislast.com, Linux Unplugged, virtual lug getting together on Sundays, a lot of cool

25:49.400 --> 25:50.440
projects going on right now.

25:50.440 --> 25:51.560
I like that.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.520
The lug's self-organized.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.800
They did this on their own.

25:54.800 --> 25:55.800
Very cool.

25:55.800 --> 25:56.800
Super cool.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.280
And now we just get to show up as members of the community.

25:59.280 --> 26:02.960
We don't have to be the ones that are putting it all together and figuring it all out.

26:02.960 --> 26:03.960
We just get to be participants.

26:03.960 --> 26:04.960
It's not about us.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.960
It's a community thing.

26:05.960 --> 26:06.960
It's very cool for us.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.920
So I'm really glad you guys did that.

26:08.920 --> 26:09.920
All right.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.520
That's all the housekeeping we have.

26:11.520 --> 26:15.040
You ready to talk a little, Buntu?

26:15.040 --> 26:16.040
Finally.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.040
Little 20.04.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.960
So we got the focal here.

26:18.960 --> 26:19.960
I want to say focus.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.880
Is that, why don't I always want to say?

26:22.880 --> 26:23.880
Focus on focal.

26:23.880 --> 26:24.880
Why?

26:24.880 --> 26:25.880
Yeah.

26:25.880 --> 26:26.880
Let's focus.

26:26.880 --> 26:27.880
Yeah.

26:27.880 --> 26:28.880
Hey.

26:28.880 --> 26:29.880
Let's focus on focal real quick, Wes.

26:29.880 --> 26:30.880
What do you say?

26:30.880 --> 26:33.080
Now, what is a fuchsia, Wes?

26:33.080 --> 26:34.720
Do you know what a fuchsia is?

26:34.720 --> 26:38.880
Well, I didn't before, but thankfully we did some research.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.880
Not a lot of people know about the fuchsia.

26:40.880 --> 26:44.800
The fuchsia is the largest carnivore on Madagascar.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.560
A fuchsia is a pretty unique animal.

26:47.560 --> 26:52.440
If I had to imagine what the common ancestor between the mongooses, the cats, and the hyenas

26:52.440 --> 26:55.960
looked like, I imagine it would look a lot like a fuchsia.

26:55.960 --> 26:56.960
You've always said that, right?

26:56.960 --> 26:57.960
Yeah.

26:57.960 --> 26:58.960
Absolutely.

26:58.960 --> 27:03.160
Turns out Madagascar is a weird place full of strange animals.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.040
So let's talk about a Buntu 20.04.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.800
It is the next long-term support.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.480
It'll be supported for five years.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.120
There's a couple of big headline features with this one.

27:12.120 --> 27:16.120
You're getting baked in ZFS snapshots if you choose that option during the installer.

27:16.120 --> 27:19.280
And you probably should, even if it's experimental.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.280
Yes.

27:20.280 --> 27:24.640
You're getting GNOME 3.36 with the Yaru theme installed by default.

27:24.640 --> 27:25.640
Beautiful.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.640
Mm-hmm.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.120
As well as kernel, was it 5.5?

27:29.120 --> 27:30.120
5.4.

27:30.120 --> 27:36.120
Ah, yes, 5.4, but with WireGuard backported right in.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.480
So let's start here.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.640
Let's start at the ZFS snapshots.

27:39.640 --> 27:47.160
Let's just get this out of the way, because I think this is a big part of what is in 20.04,

27:47.160 --> 27:48.280
is the work they've done here.

27:48.280 --> 27:52.680
A lot of, I think, software engineering, a lot of the software engineering that went

27:52.680 --> 27:55.880
into 20.04 was around these ZFS snapshots.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.480
I crave ZFS.

27:57.480 --> 28:00.040
Yeah, I know, Leo.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.760
They integrate in at the grub menu level.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.600
They integrate in at the package or manager level.

28:03.600 --> 28:07.280
So when you're installing a package, they take snapshots and things like that.

28:07.280 --> 28:14.680
And I'm very, very happy to report that on several, more than two occasions.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.440
Oh, I don't even know about all these.

28:16.440 --> 28:23.640
I used the snapshots to fix something that went wrong on my beta process.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.400
And that does happen when you're using pre-release software.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.400
Absolutely.

28:27.400 --> 28:31.200
And so having these snapshots was very, very useful.

28:31.200 --> 28:36.060
And the way they present themselves is you restart, and the grub menu comes up, and there's

28:36.060 --> 28:38.560
like an advanced option that you go to in the grub menu.

28:38.560 --> 28:41.560
And there you have all of your snapshots listed.

28:41.560 --> 28:46.760
Not super intuitive, not super obvious, like which ones are pre-upgrades or not, because

28:46.760 --> 28:48.000
it's all kind of date and time based.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Right.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.840
So you kind of have to have a sense of when did I last upgrade and when did this break?

28:53.840 --> 28:59.520
Which did actually bite me, because I at one point went back, but I didn't go back far

28:59.520 --> 29:00.520
enough.

29:00.520 --> 29:03.120
And you have two options, essentially, when you go back.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.120
There's more than that.

29:04.120 --> 29:08.320
There's two options, when you want to restore, you can either go back and just restore the

29:08.320 --> 29:13.480
system state, or you can restore the system state along with user data.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.960
And you were digging into how that actually functionally works.

29:15.960 --> 29:16.960
Yeah.

29:16.960 --> 29:17.960
I mean, they've done a lot of interesting work.

29:17.960 --> 29:21.600
There's a whole sort of grub function in there to go find all your snapshots and list it

29:21.600 --> 29:22.940
out.

29:22.940 --> 29:25.880
All that stuff's integrated with the use of their new ZSYS tool.

29:25.880 --> 29:31.880
So anytime you're installing an apt package, that triggers a ZSYS call, ZSYS goes and saves

29:31.880 --> 29:33.120
the system state.

29:33.120 --> 29:36.960
And then if you want to restore user data as well, if it's just the system, you boot

29:36.960 --> 29:40.760
right into that snapshot, right, and it just swaps it out, the magic of ZFS.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.640
And then they've added some hooks so that if you want to do the user data, that just

29:43.640 --> 29:47.480
triggers ZSYS once you've logged in before, you know, as the system is coming up, and

29:47.480 --> 29:49.200
then it'll roll those back too.

29:49.200 --> 29:56.160
So ZSYS is a ZFS system tool for targeting a ZFS on Linux experience that right now is

29:56.160 --> 30:00.860
tailored towards Ubuntu, but in theory, any project could modify this, it's open source.

30:00.860 --> 30:07.840
It allows running multiple ZFS systems in parallel on the same machine.

30:07.840 --> 30:08.840
How cool is that?

30:08.840 --> 30:13.340
And the great thing about snapshots, correct me if I'm wrong, great thing about snapshots

30:13.340 --> 30:14.760
is their differentials.

30:14.760 --> 30:20.480
You're not bombing your disk, taking up 30 gig snapshots every time you back your system

30:20.480 --> 30:21.480
up.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.760
It's a differential and it's almost like pointers in a file system directory.

30:24.760 --> 30:29.000
Yeah, I mean, that's really the magic of copy on write is that you have all these references

30:29.000 --> 30:32.720
and yes, it still does take up some space and you will need to clean up those snapshots

30:32.720 --> 30:36.600
eventually, but you're not having to make a whole new copy of every single file unless

30:36.600 --> 30:37.600
it actually changed.

30:37.600 --> 30:43.280
I actually am not totally clear on what the cleanup process is with ZSYS because I've

30:43.280 --> 30:47.520
just not used it long enough to see it auto trim.

30:47.520 --> 30:52.400
And on top of that, I've been rapidly installing updates because of the beta period.

30:52.400 --> 30:57.200
I will also add that the setup is not necessarily simple to make some of this magic work.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.920
You've got a root pool and a boot pool and a whole bunch of data sets underneath each.

31:00.920 --> 31:06.040
So if you're not familiar with CFS and you're not willing to maybe go poke around a little,

31:06.040 --> 31:09.240
do consider that this is an advanced experimental feature.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.680
But honestly, so far, I haven't had to.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.400
You almost don't notice it exists besides a couple of messages when you're installing

31:15.400 --> 31:19.620
a package that tell you that it's taking a snapshot and these new grub options.

31:19.620 --> 31:21.120
There's really nothing else you need to worry about.

31:21.120 --> 31:23.120
You wouldn't even know you're on CFS.

31:23.120 --> 31:27.800
I think it would be possible to install an Ubuntu system with CFS and give it to an end

31:27.800 --> 31:31.680
user and they would never have any idea unless they really dug around.

31:31.680 --> 31:33.760
A couple of caveats, though.

31:33.760 --> 31:36.460
It requires full disk partitioning.

31:36.460 --> 31:41.600
The current implementation, it needs to be set up by the installer to use ZSYS and it

31:41.600 --> 31:43.880
needs to take over your entire disk.

31:43.880 --> 31:46.800
And they have sliced things up considerably.

31:46.800 --> 31:51.480
Like they've really kind of sliced things up to manage how it does snapshots.

31:51.480 --> 31:55.160
And it can be a little complicated when you look at it just as a layman.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.160
Yeah.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.960
I mean, there's a lot of different data sets each mounted, right?

31:57.960 --> 32:00.720
So stuff for your home directory, all kinds of different things for the different root

32:00.720 --> 32:01.720
folders.

32:01.720 --> 32:02.720
And that makes sense.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.160
It gives you more granularity as you're taking these snapshots, so you can actually roll

32:05.160 --> 32:07.960
back what you want and not one big, huge rollback.

32:07.960 --> 32:08.960
Right.

32:08.960 --> 32:12.600
Like, for example, I can roll back just the system software, but my user home directory,

32:12.600 --> 32:15.520
all my user setting up, app settings, all that remains.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.020
And that's pretty fricking nice, Wes.

32:18.020 --> 32:21.640
That's where I've been really impressed is it's just for being experimental, for being

32:21.640 --> 32:22.640
new.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.920
I mean, ZSYS hasn't been around that long and it's a brand new app written in Go from

32:25.920 --> 32:26.920
Canonical.

32:26.920 --> 32:29.280
It all just sort of works.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.280
Yeah.

32:30.280 --> 32:36.000
Now, what about, so like Tyler, you want to use ZFS and you want to use this new ZSYS

32:36.000 --> 32:38.040
system they have on your next server build, right?

32:38.040 --> 32:42.240
I've not looked into the new ZSYS system, but I definitely intend on using a ZFS as

32:42.240 --> 32:45.560
the file system for my server build next month.

32:45.560 --> 32:46.560
Yeah.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.560
Yeah.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.440
I want to see what is now possible.

32:49.440 --> 32:54.360
I think there's a lot of speculation way back in 1604 when we very first had ZFS built into

32:54.360 --> 32:55.360
the kernel.

32:55.360 --> 32:56.360
Were there going to be lawsuits?

32:56.360 --> 32:57.360
What's going to happen?

32:57.360 --> 33:00.040
Is it just some option for really experienced administrators?

33:00.040 --> 33:01.040
Right.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.760
Canonical clearly has some long-term plans here and that's awesome.

33:03.760 --> 33:10.340
So before we move off ZFS, I got to touch on what I think is the big picture aspect

33:10.340 --> 33:14.860
of this, because it's not just ZFS, it's the snapshots too.

33:14.860 --> 33:17.920
And it's snapshots done in a way that I think are a little bit better than anybody else

33:17.920 --> 33:18.920
has done them before.

33:18.920 --> 33:22.680
Other distributions have had snapshots integrated with their package manager before.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.420
This feels like a more comprehensive solution.

33:25.420 --> 33:29.620
And because of things like ZSYS and the overall approach they're taking and the integration

33:29.620 --> 33:35.400
with grub and the package manager, the entire picture, when you zoom out what you get, and

33:35.400 --> 33:41.740
you know this is a big deal for me, this is legitimately Canonical's first crack at a

33:41.740 --> 33:44.520
truly bulletproof Linux workstation server.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.520
You're going to say it.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.520
You knew it.

33:46.520 --> 33:47.520
But you're right.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.520
This matters so much to me.

33:48.520 --> 33:52.600
I want Linux to get to the point where it is absolutely bulletproof.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.600
And that's why projects like Silverblue appeal to me.

33:55.600 --> 33:59.920
And that's why Canonical integrating these snapshots the way they have appealed to me.

33:59.920 --> 34:06.640
Because it means as an end user, my first step towards getting a bulletproof Linux distribution

34:06.640 --> 34:10.820
isn't hours and hours of reading Wiki and forms and listening to podcasts.

34:10.820 --> 34:14.240
It's not figuring it out from a technical level and building software.

34:14.240 --> 34:15.240
It's none of that.

34:15.240 --> 34:17.080
I just install the frickin distribution.

34:17.080 --> 34:21.080
Well, it made me think about when we were trying timeshift out on Linux Mint and that

34:21.080 --> 34:22.080
was great.

34:22.080 --> 34:25.540
But you could you could really tell it was sort of bolted on, hacked on at the end.

34:25.540 --> 34:26.540
Don't get me wrong.

34:26.540 --> 34:27.540
I'm grateful it exists.

34:27.540 --> 34:29.320
But this is designing it from the ground up.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.200
By the people that are making the OS.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.200
Right.

34:32.200 --> 34:35.440
And powered by ZFS, which I mean, can you pick a more rock solid file system?

34:35.440 --> 34:36.440
And it's portable.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.200
You know, I mean, it's true that they're doing the disk layout and all of that.

34:39.200 --> 34:42.920
But at the end of the day, these ZFS snapshots and file systems are portable.

34:42.920 --> 34:43.920
Right.

34:43.920 --> 34:47.400
And it's got the advantage of things like ZFS send and receive now, too.

34:47.400 --> 34:53.280
So I really can't underscore how critically important this is as a first step towards

34:53.280 --> 34:55.760
the Ubuntu desktop becoming bulletproof.

34:55.760 --> 35:02.000
It isn't bulletproof because of this, but man, is this a huge step.

35:02.000 --> 35:11.600
I mean, I'm sitting here using my daily driver laptop, my ThinkPad on a beta because of this.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.400
Like I had things blow up.

35:13.400 --> 35:18.680
I will tell you, this was not the smoothest Ubuntu beta I've ever had.

35:18.680 --> 35:22.640
That does seem to be the case, which with a lot of neat new features, you know, there's

35:22.640 --> 35:25.180
a lot of things to tweak before you can get it out the door.

35:25.180 --> 35:30.160
And if it wasn't for this recovery system and get right back to work, I would have had

35:30.160 --> 35:31.160
to nuke and pave.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.760
In fact, did you end up having to go back on to plasma?

35:32.760 --> 35:36.620
Yeah, I was planning to do the show on 2004 because why wouldn't I?

35:36.620 --> 35:39.960
But having it lock up right before the show was not very encouraging.

35:39.960 --> 35:40.960
Yeah.

35:40.960 --> 35:41.960
And that was a flat pack thing.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.200
I mean, it was something we're going to look into after the show.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.920
And if we need to file a bug, we will.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.200
I think it's a double edged sword.

35:48.200 --> 35:52.980
I think what happened was Canonical ran a very successful testing week.

35:52.980 --> 35:59.480
At the flip side, that meant that right towards the end, a whole bunch of bug fixes landed,

35:59.480 --> 36:03.720
which is good, but not always the recipe you want for an LTS.

36:03.720 --> 36:09.640
So if I was going to run this in production on my server, I might wait until a point release

36:09.640 --> 36:15.320
or two for 2004 and I might stick with 1804 on my x86 hardware.

36:15.320 --> 36:21.800
That being said, as often happens on this show, I'm not actually doing what I preach.

36:21.800 --> 36:29.200
I am running on my Raspberry Pi 4 Ubuntu 2004 and I will not run anything else, at least

36:29.200 --> 36:30.200
for a while.

36:30.200 --> 36:35.640
I will try other distros soon, but fricking A am I so happy with Ubuntu 2004 on the Raspberry

36:35.640 --> 36:36.640
Pi.

36:36.640 --> 36:41.280
I think Canon said they're going to make the Raspberry Pi platform a first class citizen

36:41.280 --> 36:42.320
for Ubuntu.

36:42.320 --> 36:43.320
They weren't kidding.

36:43.320 --> 36:44.320
Big deal.

36:44.320 --> 36:51.360
2004 on the Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 gigs of RAM in 64 bit mode is the best experience

36:51.360 --> 36:55.920
I have ever had, even compared to Raspbian, on a Raspberry Pi.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.780
And they've fixed some things that have yet to be fixed in the Raspbian kernel that have

36:59.780 --> 37:01.840
landed in the 2004 kernel.

37:01.840 --> 37:05.980
So for the Raspberry Pi platform, I'm immediately switching to 2004.

37:05.980 --> 37:10.440
That said, on the x86 server side, I think I'm going to wait a little bit because of

37:10.440 --> 37:15.460
some of these issues I had during the beta and release candidate period that I think

37:15.460 --> 37:20.360
suggest if you can, give it a few weeks, maybe a couple of months.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.840
That's kind of the nice part about a new LTS too.

37:22.840 --> 37:23.880
There's no rush to use this.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.160
It's going to be around for a while.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.160
Right.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.160
And 1804 is still getting updates.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.160
Still great.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.160
Still great.

37:29.160 --> 37:34.520
So let's talk about some of the flavors here because as always, there's a lot to talk about

37:34.520 --> 37:36.560
in the different flavors when you add it all up.

37:36.560 --> 37:42.640
Of course, Kubuntu 2004 is seeing Plasma 5.18 land, which is nice.

37:42.640 --> 37:46.600
That includes things like the new emoji selector, which I admit I actually like.

37:46.600 --> 37:54.200
But more importantly, in my daily use, I've noticed a much improved GTK theming support.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.200
Oh, definitely.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.200
A lot nicer.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.400
A lot nicer.

37:57.400 --> 38:03.480
And there's better options for toggling notifications, which are, for me, probably the bane of the

38:03.480 --> 38:04.680
the largest source of annoyance.

38:04.680 --> 38:09.200
And now that both Plasma and Gnome have decent notification management, quality of life has

38:09.200 --> 38:10.960
actually gone up on this one.

38:10.960 --> 38:14.440
And of course, there's a Ubuntu Budgie 2004 seeing their typical release.

38:14.440 --> 38:18.440
Yeah, with a brand new application menu inspired by Slingshot.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.440
Yeah.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.900
There's also a new native network manager applet for managing wired and Wi-Fi connections.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.080
That's nice to see.

38:24.080 --> 38:27.280
Are you ready for the big feature in Ubuntu 2004?

38:27.280 --> 38:28.280
Oh, boy.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.280
I mean, it's got to be big, right?

38:29.280 --> 38:32.080
Come on, XFCE, they're making changes all the time.

38:32.080 --> 38:41.200
Ladies and gentlemen, after years of development, tons of anticipation, I am happy to report

38:41.200 --> 38:51.520
that Ubuntu 2004 features a brand new dark theme.

38:51.520 --> 38:58.800
You know, I'm surprised you're not more excited considering you are a dark theme kind of guy.

38:58.800 --> 39:04.360
I know, I know, but like, that's just not the kind of thing that's going to get me excited

39:04.360 --> 39:08.400
because I can just I was already that was like, within 30 seconds of using Ubuntu, I

39:08.400 --> 39:09.400
would change that.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.400
It is nice to see it bundled in.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.960
See, but you got to you got to switch your mindset here.

39:12.960 --> 39:15.120
The advantage is there's not too many things change.

39:15.120 --> 39:19.240
So you can just roll on to the next Ubuntu without having to deal with all these interface

39:19.240 --> 39:20.240
changes.

39:20.240 --> 39:24.160
Suddenly your apps don't work the same way while getting all the underlying 2004 stuff.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.160
That's it right there.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.160
And that's the point I was going to make.

39:26.160 --> 39:32.000
I was poking fun, but the reality is, is if they just keep the lights on and they rev

39:32.000 --> 39:38.280
everything and they just ship a 2004 ISO, they inherit all the improvements of 2004.

39:38.280 --> 39:42.000
So like job done, you know, they don't need to do much more.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Rock salad.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Yeah.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Yeah.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.440
And of course, Ubuntu Mate sees its update with this one.

39:48.440 --> 39:52.200
It's going to get all of the new Mate 1.2.4 features, of course, you're going to see better

39:52.200 --> 39:57.360
high DPI rendering throughout the entire UI, lots of nice notification improvements there

39:57.360 --> 39:58.360
as well.

39:58.360 --> 40:03.340
But, and I thought this was a mistake at first when I was going through the 2004 Mate edition,

40:03.340 --> 40:05.000
but then I confirmed it with Wimpy.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.520
They've removed Compass.

40:06.520 --> 40:07.520
It's gone.

40:07.520 --> 40:08.520
It's gone.

40:08.520 --> 40:09.520
Wow.

40:09.520 --> 40:10.520
Yeah.

40:10.520 --> 40:15.040
At the same time, the Marko window manager has seen significant, they are really working

40:15.040 --> 40:16.040
on improvements.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.040
Yeah.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.040
Big time.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.040
Lots of gaming stuff is in there.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.040
So just kind of makes sense.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.040
It would land in the LTS release.

40:21.040 --> 40:22.040
Right.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.320
It's going to be the new GTK front end for the FWAPD application.

40:24.320 --> 40:25.320
What?

40:25.320 --> 40:26.320
Yeah.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.320
FWAPD.

40:27.320 --> 40:30.080
But I just love seeing these GUIs for the firmware updates.

40:30.080 --> 40:34.160
It just makes Linux feel so first class, like a real system where you can actually manage

40:34.160 --> 40:36.680
the full life cycle of whatever machine you're on.

40:36.680 --> 40:37.680
Finally.

40:37.680 --> 40:38.680
Yeah.

40:38.680 --> 40:39.680
Yeah.

40:39.680 --> 40:40.680
Yeah, absolutely.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.000
So, Lubuntu, this is a big deal for them.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.640
This is their first LTS release using LXQT.

40:45.640 --> 40:46.880
So that's a big deal.

40:46.880 --> 40:47.880
And then...

40:47.880 --> 40:48.880
Wow.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.440
They've made a bunch of changes, a new menu.

40:52.440 --> 40:55.520
So those are both two that you need to take a look at.

40:55.520 --> 40:58.880
I do think Lubuntu, this was also...

40:58.880 --> 41:00.360
They're pushing on to 64-bit.

41:00.360 --> 41:05.800
So I don't believe there are any 32-bit builds of Lubuntu of 2004 either.

41:05.800 --> 41:06.800
What a heck of a time.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.180
32-bit is gone now.

41:08.180 --> 41:09.320
It's a great time to be a Linux user.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.320
It is though.

41:10.320 --> 41:16.760
Now, Drew, you may have noticed that Ubuntu Studio has landed with improved Ubuntu Studio

41:16.760 --> 41:17.760
controls.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.760
Can you tell us what this is and why it kind of matters?

41:19.760 --> 41:24.720
With Ubuntu Studio, you use something called Jack for your audio server.

41:24.720 --> 41:29.600
And Ubuntu Studio controls is essentially an easy mode for setting up Jack.

41:29.600 --> 41:32.200
At least that's the way I look at it.

41:32.200 --> 41:38.080
So it lets you control various aspects of how this Jack server runs so that you can

41:38.080 --> 41:44.360
get the lowest latency possible without having to do nearly as much fiddling in the backend.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.560
It just makes it super easy.

41:46.560 --> 41:50.000
You know, the number one problem with Jack is people getting started with it, so something

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
like that's really nice.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.480
Yeah, and most people don't really want to load PulseAudio modules from the command line,

41:54.480 --> 41:56.560
so a GUI makes things a lot simpler.

41:56.560 --> 41:57.560
They don't?

41:57.560 --> 41:59.960
Well, I do, but you certainly don't.

41:59.960 --> 42:06.200
No, in fact, thankfully, you can because Wes has scripted a whole bunch of stuff for us

42:06.200 --> 42:07.200
in the studio.

42:07.200 --> 42:10.360
So you do load it from the command line, but I never have to bother with it.

42:10.360 --> 42:14.680
However, keep that in mind when we get to our app pick later, which is a command line

42:14.680 --> 42:17.640
audio utility, which I picked.

42:17.640 --> 42:18.640
What is happening?

42:18.640 --> 42:19.640
You know what?

42:19.640 --> 42:20.640
Every now and then there's room for it.

42:20.640 --> 42:25.960
Also, something to consider with 2004 is this is a distribution now that ships in a post-spectre,

42:25.960 --> 42:26.960
post-meltdown world.

42:26.960 --> 42:27.960
Right.

42:27.960 --> 42:31.880
And I think it's worth talking about what that means for us as end users.

42:31.880 --> 42:36.800
There is some performance impacts because of this, and it's the new normal now.

42:36.800 --> 42:41.600
And so Michael Larable over at Ferronix did, as you would expect, a comprehensive benchmark

42:41.600 --> 42:46.800
of the impact that the out-of-the-box protections against Spectre, Meltdown, and its friends

42:46.800 --> 42:52.800
— that's a good way to put it — are, how they impact the 2004 default release.

42:52.800 --> 42:56.480
And it turns out there's a kernel command line just called mitigations equal off.

42:56.480 --> 43:02.280
If you just want to turn all these off, maybe not advisable, but it's definitely doable.

43:02.280 --> 43:07.080
But he ran it through 2004 through a series of real-world tests on a bunch of different

43:07.080 --> 43:11.500
Xeon CPUs, as well as an AMD EPYC CPU.

43:11.500 --> 43:14.760
And the results are not what I expected.

43:14.760 --> 43:22.000
In some instances, and I repeat, some instances, in some of those, the mitigation version actually

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
pulled ahead.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Weird.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Yeah, in most it didn't.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Sure.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Right.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.060
But in some it did.

43:28.060 --> 43:34.060
And when you look at the benchmarks, he did 42 different average server workload benchmarks

43:34.060 --> 43:35.120
just for server workloads.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.620
He did 42 different benchmarks.

43:37.620 --> 43:43.460
And he found that on the Xeon E5 Haswell and the Kaby Lake Xeons, on average, you're getting

43:43.460 --> 43:46.840
about a 12% hit to your performance on Ubuntu 2004.

43:46.840 --> 43:49.460
It's going to be the same for all Linuxes, right?

43:49.460 --> 43:53.680
On the EPYC Roam server, it was more like a 5% impact.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.160
Hey, that's not so bad.

43:55.160 --> 43:56.160
Right.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.840
That's almost noise at that level, which is really nice to see this, right?

43:58.840 --> 44:01.440
You know, there's probably tons of places, especially if you're not running a server

44:01.440 --> 44:04.680
or anything, where, yeah, you could safely or relatively safely disable these.

44:04.680 --> 44:07.240
You know, you could turn the mitigations off if you wanted to.

44:07.240 --> 44:10.360
But if that's the only difference, just don't bother.

44:10.360 --> 44:13.080
Yeah, it might be worth it, especially on the EPYC CPU.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.080
Right.

44:14.080 --> 44:18.380
You know, on the Intel CPU Xeons, he tried a couple of different Xeons.

44:18.380 --> 44:20.600
It varies more.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.200
I guess the word there would be it's just worth running your own benchmarks.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.200
And it's pretty easy with the Ferronix Test Suite.

44:25.200 --> 44:30.880
You could just actually run the exact benchmarks Michael runs because of the comparison feature

44:30.880 --> 44:32.440
and see how your system fares.

44:32.440 --> 44:36.760
You know, in Ferronix Test Suite news, I was happy to see that they've now got a WireGuard

44:36.760 --> 44:40.000
network, which you could use because, of course, WireGuard is included in 20.04.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.400
Let's talk about the 20.04 kernel.

44:42.400 --> 44:43.400
It's a special kernel.

44:43.400 --> 44:49.200
It's version 5.4, and it might be worth recapping what landed in 5.4 because it's just now going

44:49.200 --> 44:50.200
to hit users.

44:50.200 --> 44:54.680
Yeah, well, you get that original exFAT driver, if you remember, the first one based on some

44:54.680 --> 44:56.320
old Samsung code.

44:56.320 --> 44:59.920
You'll have to wait for kernel 5.7 to get the new updated one.

44:59.920 --> 45:00.920
But hey, that's there.

45:00.920 --> 45:01.920
It's probably good for read-only, though.

45:01.920 --> 45:02.920
Yeah, right.

45:02.920 --> 45:05.120
I mean, at least you can read stuff.

45:05.120 --> 45:09.280
You'll be pleased to know faster at large directory modifications on exFAT, as well

45:09.280 --> 45:13.320
as a new read-only file system that Huawei uses on their devices.

45:13.320 --> 45:15.440
So lots of file system love this time around.

45:15.440 --> 45:18.260
Plus, of course, better support for AMD hardware.

45:18.260 --> 45:22.520
If you're not familiar, IO U-Ring is a new kernel feature for doing fast, asynchronous

45:22.520 --> 45:23.520
IO.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.540
And 5.4 ships with a lot of good improvements there.

45:26.540 --> 45:30.960
And just outside, we've seen that really getting picked up for people that need really good

45:30.960 --> 45:31.960
disk performance.

45:31.960 --> 45:34.840
And there hasn't been a great option on Linux before.

45:34.840 --> 45:39.320
And as you know, IO load on the Linux kernel, that can do some nasty things to your desktop.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.880
Yeah, yeah, that's very true.

45:41.880 --> 45:47.560
I also recall that one of the really big headline features of 5.4 is one of the security features

45:47.560 --> 45:51.320
that I believe Canonical's touting to the server customers, and that's kernel lockdown

45:51.320 --> 45:52.320
mode.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.320
Lockdown!

45:53.320 --> 45:56.960
Intended to strengthen the boundary between root and the kernel.

45:56.960 --> 46:00.540
Once you've enabled it, various pieces of kernel functionality are restricted.

46:00.540 --> 46:03.820
So it could break some stuff, you're going to want to test this before you use it.

46:03.820 --> 46:07.120
But it helps keep things secure, especially maybe you're in a secure boot environment,

46:07.120 --> 46:10.120
you've got some certain controls or, you know, auditing that you need to do, and you have

46:10.120 --> 46:13.960
to make sure that the kernel is not just letting anybody load modules and all kinds of things.

46:13.960 --> 46:14.960
Lockdown mode will help you.

46:14.960 --> 46:20.160
Yeah, it's fascinating because it started trying to address something that secure boot

46:20.160 --> 46:24.360
offers, which secure boot almost feels like it's a dirty word for us to use these days.

46:24.360 --> 46:26.040
But it's so much more than that.

46:26.040 --> 46:27.840
What it developed into was a lot more than that.

46:27.840 --> 46:32.280
It started trying to ensure the basic protections of secure boot and developed into something

46:32.280 --> 46:33.440
a lot more.

46:33.440 --> 46:36.840
It's also nice because a lot of distributions had their own out-of-tree patches for this.

46:36.840 --> 46:40.080
And so now we can standardize all of that with the in-kernel version.

46:40.080 --> 46:41.600
Right, just normalize now.

46:41.600 --> 46:42.600
That's also really good to see.

46:42.600 --> 46:47.760
So it reduces the differences between Linux kernels and Linux distros.

46:47.760 --> 46:53.040
We've talked a lot about 5.6 recently and 5.7 because of WireGuard and things like that.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.880
5.4 was actually a pretty great release, too.

46:54.880 --> 46:59.040
Yeah, the last thing I'd like to touch on is the Vert.io file system, lots of file system

46:59.040 --> 47:00.040
stuff there.

47:00.040 --> 47:03.920
That's a Fuse framework-based file system that's designed to speed up copying things

47:03.920 --> 47:07.280
in and out of your QEMU guests, which, hey, that's pretty great.

47:07.280 --> 47:11.420
You will need a newer version of QEMU to get the support on the QEMU side, of course.

47:11.420 --> 47:14.960
But it's way faster than using, say, like the Plan 9 file system that lots of folks

47:14.960 --> 47:15.960
are using.

47:15.960 --> 47:20.760
And that's just great because virtual machines, Linux virtualization capabilities, top notch.

47:20.760 --> 47:21.760
Yeah.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.000
I'll put a link in the show notes.

47:23.000 --> 47:30.200
I did a visual comparison of GNOME 3.4 to GNOME 3.6.

47:30.200 --> 47:32.800
It's not huge.

47:32.800 --> 47:36.080
It's a quality of life improvement between GNOME 3.4 and GNOME 3.6.

47:36.080 --> 47:42.000
The menus are better, it's faster, tons of bug fixes, tons of GPU fixes.

47:42.000 --> 47:47.080
Take a look at the link I have in the show notes to Imgur, where I took two VMs and I

47:47.080 --> 47:53.640
just did two stock Ubuntu VMs side by side on my 27-inch screen and then just did A-B

47:53.640 --> 47:55.720
comparisons and did screenshots of that.

47:55.720 --> 47:57.000
And I have an Imgur album of that.

47:57.000 --> 48:03.080
And what you'll see in there is refinements to the main function menu for a log out and

48:03.080 --> 48:13.580
log in, incredible improvements to GNOME system settings, and a significantly nicer lock screen

48:13.580 --> 48:14.580
and log ins.

48:14.580 --> 48:17.120
Man, it's really first class now.

48:17.120 --> 48:19.960
Very pro looking, better than anything on the Mac or Windows.

48:19.960 --> 48:25.040
I mean, the new GNOME lock screen and log in screen are quite choice and they're just

48:25.040 --> 48:27.000
worth checking out the screenshots alone.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.560
On everything else we've just talked about, you've got this new GNOME release, which in

48:31.560 --> 48:40.060
my personal opinion, having some experience with GNOME over the last decade, I would say

48:40.060 --> 48:45.160
this is far and above the best release of GNOME Shell ever.

48:45.160 --> 48:48.880
This might be the best GNOME desktop and I'm even including the two version series with

48:48.880 --> 48:49.880
that.

48:49.880 --> 48:51.120
This might, 3.6 might be the best.

48:51.120 --> 48:54.320
It just feels so fast and rock solid and smooth.

48:54.320 --> 48:58.340
I mean, we were talking about this before the show, as much as we love Plasma, going

48:58.340 --> 49:03.200
back and forth between Plasma, even the latest version here on Neon and the latest GNOME,

49:03.200 --> 49:04.200
you feel the difference.

49:04.200 --> 49:05.200
Yes.

49:05.200 --> 49:10.320
I mean, like I said, I was doing an A, B side by side and I could tell just totally stock

49:10.320 --> 49:11.600
both of them.

49:11.600 --> 49:12.600
I could tell the difference.

49:12.600 --> 49:16.800
I think it shows, you know, to the GNOME team's credit that a lot of work has gone into the

49:16.800 --> 49:19.040
underpinnings there to just smooth everything out.

49:19.040 --> 49:20.040
Yeah.

49:20.040 --> 49:22.200
And there's been some good work by Canonical in that regard.

49:22.200 --> 49:25.240
There's been good work by just people, like you say, on the GNOME team.

49:25.240 --> 49:26.240
Let's go around the horn.

49:26.240 --> 49:29.320
So MiniMech, I'm curious to know what your experiences with 2004 and your testing were,

49:29.320 --> 49:30.920
if they were all that dramatic or not.

49:30.920 --> 49:37.160
One thing is that Ubuntu with the new LibSSL version they used in 2004, they deprecate

49:37.160 --> 49:38.580
some encryption models.

49:38.580 --> 49:43.680
So you have TLS 1.0 and 1.1 that are deprecated.

49:43.680 --> 49:49.120
So if all of a sudden you can't connect to your server anymore, you know where the problem

49:49.120 --> 49:50.120
lies.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.120
Oh, that's a good tip.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.740
We had that in Mumble.

49:52.740 --> 49:58.680
So our Mumble server was TLS 1.0, and all of a sudden I had problems to log in to the

49:58.680 --> 50:01.200
Jupyter broadcasting Mumble server.

50:01.200 --> 50:06.200
In fact, I'm very, very grateful that you guys got all that resolved before 2004 actually

50:06.200 --> 50:07.200
landed.

50:07.200 --> 50:08.200
No kidding.

50:08.200 --> 50:14.040
Tyler is pointing out in the chat room that we've missed probably one of the more obvious

50:14.040 --> 50:17.280
and important things about the GNOME setup with 2004.

50:17.280 --> 50:18.280
Yes.

50:18.280 --> 50:24.340
The new Yaru theme is absolutely gorgeous, especially the dark variant and the new icon

50:24.340 --> 50:28.200
set in 2004, it is also gorgeous.

50:28.200 --> 50:32.200
It's so nice that I'm installing it on every distro I use.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.200
Even if it's not Ubuntu.

50:33.200 --> 50:35.160
If I'm on Manjaro, I'm installing Yaru.

50:35.160 --> 50:37.520
It helps that I love me some purple.

50:37.520 --> 50:42.580
Also, and this is in my visual comparison, something that Canonical has added is a super

50:42.580 --> 50:47.300
simple appearance pane, I think is what you call it, in the GNOME system settings that

50:47.300 --> 50:49.440
just lets you toggle between light and dark mode.

50:49.440 --> 50:50.440
Just boop.

50:50.440 --> 50:53.520
Another one of those things that instead of going into some hacky sub menu to change these

50:53.520 --> 50:54.880
sort of unofficial settings.

50:54.880 --> 50:58.680
Or maybe even knowing that like in the past, you'd probably have to install GNOME tweaks.

50:58.680 --> 50:59.680
Right, right.

50:59.680 --> 51:01.840
Now it's just right there in the settings where it should be.

51:01.840 --> 51:02.840
Yeah.

51:02.840 --> 51:03.840
Yeah, that is really cool.

51:03.840 --> 51:04.840
And it looks good.

51:04.840 --> 51:08.800
And it's really easy to turn on, which I appreciate and it's really easy to turn off as well.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.320
Same with night shift, very easy to turn it off.

51:11.320 --> 51:17.760
There is potentially a bumpy road for a set of users that we don't directly address right

51:17.760 --> 51:22.480
now in this show, but is going to be a growing part of the Ubuntu base.

51:22.480 --> 51:27.180
And that's the WSL users, the people that are using Ubuntu on the Windows subsystem

51:27.180 --> 51:28.360
for Linux.

51:28.360 --> 51:37.080
And it seems as of now, until patches come down for Windows, the WSL 1 version 1 and

51:37.080 --> 51:40.120
Ubuntu 20.04 may have some compatibility issues.

51:40.120 --> 51:46.720
And this is actually pretty well documented and outlined on the Ubuntu discourse that

51:46.720 --> 51:47.720
you can read.

51:47.720 --> 51:48.720
We'll have a link to it.

51:48.720 --> 51:52.720
It appears that there is some problem with WSL 1.

51:52.720 --> 51:56.360
There's a patch for it, but it appears to be like a GLib issue.

51:56.360 --> 51:57.360
Well, right.

51:57.360 --> 52:02.980
So 20.04 has a new version of GLib C 2.31, and that's implemented a new nano sleep library

52:02.980 --> 52:05.480
call based on clock real time.

52:05.480 --> 52:10.200
Unfortunately, as you recall, WSL 1, while very technically cool, is basically a shim

52:10.200 --> 52:14.140
layer that takes all these Linux kernel sys calls and has to go translate those down to

52:14.140 --> 52:19.360
Windows sys calls and unfortunately, emulating Unix style system clocks on an NT kernel.

52:19.360 --> 52:23.160
Well, to say it politely, that's tricky.

52:23.160 --> 52:27.840
That's why WSL 2, which is using a regular Linux kernel in a full on VM here, doesn't

52:27.840 --> 52:28.880
have the same problem.

52:28.880 --> 52:31.600
So if you're on WSL 2, no problems at all.

52:31.600 --> 52:32.600
Just give it a try.

52:32.600 --> 52:33.600
You can use 20.04 whenever you like.

52:33.600 --> 52:37.080
WSL 1, you'll have to wait for that patch to come down in a future update.

52:37.080 --> 52:38.080
Yeah.

52:38.080 --> 52:41.920
And it's a little complicated because WSL 2 isn't technically available to everybody.

52:41.920 --> 52:42.920
Right.

52:42.920 --> 52:46.080
So you're going to have to go through some hoops to get the insider builds to get that.

52:46.080 --> 52:51.120
And WSL 1 has some advantages over WSL 2.

52:51.120 --> 52:56.720
And WSL 1 is essentially less resource intensive because you're not emulating an entire system.

52:56.720 --> 52:58.420
You don't have this little VM going, yeah.

52:58.420 --> 53:04.280
So canonical estimates that people will probably continue to use WSL 1 even after WSL 2 has

53:04.280 --> 53:05.280
shipped.

53:05.280 --> 53:08.280
So I will say some credit should go here to the Windows team because despite clearly working

53:08.280 --> 53:12.020
on this, you know, this whole new version of it, they're still doing patches and fixing

53:12.020 --> 53:13.600
for these things for WSL 1.

53:13.600 --> 53:15.600
So be aware if you're on Windows.

53:15.600 --> 53:20.180
If you're a Windows user who uses the Windows subsystem for Linux and that's why you listen

53:20.180 --> 53:22.320
to this podcast, let us know.

53:22.320 --> 53:26.280
I'm wondering how many are out there these days and if they're searching out Linux content.

53:26.280 --> 53:29.840
You know, I also have to say that Hayden Barnes has been doing a great job communicating some

53:29.840 --> 53:30.840
of this stuff.

53:30.840 --> 53:31.840
That's how I found out about this.

53:31.840 --> 53:32.840
Right.

53:32.840 --> 53:35.760
There's a great telegram group you might want to go join for chatting about all things WSL.

53:35.760 --> 53:39.240
And we'll link to the Discord thread where they're talking about it too in discourse.

53:39.240 --> 53:44.720
Also kind of fun is a game mode, which is that Feral Interactive tool to optimize your

53:44.720 --> 53:49.200
Linux box for gaming will be default in 2004.

53:49.200 --> 53:52.480
Which is nice because in the beta period I had some hard times initially was not able

53:52.480 --> 53:53.480
to get it working.

53:53.480 --> 53:56.160
And troubleshooting is the last thing you want to do when you're already late for playing

53:56.160 --> 53:57.400
a game or you just want to relax.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.220
You're not trying to do any work on your system.

53:59.220 --> 54:00.220
You just want to have fun.

54:00.220 --> 54:04.680
I like how you phrase that because that is so like when you're quote unquote late for

54:04.680 --> 54:05.680
playing a game.

54:05.680 --> 54:06.680
That's me.

54:06.680 --> 54:08.120
How do you show up late playing video?

54:08.120 --> 54:09.120
But I do.

54:09.120 --> 54:11.000
I'm like, oh man, I was supposed to start gaming 10 minutes ago.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
I don't got time for this.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.400
I got a half hour window.

54:15.400 --> 54:18.940
It's hard to find time when you got a busy day and you just want to get right to it.

54:18.940 --> 54:22.280
So Cheezy, I know you had a chance to kick the tires.

54:22.280 --> 54:23.600
You had a few experiences too.

54:23.600 --> 54:28.120
I'd love to hear what you, what your overall takeaway was 2004 and any snags you hit.

54:28.120 --> 54:32.420
You know, a lot of you guys have already mentioned the new themings.

54:32.420 --> 54:33.420
They're really polished.

54:33.420 --> 54:35.160
So the new dark theme is super nice.

54:35.160 --> 54:39.000
I also really like the standard theme because it's kind of a blend between the dark and

54:39.000 --> 54:40.760
the light modes.

54:40.760 --> 54:47.000
The new icon set is again, super nice and it works well in both dark and light themes.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.480
And as someone who knows a thing or two about designs, that might be saying something.

54:50.480 --> 54:51.480
Yeah.

54:51.480 --> 54:55.120
I mean, I highly encourage you to check it out if you have it because it's just, it's

54:55.120 --> 54:56.120
beautiful there.

54:56.120 --> 55:00.940
And you can tell that they're kind of incrementally polishing every little bit.

55:00.940 --> 55:06.960
So Chris, you had mentioned like the login screen, it's super clean, it's super nice.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.720
It's not very distracting.

55:09.720 --> 55:15.340
To me, just with the new gnome, it seems a little bit snappier than old 3.4.

55:15.340 --> 55:19.360
So all around, I mean, visually, I think it's a really great system.

55:19.360 --> 55:25.200
There are a couple of things in your Imgur album, which we'll link in the show notes.

55:25.200 --> 55:28.360
You know, there are a couple of things that did kind of annoy me when it comes to the

55:28.360 --> 55:35.740
design, which is they've changed the Nautilus icon now to be instead of kind of a file cabinet

55:35.740 --> 55:38.280
look to a file folder.

55:38.280 --> 55:43.360
But they put this kind of weird border around it, which none of the other icons have in

55:43.360 --> 55:44.360
the set.

55:44.360 --> 55:45.360
Yeah.

55:45.360 --> 55:46.360
You know, I noticed that too.

55:46.360 --> 55:47.480
It doesn't look great, unfortunately.

55:47.480 --> 55:51.720
The new toggles, they've gone from the green to using this purple accent that Ubuntu is

55:51.720 --> 55:55.240
kind of famous for, I really like that.

55:55.240 --> 56:01.120
The fractional scaling, while I think it was baked in, is a lot nicer, in my opinion.

56:01.120 --> 56:06.400
They've even tweaked the store so that now they have the editor's picks and then the

56:06.400 --> 56:12.200
categories below that, so it looks a little less busy and a little less hectic.

56:12.200 --> 56:15.880
You know, you can just get in and search for what you need and get out.

56:15.880 --> 56:20.160
A couple of questionable things I had was whenever you launch Nautilus for the first

56:20.160 --> 56:24.840
time and pretty much every distro is like this, they give me the icon view or the grid

56:24.840 --> 56:25.840
view.

56:25.840 --> 56:30.520
I'm one of those guys that always, always uses the detailed list view.

56:30.520 --> 56:31.520
Thank you.

56:31.520 --> 56:34.120
And why can't we set that as a default, please?

56:34.120 --> 56:38.240
What kind of monster wants these giant icons where they can only fit half of their directory

56:38.240 --> 56:39.760
content on the screen?

56:39.760 --> 56:41.820
And you can't even read the file name, really, right?

56:41.820 --> 56:45.840
Because it's all kind of truncated and stacked instead of just a horizontal line of text.

56:45.840 --> 56:47.720
And then how do you even sort by date modified?

56:47.720 --> 56:50.040
Which is the first thing I want to do.

56:50.040 --> 56:52.000
It's monstrous.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.760
They've also baked in a cool little to-do app, and I've noticed this on a few of the

56:55.760 --> 57:01.040
apps that they've baked in, but there's no hover over tooltips on some of these.

57:01.040 --> 57:05.060
So you just have to guess that this icon is supposed to represent a checklist and this

57:05.060 --> 57:06.060
one's supposed to...

57:06.060 --> 57:08.200
It sounds small, but that really hurts the accessibility.

57:08.200 --> 57:09.520
You're taking a designer's eye at this, though.

57:09.520 --> 57:10.520
I appreciate that.

57:10.520 --> 57:12.280
Well, I mean, that's just how I see it, right?

57:12.280 --> 57:17.000
So I have to just take it based upon face value as I kind of read the layout and everything.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.120
I mean, I think it's great, and I think that they're heading in the right direction.

57:20.120 --> 57:25.120
And these are all like little minuscule tweaks that I don't think most people would even

57:25.120 --> 57:26.400
really notice.

57:26.400 --> 57:30.900
It's not in the final release, but you did end up hitting kind of a gnarly beta bug that

57:30.900 --> 57:33.520
we also saw, but I don't think struggled with as much as you did.

57:33.520 --> 57:34.520
Yeah.

57:34.520 --> 57:39.380
So I'm using this ThinkPad 440S, and I've got two disks in it.

57:39.380 --> 57:47.680
I've got one in the M.2 slot where the 3G radio modem used to live, and then one just

57:47.680 --> 57:50.480
an SSD hooked up as well.

57:50.480 --> 57:57.080
So on the SSD, I have Manjaro, and then on the M.2, I use basically whatever.

57:57.080 --> 58:01.720
So that's kind of my drive to jump around on.

58:01.720 --> 58:10.680
I noticed whenever I installed Ubuntu and Mate that there was a grub boot menu bug.

58:10.680 --> 58:17.160
So once installed, whenever you would reboot the machine, they're using the new EFI fast

58:17.160 --> 58:23.960
boot kind of system that the Lenovo logo would pop up, then it would pop up with a nice Ubuntu

58:23.960 --> 58:28.120
logo below that, load Ubuntu directly to the login screen.

58:28.120 --> 58:29.120
Which looks pretty nice.

58:29.120 --> 58:30.120
It really does.

58:30.120 --> 58:31.120
Yeah.

58:31.120 --> 58:36.280
I think it's a step up for sure, but wouldn't allow me to get into the actual grub boot

58:36.280 --> 58:37.280
menu.

58:37.280 --> 58:38.280
Oh.

58:38.280 --> 58:44.760
Of course, you can hit F12, and then just because it's in the bios there that you can

58:44.760 --> 58:46.560
just hit F12 and then boot into Manjaro.

58:46.560 --> 58:48.520
So I mean, I still had access to that drive.

58:48.520 --> 58:53.320
It wasn't something that just stopped me in my tracks, but being a Linux user, it kind

58:53.320 --> 58:54.320
of drove me nuts.

58:54.320 --> 58:55.320
Where's my grub at?

58:55.320 --> 58:56.320
Yeah, exactly.

58:56.320 --> 59:02.720
So I went through all sorts of leaps and bounds, and Bill helped me out, kind of directed me

59:02.720 --> 59:04.960
like, hey, maybe try this, try that.

59:04.960 --> 59:07.760
And come to find out after doing a little bit of research, there was actually a bug

59:07.760 --> 59:09.720
out there already for it.

59:09.720 --> 59:14.240
And so looking back, it looks like it's something that's being worked through.

59:14.240 --> 59:18.800
You also had that same thing I had going up from grub to the actual desktop UI, where

59:18.800 --> 59:24.000
when you search in Gnome Shell, some of the labels or the text of icons gets cut off or

59:24.000 --> 59:26.060
the bottom portion of the icons gets cut off.

59:26.060 --> 59:27.060
You hit that too, right?

59:27.060 --> 59:28.060
Right.

59:28.060 --> 59:33.320
So if you open up the applications menu and you scroll down to any folder, and I think

59:33.320 --> 59:37.200
this is really just a Gnome Shell issue that's being worked on.

59:37.200 --> 59:41.560
If you create folders, which is a nice feature so you can kind of bundle apps together, the

59:41.560 --> 59:48.040
last line of icons in that folder, and I haven't determined how many icons you have to have

59:48.040 --> 59:52.640
in the folder for this to happen or anything, but my example was the utilities folder in

59:52.640 --> 59:54.320
the Gnome Shell menu.

59:54.320 --> 59:59.360
If you click on that and scroll all the way down, the last line of text below the icons

59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.480
was cut off.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.800
However, if you launched one of those apps down there, it's the terminal.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.080
That's the first thing, generally always open.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.000
If you click on the terminal, load the terminal, then go back to the Gnome Shell menu and scroll

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.840
down, you should be able to see that last line of text.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.840
Really?

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.840
Weird.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.840
All right.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.600
This is something I'm going to play with more, and I might see if there's a bug for it because

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.320
that seems a little strange.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.960
Once they get a few of these little bugs worked out with the grub version, maybe a point release

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.800
for Gnome Shell or something like that, it's going to be one of the best Linux distributions

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.480
out there, especially for the desktop.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.480
I completely agree.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.480
Well said.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.480
It is already very, very, very close, and within a point update, I think it's going

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.320
to be really, really in a good spot.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:44.480
I am thrilled with this release.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.240
I'm really, really thrilled with the performance.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.840
You guys know I'm always the guy that's on here saying, it's not fast enough.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.840
It's not fast enough.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.360
It just needs to be snappier.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.960
Well, they did it.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.880
I hate to say it like this, but if you're someone like me who's always felt like the

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.600
interface wasn't snappy enough, the way I can put it to you is this.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:07.800
Ubuntu 2004 with Gnome 3.36 is finally as fast as it always should have been.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:13.560
If you've spent real money on your PC, if you're a guy like me who has four or five

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.560
dedicated...

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.280
I put my home on its own disk, I put root on its own disk, I put var on its own disk,

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.200
I put all of my editing scratch on its own disk, I've got 64 gigabytes of RAM, I've

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:26.160
got 12 cores in this thing.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:33.940
My main system, it's a rockstar, and it should be so fast that I never have complaints with

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:34.940
its speed.

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:35.940
Right?

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.940
You shouldn't be waiting around for just about anything.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:37.940
Never.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:44.320
And so it finally feels like Ubuntu 2004 with Gnome 3.36 is as fast as it always should

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.600
have been.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:50.360
That is not a backhanded compliment because software, it just takes a while to get there.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:55.440
And not very often do you get new versions of software and things get faster.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.960
So this is a compliment I'm making.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.960
Right.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.600
And I mean, you know, graphics compositing, that's a hard thing.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.600
Right.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.120
And so the fact that years now into it, you can install something and it feels faster.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.280
In fact, I'd say it feels like I'm getting the actual metal performance out of my machine

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.560
now.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.560
And that is so nice that it just so, so, so nice because I feel like I'm finally getting

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.740
my money's worth out of out of some of this stuff.

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.920
And so I am thrilled with the release.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:25.400
Now we got a question from Daniel that came in on Twitter and he said, I'm migrating to

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.500
an LTS very soon.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:33.160
Would it be the best case to go with 1804 now or would I be better off going with 2004

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.160
so I don't have to touch it later?

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.440
This came in on Twitter.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:41.160
And I think the answer to that is it depends on your threshold.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:46.680
For a server, I might stick with 1804 for now.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.240
But for the desktop, I think you're good to go.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:53.480
I think that the the final fixes that have landed, it's really hard for me to say at

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.900
this point, I need like another four weeks with it.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:01.080
But the last few days, it really seems like a lot of stuff has come together.

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:05.480
And I think on the desktop, if you have a threshold of a little tiny bit of things not

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.200
working here and there, if you can, if you can tolerate that, I think it's a go.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.240
On the server, on the x86 side, like I said earlier, I think maybe wait a bit.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.120
And on the ARM side, I think it's a go.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.680
So it's a complicated question to answer, Dan, so I'm sorry, I don't have a better answer

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.680
for you.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.160
But it's sort of one of those, it depends, right?

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.160
Yeah, right.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.160
I mean, you got to tolerate your own risk.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.140
And also, how comfortable are you upgrading down the line, you know, that process has

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:30.080
gotten a lot better over the years, but isn't totally risk free.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.360
And I'll add this too.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.720
I don't know if the desktop question is fully answered yet.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.440
We're going to look at Fedora 32, possibly next week.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.240
And we may have a different answer for you.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:45.120
What's great is a lot of the improvements you're getting with GNOME 3.6 will land in

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.660
both of these distributions.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:51.600
And so a lot of what we've talked about here will apply to Fedora 32 as well.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.320
But they have done some extra special sauce there.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.040
They've implemented that early out of memory killer by default.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.420
That's something that Ubuntu 24 does not have right now.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.200
And so there's some special sauce there.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.800
And I don't know which one yet is necessarily the better desktop workstation.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.680
We just get spoiled for options.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.360
It's a good problem to have.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.200
So Dan, let us know what you end up doing, what LTS release you decide to go with 18.04

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.200
or 20.04.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.040
And let us know how it goes.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.960
I know a lot of people have asked us in the in the lug meeting that we did on Sunday,

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.000
are you guys going to put 20.04 on your arch box?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Not yet.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.600
I mean, we've already got arch, how much more do you need?

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.640
I was thinking we do this Wes, what do you think of this?

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.240
Let's try putting that arch box on the arch LTS kernel.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.080
And if that goes bad, then maybe we consider going to 20.04.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.680
All right, it's worth a shot.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.800
I know what you're thinking like, Chris, that's a lot of work.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800
That's a lot of work.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.240
But remember, we separated out the data.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.320
So if we have to replace the OS, we'll be fine.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.320
We'll be okay.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.320
We'll be okay.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.320
Yeah.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.320
So we'll let you know how that goes.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.280
But man, is it nice to see this release.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.360
These LTS is there something special as as Linux users, we get something kind of special

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360
every five years.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.360
I know, right.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.040
And there's this certain excitement around the LTS sort of seen what the shape of the

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.940
future is going to be.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:09.600
And it's nice for this little window doesn't last for the entire time, although that's

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.100
getting better with things like snaps and flatbacks.

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:13.960
Everything in the repo is just fresh.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.960
You know, that's worth talking about just for a second.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.560
So you get a new LTS every now and then and then they're supported for five years and

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.560
it's kind of special.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:31.600
It almost could do an 1804 review of how usable is it now at the release of the next LTS?

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.140
How usable still today is 1804?

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:38.800
Because that wasn't always the case when I think it was Minimax and he was still on 1604.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.000
You're like, holy crap, that's so old.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Maybe we could try that, too.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
You know, we'll split it up a bit.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Yeah.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.360
I don't know if I have that sense with 1804.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.760
I wonder if we could we should take a look at it and try to make an 1804 workstation

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.000
that's totally up to date, modern, and ready to go.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.800
The thing is, now that you have snap packages and flatback and everything, so 1604 was really

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:04.160
a crucial release for that because you got snap packages and flatback integrated.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:12.000
So it was easy for software that you wanted to keep in the newest state, you were able

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.840
to have these packages or you had PPAs.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:22.760
So for me, using enlightenment, so not the stock GNOME desktop environment, it was easy

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.760
to live with that.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.760
No problem.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.960
If you're not trying to use GNOME Shell, I bet it is.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.960
Yeah.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.700
What do you say before we get out of here?

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:30.700
We do a couple of picks.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.700
Oh, let's do it.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:36.120
I teased a command line audio application that I like a lot.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:39.920
There'll be a few things that come out of me relaunching on filter.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:46.440
And that is essentially me trying to come up with a reproducible media workflow to edit

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.120
and grab clips and all of that kind of stuff.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.720
And the net result here on the show will be cool tools that you get to hear about.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:56.920
And PA Cat, Pulse Audio Cat is one of them.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:02.480
You can play back or record raw audio streams right out of Pulse Audio.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.800
You don't have to pull up VLC or MPV or any of these tools, you can just do it right from

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.800
the command line.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.960
PA Cat will essentially treat audio like it's a text file.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.240
And it's a simple tool for playing back or capturing raw encoded audio files from the

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.040
Pulse Audio sound server.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.860
It understands anything that Pulse understands.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:20.860
So that's everything.

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:22.300
It's everything.

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:27.640
And it all is supported by anything that the lib sound file library supports, PA Cat will

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640
support.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.680
And, you know, there's some YouTube stream I'm watching and all of a sudden like, I want

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.680
to hear this.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.680
I want to record this.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:34.680
I want to clip this.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.680
You can use this tool.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.680
Right.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.520
Especially you just add a little easy bash alias or something.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:41.980
It has a ton of options for choosing maybe even have multiple Pulse servers.

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:45.080
You can specify what sort of format you want to capture it in.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.080
That's great.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:50.600
You also helped me recently with an FFmpeg script that's crazy simple.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.840
You just say FFmpeg record and then you give it an interface number.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.640
And then it just starts recording.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.740
This is such a great way to record application audio on your Linux box.

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:03.460
There's lots of ways you can record microphone audio and all that.

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:07.160
But maybe you're just listening to something on your Linux box and you want to record that

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.160
application.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.160
Yeah.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160
Watching a live stream or something.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.160
Yeah.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.160
Or music or whatever.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:16.680
So if you take like a file that is maybe a Spotify playlist and it's all one file, it's

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.880
one flack, FFmpeg will do it.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.400
And it will, you just have to give it the device name or number actually.

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.600
And there's, do you remember the command?

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.600
Was it?

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.600
Oh yeah.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.600
P-A-C-T-L.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.600
And then you can just do a list command.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.600
Right.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.600
It'll show you all your devices.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.600
P-A-C-T-L list.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.240
And it will show you all the devices that it detects.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.080
You give it the number and then FFmpeg can just record right from that.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.600
And man, if I'm not using the heck out of that.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:43.200
So you combine that with P-A-C-T and it's really powerful.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:47.560
The Mac has graphical applications from Rogue Amoeba to do all this kind of stuff, but it's

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.740
all there on Linux.

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:51.320
You just have to have access to it.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.960
Two months ago I did like this month on the Mac and then we did an episode about it and

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.640
I was talking to Wes and I said, you know, one of the things they've really nailed is

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:03.560
you can just hit a button and start recording application audio.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.960
And so you and I were looking at ways of doing this under Linux and together we found these

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.080
couple of tools and it's better than anything you do on the Mac.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.080
Right.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.080
You just have to know the commands.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.080
Right.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.080
And you can add some stuff.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.640
Pulse actually has some virtual devices you can add.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.400
I've been playing around with this a little bit myself.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:21.160
So if you want to get complicated with it, you can, or you can just use a simple tool

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.160
right from the command line.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.160
Yeah.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.160
It's pretty nice.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.440
We give Pulse a hard time.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.280
You know, it's sort of like it's a meme to give Pulse a hard time, but it is extremely

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:32.440
powerful and it really has a lot of features.

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:36.360
Now that's my pick, but Mr. Bacon comes in with three mucks.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360
Tell me about three mucks.

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.240
Well, actually this was dropped by Mr. Noble Pain.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:47.120
He had dropped it in the Slack and he was going to let you own it.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.760
He was going to let me give you all the credit and let you talk about it and he wasn't going

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.760
to argue at all.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.040
Well, she seemed excited about it.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.360
You're such a good co-host, Wes.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.320
It's like a Tmux clone written in Golang, right Wes, I believe.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.520
Yes it is.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.320
Some nice sane i3 key bindings, scroll back.

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.320
Awesome.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.320
That was the big one for me, right?

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.160
Like Tmux, unless you do some configuring, you just don't, your mouse wheel doesn't deal

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.680
what you think it does.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.360
So I like the description here in the readme.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:19.260
Imagine Tmux with a smaller learning curve and more sane defaults.

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.040
And I think that that really sums it up.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.720
You know, there are some Tmux bindings in there still.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:29.880
So splitting windows, moving panes, those sorts of things are still available as Tmux

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:36.280
bindings, but you know, they have a lot of sane like alt-enter or alt-end will create

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.360
a new pane.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:43.120
So it's a great looking little multiplexer that I would like to actually get into and

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.240
download and try out.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.920
I just remember seeing it, seeing you drop it in there.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920
So I was like, well, you know what?

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.840
I'm going to throw that in for an app pick because it looks super cool.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:51.840
I will note it is early days.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.520
It doesn't look like they have any packaged releases just yet.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.120
So you'll have to have go and be able to pull it down that way.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.780
How did you find this?

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:01.880
14 months ago, the project was started.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.720
But actually, I'm not joking when I say this.

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:08.880
All of the work seems like it happened in the last, I don't know, six days or so.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.880
Yeah.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.200
I mean, it seems to be a project that's picking up steam.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200
Good catch, Wes.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.200
Yeah.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.820
It's called 3Mux, the number three mux.

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:20.240
And it is a terminal multiplexer that is essentially inspired by i3.

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.480
And that is a that is so much genius.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.480
I can't even with that.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.480
Right.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.040
I mean, it's sort of a proven paradigm that really works, especially when you have a complicated

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.040
workflow.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.400
I mean, that's the perfect place to help you manage that stuff.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.400
Absolutely.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400
There you go.

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.560
We'll have links to all of that in the old show notes.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.920
Linux Unplugged dot com slash 350.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.920
Go check that out.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.760
Also, I'd love to hear your experiences with the Ubuntu 2004.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:48.480
Let us know in the telegram group Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash telegram or even better.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.720
Come hang out on that virtual lug day, Sunday, 12 Pacific.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.960
Join us in that virtual lug in the mumble room and let us know what your experiences

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.920
have been with the flavors or with the main Ubuntu release.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.920
We love that.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.040
And it really helps us calibrate our opinions about everything.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.000
Yeah, it's a it's a great experience.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
All right, everybody.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.840
Well, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the unplugged program.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:34.800
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:49.680
I love that the top title, which is not what we're going with, but the top title is get

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.680
forked.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.680
Carole Baskin.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:13:11.640
That's great, guys.
