1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Listen closely, there's an embedded message in this music.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:11,880
All right, there's the source.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,080
Now listen carefully for the message.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,400
Did you hear it, Wes?

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,400
You know, I think I heard something.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,720
Yeah, there is a little bit of a difference there.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:34,000
There is data hiding in the 9.8 kilohertz to 10 kilohertz audio spectrum in that sample

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that we just played.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Wow.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,280
You know, considering it sounds pretty decent, I think.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,440
Yeah, well, one of the tricks they're doing is they're analyzing the music and then they're

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,680
encoding data into the audible range of the music.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,640
So picture a moment, like transferring information via sound, as we all know modems used to do

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
that.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,120
What if you could have smartphones that are always listening to the background music that's

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,720
playing, like your Pixel 3 does?

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,720
Oh, yes it does.

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,160
And it's only a little bit creepy.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,400
Now what if you could transmit information in that music, like the coffee shop Wi-Fi

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
password?

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,140
Oh, so you just step into the coffee shop, the music's been altered just a little bit

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,480
to encode the password, say, and then your phone picks it up, registers, finds the network,

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
hops on in your own life.

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,720
Wes, this isn't just a theory, why, it's a white paper too.

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,200
Yeah, I thought this was really interesting, man.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,240
Obviously, there's so many other implications when you're just spewing this stuff out in

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,940
the air and what your phone can pick up.

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,720
But I thought it was a pretty interesting way of, you know, encoding these sorts of

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,480
things that we all use on a daily basis in our surrounding audio.

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,320
And they pointed out like, why use audio frequencies, right?

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,960
Why not use a frequency that we can't hear?

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,840
And basically, there's already, there's just a lot of speakers for the human audio range

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
already.

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,440
So you have speakers in the ceiling that are designed to pipe out music in that range at

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
the mall.

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,240
Yeah, you're not going to get fantastic data rates here.

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,120
Real world data transfer would be around 200 bits a second.

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,520
So that's, I think, if I'm doing my math right, about 25 words per second.

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,520
So a good Wi-Fi password, but that's about it.

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,560
Yeah, something like an audio QR code.

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,940
Yeah, an audio QR code is exactly what it would be.

42
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:27,680
What could go wrong, Wes?

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,640
Hello and welcome to Linux Unplugged episode 311.

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
My name is Chris.

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
My name is Wes.

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Hello, Wes.

47
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
We have a great episode today.

48
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,840
So not only are we going to get to some important community news, I've had a think recently

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
about the community news.

50
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Oh boy.

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,800
So this is a slightly retuned community news, this edition.

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,200
Thomas Cameron is joining us on this week's episode, and if that name rings a bell, that's

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:58,000
because back in episode 304, we talked about Texas Linux Fest and a keynote that really

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,040
made us think.

55
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,320
Everyone on the team was impressed by this keynote, and that was the one that was given

56
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,360
by Thomas Cameron, and he joins us this week on the show.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Hey there, Thomas.

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,240
Hey, thank you so much for having me, and thank you for the kind words.

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
I appreciate it.

60
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
No, really.

61
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Thank you for joining us.

62
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,760
This is something that we've been wanting to do.

63
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,320
Both Wes and I didn't talk about it ahead of time, but on the way into the studio today,

64
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,200
listened to your keynote again, because we have a recording of it, because we just enjoyed

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
it so much.

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,640
So thank you for making it, and as we go through the community news here and stuff, please

67
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,240
feel free to chime in, and then after we get through this community news, let's just chat

68
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,760
about some of the topics you raised in your keynote.

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,840
We'll just kind of expand on them a little bit and things like that.

70
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Sounds good.

71
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
All right.

72
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,560
So before we get to that community news, I have to say time-appropriate greetings to

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
that mumble room.

74
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
Hello, Virtual Lug.

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Good evening.

76
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Hello.

77
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Hello.

78
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Hello.

79
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
That's a packed mumble room.

80
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
And of course, Mr. Cheese Bacon's here.

81
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Hello, Cheese.

82
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Hey, how's it going, man?

83
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Hey, Chasey.

84
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Good.

85
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Good.

86
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Really good.

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Just got back from Montana.

88
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,000
Decided to do something that I think I'm going to do more often when I do a family trip,

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,120
because I took the family to Montana, and then I thought, you know, when I get back,

90
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,760
the week I get back, instead of just jumping right back into work, what if I kind of like

91
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
ease in a little bit?

92
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
Oh, the ease in.

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Interesting.

94
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
The ease in.

95
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
You know, I slide in a little bit.

96
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
So I...

97
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Phase in, you might say.

98
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,480
I booked a campsite on a river in eastern Washington.

99
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,560
I don't know if that's phasing in.

100
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,120
I think that's just more vacation.

101
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Well, I'm in studio, aren't I?

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
Yes, you are.

103
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,520
I did the three-hour commute in today just because Thomas is here.

104
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Seriously.

105
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,520
If Thomas wasn't here, I would have been like, I'll do it remote.

106
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Screw it.

107
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
Is that a river behind you?

108
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Yeah.

109
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
That is the river.

110
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
That would have been Joe's like, Joe.

111
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,960
Joe would have contacted me like, Chris, this river noise, I can't filter it out.

112
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
That's my Joe impression.

113
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
It's very bad.

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,240
Anyways, moving on, let's talk about these Dropbox updates that people have been tweeting

115
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,400
me saying, well, now Chris is going to switch back to Dropbox now that this news is out.

116
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Wrong.

117
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,040
But it is good to see, nonetheless, Dropbox is adding back-end support for ZFS, eCryptFS,

118
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,200
and XFS and ButterFS on Linux.

119
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,400
Look at that.

120
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Didn't expect that to happen.

121
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,960
I mean, is that like a little awkward?

122
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Have they said anything?

123
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,240
Or is it just sort of people are noticing that the support's back?

124
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
That.

125
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Yeah.

126
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Feels weird, right?

127
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Yeah.

128
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,040
Are there changes in the justifications they gave for dropping it?

129
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,400
No, it's just changes in the release notes for a beta version.

130
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,280
This is so late, really, if you think about it.

131
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Exactly, right, Brent?

132
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,640
It's like, it's too late.

133
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,360
It was the last straw, wasn't it?

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,480
It was by far the last straw.

135
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,800
I mean, how many people just kind of said, all right, I'm out of here.

136
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
See ya.

137
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,480
You gave me a good reason to work a little harder at finding a better solution.

138
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,400
So I think they lost a lot of people.

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,180
Well, and I'll tell you, one of the things about desktop Linux is sometimes we get the

140
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,700
features last.

141
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,580
And that can actually be, in some cases, a good thing, especially if you want a reliable

142
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,700
workstation that is predictable.

143
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,280
And on Windows and Mac OS, and you've got to imagine eventually this would land on Linux,

144
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,680
but on Windows and Mac OS, things have gotten really bad in Dropbox town.

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,860
So Dropbox now uses over a half a gig of memory on Mac OS.

146
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,660
And when you look in its frameworks folder in the application bundle, there's an entire

147
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,960
Chromium web rendering engine in there.

148
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,240
And they've implemented an electron-based file manager in Dropbox on Mac OS.

149
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Can you believe that?

150
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
I mean, I knew it was coming.

151
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,000
I mean, it just had to be.

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,600
I didn't think Dropbox would be the one to do it.

153
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:41,160
I mean, Dropbox went from super lightweight cross-platform sync tool to the most bloated

154
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
sync tool possible.

155
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,120
Well, it's a whole service, Chris.

156
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,680
It's not just about syncing anymore.

157
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,200
I mean, one of the things that I was resistant about Nextcloud was it just felt like it was

158
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,880
too much stuff besides file syncing.

159
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
Right.

160
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,400
You just want some files and to have them everywhere.

161
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,120
I had a change of heart and I realized there was other things I could take advantage of

162
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,820
and then Nextcloud was a slam dunk.

163
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,160
But now looking at this, I'm thinking, man, the trade-off is actually still there.

164
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
Like Dropbox is too much.

165
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,140
With the price, if you want real storage, if you want more than three devices, half

166
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,360
a gig of memory just for their stupid electron file manager, and then the fact that Linux

167
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,840
feels like a second or maybe even third-class platform.

168
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,360
Thomas, as our special guest here on the Unplugged program, I'm curious what your sync solution

169
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
is.

170
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,600
Do you have anything that syncs to the cloud?

171
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
I do.

172
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
I do.

173
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,720
My wife and I both have backup routines.

174
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,320
She's on a Windows laptop.

175
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,480
I obviously am on a Linux system.

176
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,760
I hate to say it, man, I'm sort of old-fashioned.

177
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,600
I have an rsync script that runs on my laptop that checks to see if it's docked at home.

178
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,400
If it's docked at home, it syncs over to my file server.

179
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,920
Once it's done that, then that file server syncs to some cloud instances that I have.

180
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,440
My wife uses a commercial cloud storage solution.

181
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,640
I don't even remember what it is.

182
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:13,080
We do use cloud storage, definitely, but in both cases, it's not very sophisticated.

183
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,900
There's something nice about using rsync to move your data around because it's easier

184
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,280
to observe, it's easier to understand, so you feel a little safer about your own data

185
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,400
because it's a tool you can wrap your head around.

186
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Exactly.

187
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,720
When you're writing it, you're writing your script and you're saying, I want this data

188
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,240
to go over to this internal server versus this data, which absolutely has to go to the

189
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,620
cloud immediately because it's very important and we don't want to lose it.

190
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,840
It's like, I know exactly what the software is doing because I wrote it.

191
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,600
And you only have yourself to blame, which I'm used to doing that, so that's not so bad.

192
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,080
I actually like that.

193
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
That's fine by me.

194
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,520
I'd be okay in that scenario.

195
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,700
Are you using any kind of secret sauce for your laptop and rsync to figure out when you're

196
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,800
on the homeland versus when you're on a hotel Wi-Fi or something?

197
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Yeah.

198
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,640
Honestly, I do a couple of different things.

199
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,600
I look to see if I'm in the right address range, and I use kind of an oddball address

200
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,280
range for my home lab.

201
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:16,360
And then I also check to see if the slash etsy slash resolve.conf is set up to search

202
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,160
on my home office domain.

203
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Home DNS.

204
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Right.

205
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Right.

206
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
So that's what it is.

207
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,520
And if my host name is correct, so I do a number of tests, but yeah, if I'm on the right

208
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,960
network and the host name that's been assigned is a host name that I recognize because I've

209
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,240
got static DHCP reservations and my resolve.conf says that I'm in the right search domain,

210
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,720
then it fires off the rsync script.

211
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
That's a solid way to do it.

212
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
That is a really solid way to do it.

213
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Well, and because I'm an idiot, it's great that it's hands free.

214
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Yes.

215
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Yeah.

216
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Yeah.

217
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Just let it go.

218
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
That's right.

219
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,480
Because if those conditions exist, then it runs.

220
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Yep.

221
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Yeah, that's nice.

222
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,800
That's how you want your backups to be really.

223
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,640
There's absolutely nothing wrong with that setup.

224
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,440
It's similar to how I back up my photos now.

225
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,080
So it's not quite, I don't have the network detection stuff because mine's just always

226
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
here on the land.

227
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,400
But I like that.

228
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
So Thomas, I know you're a long time Red Hatter.

229
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,800
If I recall from the keynote, you were certified in 1999.

230
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,520
So you've been around for a while.

231
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Yeah.

232
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:27,080
My first installation of Linux was back in, gosh, 1995, I think.

233
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:34,040
It was the first version of Slackware that supported the A.out format.

234
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Oh, wow.

235
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
Yeah.

236
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,120
So I mean, it's been a while.

238
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,800
And then when I went to, actually, before I went to work at Red Hat, I was a Red Hat

239
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,480
certified engineer on Red Hat Linux 6.1.

240
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,040
And then while I worked at Red Hat, I was a Red Hat certified architect level five, which

241
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,780
means that I didn't just pass the tests to become an RHCA.

242
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,320
But then I took five additional technical tests after that and passed all of those.

243
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,800
So big old geek.

244
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,600
And as we talk today, if memory serves, you are an Amazon Linux solutions architect, correct?

245
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Correct.

246
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Yes.

247
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,080
So I started out after almost 14 years, about four months ago, and started with AWS, the

248
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,880
Amazon Web Services.

249
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,880
And I get to play with Amazon Linux all day, every day.

250
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,540
And it's a lot of fun.

251
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,540
It's a whole lot of fun.

252
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,540
Interesting.

253
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,720
I'd like to talk more about that in a moment, because that's something I got to be honest

254
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
with you.

255
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
We don't cover much on this show.

256
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Yeah.

257
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,800
And Wes and I feel a little embarrassed about that, because it's out there.

258
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,840
A lot of people are using it, and it's getting about zero coverage.

259
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Let's get to there in a moment.

260
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,400
But I kind of want to take a little bit of a historical perspective on this next story

261
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
with you.

262
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Sure.

263
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:51,040
So this week, it was approved by the Fedora technical committee to discontinue shipping

264
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,880
32-bit ISOs.

265
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,520
And they're also debating an additional, even further step.

266
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Oh, yes.

267
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,200
So they also started talking about when should they end 32-bit software repositories in general

268
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
for Fedora.

269
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,240
So they will consider a late change proposal for Fedora 31.

270
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,520
And as a result, there is now the no i686 repositories proposal that was drafted where

271
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,640
they would stop producing and distributing modular and everything i686 repositories.

272
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,080
And this 32-bit transition has just been one of the continuing meta stories of 2019.

273
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,520
And I'm just really fascinated on your entire take on the bigger picture here, the bigger

274
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
story.

275
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:42,880
You know, the systems that run 32-bit architecture are becoming so few and so far between and

276
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,200
frankly so specialized, right?

277
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,520
Usually we're talking about industrial machines or special purpose machines.

278
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:58,200
And Fedora is at its heart meant to be a general purpose distribution.

279
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:05,560
And so I kind of understand the logic behind saying, look, you know, you pretty much can't

280
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,440
buy a 32-bit machine anymore.

281
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,440
So we're not going to burn the effort and the engineering effort and all of the build

282
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,440
systems and all of the storage and all of the overhead that comes with keeping 32-bit

283
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,600
distributions alive for something that is really a niche sort of specialized platform.

284
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,160
So I kind of agree with them, honestly.

285
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
Same with me.

286
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:37,200
I feel like you need a couple of distributions to start pushing this forward.

287
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,840
And Fedora is a great distribution for that kind of tech, pushing a new tech forward.

288
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Okay.

289
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,940
So, you know, you and I are both long timers.

290
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,600
You've got more time on this than I do.

291
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,600
And I'm curious to get your perspective on why when Canonical announced something somewhat

292
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:02,020
similar, although in a different style, there was a pretty big outrage, in fact, a weekend

293
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,720
of outrage that just where people were popping off for a weekend, 60 different articles were

294
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,260
written.

295
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,120
When this gets announced by Fedora, there's like three articles and two of them were by

296
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,520
Feronix.

297
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,320
What's with the tonal difference, do you think?

298
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,240
Well, I think that you hit the nail on the head when you said they announced it differently.

299
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,640
With the Fedora project, it is a project and it is a represented project.

300
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,560
And by that, I mean, there are folks from the community who are represented.

301
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:37,000
There are, you know, over communication with a lot of the development mailing lists.

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,800
And so I think that the idea of doing away with 32-bit builds was socialized for a long

303
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:50,560
time before the announcement was sort of broadly broadcast, if that makes sense.

304
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,880
And I think that the way that it was communicated and I think that the rationale behind it,

305
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:01,160
kind of what we talked about just a minute ago, I think that most folks out in Fedora

306
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,280
land were like, yeah, that makes sense.

307
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,360
I mean, Fedora is a forward looking distro.

308
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,400
It's for bleeding edge cool technologies.

309
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,460
It's for as close to upstream as possible.

310
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,160
And a lot of the stuff that's upstream just doesn't lend itself to 32-bit.

311
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,280
So I think it was all in the way that it was communicated personally.

312
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,680
A flip side question to that then would be, do you think that inherently makes Fedora

313
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,360
less of a corporate desktop platform where Ubuntu LTS seems like you had companies like

314
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:38,100
Valve and game developers that were almost, they were dependent on it as a desktop platform

315
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,320
where they don't seem to depend on Fedora as a desktop platform as much?

316
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,840
Well, you know, look at having been in corporate IT, you and I both have been in those environments

317
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,160
where if somebody came to me and said, hey, we're just going to upgrade every desktop

318
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,880
in the place that does precision computing or CAD cam or whatever every six months because

319
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,000
the underlying distro revs every six months, I would be like, I'm either going to stab

320
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,480
you or I'm going to open my veins.

321
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Go mental.

322
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Yeah.

323
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,520
So Fedora is designed for sort of bleeding edge developers.

324
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,840
It's a phenomenal desktop.

325
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,640
I use Fedora on my desktop at home and love it.

326
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:28,840
Whereas LTS is absolutely designed to be a solid, less flashy, sexy, forward-looking

327
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,400
desktop that's going to last for a long time.

328
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:38,120
And I totally get why folks would use LTS or Ubuntu LTS as opposed to Fedora.

329
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Yeah.

330
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,720
And that could be more appealing to developers from a targeting standpoint because sometimes

331
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,520
projects can have a multi-year lifespan.

332
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,200
Wimpy, I want to give you a chance to jump in here just because I know that this is a

333
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,480
topic that's close to your heart.

334
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,160
You see the reaction differences, the tone differences between Fedora's announcement

335
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,800
and Ubuntu slash Canonical's announcement.

336
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,200
What are your thoughts on that?

337
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,880
I haven't actually seen the announcement from Fedora, so I can't comment on the differences

338
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,120
as to how it was communicated.

339
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:14,840
If I could, I should take this moment to make clear that the dropping the I680, the 32-bit

340
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,600
repositories and all of that is likely not to happen.

341
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,680
It's a proposal.

342
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,000
It's a proposal that is seeing significant pushback.

343
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,800
But the dropping of 32-bit ISOs and things like that is very likely to happen.

344
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,680
All of which has been pretty much, I think, well received overall.

345
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:38,720
I am not at all surprised to hear people not caring about the removal of the ISO images

346
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,320
for 32-bit Intel platforms.

347
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:49,360
I think for those people that need that kind of support, there are plenty of niche distros

348
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,440
that cater to that use case, and it doesn't need the likes of Ubuntu and Fedora to cater

349
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,200
to those individuals.

350
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:05,400
There are plenty of other places you can go because we're getting into enthusiast territory

351
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
now.

352
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,960
These systems are getting old enough, it won't be so long before they'll be retro and there'll

353
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:18,400
be a slew of YouTube channels about preserving their 32-bit Intel systems.

354
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,960
Let's leave that to the enthusiasts and the retro computer lovers, and let's leave the

355
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,200
mainstream distributions to look to the horizon and march forward.

356
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Well said.

357
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,800
Well said.

358
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,160
How are things over in Ubuntu MATE land these days?

359
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,440
Ubuntu MATE land, yes, very good.

360
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:47,280
I've spent some time recently creating bespoke images for some more ultra-mobile PC devices.

361
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,240
I heard a little bit about that on that there Ubuntu podcast recently.

362
00:18:51,240 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, so GPD sent me an engineering sample of their GPD MicroPC that has been going through

363
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,040
a crowd funder and those devices are currently being shipped to their backers at the moment.

364
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:14,240
And thanks to the collaboration from Hans de Goode at Red Hat, kernel support for those

365
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,760
devices is in the 5.2 kernel.

366
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:25,320
The 5.2 kernel landed in the 1910 development branch of Ubuntu, so I put together an alpha

367
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,600
release for that so that people that have got those devices and want some Linux rather

368
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,880
than some Windows have got somewhere to go.

369
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
That's great.

370
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,960
And as we progress through the rest of the 1910 cycle, I'll produce a beta image in

371
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,160
then a final image for that device.

372
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,440
That is, you know what, there's something in 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 I am excited about.

373
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
No kidding.

374
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
It's getting really good.

375
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,980
So let's take a moment to have Alex bring us down a little bit from the 5.2 hype because

376
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,560
there is a bug that is impacting those of us that are enjoying the KVM lifestyle these

377
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
days.

378
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:05,760
Yeah, was it 3.08 or 3.09, I forget, where we did a VFIO special episode, I ran into

379
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:13,000
a bug this weekend where on kernel 5.2.1, there is a K-mode exception not handled bug

380
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,400
and this manifests itself in your probably Windows guest as random blue screens of death

381
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,520
or 3D apps might randomly crash, so you might be browsing a website using Chrome and it

382
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,200
will just keep crashing time after time after time.

383
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,980
Now this weekend I'd installed a new SSD, so I thought it was that for the longest time,

384
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,560
it wasted the best part of my Saturday trying to fix this.

385
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,960
Wait, so you hit this bug at the same time you did a hardware upgrade?

386
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,760
Yeah, well when I rebooted my machine, it rebooted into kernel 5.2 and I hadn't noticed

387
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,000
that that had also changed, so yeah, perfect storm.

388
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,640
Ah man, that is a nice rite of passage though, that has definitely hit all of us, that's

389
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
nice.

390
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,440
Yeah, idiot tax.

391
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,240
It's a really simple fix, just downgrade your kernel to something that is older than 5,

392
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,680
so for the moment I've gone back in the AUR, I've gone back to Linux VFIO LTS, which is

393
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:13,840
just an AUR package, which takes me back to 4.19, I don't necessarily think I need anything

394
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,440
in 5.x for a while, so we'll find out soon enough.

395
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,840
Is this going to impact me on Fedora?

396
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm on 30 right now, but I think I'm on kernel 5.1.

397
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Yeah, it could do.

398
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,320
Hmm, uh oh, crap.

399
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,240
There's another bug in kernel 5.2 that you might bump into as well, and there's a regression

400
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,280
in the way file systems are mounted that can cause some file systems to get deadlocked

401
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
when they mount.

402
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,160
Oh, that sounds like tons of fun.

403
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Lovely.

404
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,520
No, actually, not tons of fun.

405
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,000
Dang it.

406
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,880
All right, so everybody hold out for kernel 5.4.

407
00:21:51,880 --> 00:22:01,440
On an up note, while I've been playing around with these ultra-mobile PCs, I backed a crowdfunder

408
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,840
for what's called a Topjoy Falcon.

409
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Really?

410
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Tell me about this.

411
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,800
Well, that's an 8-inch netbook style.

412
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,080
These days they're called UMPCs, but we know them as netbooks from a decade ago.

413
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,980
And this one's a little bit bigger than the other ones I've got.

414
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:30,440
So the keyboard is decent, and it's in a aluminum unibody design, and it has an optical touch

415
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,960
point and a touch screen.

416
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,600
And because of the work I've done on other devices like this, when I had a look at the

417
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,880
hardware enumeration, I was like, aha, this is the track point that I've dealt with in

418
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,520
the GPD Pocket 2, and this is the touch screen and the display device I've dealt with in

419
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,400
the GPD Pocket 1.

420
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,080
So by looking at the other devices I've worked on before, I was able to enable that device

421
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,120
with a bespoke image in a couple of hours.

422
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:06,320
So images for Ubuntu MATE 1804 and 1904 are on the website, and backers of that crowdfunder

423
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,520
are just receiving their devices at the moment.

424
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,920
So at the point at which new devices are available, there is also a Linux operating system all

425
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,720
pre-configured ready for you to install.

426
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Well done, sir.

427
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,760
Well, well done.

428
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Very nice.

429
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,480
And that relationship with GPD is developing now, and I've got two other devices in the

430
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,200
post on their way to me at the moment.

431
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,080
So engineering samples of upcoming devices that I'm looking forward to be working on.

432
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,800
There seems to be clear interest in Ubuntu MATE on these devices, huh?

433
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,840
Well GPD have kind of, because I put the effort in, we've kind of become the de facto Linux

434
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,920
that they speak to me.

435
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,920
We're an email contact, and I'm connected with their engineers, so I know what's going

436
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,180
on with their device engineering.

437
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,640
But that was because I put the effort in and some of the other community projects, because

438
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:04,560
my work is just derived from the work of others who did community images for the original

439
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,320
GPD Pocket, and that was really the device that kicked this whole movement off again.

440
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,080
So I'm not really creating anything new, but I am actually sustaining the effort because

441
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,180
some of those other projects have fallen by the wayside.

442
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:24,560
So it's nice for me because all I want in return for a bit of effort is an engineering

443
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
sample of the device.

444
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,960
So I've now got five or six of these things in the house, and they're all quite good fun

445
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
to play with.

446
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,140
And that is an important part of the open source ecosystem too, is making sure some

447
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,800
of that stuff continues on.

448
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,840
Well, that's great.

449
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,800
So Wimpy, you joined us a bit in progress.

450
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,880
Thomas, this is Martin Wimpress.

451
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,240
He's an employee at Canonical and he's the lead for Ubuntu Mate.

452
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,600
Wimpy Thomas works at Amazon in their Linux area amongst a long history of things, but

453
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,800
he's currently in the Amazon Linux team.

454
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Pleasure to meet you.

455
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
And you.

456
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,440
And I very much enjoyed your talk at Texas Linux Fest.

457
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Thank you very much.

458
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
I appreciate it.

459
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
So it's great.

460
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
It's great.

461
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
I just feel like it's been forever.

462
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
So Wimpy, it's great to have you here.

463
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Sure is.

464
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
Everybody, go listen to the Ubuntu podcast.

465
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,080
Like if you've been listening to the show and you're like, I miss Wimpy and Popey.

466
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,440
Well, actually, Popey hasn't been on the Ubuntu podcast for a couple of weeks, but Laura has

467
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
been back.

468
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
So go check it out.

469
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
It's a good show.

470
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Okay.

471
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,920
Just a couple of other community news items before we wrap up.

472
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,200
Alex, you have some good news and it's regarding one of your projects that we don't talk about

473
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,040
too often, but we probably should, which is Linux Server IO.

474
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
I love it.

475
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,760
I use many of your containers here at Jupyter Broadcasting.

476
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
We all do.

477
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:42,120
And the Linux Server IO group has joined Open Collective, which Alex, if my understanding

478
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,920
is correct, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's like Patreon, but for infrastructure projects.

479
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,520
That's a little more open.

480
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,720
Yeah, that's right.

481
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,800
We've been searching for a long time for a sane way to deal with donations, given that

482
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,040
we have team members located across the globe.

483
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,880
We looked at registering as a charity in England and as a charitable organization here in Australia

484
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,960
and all sorts of places.

485
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,920
To be honest, we were getting bogged down in red tape everywhere we turned and Open

486
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:17,160
Collective allows us to take donations via a Patreon type model and it allows people

487
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,280
who want to donate to give us as much or as little as they want in a recurring monthly

488
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,160
fashion if they would like to, but most importantly for us, it's a very low overhead to manage.

489
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,200
They handle all the taxes and everything else.

490
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,560
So yeah, it just means the project is going to be a lot more sustainable moving forward.

491
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:39,240
Why Open Collective and I'm asking in like the sort of will other open source infrastructure

492
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,360
projects maybe choose something like this?

493
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,960
What was it about Open Collective versus Patreon or, you know, setting up your own white label

494
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,720
subscriber payment system?

495
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,800
They are open source themselves.

496
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,040
So if you see something as part of their platform that you don't like, you can improve it.

497
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,480
Oh, very good.

498
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,960
Well, we will have a link in the show notes if you'd like to support Linux over IO.

499
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,340
Take a look at some of the stuff they've put together.

500
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,920
It has made automating tasks here at Jupiter broadcasting a breeze, but not only that,

501
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,320
one of the more fun projects I've probably worked on in the last six months.

502
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:18,520
It's been really enjoyable and it's one of those things where like there's complicated

503
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,820
topics that you need to learn.

504
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,380
Maybe it's containers or whatever it might be.

505
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,860
It's a great way.

506
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,360
It's a great way to learn those things.

507
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,280
It's a nice, safe, easy to replicate environment.

508
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,840
For those that don't know, we make and ship a bunch of community software packaged in

509
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Docker containers.

510
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Yeah.

511
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,320
Now, a couple of months ago, we covered that Antegros was shutting down and that Endeavor

512
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,840
OS was a community project that was launching to sort of fill that gap.

513
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,280
I was kind of skeptical as a diehard Antegros user.

514
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:58,760
I didn't want to see a project that I loved have something iterative taken and then sort

515
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,200
of be not as good.

516
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,080
However, I gave it a go this last weekend because they had their first release.

517
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,280
I felt I got to give it a fair shot.

518
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:17,000
The role here is like a sort of minimal, nice, gooey pre-setup on top of Arch and a little

519
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
bit more?

520
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,120
Is that what we're aiming for?

521
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,580
But unlike Antegros, it's a slightly modified installer and there's only one desktop, Wes.

522
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,400
There's only one desktop and it's an interesting choice.

523
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,840
It is because it's focused, right?

524
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
I gave it a go.

525
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,000
I was very surprised.

526
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,960
I'll talk about that in a moment.

527
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:44,720
However, I happen to know the editor for Choose Linux and I happen to have some sway there.

528
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,640
So I got a clip from Choose Linux, which will come out, I think, tomorrow, but it's very

529
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
soon.

530
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,320
It's chooselinux.show, it's going to be, I think, episode 14.

531
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,480
So chooselinux.show slash 14.

532
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,680
But they're going to do a full review and I got a little clip.

533
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,080
It wasn't long ago, I think it was maybe a month or so ago, Antegos announced that they

534
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,280
were shutting down and Antegos is the easy way to install Arch, essentially, with some

535
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,720
value add as well, to be fair.

536
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,400
And around the time of the announcement, shortly afterwards, a group of people said, hey, we

537
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,480
want to continue it and we're going to call it Endeavor OS.

538
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
And I was skeptical.

539
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,800
I didn't know that it was going to actually happen.

540
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,080
But about a week ago, they released their first stable release.

541
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,240
So I thought we'd better check that out, especially as it's got XFCE.

542
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,520
And I must say, I was quite impressed with it.

543
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,120
But Elle, you had some problems, right?

544
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,600
Okay, so I will just be straight, honest and say I have never used Arch before.

545
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,480
So I was going into trying this completely new and I always say it's okay to be new.

546
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,440
So I thought, why not just jump in?

547
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
Don't do it in a VM.

548
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,480
Don't do it on a backup machine.

549
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,600
Just kick to it and use it.

550
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,760
Now, I'll tell you what surprises me about that distro hopper segment is we came up with

551
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,040
that as kind of a joke.

552
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,400
I thought initially I might do it on YouTube and then I would just do a screencap with

553
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,320
voiceover and that's how I would do video again.

554
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,540
And then we were kind of joking like, well, what if you guys just hit like a random button

555
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,480
and tried out distros?

556
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,840
And I didn't, you know, like, you know, Joe, right?

557
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,760
I mean, oh, yeah, everybody loves Joe.

558
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
That's a fact.

559
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Yeah.

560
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,800
Joe's, Joe's not a big change guy.

561
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,860
He's not a big change guy.

562
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,880
So when, when, when we said to Joe, Hey, what about like, just like hitting a random button

563
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,280
and picking a distro and then having to review it?

564
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,640
I didn't think that was going to work.

565
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,720
Turns out it's been pretty great.

566
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,400
So they have this distro hopper segment where not only are they randomly picking distros

567
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,080
that happens in the show, but they're also doing some intentional reviews, some deep

568
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
dives.

569
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,080
It's been really good.

570
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,080
So Drew and Ella are on that show with Joe choose Linux dot show.

571
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,580
I like this distro hopper segment.

572
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,580
It's fun, isn't it?

573
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,840
Yeah, but one of the things I used to love about Linux Luddites, which is the podcast

574
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:03,660
that Joe created when he first made his foray into Linux podcasting about five years ago,

575
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,480
one of their segments was, I think it was called over a pint and they did the same sort

576
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
of thing.

577
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,640
They would pick a distro at random and then the following episode, they would sort of

578
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,880
give their first impressions and I used to love that segment because at the time I was

579
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,920
bootstrapping Ubuntu Marte and I would get all of these little insights about what was

580
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,920
good or bad about all of these other distributions and it was really great research material

581
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,880
that I didn't have to go off and research for myself.

582
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,120
So I'm glad to sort of see the return of that segment.

583
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
I really enjoy it.

584
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Well said.

585
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,780
And the thing that I find super fun about it is you've got a bunch of different perspectives.

586
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,860
So Elle comes from a very new to the desktop perspective.

587
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,040
She comes from a server side trying the desktop for the first time.

588
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,400
Drew comes at it from a very curious standpoint.

589
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,440
He's really just curious about everything.

590
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,240
And Joe comes at it from like a well-seasoned, I've been running the desktop for a decade.

591
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
Well-seasoned, I like that.

592
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
That's a good term.

593
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,920
Yeah, let me tell you how it really is kind of attitude.

594
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:05,240
And the three of them combined to make a really solid analysis about a distro or a desktop

595
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,200
and they managed to pack it all into like 30 minutes.

596
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,480
It's been really cool.

597
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,640
So anyways, I walked away from Endeavor OS.

598
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:20,440
My short review, my quick little walk away thing would be they did something new.

599
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,720
Early days, but it's not derivative.

600
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,560
It truly felt like something new.

601
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,980
What have they done that's new exactly?

602
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,620
First of all, it's not just a straight rip off of Anterochros.

603
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,240
It's a slightly modified installer.

604
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,760
Some progress has been made on the installer.

605
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,200
And then it's a fully custom single desktop where they've made some choices about the

606
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,440
applications that are different than the choices the Anterochros folks made.

607
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,360
The desktop environment is based on XFCE.

608
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,560
They've switched out VLC for, oh, I'm blanking on it, but it's sort of an XFCE focused Gstreamer

609
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
front end.

610
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Parole.

611
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
I think that's it.

612
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
Yeah, I think that's it.

613
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,400
So they've made some swaps there and it feels like a unique product.

614
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,480
It doesn't feel like Anterochros next release.

615
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
You know what I mean?

616
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,880
Okay, so it's not really the continuation of Anterochros, then it is a different project

617
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,560
with a different agenda.

618
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,640
That's my sense.

619
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,680
They cover it more in Choose Linux, but there will be other desktop options and other install

620
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,800
options that are in the works.

621
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
But so that's coming.

622
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,040
Okay, that I was going to say, because that was kind of the thing with Anterochros, right?

623
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,880
I think Anterochros had a different name to start with.

624
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,360
It was Sinarch originally and it was just Cinnamon on Arch and that was the only desktop

625
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,080
option and then it got renamed and then they added all of the different desktop options

626
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,280
to the installer.

627
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
History is repeating itself.

628
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,520
It sort of is, but it does make sense.

629
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,880
You know, you do want to focus a bit initially.

630
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,360
You want to limit your problem domain.

631
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Get it right.

632
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,640
Yeah, if it were me, I would advise you pick your desktop environment and you stick to

633
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,760
that one desktop environment and you just execute really well on that one thing.

634
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,200
As soon as you become a Linux Mint where you're looking at two different distribution bases

635
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:14,280
and four different desktops, you're spreading yourself too thin and you can be good at everything

636
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,920
but not great at anything.

637
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:24,880
I do think my future need a quick Arch install, just want to try something out on Arch, Go

638
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,800
To Distro will be Endeavor OS.

639
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Is that right?

640
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Okay.

641
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,920
Because that was honestly, that was probably the thing I used Anterochros the most for

642
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
as well.

643
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,720
Why Endeavor and not Manjaro, given at the moment that Manjaro's default desktop environment

644
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,160
is also XFCE and they've been doing this a lot longer, so I'm guessing there's probably

645
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,520
more refinement there.

646
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
I agree.

647
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,000
I think if you wanted a full desktop that you were going to use long term at this point,

648
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,800
it would probably be Manjaro if you wanted something that was Arch based and didn't want

649
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
to use Arch.

650
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Chris likes the shiny mountain.

651
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
That's what it is.

652
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
I know that.

653
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,600
I'm just kind of being devil's advocate because we've got a new distro on the block.

654
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:06,440
There's some heritage or a reason for its being, which is the discontinuation of Antergos.

655
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,840
And then there's some real similarities with Manjaro, which is also an Arch derivative.

656
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:19,080
So what Antergos gave me that Manjaro doesn't really satisfy is damn near vanilla Arch.

657
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,920
And I would say Endeavor OS is even slightly closer.

658
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
I could be wrong.

659
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,000
I didn't do a scientific calculation, but by the quick count that I did, six packages

660
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,840
came from their own repo.

661
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:37,720
And two of them were their GPG key package and things like that to make the repo possible.

662
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,040
So it's very mild modifications from upstream Arch.

663
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,000
It would take you 20 minutes at most to just make it an upstream Arch box.

664
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,760
And that's what I'm looking for is I'm looking for a shortcut to just get a full graphical

665
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,040
desktop environment with a web browser and a media player and some codecs.

666
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,360
A bootstrap.

667
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
Yeah.

668
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,480
On top of Arch.

669
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,080
Because if I'm installing Arch these days, it's because I need Arch to do a task.

670
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,400
I'm not necessarily installing it to use for six months to five years.

671
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,620
And if I was, maybe I would consider Manjaro at this point.

672
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,720
But for me, right now, I'm sticking to Fedora and Ubuntu for the desktop.

673
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,200
But that does seem like a good Arch candidate.

674
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,100
And I think I'm going to check back in and maybe every other release or so.

675
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,400
It's looking pretty good, and I got to say, I love Pac-Man.

676
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
I know, right?

677
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,600
It's always a dream.

678
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,320
Not just Pac-Man, but the AUR, that sauce is really hard to get rid of once you've tasted

679
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,320
it.

680
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,760
Thankfully, there's this project called Linux over IO that makes software much more available

681
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,480
on just about any distribution I choose.

682
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,600
So I haven't had that problem for a while.

683
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
All right.

684
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Well, let's move on now.

685
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,640
We have a few things to get into.

686
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,020
Number one is the housekeeping.

687
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,700
Just a really quick one here.

688
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,680
This is kind of a great study group that's kicking off.

689
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,360
It's like the next generation of the study groups we've been doing for a while.

690
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,520
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for times, dates and information highlights.

691
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,760
It's passing the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam.

692
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,280
This is a free online study group that we're getting more people at Linux Academy involved

693
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
in to give.

694
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,200
It's actually training away for free.

695
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
I don't know.

696
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
What's the downside here?

697
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,640
Just take advantage of a lot of us do this and learn some things.

698
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
How long will you let us do this?

699
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
They can't take it away again.

700
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
So you're set.

701
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,540
Once it's on the internet, it's out there.

702
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,800
But if you want to ask questions or get information, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

703
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,520
Once you set Elle on a task, man, she is like-

704
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
Watch out.

705
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
I know.

706
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
She's going to get it done.

707
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
She's just taking this to the whole next level.

708
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,560
They're going to get even better.

709
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,160
So meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for that and more.

710
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:47,360
Speaking of AWS, by the way, Elle has also released a whole bunch of more AWS content

711
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,960
for free as well as additional courses.

712
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,040
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

713
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,320
That's something that she and I do now.

714
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,400
They should never have given her the key because it's all the best stuff.

715
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
I know.

716
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,720
Elle asked me, she's like, what do you think about this, this and that?

717
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,200
I'm like, well, Elle, just use your best and just do whatever you want.

718
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
You're going to do it, right?

719
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Just do it.

720
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,200
And it hasn't gone wrong yet.

721
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,200
So check that out.

722
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:14,880
We have links to all that stuff in the show notes as well as a link to the Friday stream.

723
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,800
May there only be a limited number of Friday streams left?

724
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,960
Could there be a very special Friday stream where the entire crew is in studio?

725
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,160
All of these questions and more will be answered.

726
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,320
I've got to know.

727
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,960
At fridaystream.com.

728
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,360
The latest episode, fridaystream.com slash 10, Young and the Reckless, was our first

729
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,640
stories about the ways we trashed our early vehicles.

730
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,680
Really, that's what it came down to.

731
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,240
You know, I was on a trip when I was listening to the Friday stream live, of course, because

732
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,600
that's the way to do it if you can.

733
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,320
I saw both of my first cars, the first one I wrecked and then the second second car I

734
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,320
used after that.

735
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,020
So it's a great episode.

736
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,020
Did you hear about that?

737
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,020
Did you hear my transmission story?

738
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,020
Oh, man.

739
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,020
I know.

740
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,020
I know.

741
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
I know.

742
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,020
That was crazy.

743
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,020
Anyways, the Friday stream is great.

744
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
It may it may be a limited product.

745
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,020
I don't know.

746
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,020
Who knows?

747
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,020
People don't know.

748
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,040
If somebody may know, but who could that be?

749
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
Who could that be?

750
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,040
Check it out fridaystream.com and there's much more.

751
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,280
We have links in the show notes for everything I've been yammering on about, including all

752
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,920
of the news stories and everything else we're about to talk about at linuxunplug.com slash

753
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
311.

754
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:29,120
All right, Thomas, thank you for waiting through all that.

755
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,120
Appreciate it.

756
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Of course.

757
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:37,080
So, Thomas, I guess you're not new to the Texas Linux Fest scene or that whole Linux

758
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,720
scene at all since you've been in the biz since about 1993, if I recall, correct?

759
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
Correct.

760
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,380
I've presented at Texas Linux Fest numerous times over the years.

761
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,240
My daughters have volunteered with TXLF.

762
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:57,240
So yeah, I've spent a lot of time with and absolutely love the folks who organize Texas

763
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
Linux Fest.

764
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,320
I think one of the things that really resonated about your talk is that you and I have had

765
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,520
a very similar timeline in IT.

766
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:14,000
You started a bit before I did because when I started, Turbo Linux was no longer a thing.

767
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,300
It was like it was on the decline, but when you started, you became Turbo Linux certified

768
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,300
instructor number 001.

769
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,220
I don't even know if many people listening have even heard of Turbo Linux before.

770
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,480
It's really big in Japan.

771
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,560
And actually, this is one of the few times where I can say that with a perfectly straight

772
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
face.

773
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,480
Turbo Linux actually has done very well in APAC.

774
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,480
But yeah, back in the day, Turbo Linux was one of numerous distros out there.

775
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,820
And at the time, I owned a small IT consultancy and we got engaged because I had written a

776
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,600
whole bunch of Red Hat Linux training courses.

777
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,500
And we got engaged by Turbo Linux to develop a Turbo Linux certification course.

778
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,480
This next question is in the context of the overall direction of the jobs market.

779
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,280
I'm curious, how did you go from 14 years at Red Hat to...

780
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,360
Which when I think of Red Hat, especially the time you were at Red Hat, I think very

781
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,360
much of on-premises installations and things like that.

782
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:23,520
How did you go from that career trajectory for 14 years into Amazon, which to me is...

783
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,040
It seems like a pretty big pivot for somebody in your career trajectory.

784
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,680
You seem like you're very much on-premises, building on-premises data centers, systems

785
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,040
out, supporting those clients, running an independent contracting company, then you

786
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
go work for Red Hat.

787
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,760
It sort of extends that career trajectory, then all of a sudden you get to Amazon and

788
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,720
it seems like a bit of a 180 to me.

789
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,000
Well, I don't think it's a 180.

790
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,240
I think that it's a pretty natural progression, honestly.

791
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,600
Because look at the evolution of cloud, right?

792
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,800
For a long time, people were saying it's cloud when it was really just virtualized hosting.

793
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,080
Yeah, you're on-premises set up, but up on somebody else's infrastructure.

794
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:08,240
Lift and shift, we'll do your mess for less kind of things.

795
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,180
I spent a fair amount of time helping customers do things like that.

796
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:18,460
But then as cloud native applications and application services started taking off and

797
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:25,840
as storage changed and as networking sort of evolved and became more complex in cloud

798
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,680
computing environments, at their core, all of the services that you see most of the cloud

799
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,560
providers out there offering are built on Linux.

800
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
For me, it wasn't a 180.

801
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,160
It was a fairly natural progression.

802
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:49,680
It was realizing that everybody seems to be taking a cloud first attitude or strategy.

803
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,320
And a lot of these organizations, a lot of big enterprises are taking a containerized

804
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:01,600
first in the cloud and not even your mess for less, dump what we're doing out into the

805
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
cloud.

806
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,960
But let's really, really architect our applications to take advantage of cloud native services,

807
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,100
which are all based on Linux.

808
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,760
So that's what I decided to chase.

809
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,960
Makes sense to me.

810
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,560
The thing you said in the keynote that, well, you really demonstrated it actually with job

811
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,560
searches.

812
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,080
But essentially the punchline is the Linux sysadmin could be going the way of the Unix

813
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,080
sysadmin.

814
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,000
Not that it's going to be obliterated completely, but it's going to become a niche.

815
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,560
And when you do a job search in a popular area, you're down in the Austin area right

816
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,560
now.

817
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,700
You do a job search down there for a Linux admin, you get X amount of results.

818
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,960
You do a search for cloud architect or cloud engineer and you get almost four or five X,

819
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,320
maybe even more results.

820
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,560
What's at the core of that though is Linux, right?

821
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,000
So it's not that we are left out of this transition.

822
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,720
It's just about maybe adapting to the times.

823
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
Yeah, absolutely.

824
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,640
I mean, I think that it's really, really natural, especially if you've been doing this for a

825
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,840
long time to go, well, I know Linux, I know the data center, I know, you know, IP tables

826
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,880
and networking and subnet masking and storage and, you know, I want to do that in the data

827
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,880
center.

828
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,760
It's really easy to get caught up and scared of change.

829
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,160
But when you look at the infrastructure that is running every cloud provider out there,

830
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,400
it's all open source, it's all Linux, it's all things you're already used to.

831
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,000
And so I don't think that folks should look at it as, oh my gosh, this is going to be

832
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
hard.

833
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,880
They should look at it as, wow, I've already got a head start on a lot of other folks because

834
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,040
I understand the underlying technologies.

835
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,300
Yeah, that is, I think, a very good way to look at it.

836
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,920
And it's the reality of the situation.

837
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,560
You're well positioned.

838
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,520
I want to just take a tangent for a moment and talk about something that we never talk

839
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,200
about on the show, and that's Amazon Linux.

840
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:57,400
Correct me where I'm wrong, but my understanding is that it is at least initially based on

841
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,920
a version of RHEL, but that's about the extent of my understanding.

842
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,000
Is that correct?

843
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,760
So we have a lot of commonality with, say, CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

844
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,080
But what we did when we were developing, especially Amazon Linux 2, which is the latest version

845
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:20,400
that's out there, is we wanted to have a distro that was familiar and comfortable to enterprise

846
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,400
users.

847
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,020
So yes, it does share a common heritage with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

848
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,080
It's similar to CentOS.

849
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:33,160
But we recompiled the GCC tool chain, put a newer version of glibc, newer version of

850
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,500
the kernel, optimized and tuned it for virtualized environments.

851
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:45,480
So while it is a similar environment and gives you a similar experience to other RPM-based

852
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,560
distros, it is really purpose-built for cloud computing.

853
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,120
So it's not necessarily pegged to a specific version of CentOS or RHEL?

854
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,120
Nope.

855
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,120
Hmm.

856
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,880
And kind of in this context, what are your thoughts on the universal base image that

857
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,440
Red Hat's working on as part of RHEL 8?

858
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,440
Hmm.

859
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,640
So UBI, I saw a lot of the development that went on around UBI when I was still at Red

860
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,640
Hat.

861
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,520
UBI is interesting.

862
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,120
It is designed for containerized environments.

863
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,560
It is designed to be used as a container.

864
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,200
It's not a full distro.

865
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,560
Could run on top of Amazon Linux 2.

866
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,560
Sure.

867
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,560
Absolutely.

868
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,560
Yeah.

869
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,760
So it's free, freely available, zero cost.

870
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,980
They want everyone to adopt UBI for all of their containerized workloads.

871
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,160
And I think that that is a noble cause.

872
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:42,480
I think that there are a lot of organizations which have done analysis of container runtimes

873
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,420
and found that smaller is better.

874
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:51,240
And UBI, being a universal base image, tries to be all things to all people.

875
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:56,480
And so in the environments where you've got to spin up thousands or tens of thousands

876
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,560
of containers, you're probably going to want to look real hard at what the performance

877
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,800
impact is for having a larger container.

878
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,360
That is not a slam or a dig at all.

879
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:11,720
There are some cases where UBI is absolutely going to make sense, but there are also going

880
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,720
to be cases where it doesn't.

881
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,720
Yeah.

882
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,600
I think that's a fair observation.

883
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,440
And everything you say, I consider your personal opinion, doesn't reflect Amazon or anything

884
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,440
like that.

885
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,500
So this is all just what Thomas thinks.

886
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:31,160
And in that kind of vein, when I look at Amazon Linux 2 and how it's used at such a fantastic

887
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:38,040
scale, and I take that out over the next five to 10 years, and I multiply that across Azure

888
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:45,300
and Google Cloud, and I think not a single one of those is a Red Hat subscription.

889
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:50,680
And I wonder if this plays a bit into IBM's acquisition or perhaps why Red Hat may have

890
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,600
been willing to sell to IBM.

891
00:47:53,600 --> 00:48:00,260
Again, your personal opinion, but do you think there is a sort of a market momentum that

892
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,680
may have been on their minds during this acquisition?

893
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,680
Wow.

894
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,120
That's a little difficult to answer because I was inside of the organization during the

895
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,080
acquisition process.

896
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:16,040
I will say that you can look anywhere in the industry.

897
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:22,320
You can look at AWS, you can look at Azure, you can look at GCE, you can look at the smaller

898
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:27,160
ones like Rackspace or any one of the organizations out there.

899
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,900
They're all running a whole lot of unpaid Linux.

900
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,360
They're making a whole lot of unpaid Linux available to their customers.

901
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,040
And their customers are all saying, meh, it's good enough.

902
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,960
If you look at the paradigm shift that we're seeing where folks are saying, meh, I'm going

903
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:52,520
to do things as cattle, not pets, or even not necessarily as cattle, but as containerization

904
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,220
so that if something breaks, if something didn't work, I throw it away, I spin a new

905
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,220
one up.

906
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,220
I don't care.

907
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,600
I don't care about the underlying operating system.

908
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:06,920
I don't care about the technology in as much as it has to be distro X or distro Y.

909
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:14,160
So I think that the writing is on the wall for expensive, big distributions.

910
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,360
And I think that everybody recognizes that open source has become commoditized.

911
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,660
Linux has become commoditized.

912
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:28,280
And so, yeah, I think that that very well may have been one of the driving forces.

913
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,440
That stream, that well is going dry.

914
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,200
Maybe it's time to cash out.

915
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,200
I don't know.

916
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,640
Great point.

917
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,440
And in your talk, you talk about the distro wars as if they're over.

918
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,480
Is this kind of why?

919
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,360
Is this new reality why when you talk about the distro wars in your keynote, you talk

920
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:51,080
about them in a past tense and you talk about the damage they did, not that they're doing?

921
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,600
I think that there's still some of that mentality because you've always got the fanboys, right?

922
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,680
And to be clear, I was a fanboy for a long time.

923
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,560
I still fanboy a little bit.

924
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,880
There are some distros that I really love.

925
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,480
I love Fedora.

926
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,920
But I think that, yes, when you had in the early days, you had these distros that were

927
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,240
doing fairly different things around the Linux kernel and you couldn't install the same piece

928
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,600
of software across two different distros without totally recompiling.

929
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
That was bad.

930
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,600
That was harmful.

931
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,680
It was exactly the same thing that we saw during the Unix wars that, oh, it wouldn't

932
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:33,040
work on this sysv versus this bsd init style or, you know, hpux had a different kernel

933
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,440
and you had to recompile stuff versus sunOS.

934
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,040
All that craziness, different administration tools, different interfaces.

935
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,280
I think that the distro wars were very harmful.

936
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,240
I don't think we're seeing that as much today.

937
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,680
I think we're seeing a lot more work towards interoperability between distros with things

938
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:57,120
like Flatpak and so on that I think it's fantastic.

939
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,440
I think it's wonderful, man.

940
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,640
Use the distro that you like and still be able to access the software that you need

941
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,640
to get your job done.

942
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,040
I mean, no doubt about it, right?

943
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:11,900
I mean, looking back at since 1993 compared to today, it is so much easier to run the

944
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,800
distro that you want to run.

945
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,800
Oh, yeah.

946
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,840
I mean, you remember as well as I do.

947
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,840
And I talked about it.

948
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,800
I alluded to it in the keynote.

949
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:29,180
Man, you know, I remember fighting for literally about a week to get my first distro installed.

950
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,060
And then I finally got it installed and it booted up and there was a little flashing

951
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:37,080
login cursor and I was like, ah, what do I do now?

952
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:42,120
Thomas, when you brought up when you brought up wind modems, I actually felt physical pain.

953
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,840
I felt physical pain.

954
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,640
Oh, God, it was so bad.

955
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,640
Yeah, it was so bad.

956
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
It was so bad.

957
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,960
Well, any kind of advice or any kind of quote unquote mentorship that you would give to

958
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,360
somebody who's looking to get into the Linux market today?

959
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,800
What are some of the fundamentals that they probably need to start thinking about to be

960
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,120
successful in the job market?

961
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,340
Not to put you on the spot, but no, no, no, that's that's actually a really good question.

962
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:13,480
And I will say what you heard me say before, install Linux on your primary machine and

963
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,000
it's going to be scary and you're going to not know how to do stuff and it's going to

964
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,960
freak you out and you're going to be missing, you know, applications in the whatever your

965
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,440
OS of choice is, Windows or Mac OS or whatever, and it's going to suck for the first couple

966
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,440
of weeks.

967
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:34,300
But if you immerse yourself, if you force yourself to really use it every single day,

968
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:39,540
learn about how networking works, learn about what subnetting is, understand why you always

969
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:45,560
have a 192.168 address when you're at home, like just that sort of basic blocking and

970
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:50,460
tackling getting it up and running, getting users installed, configuring services.

971
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:57,160
If you do those things and you can speak intelligently about them when you go to interview, you're

972
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,760
going to have a huge leg up over somebody who's just kind of the paper tiger that, you

973
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,120
know, oh, I read a book or I ran through a, you know, some online cheesy CBT that didn't

974
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,000
really make me go through and perform tasks.

975
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,640
Can I just add to that?

976
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,640
Sure.

977
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,640
Absolutely.

978
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,800
So the first thing I was going to say is I was, I listened to your question and the first

979
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,640
thing I thought was really learn networking.

980
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,240
So I'm glad that you hit that point because I think that's super important and you know,

981
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,760
people often think about, oh, I know how to get around, you know, the Linux file system

982
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:33,000
and install packages and configure packages, but you really need to be an expert at the

983
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,560
network level and then if you want to be an attractive candidate to employers and you

984
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:44,860
want to be working in the data center, then it doesn't matter which technology you choose

985
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,040
to learn, but learn how to orchestrate Linux at scale.

986
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:55,440
So it doesn't matter whether it's Puppet or Chef or Ansible or Juju or Maz or whatever,

987
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:02,120
learn one of those, understand why it's important and understand how you scale Linux horizontally

988
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,120
and vertically.

989
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:08,520
And if you're able to nail that and networking, you've got a job for life.

990
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,160
I completely agree.

991
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
Great tips.

992
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:17,280
That is one of those things that even today, I still appreciate having some network fundamentals.

993
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:24,200
Wes and I were on a call on Monday discussing relays and international data transfer and

994
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:29,040
the hops between and it really, really helps to have a basic understanding.

995
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,000
We live in a distributed world, right, and it's all connected by networks.

996
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,680
I found an incredible value in learning things like Ansible, as Martin just said, but Docker

997
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,580
as well is another life-changing technology for me.

998
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,720
But having a project, a real-world problem that I can solve at home with these things

999
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:51,440
is that means I can go into an interview and speak authoritatively on a topic and say,

1000
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,280
yes, I've done X, Y and Z on my home lab, here's how I can add value to your business.

1001
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,560
And just being able to go in there and say those things with some authority is completely

1002
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,960
overlooked.

1003
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,640
When people are choosing one solution over another, whether it's a Synology NAS versus

1004
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,880
building your own thing, that never factors into the equation and I absolutely think it

1005
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,880
should for people.

1006
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,880
Yeah.

1007
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,160
And yeah, you're dead right.

1008
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:20,840
And the number of times that I have messed around with a personal interest project at

1009
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:28,440
home where I've had to learn, let's say, how Ceph works, for example, or ZFS, and then

1010
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:34,380
have been able to use that knowledge and apply it in the workplace, I can't count the number

1011
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,640
of times I've done that.

1012
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:41,600
So you know, back to the don't just run it on your desktop PC, it can be something as

1013
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:47,980
simple as a NUC with disks plugged in via USB 3, you know, it doesn't need to be expensive

1014
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:54,240
or fancy, but create yourself a lab that you can bring up and solve problems on.

1015
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,800
It's better if they're problems that persist, you know, you like your home media server

1016
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,480
or you know, something like that, and really experiment with things, you know, don't be

1017
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,480
afraid of experimenting with a new file system paradigm is something that Alex and I were

1018
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,440
talking about in the telegram this week, you know, just experiment and use these things.

1019
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:19,160
My daughter and I just bought five of the new Raspberry Pi 4Bs, and you stack those

1020
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:23,440
bad boys up into one of the little, you know, stackable cases.

1021
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,700
And all of a sudden, for, you know, a couple hundred bucks, the cost of one NUC that's

1022
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:34,320
not even, you know, super, super built out, you've got multiple machines, so you can do

1023
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:41,560
things like Docker, you can do things like Kubernetes, you know, you can do lab type

1024
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,400
of stuff at home for a heck of a lot cheaper than back in the day when we were buying,

1025
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,640
you know, old Optiplexes and stuff like that.

1026
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,020
And if you don't want to get into, well, it's not so exotic, but if you don't want to get

1027
00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:01,120
into the exotic world of ARM, you know, there's even boards like the Atomic Pi, which are

1028
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,800
x86 boards, and they're only like 60 bucks, and they're quite pokey, and you can do a

1029
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,960
lot with them.

1030
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,800
So there's plenty of ways to access sort of cheap hardware to build out your own modest

1031
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,760
lab environments to, you know, experiment on.

1032
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:20,380
Top tip from me, if you want to find a good compendium of different CPUs and motherboards

1033
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:25,600
and stuff like that is serverbuild.net, there's some great information on that website.

1034
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:34,280
And I just built this week a PFsense router around $150 with an i5-3470 in it, four gigs

1035
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,600
of RAM and all that kind of stuff.

1036
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:41,200
So you know, it is incredible what you can build for that 150 kind of price point these

1037
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,200
days.

1038
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:47,120
The Raspberry Pi thing, the reason why that's such a fun tip is it's way more entertaining,

1039
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,120
fun and educational than setting up a bunch of VMs.

1040
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,460
VMs are a good skill to have too, but it's so cool to physically set up a couple of Pis

1041
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,720
and then connect into them and manipulate them.

1042
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,920
I like Wimpy's point too, you know, make something you're actually going to rely on because that's

1043
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,920
a key part to a lot of this stuff is you're going to have to support it and you're going

1044
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,240
to have to figure out what happens when you upgrade and it goes wrong.

1045
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,160
And the family can't watch movies on your Plex server anymore.

1046
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,160
It's motivating.

1047
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,320
Let me put it that way, Wes.

1048
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:18,000
There's nothing like learning how to do RAID recovery if you pull a disk out of your home

1049
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,080
server, you know, your Plex on a Saturday morning, you know, just do that and then learn

1050
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,720
how to recover that situation.

1051
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,820
That'll focus your attention.

1052
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:26,820
Very true.

1053
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,820
Very, very true.

1054
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,660
I'll throw one more thing out.

1055
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:35,320
When I'm hiring, when I'm looking at a candidate, I will always do a Google search on their

1056
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,680
name.

1057
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,480
And so I would say that if you are trying to break into the industry, get on mailing

1058
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:48,300
lists, get on, you know, web boards, get on whatever is appropriate for what your interests

1059
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,240
are and contribute.

1060
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,800
Even if you're not contributing code, I mean, just answer questions or help folks, you know,

1061
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,680
help help new folks.

1062
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,420
You may not have the answer, but, you know, hey, did you consider blah, blah, blah, blah.

1063
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:06,360
If I, as a hiring manager, see that and see that you're out there trying to do good and

1064
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:11,840
trying to help the community, that gives you massive brownie points in my eyes.

1065
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,840
Yeah.

1066
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,000
As a hiring manager, I totally endorse that.

1067
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,160
That might be one of the single best tips given out on the show, because that is something

1068
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,840
that we use when we are researching people that we're talking about on the show.

1069
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,920
And that's the way we measure a certain amount of impact, too.

1070
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,440
And I can absolutely see how that would correlate to hiring.

1071
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,720
I think that is a really good tip.

1072
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,720
So, Thomas, I've got two last questions for you.

1073
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,720
Sure.

1074
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,720
Number one is a long timer.

1075
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,320
What are you doing today on your Linux desktop that just just like you if you if you told

1076
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,040
10 year if you just went back in time 10 years and told yourself you could do this, it would

1077
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,040
blow your mind.

1078
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,680
Oh, that's that's easy.

1079
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:50,800
I mean, it's let's ignore containerization because this is sort of, you know, the next

1080
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,800
step.

1081
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:58,480
But the fact that I have a machine at my desk with 32 gigs of memory in it, and I can spin

1082
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:05,880
up virtual machines in, you know, 10 minutes or not even that two minutes and and set up

1083
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:11,600
complex networked environments, then run Kubernetes on top of it to do my container orchestration.

1084
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,560
You know, the fact that I can do all of that on one machine and that one machine, by the

1085
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,160
way, has three monitors attached to it 10 years ago.

1086
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,600
That was science fiction.

1087
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,840
You are making me smile so much right now.

1088
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,900
A man after my own heart because I am geeking out so hardcore with PCI pass through and

1089
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,200
virtualization right now.

1090
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,840
I can't believe the performance I'm getting.

1091
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,740
I'm sitting at a virtual machine with a keyboard, a mouse and a screen, and it feels like I'm

1092
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,220
at bare metal hardware.

1093
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,400
It's just oh, yeah.

1094
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
Virtualization has come so far.

1095
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,480
It has a future.

1096
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,440
That is such a remarkable that is such a remarkable change.

1097
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,980
Great, great answer.

1098
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:55,140
Number two, how would you feel about us doing a once over on your keynote, like doing some

1099
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:59,280
audio filtering and things like that and releasing it somewhere for people to be able to listen

1100
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,280
to?

1101
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,280
I don't know if it's ever been public, but I'm just thinking after our talk that would

1102
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,560
that keynote would be some really good context for this conversation.

1103
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,560
I'd love to post it somewhere.

1104
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,560
How do you feel about that?

1105
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,740
I would be honored.

1106
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,880
That would be fantastic.

1107
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,880
Thank you so much.

1108
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,880
I will figure that out.

1109
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,200
I don't know exactly how we'll do that, but we'll do a follow up at some point, and then

1110
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,120
I'll let you know whenever we figure it out, because I just came up with that on the spot.

1111
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,000
I think it'd be really good, because it was such a great keynote, and you made some great

1112
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,820
points about diversity and different types of diversity, including neurological diversity

1113
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:30,640
that really resonated with me, and that's in the keynote as well.

1114
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:35,400
We did talk about that in episode 304, so if you do want some additional context before

1115
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:42,160
we get that whole thing posted, go check out linuxunplug.com slash 304 where we have all

1116
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,160
that.

1117
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,480
Thomas, we'll have links to your profile and whatnot in our show notes.

1118
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,720
Is there anywhere else you want to send people?

1119
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:48,720
AWS.amazon.com.

1120
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,680
Got to throw that out there.

1121
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,680
Attaboy.

1122
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,680
Good man.

1123
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,680
You got to do it.

1124
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,680
Yeah, it's great.

1125
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,680
If you've never heard of AWS.

1126
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,680
Yeah.

1127
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:04,520
There's this little company that's doing something to this cloud thing.

1128
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,480
I don't know if it's ever going to be big, but...

1129
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,200
I don't know that a book company is ever going to succeed at that.

1130
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Right.

1131
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,200
Yeah.

1132
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:17,360
Let me tell you, the Seattle area could tell you differently.

1133
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:22,680
We have some glass balls downtown that say otherwise, big, really big glass balls downtown.

1134
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:28,080
Man, the first time I saw those, because I flew up for some of my new hire, the first

1135
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,000
time I saw that was like, wow.

1136
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,280
It looks like something from Star Trek.

1137
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,040
I bet you there will be a sci-fi episode at some point that films outside those things.

1138
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,440
They're super cool.

1139
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,920
If you search the internet right now, you'll find Jeff Bezos thanking the crew for Amazon

1140
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,520
Prime Day up on the glass balls.

1141
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:47,520
It's a pretty great picture.

1142
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,960
But that's not in the show notes.

1143
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,960
That's something for you to do at home.

1144
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,960
But what we...

1145
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,960
Bezos balls.

1146
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:57,880
We do have in the show notes is a link to Croc, which is looking to surplant my beloved

1147
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:58,880
wormhole.

1148
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,880
Did you find this?

1149
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:00,880
Yeah, yeah.

1150
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,940
Well, someone found it anyway, and Drew tried it out with me.

1151
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,360
He was good enough.

1152
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,360
He agreed.

1153
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,360
It's like magic wormholes.

1154
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,360
Great.

1155
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,960
I think Croc has a slight edge.

1156
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,960
It's encrypted.

1157
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,840
It lets you send multiple files, and it's resumable.

1158
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,120
Okay, hang on.

1159
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,120
Rewind.

1160
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,120
What's this thing called?

1161
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,120
Because I love wormholes.

1162
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,600
If there's something better out there, I need to know about this.

1163
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,600
Right.

1164
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,600
It's called Croc.

1165
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,600
C-R-O-C.

1166
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,600
It's on GitHub.

1167
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,940
We'll have a link in the show notes.

1168
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,200
And it's all the things we love about wormhole.

1169
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:33,080
It will do a proxy connection, which you can self-host or that project offers one.

1170
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:38,080
It brings in multiple files and resuming, though, which magic wormhole currently does

1171
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,080
not.

1172
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,080
Really quick recap.

1173
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:44,560
For those of you that don't know, these are tools that make it crazy simple to transfer

1174
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:49,520
all kinds of large or small files between machines anywhere in the world.

1175
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,800
They will traverse NAT.

1176
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:55,620
They will manage your port 40, aka they don't require it.

1177
01:03:55,620 --> 01:04:00,480
It's a really, really handy way to, say, exchange large working files between groups and not

1178
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,080
have to rely on like a cloud service.

1179
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,840
Because once the transfer is set up, you're sending directly between machines.

1180
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,560
And the thing that Croc's bringing to the party is Windows and Mac support, which is

1181
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:15,000
nice, encryption, multiple files, and resuming.

1182
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Yeah.

1183
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And it's just a go binary, too.

1184
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,280
So you can just download the tar file.

1185
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,280
Oh, quit it.

1186
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,880
It's super easy to package up or run wherever you want.

1187
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,400
I really love magic wormhole.

1188
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,400
So this does hurt.

1189
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,640
Because one of the cool things that it does, and I have not tried Croc, but one of the

1190
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:32,940
things magic wormhole does is you say wormhole send, and then you give it the file name.

1191
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:37,080
And then it generates a human readable code that's in three segments.

1192
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,080
Oh, it is?

1193
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,080
Yep.

1194
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,080
That's really nice.

1195
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:44,060
And this magic wormhole, in fairness here, has one of the inspirations for the project.

1196
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:46,080
So there's a lot of tools here.

1197
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,780
And I don't know that it's really necessarily better than what you're doing, unless you

1198
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,320
need one of the features.

1199
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,320
Resuming's nice.

1200
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,360
Because we're moving like 30 gigs.

1201
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,520
I will certainly take a look at this.

1202
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:02,000
What I would say is wormhole can transfer multiple files as well.

1203
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,280
You just point wormhole at a directory, and then everything in that directory gets transferred.

1204
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,280
Oh, nice.

1205
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,280
Fair enough.

1206
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,280
Yes, that is true.

1207
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,280
Oh, look at this.

1208
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,280
They have a container ready for it to go.

1209
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,840
I also like that the relay's easy to run.

1210
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,960
You don't have to run anything separately.

1211
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,000
It's another flag to the binary that you have.

1212
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,360
So we could put that relay on our own system.

1213
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,360
Very easily.

1214
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:21,360
And there's a container for it, yeah.

1215
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,360
Yeah.

1216
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,360
Dang it.

1217
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,360
This is happening, isn't it?

1218
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,360
I can already feel this has happened.

1219
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,360
Like you and Jeroob decided now it's just time for old man Chris to get on board.

1220
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,360
Dang it.

1221
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,360
That's cool.

1222
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,520
I love magic wormhole.

1223
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,240
I'll still use it with Wimpy.

1224
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,840
Yeah, we're not going to uninstall it.

1225
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,960
No, what's nice about magic wormhole is it's in most repositories.

1226
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,960
You just didn't know about it.

1227
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:39,960
That's nice, yes.

1228
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:40,960
I love those kinds of apps.

1229
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,760
They've been in the repo the entire time.

1230
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,760
And it's in pip too.

1231
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,240
So if you already have Python, you're good to go.

1232
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,240
Yeah, of course.

1233
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,240
Of course.

1234
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,240
All right.

1235
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,800
Well, we'll have links to that and more in the show notes.

1236
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,800
LinuxUnplugged.com.

1237
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,520
Why don't you join us live next week?

1238
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,720
Did you know we do this on a Tuesday?

1239
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,200
Oh, it's way more fun live.

1240
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,200
It is.

1241
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,640
Well, there's like more show.

1242
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,640
Extra show.

1243
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:00,640
Yeah.

1244
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,720
There's a post-show and post-show and the recording, but that's not.

1245
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,720
That's just a little teaser.

1246
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,720
Spoiler alert.

1247
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,720
That's not the whole thing.

1248
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,720
It's not.

1249
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,720
It's not the whole thing.

1250
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,560
We never really said that, but it's true.

1251
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:12,080
There's only one way to really find out, though.

1252
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,080
jblive.tv.

1253
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,800
We have it converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar, as

1254
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,640
well as many other fine shows posted over there.

1255
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:25,920
Go check out the links to the guests and as well as the hosts at LinuxUnplugged.com.

1256
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,320
Thanks so much for joining us.

1257
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:53,880
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1258
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:12,560
Thomas, thank you so much for coming on the show, man.

1259
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,560
Absolutely my pleasure.

1260
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,560
Thank you for having me.

1261
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,560
That was a lot of fun.

1262
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,560
And thank you for doing the recording too.

1263
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,480
So before you stop recording or before you go, we just have one duty left and that is

1264
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,280
we must select a title for this episode.

1265
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,960
It is the hardest aspect of the show.

1266
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,040
So if you go over to jbtitles.com, that's why we make you help us.

1267
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,040
Yeah.

1268
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,520
If you go to jbtitles.com, we have a vote.

1269
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,280
Oh, and then we've only gotten seven suggestions.

1270
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,280
Chat room.

1271
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,280
Several of them are from me.

1272
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,680
Oh my goodness.

1273
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,080
So we have only a few choices to pick from.

1274
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,080
Yeah.

1275
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,080
Go help us out.

1276
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,360
I don't think I like any of these.

1277
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,120
So we may have to come up with our own.

1278
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,680
These I expect more.

1279
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,480
32 hours of outrage.

1280
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,940
That is good.

1281
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:54,940
That is good.

1282
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:57,520
I got to admit that is really funny.

1283
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,680
I actually would click that too.

1284
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,680
It's natural.

1285
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,680
You can't resist.

1286
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,680
Yeah, you can't.

1287
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,680
It's instinct.

1288
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,880
Can we come up with anything else?

1289
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,880
Wimpy, you haven't been here for a while.

1290
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,760
I feel like it'd be perfect for you to just have a creative title idea.

1291
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,520
And Brent, where's your game today?

1292
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,520
I've just done it.

1293
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,520
What was it?

1294
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,520
I've got one in there.

1295
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,520
Yeah, Brent.

1296
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,520
We see it.

1297
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,520
I mean, it's not like we don't see it, Brent.

1298
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,520
I know.

1299
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,520
I know.

1300
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,520
I never said it was good.

1301
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,080
Podcasting in my pants with me.

1302
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:28,440
I don't think that's going to be it.

1303
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,120
I mean, the exclamation point really makes it.

1304
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,480
I do appreciate the visual, but imagine all of the audience that has to have that visual,

1305
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,480
Wimpy.

1306
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,440
That's just not something we want to do to them.

1307
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:54,720
Well, I think you've missed on your market research there.
