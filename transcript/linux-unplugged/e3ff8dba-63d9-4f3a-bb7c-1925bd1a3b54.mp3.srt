1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
So I have a DJI Phantom and it has it has zone restriction that you know so

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,980
that way they don't get in trouble as a company with like the FAA and there is

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,560
an airport near the studio and so I send the drone up and it takes it takes a few

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,220
beats before it gets GPS lock and so I send it about 35 40 50 feet up in the

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,180
air and by the time it gets to about 60 feet in the air it has very clear GPS

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,420
signal and it realizes that it's in a region lock zone and enforces the drone

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,800
down on me and there's really no way to get through it until I just let it get

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,160
GPS lock and the other day it almost came down in traffic and I'm sitting

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,600
there trying to abort the abort the landing abort the landing there's a car

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,640
coming and and it I was able to hold it up for a few seconds got the car to pass

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,960
like three feet from the car's roof and then as the car passed it landed then I

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,720
just have to I have to just agree to be safe and then I can send the drone back

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,640
up again but of course you then have to have your device that's connected to the

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,320
controller it has to be on some sort of data connection so it can ping the

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,120
servers that you've been authorized that you've agreed to the terms of use and I

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,520
had my I had my phone in airplane mode because like always whenever I'm doing

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,320
something I'm getting a ton of messages coming into my phone and I didn't want

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,880
them coming in over the over the UI of the drone so I turned my phone into

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,400
airplane mode so I can't I can't out I can't authorize it because part of the

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,680
authorization process is receiving a text message so there I am in the middle

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,360
of the road trying to get my phone out of airplane mode trying to get a text

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,720
message authorizing this drone so I can set it back up in the air out of the

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,120
road it's it's oh god is not annoying is there a way on iOS to get rid of the

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,240
drop-down notifications so they don't overlay on top you know well what I

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,880
realized I did what I should be doing later and I was just being dumb is put

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,360
it in do not disturb mode no but even if you have the do not disturb thing on

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,160
like the switch or whatever it doesn't actually do anything for the on-screen

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,240
notification I oh really well now I'm screwed now I'm I always have mine and

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,800
do not disturb mode always good man good man I have a solution though I'm you

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,560
know what I should do this is the really the the long-term solution here is get a

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,200
drone that doesn't have this control software on it because you know come on

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,720
I mean this is the problem is there's somebody else that's controlling what my

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,320
drone can do if Richard Stallman was here he'd be shaking his head at me he'd

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,880
be very disappointed good no good so look at this project it's a drone built

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,380
with a Raspberry Pi that's capable of streaming live to YouTube now this is

36
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,360
more my speed it's a quadcopter it's a quadcopter and it goes right either the

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,480
Raspberry Pi goes right on the top of it and it works it's legit the camera

38
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,480
could use a gimbal that's for sure I mean it's a work in progress and there

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,600
and then they're live streaming I there's no real like official control

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:47,760
software but they put a LG LTE card in it a SIM card it's got Wi-Fi antenna

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,160
it's got the camera for the right now the Raspberry Pi kit camera it's kind of

42
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:00,320
ingenious so maybe future vlogs will be powered by a Raspberry Pi drone this is

43
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:15,360
Linux unplugged episode 181 for January 24th 2017

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,520
Oh welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show with a host that's

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,680
flying solo this week well that's never really true my name is Chris and I can't

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,120
really be true when I got a virtual lug a packed virtual lug this week coming up

47
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,320
we're gonna talk about some big news that's breaking right now as we go on

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,880
the air that could affect the Unix landscape overall we'll talk about scale

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,560
15x and ubicon there's some really big project updates we're gonna get to this

50
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,640
week including those sly foxes over at Solus adopting flatback what yeah I

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,040
that's what I said when I literally did a war what when I saw the headline come

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,280
across my screen then a certain insider in the Ubuntu Mate project is gonna

53
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,520
leak some of the upcoming details and fanciness that'll be rolling out and

54
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,360
then Kali Linux yeah Kali Linux they're taking it up a notch you know they've

55
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,600
been around for ten years now ten years kind of makes me feel old to be honest

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,080
with you I think I've been using it for ten years anyways they have some big

57
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,520
news on their tenth anniversary that I'll tell you guys about and then we'll

58
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,680
touch a little bit on a future install a future rig build get some input from our

59
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,680
mumble room read some feedback and all of that goodness there's a lot to cover

60
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,000
in today's show mr. West couldn't make it this week he sends his apologies he

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
wanted to be here but there was just I'll just put it as this there was work

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,880
circumstances that came up you guys know how this how this industry goes sometimes

63
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,960
things just come up and you can't get away for the afternoon to podcast so we

64
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,760
we miss you Wes and you're here in spirit well I'll channel you from time

65
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,640
to time West but never fear we have a great team in our virtual log time

66
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,800
appropriate greetings mumble room

67
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,520
right now and you're plugging that doesn't matter you know there's a great

68
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:19,840
back catalog yeah I'll be fair late night Linux there you go there you go

69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,560
you know what's gonna happen is they're gonna listen to that back catalog and

70
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,320
they're all gonna say I miss Laura so I don't really yeah that's a common

71
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,200
message that we hear yeah speaking of late night Linux mr. Ike is here hello

72
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:39,120
Ike it's good to have you here yeah and also returning to the show and I don't

73
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,320
know how I think it's almost been a year mr. Michael Hall hello mr. Hall well I

74
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,200
am looking forward to talking to all of you the course we all have a whole cast

75
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,640
of regulars in there too and so even though Wes isn't here we have a great

76
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,880
crew and everybody will be jumping in as we go along but I I don't like doing the

77
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,880
bad news stuff if we can avoid it so let's do like a quick breaking news kind

78
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,480
of thing yeah this is Linux unplugged breaking news and it's it's unfortunate

79
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,880
when this kind of story comes out but we kind of had a little bit of a sniff of

80
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,680
this story earlier Oracle is laying off more than a thousand employees according

81
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,220
to Mercury News Oracle's laying off approximately 450 employees in its Santa

82
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,600
Clara hardware systems division now that matters because that's the division that

83
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,800
was responsible for spark hardware which it appears to be where the majority of

84
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,680
these layoffs are coming from it looks like cloud is what Oracle cares about

85
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,720
now because software licensing Solaris and whatnot the revenue from that

86
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,320
plummeted by 20% last quarter and at the same time Oracle's hardware revenue also

87
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,840
fell 13% so there's just starting to essentially probably realign the

88
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,760
business with where they're actually making revenue from but it's kind of

89
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,720
sad because I think it's it's probably at least gonna signal a massive slowing

90
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,800
down for solaris at least that's that's my read of this story and that's kind of

91
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,160
why I thought it was worth covering today is because that overall affects the

92
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,520
Unix ecosystem I mean no entire in the entirety it's good it looks like it's

93
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,640
gonna be about 1,800 employees company-wide that will be pink-slipped

94
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,280
whoo there was already a story about this on the software side right like

95
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,880
they were talking about how they're canning the new major version it was

96
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,880
rumor at that point so that's kind of I think more recently though not only was

97
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,440
there the rumor that was like two or three months ago but there was a newer

98
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,880
story to back that oh yeah I was talking about the rumor we covered previously

99
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,360
yeah yeah I know I think there were two stories on the same thing yeah and this

100
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,240
is later yeah this has sort of been it's been there's been smoke signals really

101
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,880
since also pretty strong smoke signals since December it's not surprising

102
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,840
because like as someone who worked with solaris boxes at one point and saw the

103
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,080
transition to Red Hat next 86 I'm not surprised they're gonna have to close up

104
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,480
yeah especially since everyone wants more open infrastructure and they're

105
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,560
offering the most closed proprietary infrastructure it's just becoming more

106
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,320
of a commodity now where you need open infrastructure so this is just not

107
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,240
appealing yeah yeah and when I worked at Sun Microsystems we used to say solaris

108
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,160
for a pro Linux for show yeah I've heard that saying before and that's changing

109
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,960
yeah more now well yeah I mean especially with the lack of dedicated

110
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,080
resources right like I'm sure there are more dedicated resources in the Linux

111
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,840
community now than there are in this hilarious community oh for sure the

112
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,280
community it's not really a community and businesses and software services

113
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,320
around Linux and you know all the all of that when you go to a trade show you see

114
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,880
all of these middleware businesses that are selling Linux based solutions and

115
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,200
they're not none of them are selling anything that runs on solaris that's

116
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,560
that mean what I'm what I'm getting at there is the workloads we're becoming

117
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,440
more and more specific for solaris stations too yeah let's okay so let's

118
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,520
talk about something fun let's talk about something that I'm looking

119
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,440
forward to March 2nd through the 5th coming up at Pasadena convention center

120
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,300
is scale 15x the 15th annual Southern California Linux Expo we went last

121
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,880
year I think we've gone a few years past and I'll probably be going this year too

122
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,960
I'm gonna decide after today's show that's that's my plan and they just like

123
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,240
I believe last year too there will be an Ubicon summit to take place March 2nd

124
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,960
through the 3rd so sort of tucked up right next to scale and it looks like

125
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,140
it's gonna take place also in Pasadena so you just go to this location and you

126
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,120
can attend both events essentially am I getting it right mr. Hull yes actually

127
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,920
we're gonna be using two of the scale conference rooms for those two days

128
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,240
really I think this is such a good way to do it oh yeah we've got several

129
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,080
Ubicons that happen all over the world some of them are standalone some of them

130
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,480
co-host with another big conference like scale and it really helps the logistics

131
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,520
to be able to do that so what do I kind of expect if I'm gonna go to Ubicon is

132
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,080
it something that an Ubuntu desktop user would be interested is it something for

133
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,000
developers administrators who's the target and what should I expect it's a

134
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,960
little bit of both last year we had two tracks one for users and the other one

135
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,760
targeting developers and we're gonna do something similar again this year with a

136
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,600
little bit more workshop kind of sessions on the second day than we had

137
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,920
last year and then in the morning of both days we've got keynotes and

138
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,640
presentations going on that are generally relevant to anybody hmm well

139
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,800
see this feels like if I'm gonna go to scale I should plan to be down there a

140
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,600
few days earlier so that way I could be there for at least at least you know get

141
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,760
down there by the third but maybe even the second hmm I like that and so what

142
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,840
do you what is your overall goal is it to is it to inform community is it to

143
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,240
get more Ubuntu users what is the sort of strategy and why is canonical willing

144
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,920
to spend the resources on it well Ubicons are held by the community so the

145
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,160
Ubicon summit is being organized by the California community we're helping them

146
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,160
with logistics and we help you know as much as we can financially also you know

147
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,760
Michael I think it kind of feels like yeah oh for sure I think it kind of

148
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,840
feels like an official canonical event because last year you know the pretty

149
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,840
big canonical crew is there including mark shuttleworth so it feels like it's

150
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,560
a like in a big Ubuntu official event in a big official canonical event in some

151
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,080
sense but I forget that it's really community driven itself yeah last year

152
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,520
was kind of an oddball out because usually there's not that many people

153
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,200
from canonical being flown into Ubicons what is what is the rumor on on

154
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,680
shallow worth making it to Ubicon this year I don't think he's going to because

155
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,640
it actually overlaps a little bit with mobile world convert conference

156
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,040
happening oh wow yeah and we always have a big presence there and he's at that so

157
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,720
yeah I'm not sure if he's gonna get over I think he might try and get to scale

158
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,400
but I don't think he's gonna make it for Ubicon you know you know who I'd be

159
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,960
going to see would be Martin mr. wimpy down there but wimpy you're not gonna

160
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,240
make it this year either are you I don't think so no it's okay it's okay wimpy

161
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,480
it's all right I was just gonna buy you still I'm still buying Linux fest

162
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,560
Northwest though I think I owe you like a dozen beers so I'll make sure I'll get

163
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,240
I'll get them taken care of at Linux that's even better things mutual so

164
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,560
that's gonna be a fun night oh boy well you know what I tend I this I think this

165
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,300
year I'm gonna park at Linux fest in the parking lot so if we get if we get too

166
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,440
irresponsible we won't have to go very far because we'll just walk back to me

167
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,400
well Michael I'm gonna try it I think I'm gonna try to make it down there I'm

168
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,680
not sure what my whole approach is gonna be this year but I think I'll try to

169
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,720
make it down to Ubicon so how do I sign up do I need to pre-register can you

170
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,120
give me those details so we're still working that out I think we're gonna use

171
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,200
eventbrite for the Ubicon registration itself we just put out a call for papers

172
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,640
for the presentations that happened those two mornings and those are

173
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,420
actually going through the scale CFP system even though scales not taking

174
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,920
talk proposals anymore they still have it open so that people can submit them

175
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,480
for Ubicon you just use the Ubicon tag and they'll send all of those lists over

176
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,240
to Nathan Haynes and Richard Gaskin or the California team organizing all of

177
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,920
this the one thing I think I had some confusion on last year but from the

178
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,760
audience was I think some people thought you sign up for only one or do you have

179
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,920
to sign up for one and then sign up for the other signing up you don't get both

180
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,880
right you have to go you register for scale and then you register for Ubicon

181
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,680
is that what the how the format is gonna work yeah so the book cons

182
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,320
traditionally have been free to come and participate in you haven't had to

183
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,480
register you don't have to pay or anything to get in and what we've worked

184
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,320
out with the scale guys is that people can come into Ubicon without paying to

185
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,800
get into scale but we really encourage people to register to be at scale and to

186
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,280
go to all the scale talks in the conference or the expo floor and

187
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,920
everything because you know it's a huge conference it's totally worth going to

188
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,440
if you're gonna be there already for Ubicon anyway just pay the little bit

189
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,400
extra get into scale also yeah I second that for sure absolutely even if you

190
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,640
just walk the floor for a few minutes and you know say hi to a few people well

191
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,600
that that sounds pretty good yeah and compared compared to other huge shows

192
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,240
you know it's not expensive to get into scale at all what does it cost is it

193
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,880
free or is it it's not much no I want to say it was like $45 or something oh is

194
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,240
it so I always go in as media so I've never actually never had to pay for it

195
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,640
because they let media in for free but I think it's so reasonable that whatever

196
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,120
it is that it's it's I know it depends if you just want to go for the expo

197
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
floor it's kind of cheap it's like 20 bucks okay if you want I think the con

198
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,280
or the this the talks and things it's almost a hundred it's like 80 bucks yeah

199
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,040
and the reason why that kind of makes sense to me is because the talks are

200
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,360
gonna be more focused for people who are there probably because it's their

201
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,360
profession and and they would maybe even get work paying for that kind of but

202
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,520
that's really really cheap compared to other conference yes it's still under a

203
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,280
hundred bucks yeah yeah yeah very much so so pay to go to scale come to ubu con

204
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,040
for free if you're there the first day and I know Chris you weren't sure about

205
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,200
this but if you can get there the first day we've got Carl Rochelle from system

206
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,920
76 giving our keynote oh cool and I have been teased by Ryan that he has some new

207
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,360
announcements to make during that keynote well that is really neat Carl is

208
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,080
a super bright guy and really fascinating speaker so that will be a

209
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,400
really good keynote yeah I think I'm gonna try to make it I think I'm gonna

210
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,360
try to make it maybe I'll see if I can't ping the scale folks and maybe they can

211
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,480
get us a coupon because there are coupons out there floating around for

212
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,120
scale and that was yeah they just ended their special pricing I think that was a

213
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,240
couple days ago hmm but they had that going for and they still have student

214
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,080
discounts 50% off oh nice well mr. mr. Hall is there anything else you want to

215
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,600
add about ubi con before we chug along no just want to reiterate you know if

216
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,760
you want to give a presentation there we've got slots open go to the scale

217
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,800
call for papers and submit that with the ubi con tag we're also gonna have a

218
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,880
snappy workshop happening there that second day so if you want to learn how

219
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,040
to make snaps and go through the walkthrough of that yes I'll be there

220
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,880
hosting it also nice nice nice let's make sure I key attends haha I can't I

221
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:03,960
poke I poke I don't know if I believe that well I think it's gonna be a pretty

222
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,920
good show yeah and if you can make it to both come say hi because I'm gonna try

223
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,480
to make it down there I'm I try to make it down there for the whole thing with

224
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,440
Carl doing the keynote so maybe I'll end up doing some live shows from down there

225
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,600
too and doing a meetup we'll see we'll see I'll get my plans figured out I kind

226
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,440
of feel like this might be the year I fly down instead of drive down so I can

227
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,880
get down there cover it and get back up here quick because they might have

228
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,160
something coming up in the near future which would be a much longer drive and

229
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,360
probably save the wear and tear on the vehicle for that hey before we get into

230
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,800
like some seriously big feedback and some good updates and other things and

231
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,280
also big news for a cyanogen users I wanted to give mention to a project that

232
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,240
recently launched a refreshed website and it was it was really producer Michael

233
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,440
who threw it in my face because I don't I don't generally follow the cinnamon

234
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,440
desktop mod scene I guess you could call it but cinnamon spices which is

235
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,280
cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com has been refreshed and relaunched make it easy to

236
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,120
modify your cinnamon desktop environment you know with things like themes

237
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,000
applets desktop desklets and of course extensions I don't really know if this

238
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,160
is something that appeals to most of you out there but I think it's worth

239
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,960
giving the the guys and gals working on this project to shout for the really

240
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,380
nice work they've done to showcase some of the stuff I mean it's dang it really

241
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,200
makes these themes it really makes this stuff look good so thank you to producer

242
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,240
Michael for throwing that in my face so if you are a cinnamon desktop user you

243
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,680
might want to go check that out I'll have a link to the cinnamon spices site

244
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:40,680
in the show notes lineage OS which was the continuation I suppose of the

245
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,080
cyanogen open source project I guess the cyanogen forked lineage OS we could say

246
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,000
for now have started surfacing we actually have real legit builds now that

247
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,400
will work on Nexus devices like the 6p and 5x now if you're already running

248
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,200
cyanogen mod there's an important note so pay attention to this you need to

249
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,880
first install the experimental ROM which has a big old ugly watermark on it

250
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,680
before you can start installing regular lineage OS builds otherwise lineage OS

251
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,360
is not gonna work at all you're also gonna have to be prepared to get a new

252
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,880
version of the G apps because that'll also require an update but you can get

253
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,000
experimental lineage OS nightly builds now on a bunch of devices but the ones

254
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,720
that jumped out at me where the 6p and 5x is anybody in the anybody in the

255
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:31,600
mumble room a cyanogen user or even an alternative ROM user on Android anybody

256
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,420
using different ones yeah I have it a space for selfish OS no okay so okay so

257
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,200
let's I think both Minnie and William was that who I heard just let's go

258
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,880
someone else okay me okay let's start okay let's start with producer Michael

259
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,880
and then we'll go Minnie so go ahead I used to use cyanogen mod before

260
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,000
cyanogen company was created but that was like my late my late phones I

261
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,760
haven't bothered yeah that's that's that's basically been my sub now Minnie

262
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,240
you said you were using cyanogen currently yeah we have it a space for

263
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,320
selfish OS for the ports for the Nexus 5 oh you have a port for us it's cyanogen

264
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:16,880
11 and 12 and there is one user he's working on cm13 even now and will that

265
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:24,400
eventually become lineage I don't know yeah I'll see now we now we are looking

266
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,840
for cm13 we got the base and we have some little struggles to go but if that

267
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,720
is working why not go further yeah I guess so I think it's I think it's good

268
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,360
that the projects continuing I don't I don't I don't feel good about the future

269
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,080
of the ROM market I feel like it's gonna get more constricted than ever I'm not

270
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,920
saying is dying I don't want to be dramatic about it but it doesn't seem

271
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,680
like it's it's particularly good wimpy are you still rockin Ubuntu touch is

272
00:19:52,680 --> 00:20:02,440
your daily driver no oh done done done no hold on hold on now this we got to

273
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,880
stop the show we got to talk about this what happened tell me what happened I

274
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,560
got a Christmas present the holidays what did you get what did you one plus

275
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,280
3t oh and and it's now running Android it's probably running Cyanogen of a

276
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,480
type isn't it well it runs oxygen OS which is their their version of it yes

277
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,920
but I've set things up a little bit differently this time so I'm using the

278
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:33,440
f-droid store and almost none of the Google services very nice and how do you

279
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,320
like it is a good compared to what do you think compared to Ubuntu touch you

280
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,840
are you kind of glad to be back do you miss some features give me a sense of

281
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,880
that I miss the navigation of Ubuntu touch I think the way that the user

282
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,800
interface is moved around in Ubuntu is light years ahead of anything else it's

283
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,480
similar but different to sailfish so if you like sailfish there's some

284
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,280
similarities but I feel the Ubuntu interactions are more intuitive than

285
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,960
selfish selfish is kind of you have to know yeah that this thing does this

286
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,080
thing where with Ubuntu it's it's much more natural it's curious so I was

287
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,680
obviously using things that were like wraps of web applications on Ubuntu

288
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,880
touch and now I've come back to Android I'm actually using a lot of those rather

289
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,200
than native apps because in many cases now the web application version of

290
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,120
things is far better than the the native app version so for example Facebook is

291
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,320
one example of that yeah and the old reader is another two things that I

292
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,040
well one Facebook is for staying in touch with my family and the old reader

293
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,640
is where I get all my news from I think Facebook the perfect example I feel like

294
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,600
Facebook is safer as a web app than it is to have the Facebook app installed

295
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,360
on Android because yeah you never really know what it's doing and also with the

296
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,200
web app you get access to messaging and all of the other stuff that all separate

297
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,680
apps on Android you know as native native app so you know that's good in my

298
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,120
opinion yeah there's a there's a there's a slight thing where if you have if you

299
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,600
use a browser to do that that it tries to like it detect that you're using a

300
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,360
browser and it says oh you need to install the app but if you use a web app

301
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,640
wrapper it'll break that and make it think that it said not it's it's like a

302
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,560
desktop thing but it'll still show it as a mobile what a pain in the butt

303
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,040
mr. Hall I noticed that you said you kind of agreed that it looks like it

304
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,880
might be a dim future for alternative ROMs did you want to expand on that at

305
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,400
all oh I think you might have gone away yeah yeah I noticed you said you kind

306
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,920
of agreed that it looks like it might be a dim future for alternative ROMs on

307
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:45,520
Android did you want to expand on that a bit I don't think I agreed to that so

308
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,680
you think okay well I will second Martin though I've been on a galaxy s7 for

309
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:58,240
five months or so now and I totally missed the navigation of the phone yeah

310
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,160
that was the Nokia stuff right it's not what that was powered by on the boon to

311
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,880
phone I can't remember the mic was referring to the touch gestures not the

312
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:15,300
oh okay really that's interesting really honestly guys really honestly because I

313
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,880
got to tell you one of my biggest concerns about a boon to touch was that

314
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,760
the gestures were sort of opaque you didn't really you didn't have any idea

315
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,040
they were there so it seemed like it'd be hard to internalize them but that's

316
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,520
not the case no it only took like an hour to really get used to them and

317
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,200
within a week you're so addicted to it that whenever you go back to something

318
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,240
else you instinctively try and do those gestures that's good to hear how about I

319
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,840
guess I'm still I'm not convinced about discovery because you guys are kind of

320
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,280
bad examples because not only are you canonical employees but you're around

321
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,640
other people using a boon to touch and you were there during the UI creation so

322
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,200
if you came into a cold do you still have a sense that it would be

323
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,840
discoverable and usable it just seems so hard to find them I think so I mean the

324
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,040
the tuition the tutorial that runs on you know first startup that explains

325
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,080
what the four directions of movement are oh yeah that's right like 60 seconds to

326
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,720
complete and it basically introduces you to it's a pull down it's a pull up yep

327
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,760
and pulling in from the left and the right and that's the extent of it

328
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,640
completing the same tutorial on sailfish and for anyone that's got sailfish yet

329
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,280
they can maybe back me up to prove I'm not making up their tutorial takes about

330
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,920
five minutes to complete yeah and you can't skip through it you have to you

331
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,880
know do all of the steps yeah there's some Android like that too yeah and I I

332
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,320
always feel lost in sailfish when I want to swipe around it feels like you're

333
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,040
moving through one of these text dungeons you know go south go south by

334
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:55,280
southeast go go west go north and you're not to agree with you I mean I used an

335
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:01,400
N9 Nokia N9 before and the gestures were pretty much the same and on

336
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,920
sailfish you get used as with a boon to touch you get used pretty quick you use

337
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,240
ten minutes and you get used to it all right yeah I've not I've just not I

338
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,920
always feel lost when I use so I've got two selfish friends I've got the

339
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:23,920
original yolo phone and I've got the in tech aquafish yeah three gestures yeah

340
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,640
yeah and as soon as you master three gestures then you know you've got it

341
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,400
that does seem actually that does seem pretty reasonable especially combined

342
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,580
with the tutorial alright so let's let's cap off this conversation with the

343
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:42,560
obligatory web OS mention go ahead Michael go ahead yeah okay so I like

344
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,000
webOS yeah I was a huge fan back in the day their gesture structure was this

345
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,800
very similar to the how I want to touch works except instead of this from a side

346
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,980
interest it was the bottom entrance so like you had the same kind of really

347
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,720
pull the launcher from the side you had to pull the launcher from the bottom you

348
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,520
had the same like swipe away things except in a different direction it's

349
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,480
they're actually very similar so someone who was a webOS person would pretty much

350
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,440
just jump right into a bunch of touch well that's encouraging all right okay

351
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,940
now I want to run it on in my 6p that's that's official that's official hey

352
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,920
let's let's stop talking about mobile but before we go too much for the let's

353
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,480
talk about ting this seems like a great time to mention it well here's how you

354
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,220
get started with ting you go to the linux.ting.com linux.ting.com will get

355
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:33,680
you $25 off a device or $25 in service credit and think about this $25 in

356
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,480
service credit might pay for more than your first month because average ting

357
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,440
bill $23 after all you're sitting done here's how it works no contract nor

358
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,320
the termination fee and you only pay for what you use minutes messages megabytes

359
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,600
you pay for what you use linux.ting.com I love this system I was just talking

360
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,580
about in the pre-show how I have a couple of different my fives one on

361
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:59,360
ting's GSM network one on ting CDMA network and I use apps like open signal

362
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,480
to determine which one's gonna be stronger in whichever area I'm taking

363
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,600
the RV and that's the my fi I choose to use it's six dollars a month for the

364
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,260
line and if I don't use any data on that my fight for a month I'm paying six

365
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,560
dollars I could also just go in the control panel and turn it off it's

366
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,720
amazing it's great for when you're traveling it's great if you're an IT

367
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,320
worker and you need to have connectivity at a moment's notice and you want to

368
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,320
have two networks to choose from I love this functionality of course you can get

369
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,000
a phone that's on either network to doesn't really I mean I'm talking about

370
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,760
my files but you could use it as a phone I've got three phones on the ting

371
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,560
network and I think it's a fantastic service usually and if I'm not using

372
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,040
like my my advice a bunch which I use actually just lightly this weekend it's

373
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,280
it's so fantastic because I think maybe even with the holidays the phone bills

374
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,400
gonna be like around 45 bucks this month three lines when I'm at work and I'm at

375
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,520
home I'm using Wi-Fi all the time and so I might be making a few extra calls for

376
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,120
the holidays you on the average my phone bills around 35 dollars a month for all

377
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,160
three lines so it really averages out to be it's just an unbelievable price you

378
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,200
can get a little idea by going over to Ting's website and see kind of what it

379
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,120
would cost for you it's a really nice service because I also back it with

380
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,840
fantastic customer service an awesome control panel an active blog full of

381
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,600
good information tons of devices including ones you can just bring

382
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,240
yourself like one from the play store just hint hint nudge nudge check them

383
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,200
out linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the unplugged

384
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:35,120
program and a happy customer for a long time now linux.ting.com this is an

385
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,280
interesting post and I just will touch on it really quickly I don't think we

386
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,200
have to have a lot of conversation about it excuse me Chrome 56 is going to

387
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,760
aggressively throttle background tabs hallelujah this is just kind of all you

388
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,920
really need to really know but they can they're coming up with like a timer and

389
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,600
a budget system and each tab and is gonna get a timer and then it's gonna

390
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,680
get a budget and the budget regenerates with a certain amount of activity and

391
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,400
all this it's they got a very very Google sophisticated system and they're

392
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,560
talking about how it'll affect applications like slack and discord or

393
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:13,560
bit mix or a Bitcoin trading site and there could be some major effects so you

394
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,720
might want to go check it out if you are heavily dependent on one of those

395
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,320
applications or a developer on one of those projects because it's gonna be big

396
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,920
eventually Chrome 56 is gonna be a big deal but it probably will help a lot of

397
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:30,220
us with like two core laptops on battery and you're running Chrome this is

398
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,520
probably gonna make life a lot better for you yeah all that budget gets

399
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,560
submitted to Google that is an interesting thought Altera wouldn't it

400
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,800
be in wouldn't that be a fascinating because they you know they do ask if you

401
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:49,280
want to opt into like diagnostics and air reporting I wonder if that time

402
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,560
budget and things like that would be diagnostic data

403
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,560
whoo that sense chills down my spine I mean for the first release I'm sure it

404
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,160
probably will be right because it's not gonna be a perfect system right away the

405
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,480
amount of data that gives googs about the what I mean it makes Google

406
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,360
Analytics look like child's play that is a that is a striking thought but not

407
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,180
just what sites you go to but how you engage with them how actively you engage

408
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,440
with them how long they said idle on your website they could tell you we can

409
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,560
go ahead we can just we can see if it's total if it's going to be in chromium

410
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,800
and Chrome or just in Chrome whether they're gonna be collecting data or not

411
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,400
yeah hmm that's a well we'll see we'll see where that goes maybe none of that's

412
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,600
gonna happen too so I want to talk about some feedback that I've gotten on

413
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,200
Sunday's Linux action show and I shouldn't really cross the streams like

414
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,560
this but I kind of want to take advantage of the mumble room so this

415
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,680
seems like the perfect opportunity I've been considering building something that

416
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,240
I'm gonna just called because we all understand what I say when I mean this

417
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,000
when I read what I mean when I say this I'm just gonna say it's like a

418
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,680
bulletproof Linux installation something that isn't like a fun Linux installation

419
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,600
isn't isn't like something I'm gonna run on all my systems but one of my

420
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,280
workstations maybe two would be set up in a way that is it's meant to be like a

421
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:16,480
five-year installation with absolute minimum failure maybe with a I would

422
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,200
love to say even a tolerance of one failure failure a year so that probably

423
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,240
includes maybe a hard a hard drive mirror maybe it also includes a UPS

424
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,840
power so there's some physical aspects of this too but right now what I wanted

425
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,120
to focus on because it's more germane to our show would be the Linux

426
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,000
configuration that would actually make this possible and I've been I've been

427
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,800
toying with the idea of installing solace as the base operating system and

428
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,200
relying on the fine folks over at solace to package up some of the core desktop

429
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:56,200
applications that I want like no pressure I key yeah like Telegram like

430
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:03,440
Google Chrome you know those types of the general desktop environment hoping

431
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,160
and maybe it maybe I should wait till after budget 11 but hoping that there

432
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,000
would be sort of a a consistency and stability there and then a lot of the

433
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,720
more esoteric applications many of which being web-based like sab NZB couch

434
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,520
potato sonar those would run in containers like Docker containers and

435
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,400
other other applications that maybe I would just sort of concoct one day and

436
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,420
maybe I would also sort of also supplement this with an arch virtual

437
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,480
machine that has access to the AUR or something for command line or maybe even

438
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,880
graphical applications so I've been this has been something that I've been

439
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,040
kicking around but I think mangas is how I'm gonna say it three days ago on a one

440
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,120
day ago in the Linux action show sub wrote it subreddit wrote I have the

441
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,080
feeling that container ization is not the solution for you Chris last I think

442
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,360
that you have to accept the three M's that Noah pointed out in last you go a

443
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,400
boon to LTS and you really should use something like snap packages also set up

444
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,720
a clone and whatnot but he he argues that because predominantly what I'm

445
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,560
going to want on this machine is of is a wide selection of desktop applications I

446
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:18,560
should probably go with an LTS snap flat pack approach for the container and

447
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,240
container izing contain the specific applications and use a boon to LTS for

448
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,400
the base operating system and just go something with much more generic and

449
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,520
maybe says yeah I could go fancy with CFS or something like that but and this

450
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,200
has been sort of a common thread that's come in is don't go as far as

451
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,040
container ization just go a boon to LTS or a you know maybe it's a bit of a tail

452
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:44,200
test or whatever it is but you go with a tried-and-true Ubuntu install and you

453
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,280
don't you skip the Docker container ization and you go with snaps and flat

454
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:54,240
packs and when I every time I look at this idea which doesn't seem to be too

455
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,880
too insane that kind of kind of look at and go why why does this not appeal to me because it

456
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,480
feels like the path of least resistance I could get a 1604 based install in 15

457
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,800
minutes I could go get a few snap packages 10 minutes after that and I may

458
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,560
theoretically be pretty close to done at that point I'm sure there's a few things

459
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,720
I still have to work out so it does have definitely has the appeal of being the

460
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,160
path of less resistance but with what I what I feel like it I feel like it's not

461
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:31,320
really ready yet like it seems like it's the easy path but in reality I love snap

462
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,600
packages I love everything getting snapped up but some of the things I want

463
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,660
don't get updated as frequently as I want because they're not being the

464
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,400
package itself is not being maintained upstream it's being maintained by a

465
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,080
volunteer some applications I want may may not be available things like steam

466
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,120
compatibility are still a big a big priority for me and making steam work

467
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,240
really easily and not break is a big priority for me and I don't really see

468
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,120
like a flat pack snap solution to that specifically either it feels like to me

469
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:02,360
if I'm building a five-year system today in terms of application availability

470
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:07,120
docker probably blows away just about every linux distros repo out there in

471
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,120
terms of current modern applications being developed that I would want to try

472
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,920
to talk about in reviews and whatnot docker is a massive distribution

473
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,440
platform already I would argue larger than snap packages and so if you were

474
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,880
building a system for today it actually seems like docker would be the one to

475
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,720
use today and then in five years put your head up and go okay all right all

476
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,720
right so let's take a look around where how what's gotten snapped up what's

477
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,240
gotten flat packed and when it's time to rebuild that would be the time to

478
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,720
evaluate that so I I've been getting a lot of that feedback and I've been

479
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,600
reflecting on I think I actually think the snaps and flat packs would be more

480
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,600
down the road should I pause here does anybody want to jump into the mumble room

481
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:53,560
before I continue on my question was is there a possibility to use LXC LXD

482
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:59,480
containers for GUI applications I mean I'm not really you know I I'm not

483
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,880
really sold on any particular containerization or necessarily even

484
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,840
containerization over virtualization or even a fancy cheroot really to be honest

485
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,080
I don't really have any strong leaning my one preference towards docker would

486
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:18,680
be it's pretty simple to set up on solace and it's got a huge application

487
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,160
availability on docker hub and there was actually some subset of those

488
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,520
applications up on docker hub that are being properly maintained by projects

489
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,920
that really care and you can you can suss that out eventually and there

490
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,280
there's still enough of those that it's a pretty wide set of applications to pick

491
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:43,360
from so kind of leaning docker that reason okay I wanted to so let's talk about let's

492
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:48,520
let's take all of this conversation and let's shift over to solace they

493
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,640
announced this week that they're adopting flat packs they've also they've

494
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,880
also been an update recently about some big changes coming in q1 to the to the

495
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,400
desktop including including something called why was it here don't have it

496
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,600
here bulletproofing we're gonna talk about all of this we're really gonna

497
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,040
talk let's talk about this so let's take a moment if we're talking about

498
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,200
containers we're talking about virtualization and you want to know more

499
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,140
go to Linux Academy Linux Academy comm slash unplug sign up take advantage of a

500
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,600
seven-day free trial support the show and learn more about all of these

501
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,400
technologies they have really dedicated professionals that follow this stuff

502
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,000
like legit people in the industry that have come to Linux Academy now we're

503
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,520
working with them consulting with them they have full-time instructors I think

504
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,400
this is where you get the knowledge directly from the people that know

505
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,960
what's up and I love it because the people behind the company started

506
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,480
because they're Linux enthusiasts and somebody who runs their company because

507
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,760
they water a Linux and started my company because I'm a Linux enthusiast

508
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,880
yeah I really dig that and it really kind of is the perfect essence behind

509
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,000
what they're all going for Linux Academy comm slash unplug that's where you go

510
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,600
find out about their self-paced in-depth video courses and just about every Linux

511
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,000
topic out there they got labs to give you hands-on real-world experience you

512
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,600
build the confidence you need when you go do the job which I've learned makes

513
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,480
all the difference instructor mentoring when you do need it a community that's

514
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,160
stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members courses specifically for cert

515
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,160
training if that's where you're going and course schedulers for those of us

516
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,920
that are cray cray busy and you need to have something custom built out for you

517
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,160
to match that schedule Linux Academy comm slash unplug they also have public

518
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,660
profiles if you need to let management know what you've been doing that's been

519
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,480
really nice for me in the past when I had I what I used to do is I had these

520
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,120
little systems these little papers that I would track my stuff in in a

521
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,240
spreadsheet and I would hand it in because I would go to community

522
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,520
colleges to get my course updating to get my training updating that work

523
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,360
thankfully paid for but you know with a public profile like this such a genius

524
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,320
system makes it work so it's just all automated plus if you're you know talking

525
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,200
to a client or looking for a gig very useful there too Linux Academy comm

526
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,920
slash unplugged whoo go there to support the show sign up for a seven-day free

527
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,000
trial and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged

528
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,520
program so I don't really know where to start Aiki because I am so excited about

529
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,180
all of this but I feel like let's start with flat packs and then I'd like to

530
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,240
talk about some of the other stuff you guys are doing sort of in q1 so what the

531
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,680
hell flat packs what this is this is huge because I thought we had this big

532
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,680
discussion on this show about how you weren't really a big fan of snaps or

533
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,760
flat packs you wanted to you wanted to be in control of the software that gets

534
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,000
bundled for your district what's what's changed in that respect actually nothing

535
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,880
so remember the most of the people are having this discussion based on

536
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,960
universal apps the problem that we have in solace as you've probably seen

537
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,120
yourself is we have a very very weird mechanism for deploying third-party

538
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,600
software like Google Chrome mm-hmm mm-hmm and it just doesn't work very well I

539
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,400
mean it's flaky I'm a big challenge are you mentioned a couple times in your

540
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,040
post the Google the Google Chrome problem solving the Chrome problem the

541
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,680
only thing I really if from my experience was I went to a third-party

542
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,240
section and it seemed like it took a significantly long time to install Chrome

543
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,800
I could I had the sense something was going on behind the scenes but I don't

544
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,200
really understand what is the Chrome problem okay so I mean you're not

545
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,680
allowed to distribute Chrome full stop only Google can do that which you know I

546
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,480
mean that's fair enough so the way that we get around that is behind the scenes

547
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,000
it's actually downloading the Devon repackaging it is an EO package then

548
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,040
installing that locally but I mean to do things like that I mean there's things

549
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,520
like exit compression involved and all this stuff which is why it takes

550
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,000
horrifically long amount of it's not viable there is no update mechanism for

551
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,640
it so we had to reevaluate it because at the end of the day anyone's personal

552
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,400
views aside it's leading to a poor user experience so one of the developments I

553
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,600
saw recently in Flatpak I say recently recently ish is it can it supports

554
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:58,880
downloading extra files at installation time now the first place I saw this was

555
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,840
over on Endless how to dig around there and I could install Chrome straight from

556
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:13,880
the software center so the more I dug into it it turns out that they're making

557
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,080
use of the same thing that I'm gonna be making use of and it's essentially still

558
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,840
pulling the debt but it's doing it in a way that's efficient quick supports

559
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,040
updates and it's transparently integrated and in the end I mean I put

560
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,360
the poll up on Google Plus but that itself wasn't a deciding factor but it

561
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:36,160
was definitely one of the things that enabled it as an option for me so the

562
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,320
other thing that probably comes to most people's mind is why say snaps why not

563
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,800
say snaps or app image or one of the other competitors oh well I mean app

564
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,120
images again it's the same distribution problem so it's immediately out I mean

565
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,360
an app image contains a file system which means it would contain Google

566
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:58,000
Chrome so it's in the out of the races mm-hmm and then again it's you know it's

567
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,600
now but snaps include snaps do have the ability to pull files down and sort of

568
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,280
essentially work around that problem right and don't get me wrong there was

569
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,720
there's a lot of hype and love around snap but it may if I'm gonna integrate

570
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,720
something into solos it's got to be done properly it's got to be done fully so we

571
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,560
don't have app armor and solos now you can yes you can run snaps without app

572
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,800
armor but again they don't get properly and I exactly a sandwich fully and

573
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,200
properly you've got a enable app armor now that's an obstacle in terms of

574
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,400
integration so there was a lazy aspect to it because it would be there's a

575
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,520
large integration challenge or something like snap but the main thing that

576
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,840
actually won me over in the end I mean everything else aside integration

577
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,000
problems distribution all that side of it was being engaged on a technical

578
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,200
level consistently by the flat back camp and every time I brought this up online

579
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,000
every time I've ranted about it discussed it bitched about it whatever

580
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,840
that fact has always remained true they've always engaged with me now fair

581
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,720
play it to snaps as well because Michael Hall actually contacted me offline after

582
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,160
and you know I've got a lot of respect for that but I was being engaged on a

583
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,720
technical level consistently by the flat back team and they've always answered my

584
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,640
responses and it's more aligned with what works in solos and for me it's kind

585
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,720
of what won in the end I had to be on technical merit only it couldn't be on

586
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,840
the hype it couldn't be around marketability and the universal apps part

587
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,960
of it at this point in time is currently not interesting to me I'm talking about

588
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,440
distributing some third-party applications now does this also solve any

589
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,040
problems around packaging steam for solace so what we're doing with steam at

590
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,680
the moment I mean at the moment we have this steam runtime compatibility if you

591
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,880
like within our repos works really well now but give it a couple of years

592
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,120
something like that would eventually fall apart at the seams because you know

593
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,840
they're gonna be using older have a an ABI problem so large you wouldn't be

594
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,400
able to solve it anymore so while it works for now it's not a long-term

595
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,520
solution match you spoke about this on late night Lennox last night I know

596
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:21,400
plug so so so so but yeah I mean it's kind of soulless only which is kind of

597
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,120
not fair so what I've done is I proposed to

598
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,240
upstream I opened up a github issue and it'll basically like here's the cards on

599
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,720
the table I would like to take everything we've learned about building

600
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,780
the same runtime because we're actually pretty good at that and offer one in the

601
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,840
form of a flat pack runtime which is optimized which has all the things that

602
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,040
we want then anyone flat back would be able to use it on any distro not just

603
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,640
solace so it makes it a lot easier than for distributions to have steam because

604
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,520
they're kind of hmm an omen an hour in about the whole lib 32 crap it would be

605
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,440
a lot easier for them they don't need to have like a 32-bit driver so this would

606
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,240
be though kind of all back-end plumbing right if I'm if I'm a user of solace I

607
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,680
would just basically hit an install button in the oh yeah definitely yeah

608
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,760
you don't want to complicate it it's got to be natively what it mean though as a

609
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,760
solace user I could run other flat packs that I found yes so the one thing I

610
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,800
didn't want to do is say like this is only for third-party and that's all

611
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,760
you're gonna use it for yeah if we're gonna do it we're gonna do it properly

612
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,080
yeah and that again that was the thing when was looking to snap it would have

613
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,800
been hard to integrate that properly into solace for a flat pack it's very

614
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,440
very simple for us to integrate producer Michael you had a question about can or

615
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,120
sandboxing yeah same as in categorization whatever the flat packs

616
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,840
originally we're doing via Wayland so how did they approach the issue this

617
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:51,880
like if they have it right now sorry I didn't quite get I don't know if they're

618
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,200
I actually just saw a blog post about this I think this is sort of in the work

619
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,280
still isn't it I didn't I didn't read the post yet I had tagged it for reading

620
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:05,280
but I haven't if one of the issues of is is app app armor is not available to be

621
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,920
to install and solace but the flat pack is covering this issue for security but

622
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,840
last time I checked they they don't have sandboxing for that yeah oh they do have

623
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,400
a sandboxing mechanism in place it's called bubble wrap and it effectively

624
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,480
creates a kernel level it's effectively a container you know okay to avoid they

625
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,720
don't call it a container because it has all the connotations of Docker and

626
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,200
things like that but effectively it's like a it's a kernel level namespace and

627
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,640
container containerization yeah and then you have there's a there's basically a

628
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,240
debossed proxy that sits in the middle that filters all out the cold you've got

629
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,560
a sec comp which is involved as well so we can actually filter system calls

630
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,680
going through so in terms of integrating into solace I had to update lib sec comp

631
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:54,200
and I made one patch which has now been merged upstream already and that was to

632
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,360
actually support a stateless configuration in solace so it was very

633
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,960
very easy to integrate for a Google Chrome itself we wouldn't be sandboxing

634
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,120
it here's the difference so we'd still be using the native file system stuff

635
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:10,640
there it's just effectively a way to distribute and update it so the

636
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,000
sandboxing for that part isn't important but for future and applications that are

637
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,680
being distributed as these things start to get more popular obviously we do want

638
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:25,560
that fully integrated that makes sense so I want how will I see this and when

639
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,000
will I see this as a solace user is my am I gonna be waiting for a while oh no

640
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,280
no no no no that wouldn't be fair at all so at the moment we are doing a very

641
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,120
very large stack upgrade we're going from normal 3.20 to norm 3.22 you will

642
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,320
see me ranting and raving about it on Google Plus at the moment I'm not in a

643
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,760
good mood with some parts of it but anyway so while we're doing that we also

644
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,840
try and bring up some of the reverse dependency so flat back has already gone

645
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,560
in there at the moment okay that's part of the next update series that will go

646
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:01,600
into the main repos but it's gonna be a colossal update like when I got as far

647
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,520
as packaging I think it was Nautilus which was the first gnome app that I'd

648
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:12,960
updated there was already 200 updates to solace by that time yeah so it's I'll be

649
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,400
nice I'm gonna issue some Delta updates as well but yeah so the next set of

650
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,960
updates that will all come through flat pack is already in the repos and

651
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,440
enabled now we just need to plummet into the software center to make it all work

652
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,320
nicely so that's that's kind of huge that's kind of a huge thing and you

653
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:32,840
talked about something else in a recent post talking about budgie 11 and you

654
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,100
talked about bulletproofing I think was the verbiage was like bulletproofing the

655
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:43,040
upgrade process yeah bulletproof boot is what it is oh yeah that was the name I

656
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:50,600
gave it so the kernel update mechanism in solace isn't great effectively you're

657
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,040
having the carpet ripped out from under your feet every time you read every time

658
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,880
you upgrade now there is a variety ways to do it in some different distributions

659
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,840
and that usually involves having a meta package which will then depend on a new

660
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,520
package that comes in and then you end up with multiple parallel kernels

661
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,960
installed the way that I'm doing it I'm actually adopting something that I

662
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,920
developed at work which is clear boot manager from clear Linux which is an

663
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,280
Intel project what I'm doing is make adapting that to actually support solace

664
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,720
fully and more importantly be generic enough that would work for over

665
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:29,520
distributions so the way that this effectively works is you take the

666
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,600
control of the kernel away from the package manager now that's probably

667
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,600
gonna sound a little bit weird mm-hmm so if you upgrade a package on your disk it

668
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,100
takes away any files are left there the difference is with this approach you

669
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:46,040
have this package once you upgrade it leaves the old files on the disk they

670
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:51,160
are no longer within its domain then clear boot manager is fired up the first

671
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,480
thing that does is make sure that the new your running kernel has to stay

672
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,640
there that's like rule one it has to stay that you're not allowed to remove

673
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,720
the running kernel this is a very bad thing to do it will then install the

674
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,960
latest kernel and the last running kernel so when it goes to install them

675
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,840
also make sure they're repaired so they're fully present on the disk if

676
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,880
anything's happened to them it will actually repair them and fully restore

677
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,320
the EFI system how does it accomplish this through the code that I wrote

678
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,120
basically I mean it's like pulling code down and patch like what it what's

679
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,520
happening no no no so like if you upgraded now like in solace you'll be

680
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,800
automatically shipped to this new package it's called Linux LTS and that

681
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:34,720
will be on the 4.9 branch so when you update the old files stay there and so

682
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,560
are the new files they're specifically namespaced versions with release

683
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,680
everything is encoded in the name of these files so when you upgrade it

684
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,240
automatically knows which one is the next new kernel because we'll have a

685
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,440
symlink which is default LTS shipped as part of the packaging so it knows who

686
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,880
the new guy is when it looked at the you name output that is also encoded to

687
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,800
carry the version release and type information of a kernel so it knows

688
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,840
which one needs to stay which one needs to be repaired and which ones need to be

689
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,940
garbage collected and so this is how it's able to this is how the package

690
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,800
managers able to just not even worry about it and it's able to exactly that's

691
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,200
really so the package manager it comes along so say we went from 4.9 point 4 it

692
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,400
then deposits all the 4.9 point 5 files on there the difference is now that

693
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,920
default LTS link is changed from the old 4.9 point 4 to the 4.9 point 5 one and it

694
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,520
doesn't have to be a version update it can just literally be like bumping a

695
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,480
release to fix something your current kernel will stay on there the one you

696
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,620
booted before will stay on there because we run a systemd unit at boot and once

697
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:40,120
it's got past the multi user target it records that information to a file so it

698
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,240
knows that that kernel successfully boots anything that doesn't meet those

699
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,640
parameters is then garbage collected from the disk including the initial RAM

700
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,640
disks which are now shipped as part of the package instead of being generated

701
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,800
at install time which is risky so everything is now pre-shipped ready to

702
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,000
go so you're never gonna have a situation where you upgrade and kernel

703
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,920
modules go missing and things disappear and you can't roll back so does this

704
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,320
clear root manager land install list as as well I mean at the same time that

705
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:12,720
Linux 4.9 does so I'm actually on the 4.9 now but yeah they will come

706
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,240
together so basically you'll have one last derpy upgrade which is going from

707
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,720
the 4.8 stuff because that part of it is unavoidable because it was broken to

708
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,680
start with once that's happened should be upgraded to the 4.9 and from then on

709
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,980
you can just keep upgrading and if there is ever a problem you can just roll back

710
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:33,240
to the old kernel now the difference between this approach and you know the

711
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,920
typical pseudo update grub kind of crap you have to record bits of those

712
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,320
information around for it to keep working properly so if you've ever had

713
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,440
encrypted installs you've got to keep hold of like the resume parameter

714
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,480
parameters the locks uuid parameters the root equals all of that stuff and it's

715
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,800
even harder for UEFI clever manager is is picking up all this information

716
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,600
automatically and recording it so it's entirely stateless it can completely

717
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:02,560
restore a boot partition for you so I put a video up on my Google Plus if you

718
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,600
want to go and have a look at it okay I basically RM RF everything on my ESP

719
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,640
which is something you probably shouldn't do but then just to kind of

720
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,440
demonstrate the confidence in that I ran the command and BAM my ESP was

721
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,240
restored including the bootloader itself because it manages the updates

722
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,680
that as well I will have a link to iQIYI's G plus page in the show notes as

723
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,480
well as to the clear boot manager that's that's a pretty nice upgrade that'll be

724
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,760
that that does sound like if it's everything works as intended that it

725
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,360
should make that update process much more bulletproof that's kind of going

726
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,000
for that's what I'm going for yeah I mean it's been used in clear Linux now

727
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,040
for a long time obviously here I'm not speaking on behalf of Intel while I'm

728
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,920
here now I'm speaking on behalf of Solus but it's a project I work on at work and

729
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,560
we've been using it there for a long time and it does work it's you know it's

730
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:55,040
field proven if you like and the the original thing that basically bugged me

731
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,960
was dual booting on an EFI system partition nobody really does that nicely

732
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,680
I mean if you look at some systems you'll get like a slash init RD zero dot

733
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,520
image and things like this who does it belong to you know where's the domain

734
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,120
ownership and then you have these subfolders it's kind of nasty so I

735
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:18,560
wanted to basically implement standards and have a way that things can cohabit

736
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:24,800
peacefully on an ESP without conflicting so the Solus kernel now is like a con

737
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,720
dot Solus project and then it'll have like the version everything coded into

738
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,000
the file names so you don't have to worry about things conflicting or

739
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,280
fighting over the ESP so I'm also making it very agnostic so if anyone else does

740
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,520
want to integrate it into their projects they're more than welcome to and so does

741
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,200
this make it possible to say run multiple branches of the kernel so say

742
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,160
if I wanted to have yes yeah yeah I mean that was one of the motivations

743
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,560
because in Solus there is a kernel package it's just called kernel like

744
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,940
you're kind of limited on new choices there which is kind of sucky because we

745
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:01,040
have to run the kernel that's gonna be safe for everyone but sometimes there's

746
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,200
hardware enablement differences or we need experience with that new branch of

747
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,240
the kernel before it becomes a new kernel so this one is becoming the Linux

748
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,400
LTS kernel so you'll upgrade and that's what you're going to okay it that'll be

749
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,560
handled automatically then the default on the LTS yeah just to make sure

750
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,840
everyone's safe you're you're gonna go to the LTS branch and then that's where

751
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,200
you're gonna be by default are you tracking Greg cage is that where the LTS

752
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,640
moniker comes from or yeah basically so that would be the 4.9 branch for now and

753
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,680
once 4.10 is stable then we can start like a Linux mainline package to kind

754
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,400
of you know have a bit of symmetry between holes and kernel dot org just so

755
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:42,200
you know where you stand I like that a lot I think that's a good idea well okay

756
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,760
well that's a hell of that's a hell of a lot of awesome stuff that's making me

757
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,160
really want to continue to use solace so that's good that's yeah there's a lot of

758
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,720
things that are coming we've just started up budget desktop to org as well

759
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,480
you know we say I do want to talk about a little bit about budget if we could

760
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,480
yeah I mean you know yourself I mean budget Evans kind of achieved a meme

761
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,480
status by now yeah you know like after budget 11 this thing and that but it's

762
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,400
actually nine now now I'm nervous because I'm like I feel like things are

763
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,880
just getting stable for me and then my desktops gonna get swat just pulled

764
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,120
right out from underneath me and no no budget is going nowhere I mean you have

765
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,280
my full assurances now so I'm worried about big changes it sounds like 11 is a

766
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,440
pretty big rewrite well the thing is well I'm gonna be explaining more of this

767
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:32,800
in the blog post later there's I don't want to spill the beans but it will be a

768
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,680
significant blog post but effectively it's we're taking measures that will

769
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,240
limit our creative freedom which will make budget a lot better because we've

770
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,960
got some long-standing bugs that we just haven't been able to fix so those will

771
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,440
be coming and cue boy oh boy it's big stuff but yeah sounds like all of this

772
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,880
is basically focused on one singular topic it's about giving users the

773
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,320
experience they deserve right now with budget we are not there you know we are

774
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,840
not there there are some annoyances some bugs that are there and the user

775
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:06,360
shouldn't have to put up with this shit so that's what all of this quarter is

776
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,800
about it's getting everything in place so the users can actually have that

777
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,200
experience that they deserve from their computer that they bought that computer

778
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:16,160
you know they shouldn't have to suffer these stupid bugs so we will have that

779
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:21,400
up there and it's going fully fully distro agnostic like it's up on its own

780
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,120
namespace and get hope has its own domain it has its own blog so it's gonna

781
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:31,400
be very some people you know are gonna be how people are when they see

782
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,280
something about new stuff and this is how we do things but it's believe me

783
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,240
it's for the best I will say I say from the blog post keep an open mind and

784
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,160
we'll wait for updates maybe you come back you tell us a little bit about it

785
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:49,960
don't care all right well I want to also I've never installed oh hey I'm

786
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,680
doing a show excuse me I wanted to also mention some big updates that are coming

787
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,540
to our friends over at Ubuntu Mate as well as Kali which I am super super

788
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:02,040
excited about so we should keep moving so we can make room for tech snap you

789
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:06,280
know I would be a miss if I didn't mention DigitalOcean that's the secret

790
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:11,000
sauce guys that's the secret sauce it's a super simple straightforward cloud

791
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,760
hosting provider that'll get you up and going in no time if you're a one-man

792
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,200
team up to a multi-million dollar company DigitalOcean is gonna work

793
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,840
great for you because it's it's super intuitive it's super reliable super fast

794
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:30,440
I'm trying to think of another super super SSDs I'm losing it I got I don't got

795
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,280
any more supers but it is a great service and it deserves all the supers I

796
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,640
can come up with they've paired an amazing user interface that really is

797
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,120
accomplished it accomplishes it's simple to use while also being very advanced

798
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,400
and letting people that know what the heck they're doing just to go at it like

799
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,440
I'm automatically attaching your SSH keys spinning up multiple VMs from

800
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:53,040
templates snapshots and backups but the best part is all of its exposed by a

801
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,600
very simple straightforward gotta love it API and you know my day-to-day usage

802
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,800
I talk about the UI so much because I was born in the fire of a time when

803
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,720
virtual machine management only ran under Windows and it was the worst

804
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:12,580
slowest MMC UI knockoff you'd ever seen so now in 2017 to sit here and look at

805
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,960
this DigitalOcean interface it just blows me away so that's what I always

806
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,640
focus on but the reality is their API is really where it's at on it as a daily

807
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,120
driver of DigitalOcean for spinning things up and down for our

808
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:27,360
infrastructure all day long up and down up and down all day long I'm using the

809
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,440
API I'm using bot commands that trigger the API to be honest that's how I'm

810
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,540
doing it and it makes it so easy to integrate DigitalOcean infrastructure

811
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:41,120
that's in San Francisco for me and in New York and it's just like one single

812
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,560
bot command and in the background these systems spin up online these sites go

813
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:50,000
active these streams turn up it is so incredible making multiple systems is a

814
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,200
snap as well you can do it from a snapshot but it is super simple and the

815
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,880
other thing that's really nice is not only can you transfer droplets to other

816
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,080
folks so say you're gonna build something for a client or for a friend

817
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:05,480
or a family member etc etc it also is really great working with teams for your

818
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,000
personal you say you want to do a mumble server a Minecraft server an IRC server

819
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,720
a sync thing bit torrent sync all of that they have 40 gigabit connections

820
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,000

so there has been a massive leak Edward Snowden size leak about the progress on

825
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,480
Ubuntu Mate there's an insider I'm not familiar with this person I think his

826
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,280
name is Martin I'm not sure who he is but Wimpy is here to help us make sense

827
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,640
of all of this so Wimpy there's some really nice things coming down the road

828
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:55,720
and there's also some stuff that we talked about previously on the show from

829
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,480
Ikey Brisk in there so where do you want to start with the update for the Mate

830
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:04,760
project okay well let's start with Brisk we've just heard from Ikey I don't know

831
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,280
if you noticed he's quite a clever chap isn't he lots of technical detail there

832
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,800
that said he does need help from an older wiser gentleman with bitwise

833
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:21,000
operators from time to time but aside from that he's a smart cookie yeah so

834
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,760
let's start with Brisk because there's there's some news there that I've not

835
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,800
announced that dovetails with that Ikey released Brisk menu 0.3.0

836
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:36,160
yesterday evening and that's being developed as a an efficient menu for the

837
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:42,760
Mate desktop and we created a PPA for Ubuntu for that so if you're running

838
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:49,080
16.10 or 17.04 you were able to get 0.2.0 release and that PPA is now up to

839
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:53,840
date with the 0.3.0 release so if you're already using that PPA you'd

840
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:58,080
have got your updates today and there's a bunch of bug fixes for Brisk in there

841
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:03,840
and that's cooking along nicely I've gone through Ikey's issue tracker and

842
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:08,000
sort of highlighted the bits that I'm interested in seeing and Ubuntu Mate

843
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,720
we're in our second month now Ikey we're up into the crowdfunding from

844
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:17,480
Ubuntu Mate some of that money's being funneled into Solus so that Ikey can

845
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:23,560
work on Brisk for the Mate desktop as a whole which is really cool to see that

846
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:29,000
is cross distro collaboration yes and I also heard that mr. producer Michael

847
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,160
there in the in the mobile room was involved in updating high DPI and low DPI

848
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:40,960
for what what icon themes I think it was that's right yeah so yeah Michael in the

849
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:48,040
chat room here producer Michael he retouched all of the assets in the not

850
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:53,760
the icon theme but the the GTK theme itself so things like sliders switches

851
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,920
radio buttons and all of that sort of thing and all of the outlines for those

852
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,760
in the shading they've all been retouched so that there are two versions

853
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:06,800
there's a low DPI and a high DPI version available for those now yes so that's

854
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:11,560
all good stuff and yet he was another fund that was another funded contribution

855
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:18,960
in the same way that the work from Daniel for a elementary he he contacted

856
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,920
me just before the Christmas holidays and he was saying you know would we be

857
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:31,200
interested in adopting some of his updated folder icons and things of that

858
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:37,320
nature in Ubuntu mate because those of you that don't know Daniel years ago

859
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,720
used to work I think is on a contract basis but worked with or for Ubuntu on

860
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,400
the humanity icon themes so that all of those icons that you're using in a bun

861
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,360
to originated from his work and he's refined and improved those over time and

862
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,400
he was saying you know did I want to adopt the new the new version of that so

863
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,520
he did a bunch of work and we've adopted those icons and then they are a few that

864
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:03,880
looked a bit rough because they were the old style and he's now touching up a few

865
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:08,040
of the others there so we've got a whole new icon theme for all of the common

866
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:12,880
actions and folders and stuff like that and that's all come from Daniela

867
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,480
elementary and again funded through the Ubuntu mate crowdfunding that is slick

868
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,840
I really that sounds like some really nice updates it's great that the

869
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,600
crowdfunding is making that possible too that's I love it's really so it's made

870
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,160
quite a difference you might remember me saying I think it was a few months ago

871
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,680
we got sponsorship from bite mark to cover all of our hosting and bandwidth

872
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:39,080
now and that took a few months to fully kick in all of the advantage of that

873
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:43,020
because although we moved to them as soon as they made that available to us

874
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:47,000
we'd got some longer term hosting agreements with some other providers

875
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,600
that we've had to sort of be paying for well that all ended at the end of

876
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:58,160
December so this January is the first month where we're completely free of any

877
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:05,200
legacy hosting payments and already for January the amount of funding that

878
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:10,520
Ubuntu Marte is paying out to other projects and independent open source

879
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,960
developers is sitting around two and a half thousand dollars of money going to

880
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:20,880
other developers to work on either Marte or Ubuntu Marte related projects so if

881
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,280
we're able to keep that up over the next 12 months that will mean that we get

882
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,040
good quality consistent contributions coming into the projects that we care

883
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:35,360
about but some of those cross distro collaborations that's money going back

884
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:42,560
into those projects that they can use to fund their own work and for the the

885
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:46,600
part-time collaborators you know some of them are students and some of this money

886
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,120
is meaning that they don't have to flip burgers at the weekend they can actually

887
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:55,000
work on open source and get get a decent amount of money in return so that's

888
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,800
really hoping that that will that will continue to escalate over the next year

889
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:05,440
so you know what I really want to talk about though is I'm guessing the Mate

890
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,240
desktop 2.0 I mean you got you put 2.0 on there and I want to know I want to know

891
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:15,160
more details yeah so internally within the the Marte team there's there's sort

892
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:19,720
of four of us that make up the core team and there's two of us that want to go

893
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:26,400
with Marte 2.0 and the other two are like no let's call it 1.18 so I'm kind of

894
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:35,840
forcing the agenda here by putting it out there that it could be a Marte 2.0

895
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:39,640
and it might it might still be well we'll have to have some polite

896
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,080
conversations and agree agree that this is what we're going to do but the reason

897
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:49,760
for for this distinction in my mind is that with the next stable release which

898
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,040
at this point could be 2.0 or it could be 1.18 it's the first version which is

899
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:01,240
you can only build against GTK 3 all of the legacy GTK 2 code has been removed

900
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:06,560
from the entire project so that's all gone now and there's been some other

901
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:11,400
incremental improvements there but really that I feel that 2.0 is worthy

902
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:17,400
because GTK 2 is gone yeah and it would be nice to know that the one series was

903
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,480
the one that you could build against GTK 2 and the two series is the one that

904
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:28,800
meant went to GTK 3 that yeah and then you know we've had on our roadmap you

905
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:35,640
know this gentle progression to GTK 3 has always been more so from some of the

906
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:42,200
other distributions they've got an eye on adopting Wayland so another step

907
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,640
towards Wayland is this current so we have the development snapshots they're

908
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:53,880
currently 1.17 those development snapshots now have support for lib input

909
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:59,160
which is a modern library for handling input devices including you know mice

910
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,840
and trackpads and trackballs and touchscreens and what-have-you which

911
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:10,160
supports both Wayland and X11 so that's in there now so we're looking for some

912
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:15,720
testing and feedback on that but that gives if you've ever used lib input on

913
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:21,440
say GNOME 3 which has had it for a little while now you'll notice that the

914
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:26,000
the sensation of especially on trackpads you feel like your finger is really

915
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,360
moving the mouse rather than there's sort of your dragging your your finger

916
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,880
movement is disconnected from you know what you see on the screen with lib

917
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:39,360
input those things very sort of glued together and you can feel that that

918
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:43,720
that relationship is very strong so that's good and it opens up some

919
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:49,840
compatibility so improves things like disabling taps when you're typing and

920
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:54,360
stuff like that is much better palm detection oh yeah that's great stuff

921
01:08:54,360 --> 01:09:01,480
oh and then that also puts you closer to Wayland right it does and then with

922
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:13,080
fedora 25 going to Wayland by default the fedora maintainer for Marte he's now

923
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:18,320
had a series of bug reports where some people are installing pieces of Marte on

924
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:23,960
top of fedora 25 running GNOME 3 and then those applications don't work

925
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,800
under Wayland so this is things like Kaja the file manager I have Marte the

926
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,160
image viewer the terminal you know various other bits and pieces the text

927
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:37,020
editor and what have you so we've now got this to the point where the

928
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:44,760
applications will run as applications on top of Wayland now that doesn't mean you

929
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:49,480
can bring up the whole of the Marte desktop in a Wayland session that's a

930
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:53,080
little way off but the individual applications when they're running on

931
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:57,840
Wayland will now run on one of them and that's plume of the text editor can run

932
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:03,440
natively on top of Wayland so baby steps but we're getting there we're getting

933
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,440
there yeah sounds like the way yeah the way this supports integrated I'm hopeful

934
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,760
that this will also mean that Mia will will work as well but I shall be testing

935
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,040
that later in the year hmm so Ryan types in the chat room there is asking if

936
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:20,760
you've heard any little bird or birdies tweeting about perhaps live input ending

937
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:24,040
up in unity and Ubuntu because that seems like that'd be a nice feature

938
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,720
upgrade for Ubuntu desktop to have you heard any discussions mmm I may have

939
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:33,160
done but I'm foggy on this so what I'll have to do it Ryan I will check some

940
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:38,320
things and get back to you on that I think I think it's in unity 8 already

941
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:42,760
I'm pretty sure about that it's not in unity 7 and I wonder if one window

942
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,120
digging around a launchpad if you might just get the answer yeah well I will

943
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:49,080
need to go off and have a little look in there in the code repositories but I'm

944
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:52,960
not but I'm aware of but that doesn't stand for anything because some of the

945
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,080
people are working on this sort of disconnected from from what I'm doing at

946
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,400
the moment so for end users what am I gonna what kind of new stuff is landing

947
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:05,160
for that we've just discussed as landing in the in the next release

948
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,120
everything we've just discussed is in the next release already it's already in

949
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,920
the development snapshots you are crazy sir remember how remember how one of

950
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,840
these releases you're just gonna kind of back off and just have like a really

951
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,000
boring release remember how that's gonna happen this is this is this is that one

952
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,080
yeah everything I've just discussed is what's happening in Marte itself rather

953
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:31,840
than Ubuntu Marte oh so Ubuntu Marte is is going to move to the next version of

954
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:37,720
the Marte desktop that's nice release we've already uploaded Marte 1.1 7

955
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:43,360
development snapshots to the Zesty archive so if you install a Zesty daily

956
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,920
image for Ubuntu Marte now you get all of this stuff I've just been talking

957
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:54,680
about if you download the alpha which is coming out in a week or so then you know

958
01:11:54,680 --> 01:12:00,680
you'll get all of this stuff but in terms of what Ubuntu Marte is doing all

959
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:04,280
of that high-level you know headline-grabbing stuff we've just spoken

960
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:11,200
about is only part of it there was a load of rough edges in Marte 1.1 6

961
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:16,960
because that was the one where we sort of really jumped to GTK 3 and it was

962
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,080
available everywhere although it's still a build time option for some of the

963
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:25,680
components and I've been going through the issue trackers on launchpad and on

964
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:31,320
github for Marte and joining up all of this stuff and sponsoring the upstream

965
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:37,240
Marte developers to fix all of the sort of the real serious papercut issues

966
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,880
with with that transition to GTK 3 so there's a lot of refinement going on in

967
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:47,240
Marte in this release and consequently that will filter into Ubuntu Marte so

968
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:51,840
they it's just going to be boring and fixes is very true for Ubuntu Marte

969
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,560
we've got some shiny new artwork from from Daniel I really wanted to bring the

970
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:02,480
brisk menu into the Ubuntu archive now but for those of you that don't know

971
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:09,240
Debian stretch what will be Debian 9 they're in final freeze in a few days so

972
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:14,560
consequently they're not allowing new packages into Debian and if they don't

973
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,680
go to Debian then they don't automatically sync to Ubuntu and I

974
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:23,720
prefer when I'm working on Marte to do everything in Debian so these packages

975
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:28,200
have been so brisk has been uploaded to Debian it's in the new queue and it

976
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:33,880
won't get out of the new queue until Debian 9 is released so maybe I'll

977
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:38,520
upload it just as an Ubuntu version at some point but I'm I just want to see

978
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:45,640
what happens see does Debian 9 materialize in this cycle in this window

979
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:51,480
but I've done a bit of work with brisk so that you can have the brisk menu with

980
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:57,600
its search capability and you can still have the places and system menu along it

981
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,760
so instead of applications places and system you can now have the brisk menu

982
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:06,680
and you get menu places and system so you still have the three-tiered menu you

983
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:11,440
still have places and system as you used to brisk is very much like the

984
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:16,520
applications menu as was but has fast search and some additional session

985
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:22,280
management capabilities in there so I I'm thinking brisk might become the

986
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:27,760
default if not in this release then the next release sitting alongside the

987
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:33,600
traditional three-tier menu I think I did I did I hear you mention I think I

988
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,280
think in the post you said alpha 2 is scheduled for release in like three days

989
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:45,760
so yeah it's very it's very soon yeah I forget exactly but it's it's this week

990
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,320
maybe maybe this week there's a couple of releases coming up and I can't

991
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:57,040
remember which way around there we've got the 1604.2 release coming up on

992
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:03,840
February the something or other and we've got the alpha 2 of 1704 coming up

993
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,480
as well so it's all releases at the moment yeah boy that's I'm sure that's

994
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:13,160
not not a not a stressful time at all that seems seems very low-key sounds all

995
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:17,880
very good all good fun you're a good sport wimpy you're a good sport all

996
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,960
right so before we get out of here I just wanted to give a mention to Kali

997
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,480
Linux who celebrates their 10th anniversary this year and they have

998
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:30,000
announced today a new Kali Linux certified professional course which will

999
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,960
debut at blackhat 2017 the KLCP is the first and only official certification

1000
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:40,000
program that validates one's proficiency with Kali Linux which I think is

1001
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,760
interesting perhaps if you're in penetration testing business I used Kali

1002
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,720
when I did that and the Kali Linux also announced that there will be on June

1003
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:54,200
5th a Kali Linux revealed mastering the penetration testing distribution the

1004
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:59,400
first official book on the Kali Linux platform and keeping in Kali Linux

1005
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,720
spirit they're also gonna make the online version free for download so you

1006
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:07,440
can get it if you want for free that actually is gonna be also a big refresh

1007
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,960
in the documentation area too so you combine that with the book documentation

1008
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:16,720
and a certification it's kind of big movements for Kali that's that's kind

1009
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:22,920
of a big deal I don't I oh and also I should say cute 5.8 was released

1010
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:26,360
yesterday that's that's the news right there oh yeah okay all right we're

1011
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,880
gonna call it there we got to go because we got to make room for the for the new

1012
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:33,200
tax net program which if you ever want to tune in live is on Tuesdays now but

1013
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:37,280
yeah I just thought that was really cool to mention mention for Kali I mumbled

1014
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,360
room you guys thank you very much for making it it was great having you here I

1015
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,120
think we got lots of good info on everyone everybody's working on the

1016
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,760
planes are overhead now flying the banners to celebrate our excellent job I

1017
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:50,680
think that means job well done when the when they launched the planes that means

1018
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,440
that means we did a good job so we can get out of here we'll end on a high note

1019
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:59,920
thank you for tuning in this week we miss us I'm sending love to West right

1020
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:05,040
now he he misses you too so don't worry if you miss West he'll be back next week

1021
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,400
if you'd like to join us live next week perhaps participate in our mumble room

Chris Elias the network at Jupiter signal thanks for being here we'll see

1027
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:56,120
you right back here next Tuesday

1028
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:12,880
all right that brings us to the end we have a couple of minutes to pick our

1029
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,680
title so everybody in the chat room go to JB titles that is watching live guys

1030
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:23,680
thanks so much there was tons of good info from everybody in there also thanks

1031
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,280
to mr. Hall who had to move on because he had other he had another call to

1032
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:31,320
jump on but he he had to jump to that was good stuff now I key I had a

1033
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:34,480
question you said something in there about a new icon theme is this a fork of

1034
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:42,520
mocha or what is that nope nope you got the author right oh really yeah so what

1035
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,960
we've deliberately done and this is gonna sound like me being a complete

1036
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:51,720
knob but we deliberately done it on a private get for now because it's

1037
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:56,120
something that's gonna be important to the visual identity of solos now it

1038
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:00,280
might sound like a minor thing but solos was the first one to ship with arc

1039
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:05,040
thing you know we've worked with horse the the offer of arc and getting budgie

1040
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,960
to look good and be integrated it's it was effectively the official solace

1041
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:15,200
thing everywhere you look now I see that bastard thing oh yeah it's good luck so

1042
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:19,840
so what we're doing is we're doing it behind closed doors third first I can't

1043
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,720
speak today doing it behind closed doors first just because I don't want to say

1044
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:27,560
turn up in the AUR tomorrow and already been warned by half the country before

1045
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:32,200
we even get to release the solar cell but it will be coming in time and it's

1046
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,520
gonna be nice and they'll help you know define the look of solos that little

1047
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,120
bit more so you know I was just pinged during the show that there is a there is

1048
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:43,220
an event that I've been wanting to go to for a few years it's happening in the

1049
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:49,720
back in my backyard during scale man I really want to go to this plus there's

1050
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:53,060
something else that's happening with some friends on that weekend and now I'm

1051
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:56,520
considering I'm considering maybe seeing if I can get I think Noah would go

1052
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,440
regardless but now I'm now I'm wondering if I really need to go I in the show I

1053
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,720
said I was gonna go to scale and now by the end of the show I'm like Noah's

1054
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,520
gonna be there I'm forcing him to go yeah I think yeah I think he'd be

1055
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:12,200
regardless so we get coverage so yeah I don't know the question is is do I

1056
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:15,120
because it's not that the thing it's a it's a hot air balloon event it's this

1057
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,520
massive huge hot air balloon event in this in in a town that looks like it's

1058
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,200
from 1805 it's a it's a it's like a western town like wooden sidewalks dirt

1059
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:28,960
roads it's a really cool little place and they have an RV park that is within

1060
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,080
walking distance and you take a wooden stairway down into the town and they're

1061
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:36,280
gonna have this massive hot air balloon event and it would be so cool to go I've

1062
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:39,680
always wanted to go and it's only like two hours of three two and a half hours

1063
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,560
away from where I live

1064
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:52,320
I like going to that town too so I don't know so do I but I live in the city if I

1065
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:57,120
have a big one every summer and it gets a bit boring I bet towards the end I bet

1066
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:02,240
I would only go for like one day but yeah I don't know I don't know what to

1067
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,720
do now it's always so hard scale comes at the

1068
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:10,440
worst time possible I actually don't like that they moved it up this year so

1069
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:15,020
it's closer to LFNW itself yeah I wish I wish it was still be in January like it

1070
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:18,120
was because it would have been happening you know this past weekend I wish it was

1071
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:21,840
happening actually like later in the year even that would be fun like

1072
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,880
November some well that might be a little too late interesting somewhere in

1073
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:30,120
that range might be not bad though October like yeah August might be a

1074
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,240
little August is bad because there's a lot of security conferences honestly like

1075
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:37,080
yeah I'm going on I don't want to make it right to scale yeah although I

1076
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,680
wonder if they could if they did if they if they nosed it up to something like

1077
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,960
that if they could get some more attendance although they get plenty

1078
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:47,200
attendance scale timber Wimpy do you mind if I ask what did you consider

1079
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,900
going and why you decided not to go just because I'm considering if I should go

1080
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:56,600
or not um well I was either going to go under my own steam or go with work and

1081
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:02,880
there are people from work going I can't afford to go to scale and Linux fest

1082
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:10,920
Northwest so and it's a bit a bit awkward timing for scale so yeah unless I

1083
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,360
was going with work I decided I'm not gonna go individually that's the thing

1084
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:21,400
with with Noah going I don't it's not like mandatory that I go I don't know I

1085
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,720
gotta think about it some more I wish I hadn't said I was going in the show

1086
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:28,440
because literally during the last half of the show I got those I got the

1087
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:34,320
message there's also we have a we have a close friend who has a concert once a

1088
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:41,040
year and we've missed the the concert because of scale and and so like six

1089
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:45,120
months ago she's like well guess what they we moved that we moved the date of

1090
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,760
the of the concert well guess what they what they moved it to the weekend of

1091
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,640
scale March 3rd yeah great thanks guys what you could do Chris you see is you

1092
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:58,100
could do this you could save your money not go to scale and you could come to

1093
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:07,040
UbuCon Paris in November whoa whoa whoa whoa that would be an amazing goal
