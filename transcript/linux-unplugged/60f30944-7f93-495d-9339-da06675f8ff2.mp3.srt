1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We have a little debunking I want to do. I'm going to pull up Skype right now so that way Matt can call in while we're talking about this because I'm about to get a little upset.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Uh oh.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You guys know how I feel about Linux journalism.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's crap.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It is crap and it needs to get fixed real bad, right?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh yeah.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's an old punching bag of mine. It's not too surprising. Nothing too new there.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, our buddy John Grogan over at Linux Journal, nothing against John, I mean he's just doing his job writing for Linux Journal, wrote up a piece that I saw last week, towards the end of last week, he wrote this on August 8th.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So let's see, when was August 8th?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
August 8th was last Friday.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And I remember I came across this article while I was evaluating potential stories for the Linux Action Show.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And one of the metrics that I use before making a story in the Linux Action Show is how much overall coverage is it receiving?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And I noticed particularly by tracking the story that it was getting more and more pickup.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And I thought, okay, this is one that it's now definitely entered the category I need to read.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And it's Linux security threats are on the rise.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's the headline.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Ooh, that sounds bad.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Real bad.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Faith, does that scare you?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That scares me to death right there.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, and here's the facts.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Every year, heck, every month, this is directly from the article, Linux is adopted by more and more companies and organizations as important.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And of course I wouldn't dispute that.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Would not dispute that.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And of course, Linux is a key part of their enterprise platform and more serious hardware of the platform, they're more likely to be running Linux.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
60% of servers, 70% of web servers, and 95% of all supercomputers are Linux based.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So John starts out by kind of outlining something that everybody's going to agree with.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I agree with that.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Linux has a lot of usage.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So we go through the article and we talk a little bit about the benefits of Linux and its total cost of ownership.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then we get to a point about what's causing the increased security risks for Linux.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
At least two factors John points to.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And this is, I love this one.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I love this one so, so much.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
First one, going forward.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Not saying today, going forward.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Love it when you just get everybody all worked up and then you preface it all on something that's going to happen in the future.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's not happening now.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's all get it worked up.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So going forward, the sheer size and ever-growing popularity of Linux will be its downfall.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Simply put, with 15.8 million lines of the most recent kernel, the likelihood of a mistake or a mistake simply increases.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And mistakes equal vulnerabilities.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Witness the GNU TLS bug from earlier this year.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And with more web servers running Linux than anything else, cracking Linux gets you where the money is.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So he's saying more lines of code equal more bugs.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is essentially because the Linux kernel is 15.8 million lines of code, therefore there's going to be more bugs.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So he's saying, so the headline is Linux Security Threats on the Rise.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What does he point to as a data point for these security threats being on the rise?

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The lines of code in the Linux kernel.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now have we not been here?

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Have we not done this before?

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is what happens when any non-programmer looks at this and simply equates lines of code to complexity and bugs.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That code is segmented out into individual modules where they have ownership.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In fact, it is extremely improper to measure the complexity or the vulnerability of a project based on its lines of code

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
because you have no idea how that code is managed internally.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And that makes all of the difference.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In fact, the senior director of engineering of Red Hat points out, he says the most fundamental level of vigilance

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
are things that seem very likely should be no-brainers, but they're easy to neglect or forget about.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is the true reality of Linux security.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Vulnerabilities are found all the time.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So the critical piece of advice is to make sure your servers are kept up to date with security fixes all the time,

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
i.e. patch your S, like we talked about on TechSnap.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is why Fedora Next is looking at ways to make your server much easier to have almost in a sense rolling.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So you're constantly updating.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We just had a story on TechSnap where now, based on studies, really your safest window to patch is nine days of the vulnerability announcement.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's your safest time to patch is within nine days.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And so you can see how existing Linux patching infrastructures aren't necessarily accommodating that new reality.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To secure systems at an enterprise scale, one needs more than vigilance, though.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Of course, he points out you've got to have a real-time continuous visibility, back to John.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You've got to have, in order to tackle this increasing Linux security problem, you have to have continuous real-time visibility

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
across the entire landscape and environment and ability to establish and enforce security policies across the entire environment.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, good news.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Good news, everybody.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because it just so happens, right at the end of this article, John points out,

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the Linux Journal is participating with Bit9 and Carbon Black for a webinar to address all of these issues

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
where they will teach you with one click how to implement centralized security policies on Linux systems.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They'll give you the technical justification for increased vigilance and security measures,

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
as well as a roadmap to ensure that your data and your customers' data is safe and secure.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Of course, the webinar is on August 27th.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This entire article was to sell this damn webinar.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And the reason why this bothers me is that headline has now gotten this thing in publication everywhere.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And because the outlet is Linux Journal, everybody's running with it.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And what I saw on Friday was a couple of sites.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I now see all of the Linux aggregation news sites running this story.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And it's a crap story. It's not based on any data.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's based on the fact that lines of code have been added to the kernel,

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and the fact that they have a webinar they want to sell.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is this not egregious?

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is fairly egregious.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I agree.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Was there not an independent testing suite that rated the Linux kernel as the gold standard of code quality?

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Right.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I feel like, if you're going to sell your product, can you do it without tarnishing the good name of another project, maybe?

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This is egregious.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's how I feel.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well put, sir. Well put. That's exactly.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And I don't mean to get on John's case, because I'm sure he was assigned this.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And of course, you know, this is probably going to be a good talk.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They want to spread the word about it.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I just think it's unfortunate, like you're saying, to drag the good name of a good open source project through the mud

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and use lines of code as your backup justification.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Because it's one of those arguments that on surface almost sounds kind of good.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And then when you actually think about it, it's kind of a crap argument.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It sounds to me like they basically told him to write an article to push this marketing job forward.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, I agree.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's all marketing.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Agreement.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I just wanted to rant about that a little bit.

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by Linus Torvalds' treadmill desk.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
My name is Chris.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And my name is Matt.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hey, Matt.

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hey, guess what?

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In studio this week, I'm pretty excited, Faith's joining us.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hey, Faith.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Hi there.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Thanks for having me.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hey, so I think, what, last time I saw you, I mean, I feel like we talk almost every day because you've been on summer break.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Last time I saw you, though, Linux Fest.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yep.

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yep.

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And Faith's in the Washington area, but like as far away as possible.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, pretty much.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So he decided to join us today, Matt.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And it's good, too, because one of the topics we're discussing today is the new beta of elementary OS.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And Faith happens to be sitting at the machine in the studio with that beta installed right now.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He's running it.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh, that's me.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There he is right there.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, nice, nice.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Oh, that looks good.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, you got chat on a virtual desktop.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Man, that is looking fancy.

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Now, of course, we're not doing a review because it's beta.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We're just going to give you our insights on it and maybe discuss the project as a whole, the community, their interaction with the community, which I think is very unique for elementary OS.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And elementary OS is doing some extremely interesting things hardware-wise.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's not a smartphone.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's not a tablet.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No, it's much, much smarter than that.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
They're really attacking it.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So that's coming up later in the show.

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But first, we do have some feedback to get to.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So we're going to jump into that first, as always.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's tradition, Faith.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't know if you – did you know that?

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah, no, I knew that.

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, yeah.

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay, you did know that.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, okay.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
All right.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, our first email comes in from Kyle.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And Kyle wrote on a follow-up to an email we read on Sunday's Linux action show about the Linux desktop kind of getting him down, how he was kind of disappointed.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Matt, you and I kicked this one around a little bit.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, he writes, hey, Chris and Matt.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is Kyle, aka WiggleWaffles.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thanks for your follow-up on today's last.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Just to respond, number one, he's not going to switch away from Arch.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He says Arch would have to be pried out of his cold, dead hands.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He doesn't blame Arch for his recent problems.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
As he said in the subreddit, he wasn't having trouble with Arch, but stuff that would be an issue on any distro because he installed the beta versions of those packages.

164
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I've had to do some crazy grub gymnastics even to get Ubuntu to boot sometimes.

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So it's not like Arch is alone in his problems.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He says, in fact, Arch should never really give me any trouble itself.

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Number two, he took our advice about picking like a GNOME or XFCE desktop and just sticking with it.

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He says he's going to give it a try.

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He says, I was wondering if you guys could do a how-to segment on running multiple DEs under Arch and cleaning up the ones you're not using.

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Because I remember Chris borked his Arch install when going from KDE to GNOME and it has me a bit scared.

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I think that was actually an NVIDIA driver issue.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh, was it? Oh, okay.

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Have you ever had any problems installing multiple desktops on Arch?

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Not really. I mean, I never really do KDE in any capacity, so I can't speak to that.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I just don't care.

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But I can tell you with GNOME and XFCE, no, those seem to play well together.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What about you, Faith?

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, I've tried that on Ubuntu back when I was on Ubuntu and I got out of the habit of it because it tends to add badly.

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Now, I think that's where it happens to go bad is on Ubuntu desktops because they've got specific requirements of the version of Unity or et cetera, et cetera, right?

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Don't you think?

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No, that's probably it.

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You run Arch now, though, don't you?

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, I do, yeah.

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And you still haven't really tried the multiple desktops?

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Well, GNOME is the master desktop, so how do you get away from that?

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't want to draw attention to this, but I had the lower third wrong and I just fixed it.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't want to thank my wife.

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
She just sent me a text message.

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
She sent me this text message.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Look at this text.

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Look at that text message.

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Episode wrong.

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The number is wrong.

194
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Thank you, Angela.

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're right.

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It is episode 53 of The Unplugged Show.

197
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah, I would say the only thing that really bites me when I'm switching around multiple desktops is sometimes you get that mess of like, I've got three text editors now or something like that.

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't know.

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We'll bring in the mumble room.

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Anybody in the mumble room have any advice for somebody that wants to install multiple desktop environments and play around?

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Is there any gotchas that somebody should be worried about firsthand?

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Cruft.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Lots of cruft.

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Multiple apps, right?

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Multiple web browsers, stuff like that.

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, yeah.

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Redundant apps.

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Multiple settings area.

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're going to fill up your root drive very quickly.

210
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Selecting multiple display managers as well when you log in.

211
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I feel like systemd made that a lot easier because it's systemctl enable kdm.service or disable gdm.service.

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Systemd makes it really easy to move between the different display managers.

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But yeah, that would be my warning.

214
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What I do is I inevitably install another desktop because I like to play.

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm a tinkerer.

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So what I always do is I start with the grand vision.

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This is going to be a GTK only desktop with only GTK apps.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And then, of course, about 15 minutes in, I remember I have to install Quazl.

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So then I install Quazl.

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And then about 10 minutes after that, I think, well, I do like K3B or something like that.

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I have to install it.

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What you have to do is just start as minimal as possible and then branch out from there and watch out for clutter.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And you'll be fine.

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't really think there's anything.

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You're not going to break your KDE install by installing Gnome.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's not going to happen.

227
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And if that does happen, switch to a different distribution.

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
One thing I'd also suggest is if you've got Gnome going on and you want to switch up your desktop environment,

229
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Cinnamon's a very easy one to install because it uses a lot of the same programs.

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, totally.

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, good point.

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Moving between Gnome, Xfce and Cinnamon is particularly painless, I think.

233
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't forget Mate as well.

234
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes, yes.

235
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Mate has a lot of its own apps, including like a different replacement for GYAD as it were.

236
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I forget what it's called off the top of my head.

237
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And it's got its own terminal, right?

238
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, but look, Cinnamon has their own file manager, right?

239
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But that's the only thing.

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah, and their own control center, but yeah.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And the other thing to consider is that after some amount of time of messing around,

242
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
you might eventually find one that you can stick with and stay with it and then it won't be a problem.

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Right, right.

244
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah, because it is just kind of an experimentation phase.

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
CountZero writes in with our next email.

246
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He says, the problem with Linux market share.

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Uh-oh.

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He says, hi, guys.

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
First of all, congratulations on your excellent piece on the Linux Unplugged 52

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
where you talked about the issues facing Linux on the desktop

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and why the Mac is gaining market share.

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And that maybe Linux might be stagnated.

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
While there may be a large degree of truth to this problem,

254
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I feel that the real situation is a lot more complex

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and that it first appears because unless you're buying a Linux machine from a company like System76,

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
well, there's a 99% probability that the machine you're going to get will have Windows installed on it.

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
This means that when you bought it, it would count as a Windows sale

258
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and consequently push up the Windows market share.

259
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Since it's very hard to actually go out and buy a ready-made Linux machine,

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
it's not surprising that Linux is lagging so far in the sales statistics.

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The main question that comes out of all of this, though, is how do you determine Linux market share

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
when Linux is downloaded for free of charge

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and for the home user no support contracts or other arrangements are made that would leave a paper trail.

264
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Of course, Google certainly knows how many search requests are coming from Linux client

265
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
in relation to Windows or Mac, but this is just one way of determining usage.

266
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I guess my point is that because Linux doesn't leave much or actual any kind of financial data

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
in its wake or a.k.a. paper trail, the market research companies not only find it difficult to get accurate figures,

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
but frankly are not even very interested because there's no money involved.

269
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
As Chase always says, you got to show me the money.

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And you know, Chase does always say that. Chase always says, show me the money.

271
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Show me the money!

272
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I look back at that. For one thing, I've experienced this a lot when you're looking at various pundits and whatnot

273
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
talking about the Linux market share is not there and they always point to the same old tired crap

274
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
that's not even accurate, it's not even a debate.

275
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But as an industry, we accept it as reality.

276
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, there you go. There's the numbers. There's where it is.

277
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I think he's completely right. I think a lot of people are buying Windows boxes and installing Linux

278
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and you would have no idea what those actual numbers are.

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, he says, my own feelings on the subject is that Linux market share is inevitably far greater than any official figures suggest

280
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
while the Windows figure may be correspondingly less than their own market share would indicate

281
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
since many people just see Windows boxes as Linux rigs waiting to be installed.

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I agree.

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, I think the closest you get is guesstimates, right?

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You can look at Steam figures, you can look at web browsing figures, but those are just approximations of certain demographics of people

285
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and you're not going to get a true representation because there is no central database of Linux users.

286
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah.

287
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think it's a combination of all of them.

288
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you look at it, what it really comes down to is, I think the closest you're going to get is the web browser

289
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
where the statistics based on Google or Bing or whoever.

290
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Or Wikipedia is one we'll sometimes quote.

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Some people use Distray Watch, don't they, to pin down market share.

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah.

293
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If you look at net market share, most people use a browser on their computer at some point, don't they?

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So it's a fair assumption to say if you have traffic coming from Linux boxes, that's a good way to measure it.

295
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I almost feel like we have to come up with a new metric.

296
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Like Fade here, what's that new tablet you got called?

297
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, it's a Kobo Aura HD.

298
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's an e-reader.

299
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And it's Linux based?

300
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It is.

301
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And it's got a 1080p e-ink display.

302
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So obviously it's a killer e-book reader and you can use Calibre to sideload documents on or mount it as a USB drive.

303
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And that, for you, if you, so I guess my point is say you spend two hours a day on that device.

304
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Does it, should it now be counted as one of your computing devices and the fact that it runs Linux,

305
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
should that be included in your mix?

306
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And even if you are a Windows user but you spent two hours of your computing time on a Linux type device,

307
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
how do you properly account for that?

308
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Because that represents a huge majority of people that have Android devices.

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's true.

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I mean you look at Android market share and that for the use case that you use mobile devices,

311
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
for most people it's the same use case they use desktop devices.

312
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, email, social.

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And we like to separate it with this delineation.

314
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We're geeks.

315
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But I think it's a false delineation.

316
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
People used to get stuff done whether it's on mobile or on desktop.

317
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I agree.

318
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I think it's a bit of a.

319
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's just a false belief.

320
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's a false belief.

321
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's something that we've divided in our minds because of the way we see the technology.

322
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But as new people come into it and use it, they don't have those prejudices.

323
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah, like your kids, when they're growing up, this is what they use to get stuff done.

324
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The computer is the old weird thing.

325
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Like when Dylan uses the computer, he's using the quaint thing that dad uses, right?

326
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's how he sees it.

327
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And when he's using a tablet, he's using a real computer.

328
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Because a real computer has speech capability, it has a camera built in, it has touch screen capability.

329
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And if you have a computer that doesn't have those things, it doesn't have all the features he wants.

330
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's like us looking at five and a half inch flabby's.

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Right.

332
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Or punch cards.

333
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah.

334
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There you go.

335
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It is.

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's very weird to think about it that way.

337
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And that's why it's all going to change.

338
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,000
James writes in about the Ubuntu rant that Matt and I got into an Ubuntu rant at the end of last week's Linux Unplugged.

339
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And you knew that was going to get Josh in the mumble room.

340
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I knew he was pulling his hair out while we were going.

341
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh, yeah.

342
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But James wrote in, I think, so that way he could say what Josh didn't want to.

343
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hey, Chris and Matt, one day I'll make it onto the mumble room.

344
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But in lieu of that, I had to pass this comment about your Ubuntu dropping the ball rant in last week's episode.

345
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Firstly, here we go, Matt.

346
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You know it's bad when it starts out with firstly.

347
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, yeah.

348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's okay.

349
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yeah.

350
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Firstly, one of the specific points raised, such as the software center, et cetera, weren't necessarily wrong.

351
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But I contend that every distribution has issues like this.

352
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And the reason we are so upset about those issues with Ubuntu is that we all know deep down that Ubuntu is the closest.

353
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The problem seems that all of the glaring the problems seem all more glaring simply because it's 99 percent of the way there.

354
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If it was 70 percent as some other distros were, then it simply wouldn't get that upset about it.

355
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know if I agree with that.

356
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I completely agree with it.

357
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I think he literally like climbed inside my brain and stated exactly why I get so that's why I get so much grief about it.

358
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Because I do care.

359
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I care about Ubuntu and it is the closest.

360
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I completely totally agree.

361
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So you think because it's in that uncanny valley and that gap is so close to being closed that we get frustrated they didn't just finish it.

362
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Exactly.

363
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's like they're I mean, they've already got the they've got the skeleton there.

364
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
They've got the know how.

365
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I would argue they have the resources.

366
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They may differ, but I believe they do.

367
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I've seen evidence of it.

368
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I've just seen the things they've done so far and believe they can.

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And it feels like they get so close to the finish line and they're like, oh, hey, look mobile.

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's just kind of like it's like, really, guys, come on.

371
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah, I would completely agree.

372
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
When you bought your Ultra Pro, it came with the Unity desktop and then you reloaded to Arch with Gnome.

373
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes, to you, does do you doesn't doesn't Gnome feel like a more completed product to you?

374
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So I like those percentages you gave.

375
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I feel like it's ninety nine percent of the way there for most people.

376
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Ubuntu or Gnome?

377
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Ubuntu with Unity.

378
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah.

379
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
For the needs, not wants of most people.

380
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And it's about 70 percent of the way of what it could be if you really focused on the desktop, which is why I use Gnome, because they never stop focusing on it.

381
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And maybe Unity 8 will be simply amazing, but we don't know because it's not a thing yet.

382
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Other than on mobile.

383
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's a good point.

384
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
All right.

385
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So that was his first point.

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He said, I have to say that in comparison with Android and we did make a comparison to Android.

387
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He said that he thought was kind of telling.

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Traditional Linux distros have always been just a little lacking on integration needed to produce what we've all seemed to want.

389
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And this will not change in the next few years.

390
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Android solved that issue.

391
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So what did Android do?

392
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It took the Linux kernel and a subset of tools and it developed its own user space, its own integrated display manager and its own SDK.

393
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I think it's worth considering that what Canonical is doing is not getting lost off in mobile land and ignoring the desktop,

394
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:58,000
but actually doing R&D on how to pull off an Android style revamp of its desktop while at the same time pulling off a large number or pulling in a new large number of developers.

395
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Let's be honest.

396
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Canonical is plugging the desktop hard, but in places where Microsoft does not have a huge monopoly.

397
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Is it worth spending limited funds providing and offering to say 2 million potential customers in the US?

398
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Or should they go to Brazil, Africa and India and put that offering in front of 2 billion potential customers,

399
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
which will provide a larger foothold to build on for developers and to build applications needed to make Linux desktop a reality?

400
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Sure, it's a risky strategy.

401
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Unity 8 and Mirror might end up being bad, but Canonical in this case is like the Swan.

402
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Everything looks calm on the surface.

403
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But furious paddling is occurring under the water.

404
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Only time will tell.

405
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's a great email, James.

406
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That was actually fantastic.

407
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah, I could see where they're going with that.

408
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I definitely can.

409
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
My concern is that it's once again, it's grass is greener on the other side.

410
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
As soon as we get this done, Matt, as soon as we get this done, it'll be fine.

411
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah, exactly.

412
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's it.

413
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And on top of that, I think if you really look at it practically, rather than owning a market that quite honestly is not dead,

414
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
yeah, it's stagnated, but again, you're not trying to get people to buy new hardware.

415
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You're trying to get people to get them to use their hardware again in ways they may not have previously.

416
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Instead of going that direction, they're basically trying to invent something no one really asked for, in my opinion.

417
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Geeks have asked for more mobile stuff, sure.

418
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Joe Average doesn't care.

419
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And being they make up most of the numbers arguably, I think they're wasting their time.

420
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't really understand the real benefit there, but they could prove me wrong.

421
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's happened before.

422
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I hope they do.

423
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's not a wasted effort.

424
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I hope it's not a wasted effort.

425
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I hope they prove us wrong.

426
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't know.

427
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I mean, we'll see.

428
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Sure.

429
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It very well.

430
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I think it's wasted effort.

431
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That'd be awesome if it could.

432
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah, it would be.

433
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It would be amazing, to be honest with you.

434
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It would be salvation for a lot of people who are looking for a solution.

435
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Definitely.

436
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But wasn't one of the things you were talking about last week was that the Mac user experience is so great because it's got all this integration,

437
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and therefore, developers are willing to put the time and effort in to that user space.

438
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Well, if Linux had something like that, would that not benefit us?

439
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't know if I've ever said the Mac is well integrated because I don't know if that –

440
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I think when we think of integration, what do we – I think when I think integration, I think KDE, right, where all of the K apps.

441
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But the real integration, the integration that matters is like the API and that type of stuff,

442
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
where you can write something for iOS, and then with very little code surfacing on the surface rewriting,

443
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
you can make that application available on Mac OS X.

444
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That type of integration that inspires developers to write for the platform,

445
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and then those good applications inspire users to move to the platform.

446
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What sells consoles? An incredible game.

447
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And that's the kind of story that Canonical is pitching is you will be able to write a QMLJS or a Qt application that runs on the mobile,

448
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
that runs on the tablet, that runs on the desktop with very minor changes.

449
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's a very compelling story, and it might result in some really decent applications coming to Linux that we might not have thought of before.

450
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It might be a pipe dream, too, though.

451
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
They've been talking about it for years.

452
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, I think the problem that we have with it isn't so much that they're going in a new direction that may or may not be successful for them.

453
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's that they have such a large market share and so many people rely on them that them focusing the efforts,

454
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
their limited finite resources on something that's unproven and generally unwanted,

455
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
it does result in negligence of the platform that we all love right now.

456
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Google has the resources to focus on anything they want to.

457
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I think it's the negligence of the platform we all love now that has us upset.

458
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But you can make a good case that the people who we really need to have adopting it right now don't want necessarily a moving target.

459
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Take India.

460
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
In some ways, a non-moving target is a good thing.

461
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So it depends on who you want to have adoption.

462
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What I really have is the end game.

463
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
This is where I truly, deeply am concerned about the canonical strategy.

464
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Let's be honest.

465
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Who's going to buy Ubuntu Touch devices in mass numbers?

466
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And I'm talking millions.

467
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's carriers.

468
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Why?

469
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Because they're already working with carriers to develop the platform so that way those carriers can modify it.

470
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So that way it's Verizon OS.

471
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's AT&T OS.

472
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's Orange OS.

473
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Whatever the carrier is, it's their operating system with their store, with their services.

474
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What we will be moving to with Ubuntu Touch is not just operating system lock-in.

475
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
We will be moving into an era of carrier lock-in where you buy an app and that app is only available from the carrier store

476
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
because they control the experience from the operating system all the way up to the connection.

477
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And it will be carrier lock-in and phone lock-in.

478
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It will be a new breed of evil.

479
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The idea is you, as in like the carrier or whatever, would be able to, say for instance, Ting.

480
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Ting would be able to develop a Ting scope that works on the Unity mobile experience.

481
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And you would be able to use their scope or they would be able to tie in music purchasing into the music scope if they wanted to.

482
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Does that mean carrier lock-in?

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yes.

484
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Sort of.

485
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But if the content you're buying is only available from that carrier and you switch to a different carrier,

486
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
you lose access to the content.

487
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's not like the carrier is going to be completely stripping out the application store from Ubuntu Touch.

488
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
They're only going to be adding particular stuff onto scopes.

489
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I agree.

490
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I don't know here because I've had those really bad prepaid phones since I was a kid

491
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and they try and ship their store, their ringtones, their music, all of that stuff on there and nobody buys it.

492
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Well, you don't.

493
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's bad, but they've never had a platform that sits on a smartphone.

494
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And when it's on a smartphone, it's shiny and appealing.

495
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And if they go to Canonical and say, hey, we'd love to ship your product if you let us do this, what's Canonical going to say?

496
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Of course.

497
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Right.

498
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
They need the sale.

499
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Exactly.

500
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
They have no resources.

501
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You have to remember that when your platform is divided and used in all sorts of different facets, that's a problem that winners have.

502
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Right.

503
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Well, and let's go back to Android for a second.

504
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Thank you, Noah.

505
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So let's talk about this.

506
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Look exactly at the user sacrifices that Android decided to make in order to accomplish carrier adoption.

507
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,000
They conceded things that we all now hate, the ability to install software, the ability to delay updates.

508
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
These types of things that we all absolutely hate as Android users were done so that way they could get in the door and compete with the iPhone.

509
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Well, we are now seven years later, ladies and gentlemen.

510
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So imagine how much more locked up that is.

511
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,000
The only way to penetrate, and I want to underscore the word penetrate, that market, is by bending over and letting them do anything you want.

512
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And if that means making a scope, that's where it begins.

513
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It will be a themed operating system.

514
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
They will have backgrounds.

515
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
They will have app stores.

516
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
They will have video stores.

517
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
They will have e-book stores.

518
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It will be the V-cast store.

519
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It will be the V-app store.

520
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And the reason why I hate that we are ignoring the desktop is because we are building, and I say we, I mean Canonical, are building a future in which I don't want that anyways.

521
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Like even if we get there, the worst case scenario is that Ubuntu Touch is actually adopted.

522
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's bad for users.

523
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's bad for the market.

524
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Worst case scenario, worst case scenario is that Ubuntu Touch is successful.

525
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Think about it.

526
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Everything we don't like about Android, much worse.

527
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But what about the fact that the Android can be, you can install Ubuntu Touch on Android with like one button.

528
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But Canonical can make it where you can just disable all the carrier crap with one button.

529
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Well, I mean obviously, if there's something like that, then it's the Jesus platform.

530
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But right now, I don't.

531
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And you've got to look at motivation.

532
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Who's putting money in their pockets?

533
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
We're not.

534
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Right.

535
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Why the hell would they do that?

536
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Like if I'm a carrier, wouldn't I want to remove that functionality?

537
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I wish they would, but I can't see that.

538
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
There's only one group of organizations in the entire world that are worse than banks, and that's carriers.

539
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Most of the time, like the only people that upset me more on a daily basis besides the financial industry is the freaking telco industry

540
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
because I have to interface with them constantly, and it's so aggravating.

541
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So giving them more power, giving them a platform, that sounds like the worst thing ever.

542
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
If you create a vendor-locked-in platform like that, if they're successful, which why wouldn't they be?

543
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
If you're going to ship an Ubuntu Touch product, you're going to make any kind of demands you like,

544
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and they're going to be met, or you're not going to ship it.

545
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The two-year contract that you're locked into, even if you don't like it, tough.

546
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You've got two years before you can do something else, and by then, you'll be locked in.

547
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Well, you're going to take that phone over to another carrier?

548
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's got all the other carriers' image on it.

549
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And then we go into this argument that I love, like when I complain about the stuff about Android,

550
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I always get the, well, you could install CyanogenMod.

551
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Well, I mean, sure, in Ubuntu Touch, you could flash it yourself.

552
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Okay, that's great for the 2,000 people in the entire world that will do that.

553
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Good job, everybody.

554
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But for the millions of people that will have no idea what that even means, it doesn't do squat.

555
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Fair enough.

556
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I was just thinking about, this is kind of down, but if you think of the tablet industry, though,

557
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
that's not tied to a central carrier.

558
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Somebody like System76 or even just box stores could potentially ship a product.

559
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I would be more excited about that.

560
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I would be a lot more excited if it was like Ubuntu Touch for tablets, and that would probably be where I use it.

561
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm not so excited about the carrier versions.

562
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
For me personally, I'm already running Ubuntu Touch on my Nexus.

563
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I am really looking forward to it as an enthusiast, getting to play with it.

564
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
But the thing is, I have to be realistic about what the mass market implementation will be.

565
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And that's damn depressing.

566
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Personally, to play with, I'm all excited for it.

567
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Have at it, right?

568
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But I don't think it's worth sacrificing the two years.

569
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It feels like, I don't know, it feels at least like the last year has been lost on the desktop.

570
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But don't you think that the people that care enough to flash their phones are going to be the ones that flash their phones?

571
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And the people that don't know how to flash their phones are the ones that probably don't care?

572
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I think people don't care until they decide, wait a minute, my carrier is screwing me and I want to move.

573
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Or they think, oh, I don't like this anymore.

574
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
For me, I've recently come to the conclusion that I'm a little more uncomfortable with Android than I originally realized.

575
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And so I decided I'm going to try out an iOS device.

576
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Well, there goes all the apps I've ever bought.

577
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Screw you, Chris.

578
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Same developers.

579
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You've spent the money.

580
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Screw yourself.

581
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You're done.

582
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Regular people are not willing to make that decision.

583
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Shouldn't they get paid?

584
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Right.

585
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But see, what Faith just said, I underscore, is I don't necessarily hold the developers guilty for that.

586
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But like Faith said, normal people will look at that and say, well, geez, that's about another phone's worth of apps I've bought.

587
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm not switching.

588
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And they're already locked in.

589
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Now, add the carrier level to that, guys.

590
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I mean, just think about that.

591
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That is freaky.

592
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Well, we'll see.

593
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You know what?

594
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We shouldn't get too worked up, honestly, because who knows what could happen.

595
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
There could be a way to strike a balance here.

596
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And maybe Canonical is the one that could set a tone for the rest of the industry to follow.

597
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And if not, Yolophone.

598
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah.

599
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Sure.

600
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah, I'm rocking one right now.

601
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's not loaded up with a bunch of DNA bloat.

602
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, and you know, Alan from TechSnap just got the Spark or whatever it is from the Mozilla guys.

603
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And he likes it.

604
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He doesn't need a lot of functionality.

605
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It works for him.

606
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
All right.

607
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Well, we've got a couple more emails just to bust through real quick.

608
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
This is the one Faith's been waiting for.

609
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And I like this guy.

610
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
His name, he submitted, from Australia.

611
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You know what?

612
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
That's all you need to say.

613
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Immediately, I'm like, that's awesome.

614
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Okay.

615
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So he writes and he says, hey, Chris and Matt, I watch your show weekly.

616
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And I really enjoy it.

617
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So I just wanted to let you know, and I think he was responding to some of my butter FS

618
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
grousing I was doing.

619
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I've been using ZFS on Arch for one and a half years now.

620
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Never had a single issue.

621
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I run it on two servers, about 24 terabytes of data, and on my notebook.

622
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I use it for my data partition only.

623
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Storing data on my ZFS makes me sleep better.

624
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And I'm sure Alan would agree with that.

625
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I use ZFS Git package.

626
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
He's using the Git version of ZFS from the AUR, and it works like a charm.

627
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Thought you would be interested, and maybe you can give a maintainer a quick shout out.

628
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
His name is Jesus Alvarez, or Jesus, whichever.

629
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm going to go with Jesus.

630
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
He really deserves the name.

631
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I agree.

632
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Also, he's known as the demonizer.

633
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
He made my life so much easier.

634
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It may be yours, too.

635
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I've included commands to start using ZFS.

636
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
He says, caution, it's very easy.

637
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
See you on last in TechSnap.

638
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So from Australia, thanks for the update.

639
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You, sir, have balls making your data partition based on the ZFS Git.

640
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The Git version of your files, wow.

641
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And I know ZFS is supposed to be stable and all, but.

642
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
On an unsupported platform, wow.

643
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
This is what I'm saying.

644
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
This is what I'm saying.

645
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Okay, Mumble Room, this one's for you.

646
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Q5, are you still in there, Rotten?

647
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Are you guys in there?

648
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You guys got your ears on?

649
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Because this was submitted nine hours ago to the Linux Action Show subreddit from...

650
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm going to go with Ion D-Bagger.

651
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Ionic Badger.

652
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Ironic Badger.

653
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That's actually me.

654
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Okay.

655
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I like D-Bagger.

656
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Wow.

657
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Well.

658
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
All right.

659
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Well, I'm glad you're here because I made it much funnier.

660
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So, Ironic D-Bagger wrote, hey guys, apologies if this is a...

661
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah, apologies.

662
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But he wants to know if we would be interested in doing a LUP review of Open Media Vault.

663
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Do-it-yourself NAS based upon Debian, it really has some neat features for the home NAS solution.

664
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Hopefully a range of people could test it out on various different RAID setups, drive

665
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
pooling options such as SnapRate, AUFS, MHDDFS, and so on.

666
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We could always use more discussions trying to help people store their TBs, terabytes,

667
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
at home.

668
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I use SnapRate with AUFS.

669
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
For now, XFS across my data drives.

670
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Always love the good talk on this topic.

671
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'll be in the Mumble Room tonight, hopefully.

672
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Well, there you go, Crunchy.

673
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So, I also would like to be, I would very much like to get a community review of Open

674
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Media Vault.

675
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It's one of these things where it's hard for me to review because I've got a free NAS and

676
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
a Plex server.

677
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm kind of already all dialed in.

678
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm not really in a position where I need to do this.

679
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But I've always wondered about Open Media Vault.

680
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So, is anybody in the Mumble Room interested in doing an Open Media Vault review?

681
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
We could do like a round table review.

682
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah, I'll take part in that.

683
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Seeing as I posted the thing, I'll definitely say yes to that.

684
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
All right, so we've got three.

685
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
All right, we'll start from there.

686
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We'll talk more in the post show.

687
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So, we'll do a community review of Open Media Vault soon.

688
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So, out there, if you're interested and you're normally one of our Mumble Participators or

689
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
if you're not and you still like to be involved, you can go over to the Linux Action Show

690
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
subreddit and we'll have a feedback thread for episode 53.

691
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And it is episode 53 of Unplugged, not 52 like the lower third said.

692
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Last but not least, I'm going to give you guys a little Oculus updates as we wait for

693
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
the Linux version.

694
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Now, you will recall I was complaining in the Linux Action Show that on the Oculus DK2

695
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
pre-order website, they list Linux support.

696
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,000
However, I do not have a working SDK or DK2 under Linux.

697
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
No, sir.

698
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
No, actually, they've just today updated their SDK for Mac.

699
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So, now Windows and Mac have SDKs, but us Linux users, bubkiss so far, bubkiss.

700
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So, the Oculus update remains, it's still negative in the freedom dimension, cannot

701
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
use it under Linux, not yet at least, but a little birdie tells me they are working

702
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
on it.

703
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's going to take some time.

704
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Kind of a bummer.

705
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Kind of a bummer.

706
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Kind of a bummer, man.

707
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm going to show it to Fade afterwards and it's like, okay, well, should I show Fade

708
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
on the Windows box or the Mac?

709
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Not great options.

710
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
No, not at all.

711
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Right?

712
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
People come over and say they want to see the Oculus and I got to boot into Windows.

713
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's disgraceful.

714
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It's disgusting.

715
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You feel dirty afterwards.

716
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Well, I always, that's why I always ask all my guests if they'd like to take a shower

717
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
with me.

718
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I always just think it's gross.

719
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It just got awkward.

720
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I can actually see his eyes get wide.

721
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Oh, hey, Fade, by the way, after the show, I had something I wanted to ask you.

722
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
All right.

723
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Before we get into our first main topic of the day, I wanted to thank our first sponsor

724
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and that is Ting.

725
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Go to linux.ting.com.

726
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
We were talking about some of the problems with the mobile industry and that is talk

727
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
about something that Ting can help clean up.

728
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Here's the thing about Ting, no contracts and no early termination fee, but maybe my

729
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
favorite part and probably Matt's too, is you only pay for what you use.

730
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's a flat $6 a month.

731
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It's $6 a month and then it's your usage.

732
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Ting takes your minutes, your megabytes, your messages, they add them all up, whatever bucket

733
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
you fall into.

734
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That's what you pay.

735
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And then the man comes along, he's like, excuse me, Ting.

736
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I got to put a little percentage on that.

737
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So then the man gets his cut, but after that, that's all you pay.

738
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's whatever you use plus the man's cut and that flat $6.

739
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And by the way, it's $6 per line.

740
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So you add more devices, you can pull your minutes together, $6.

741
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I've got three phones.

742
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's crazy.

743
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
They're all on one account and my bill is outrageously low.

744
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's great.

745
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Plus they've got a ton of phones you can buy.

746
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
They're yours.

747
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You own them outright.

748
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
They're not subsidizing the cost.

749
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
They don't trick you into paying for that phone over the life of that two year contract.

750
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You buy it upfront and own it like you do a fricking computer.

751
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's yours because these are fricking computers.

752
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
If you want to use Ting as your mobile ISP, do it.

753
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Kyra don't care.

754
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Ting don't care.

755
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Use them as your mobile ISP.

756
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
They like it.

757
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Go over to linux.ting.com.

758
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It will take $25 off your first month of Ting service.

759
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And one of the great things about Ting once you become a Ting customer is you can take

760
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
advantage of some of their really advanced functionality like their dashboard.

761
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Ting has an incredible dashboard.

762
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You can go in there, you can activate devices, deactivate devices, transfer devices, check

763
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
your minutes.

764
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
They have cool like fuel gauge status indicators of where your minutes are at.

765
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Set up short names, set up call forwarding, all the bouncing rules, all that kind of stuff

766
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
you might want to do.

767
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And then if you ever get stuck or you just don't want to be lonely, you just want to

768
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
talk to somebody, guess what?

769
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You can call them.

770
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
1-855-TING-FTW.

771
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
1-855-TING-FTW.

772
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Any time between 8am or 8pm East Coast time and a real person, a real Canadian empowered

773
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
to solve your problems answers the phone.

774
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And they're cool too.

775
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Like we've had stories of our audience members getting postcards in the mail from Ting afterwards

776
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
like signed by the person that they talked to on the phone.

777
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Be like, hey I was just thinking about you.

778
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I miss you.

779
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You know that kind of stuff.

780
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Maybe not the miss you part, but you get my drift.

781
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And every Ting plan includes hotspot, tethering, picture messaging, caller ID, three way calling,

782
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
all that stuff you would expect.

783
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Oh, you want a hotspot?

784
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Just tap the check box.

785
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You know your operating system's got it built in.

786
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Why do you have to pay your carrier some extra special like crazy ass package to get Wi-Fi?

787
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Just tap the link and just use the feature built into your operating system and then

788
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Ting just considers that to be data usage.

789
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Linux.ting.com.

790
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
That will take $25 off your first device.

791
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
If you've got a Ting compatible device and you might, you can check out their BYOD page.

792
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
If you've got a Ting compatible device, they're going to give you a $25 credit.

793
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
If you're like me, that $25 credit lasted me more than my first month.

794
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm now saving over $2,000 by switching to Ting.

795
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It's ridiculous.

796
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I could buy, I could almost, almost, almost afford a MacBook Pro with the savings I switched

797
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
by Ting.

798
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Almost.

799
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Good thing Noah would never let me have it.

800
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
But I could easily buy like an Ultra Pro.

801
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That would be a good choice.

802
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah.

803
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I've already got the money.

804
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I've already got the money for it.

805
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Wow.

806
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Because I've saved the money.

807
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I just got to convince Angela of that now.

808
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You think that logic would work with her?

809
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
No.

810
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Probably not.

811
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Maybe not.

812
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'll keep trying.

813
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
You know what I'll do is I'll keep telling her to go to linux.ting.com.

814
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You can go to linux.ting.com too.

815
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
By the way, linux.ting.com is in the, Linux, in the URL.

816
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Right?

817
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I mean, just go rocket force.

818
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Would you let them know you appreciate them supporting the Linux Unplugged show.

819
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Check out their site.

820
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
They've got a great blog too.

821
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Go check out their devices and that savings calculator.

822
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Linux.ting.com.

823
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And a really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

824
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
All right, Faith.

825
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So you've been sitting in front of that elementary OS.

826
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
We're running the brand new beta.

827
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It was just released last night.

828
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And what's it called?

829
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Freya?

830
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That's what I hear.

831
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Freya.

832
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I wrote it down and then I lost the paper I wrote it down on.

833
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's not ISIS anymore.

834
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They changed the name.

835
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It was going to.

836
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You actually pronounced it correctly.

837
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh good.

838
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So Faith, what do you think?

839
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
So this is just a super basic install.

840
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It hasn't been exactly one year since the last release of elementary OS.

841
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So Freya beta one is available for developers and testing.

842
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Now they do highly, like right up in the announcement put up there,

843
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Hey, this is not for production use.

844
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Do not put this on a production machine.

845
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It is beta.

846
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It is meant for developers.

847
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It has issues that need to be worked out.

848
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So they're really upfront about that.

849
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So the first thing I did is I promptly went out and downloaded and installed it.

850
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I want it.

851
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So did you, wait a minute.

852
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Did you just drag that mumble application between desktops

853
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
by dragging its icon down below?

854
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
No, it turns into an icon.

855
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh, it turns into an icon.

856
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
That is so cool.

857
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah, it's fantastic.

858
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Arch is cool and all, but no, I want this.

859
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So they say a few more stages remain in the development process.

860
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
They'll be addressing serious bugs before the final release.

861
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
That said, this post is going to be more technical.

862
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So they get into some technical stuff.

863
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
They're going to talk about user features in the future.

864
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's based off of Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, Linux kernel 3.13

865
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
with the new updated drivers and graphic stack.

866
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It includes support for EFI and stub loading,

867
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
which is a kernel feature that enables booting directly from UEFI

868
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
without the need for an additional bootloader such as grub, which is awesome.

869
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And we'll get back to this in a minute.

870
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
One of their developers created a step-by-step guide to actually load

871
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
elementary OS natively on MacBook Pros,

872
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
which I was just grousing about two weeks ago.

873
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Additionally, we'll be shipping the latest GTK Plus release, version 3.12,

874
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
rather than Ubuntu 14.04's outdated 3.10.

875
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
They say they're also working on the Pantheon online accounts.

876
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It's not necessarily a fork of Gnome's.

877
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Unlike Ubuntu online accounts, it's GLib-based.

878
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Unlike Gnome online accounts, it's fully extensible.

879
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
With Pantheon online accounts, you get the best of both worlds out of the box.

880
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
They're going to have Facebook, Fastmail, Google Plus, Microsoft, and Yahoo support.

881
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And then you'll be able to add more integration for other stuff.

882
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Like right now, they don't have own cloud.

883
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
This online account thing is actually a little neater than I originally kind of gave it credit

884
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
because you set this up, and now you can tweet from your desktop.

885
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Your calendar syncs, so when you click the little calendar,

886
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
all of your Google Calendar or whatever you synced it up to,

887
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Microsoft, Yahoo, all show up in the calendar.

888
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's kind of a neat service.

889
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And the fact that their support's plug-ins is nice.

890
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
They also out-of-the-box client-side decorations.

891
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
One of the new features of GTK 3.12, obviously, is the ability to use client-side decorations.

892
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So they've made extensive use of the feature there, right?

893
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Every GTK 3 window in Freya is decorated on the client side

894
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
with no extra work needed from the app developers.

895
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
That's also important from a Wayland standpoint.

896
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The Wayland developers strongly believe that things should be client-side.

897
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
They say there's still a few hundred bugs, though,

898
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
like CalDAV syncing issues, search issues, and things like that.

899
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:42,000
But, Matt, what we have is a beta 1 that is very functional-looking, really polished.

900
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Let's phrase this. Let's set this up.

901
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
We're in an era now where we've obviously spoken about some discontent with Ubuntu.

902
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And there is a need for something stable, something elegant,

903
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
something that maybe we would look at home on one of the more popular netbooks

904
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that seems to be selling these days, the MacBook.

905
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Is elementary OS enough, Matt?

906
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Is it enough of a desktop operating system that it could be as successful as Ubuntu proper?

907
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I think potentially I would need to spend a little more time with it,

908
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
and more importantly, how I foresee it or how I use it as a material.

909
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It's how I drop it in front of just people that might be Ubuntu targets and how they perceive it.

910
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
If it's successful in that space, then potentially, then potentially.

911
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
But I think that's something that needs to happen,

912
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
is we need to get it out of the echo chamber and actually get it in front of real people.

913
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So Josh, I know you're running it in the mumble room, right? What do you think so far?

914
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm loving it. Interestingly enough, one of the things I was most excited about

915
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
is the fact that the calendar is actually useful now.

916
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
You can actually sync stuff with it now, which is like, I know,

917
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
how could they ship a calendar that doesn't even let you sync with Google?

918
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But it does now. Files now have search functionality,

919
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
and it doesn't have the stupid type of head stuff that the current Nautilus has.

920
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Oh, I like that. Yeah, that's nice. That's frustrating under Nautilus.

921
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah, it's incredibly frustrating.

922
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
The music app doesn't screw up when you have a large amount of music now, which is nice.

923
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Josh, does it feel too much like an OS X clone to you?

924
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I mean, you know, it's got the metal, it's got brushed metal look, it's got a dock below.

925
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Right, but I mean, you know what else has a dock?

926
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Xyburn 2.

927
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You know, it's just like, it's a different way of handling your current running application.

928
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Maybe it's better.

929
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
You know what else has a dock? Unity is just on the left-hand side.

930
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
My gnome desktop.

931
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yeah, you know, I like it.

932
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But the brushed metal, right? I mean, isn't that the thing that stands out the most?

933
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I mean, you look at Midori under this, it looks like Safari to me, right?

934
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Yeah.

935
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Does that bother you at all?

936
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Yeah, I mean, I like it. It does have a lot of strong resemblance to OS X.

937
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But, you know, they have done a lot of specific things to elementary OS to make it different from OS X.

938
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And I think the line to walk is, can you be inspired by a desktop,

939
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
but yet still do your own enough unique take on it that essentially what you're doing is adopting some of the best elements

940
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and innovating in your own areas.

941
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And I think it's fair to say that elementary OS does that.

942
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I feel like it. What do you think, Fadi? You've been using it for a little bit.

943
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I think it's pretty, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

944
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
You might make comparisons, but any comparison you see in a negative light could just as easily be interpreted as a benefit.

945
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,000
For example, people that might be familiar with that look or even just subconsciously aware of it from commercials or whatever.

946
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It looks good, and it works really well, and I really like it.

947
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Well, and there is something about it.

948
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Like, when you see a screenshot of elementary OS on a piece of hardware, it looks good.

949
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Like, it does justifiably look good.

950
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But, Eric, it's not all about the look or the applications or the unique apps that they've built for it.

951
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
There's also, at least for Linux enthusiasts, the whole community aspect of it too, right?

952
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
That's absolutely true.

953
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
One thing that has been bugging me about the elementary OS, I think they're probably a great group of guys.

954
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I've never had the pleasure of meeting them, but here's what I've been seeing.

955
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Their community management sucks.

956
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And the reason I'm saying that is because there are people who want to be involved with the project to help them get some of these bugs down

957
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
so they're not taking so freaking long to get the distro out there.

958
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
There are people who want to help, and they're like, no, we don't want you helping.

959
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
We don't want you helping.

960
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
We're going to do this all ourselves and take so freaking long, and it'll be ready when it's ready.

961
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Well, they want help, but they want it via BountySource, right?

962
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
For them, they say, we have over 5,000 worth of bounties remain unclaimed on BountySource.com.

963
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Anyone can contribute to fix and earn bounties.

964
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Eric, here's where I think you're getting confused.

965
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
The people that were saying, oh, I want to report these bugs, I want to help fix it,

966
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
those were individuals that were running unofficial, unstable ISOs or ISOs that they've built themselves.

967
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
They were not running any sort of beta.

968
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,000
What they were doing was they were saying, okay, I'm going to use this build script and create my own thing that might resemble elementary OS.

969
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Of course, the developers are going to say, no, no, no.

970
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:20,000
If you want to help, go fix the bugs or contribute monetarily if you don't have any programming experience or you don't know Vala and GDK.

971
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Yes, you're right.

972
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
They should have been downloading the ISOs according to them, but then how does anybody do any bug reports?

973
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
That just doesn't compute.

974
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You let the core development team focus on the issues at task for beta one,

975
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:47,000
and then the beta is used to figure out any issues that the core development team couldn't figure out that the community knows of,

976
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
and then those issues get resolved before stable.

977
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Okay, they are the only Linux distro community I know of that does that.

978
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
There's a lot of things they do that are unique.

979
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:08,000
When this beta hit, because I don't follow it super closely and there's not really a lot of public postings about it,

980
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I wasn't sure, is this one also based on 12.04 or is it based on 14.04?

981
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I didn't know any of that.

982
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I had to ask people in the community because I don't grok how I'm supposed to be receiving information from the elementary OS project

983
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
if I want more than just when they make big announcements.

984
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I want more than that, but I don't need much more than that.

985
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
That's my other point, is that when they do give out information, they don't give enough.

986
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah, I can understand.

987
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Maybe they're trying to do some sort of Skunk Works project.

988
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And branding. It's a little bit about branding.

989
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah, a little bit about branding, but the thing is there is this community of people who just want to help.

990
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I have a degree in volunteer management, basically.

991
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I know what it takes to make volunteers work.

992
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
If everybody has a common vision, it's great.

993
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:06,000
The thing is, it's harder to manage volunteers, I can understand that, because you're not holding a paycheck over their head.

994
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
But at the same time, you need to let people get involved in your project.

995
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:23,000
At the same time, though, I want to, in a way, give them room to try something unique and different than all the other distros are doing.

996
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I feel like we need that, because maybe that will be the right combination that finally results in massive success.

997
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
From a usability standpoint and a consistency standpoint, I think they're getting there.

998
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,000
What we have seen so far is a distribution that has decided it doesn't need to quite follow the standard distro mold.

999
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:52,000
That might, while it might be hard for us to figure out how to fit into our established paradigms of interacting with Linux communities,

1000
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
maybe a little bit of medicine that we need to swallow, eventually, down the road.

1001
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:03,000
But I think the problem is, them as a project, figuring out what that means and how to pull that off and how to do it successfully

1002
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
is going to be changing for a while as they grow and get established. Does that make sense?

1003
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Well, I think they've also... I'm sorry, Faye, go ahead.

1004
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
No, it makes sense to me. One thing I just wanted to throw in while we're talking about it is that their choice of Midori,

1005
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I think that's an excellent choice, because not only are you providing something that consistently is elegant in its design,

1006
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
but most users that you're installing an OS2 that aren't technically savvy,

1007
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
they're probably going to be using the web browser most of the time, and choosing something that's so low resource

1008
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
would indicate that it would perform well, as long as they have the graphics to support the compositing.

1009
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah, and it's very fast, it's very functional, it does feel like a perfectly integrated app.

1010
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Now, for me, I'm like, oh, what about my Markdown plugins and stuff like that? But for regular folks, it's fine.

1011
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah, they have some extensions, but there isn't a lot.

1012
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yeah, no. I've played with it a little bit. I like to use it for one of my Google account logins.

1013
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
My gripes aside, I think they're doing a fantastic job.

1014
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
No, I think it's a fair point to make, because it's something I've kind of grappled with, too, is it doesn't quite click.

1015
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Sometimes I go in there and I'm like, am I even supposed to be reporting on this?

1016
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I wasn't sure if I should even be talking about this story today, or am I going to get crap from the elementary project

1017
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
for talking about something that isn't ready to be talked about yet.

1018
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Honestly, before we even went on air, I was like, maybe we shouldn't do this on the show, because I don't want to piss them off.

1019
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And then I thought, if they're putting out a beta, they're obviously okay with some, and we're not reviewing it as a distro yet.

1020
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
We're going to wait until it gets finalized.

1021
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But I guess what I'm saying is, that thought would never have crossed my mind with any other Linux distro, ever.

1022
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Never has ever in the history of any show I've ever done.

1023
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
This is the first time the thought has ever crossed my mind.

1024
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And it's one of the reasons I don't like covering some of the commercial software spaces, because who wants to worry about that crap?

1025
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's nice that it's all open source.

1026
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:01,000
The key thing is, you wouldn't do any logical individual, wouldn't put a review up, whether it be a video or something,

1027
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and point out, oh, you shouldn't be running this operating system if it's a beta.

1028
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Say for instance, Ubuntu 14.10 beta 1 in the future.

1029
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It wouldn't be logical to do a completely different video review or something.

1030
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
You wait until it's so stable.

1031
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I think too, let's be frank, whatever they're doing is working from a PR standpoint.

1032
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Because before this beta hit, the first story I saw on the subreddit was a countdown.

1033
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Like we got the countdown thing to the beta release, and everybody's like, oh my gosh, the countdown page is up.

1034
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And everybody started talking about the countdown page.

1035
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And then within a couple of hours after the countdown page, boom, beta hits.

1036
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And then links on every single freaking Linux website in the world are linking to the new elementary OS beta.

1037
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And OMG, Ubuntu's got a write-up about it before they even have made an official post.

1038
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And everybody's freaking out, now we're talking about it the next day.

1039
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It generates buzz.

1040
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Well, and it works. And I think you kind of nailed on something very important.

1041
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
The reason why they make a lot of stuff that we take for granted really difficult to do

1042
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
is because they've looked at other proprietary models that have done the same thing, and they found that it works.

1043
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Is it attractive to us? No.

1044
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Is it attractive to people that want to talk about it? Yeah, apparently so.

1045
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I guess so. It's working.

1046
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Well, and it's almost like they give us enough for us to talk, but not enough that we all fill in the gaps.

1047
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
It's almost like the Apple approach, where they eek out a little rumors, like they give some to the Wall Street Journal.

1048
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
That's exactly what they're doing. Yeah.

1049
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's kind of funny. Here we are getting played, but I kind of like it.

1050
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
At the same time, it's fun to kind of conjecture about it, too.

1051
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
They got me. All right, well, they're doing something really smart.

1052
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I think, you know, we talked about mobile devices and phones and tablets.

1053
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The elementary OS project, though, and I don't even know if it's all that official,

1054
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,000
is doing something incredibly smart when it comes to hardware support that might give them the edge up in the long run.

1055
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But first, I want to thank Linux Academy.

1056
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Go over to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug.

1057
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
That'll get you the summer of learning discount 33% off,

1058
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
and Linux Academy is an awesome resource created by some really passionate Linux enthusiasts,

1059
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
always adding new content to it, which I love.

1060
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Their training division is so passionate about this stuff.

1061
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So, have you checked out Linux Academy? Because you really should.

1062
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
They've got step-by-step video courses. They have downloadable comprehensive study guides.

1063
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
You can grab on your MP3 player and listen to it while you're in the goal.

1064
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
If you're like, Listener Seth, you can listen in the shower. No judgey.

1065
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It comes with your own server, too, so if you need to spin up a virtual server during the coursework, don't worry about it.

1066
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
They got it covered, man. You get there in the coursework, boom, on the back end, they spun up a virtual server.

1067
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
You're doing AWS, good on you. Don't pay for AWS.

1068
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Linux Academy has it covered. You get to the point in the course where we need a virtual server, they spin it up.

1069
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I think that's incredible. Plus, you can choose from any 7 Plus Linux distributions,

1070
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
and they'll automatically adjust the courseware to match that distribution, which I think is pretty sweet.

1071
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And one of the things that I like about their system is they're not just adding content every single week,

1072
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
but they're also now involving livestream Q&A, so that way you can go right to the educator and ask them a question.

1073
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And then they post them up later on, too, so even if you aren't able to attend the live event,

1074
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
you can still benefit from the Q&A session.

1075
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
They have self-paced labs as well, so if you're somebody like me who just wants to go in and tinker to learn something

1076
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
and just have a little intellectual stimulation and advance my skill set from time to time, that's perfect.

1077
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But if you're also somebody who needs to land that next contract, if you're somebody who just wants to better themselves,

1078
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and I've thought about this a lot, and one of the things I like about Linux Academy from a Linux user standpoint

1079
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
is it allows me to stay competitive and keep my skills up, even when I'm not necessarily working with these technologies anymore,

1080
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:38,000
because as I've pulled back from the contracting world, I've had this weird sensation where I feel like maybe some of my skill set has slipped,

1081
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
or maybe I'm just not quite as sharp as I used to be.

1082
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So in a way, I get to test my mettle with Linux Academy, and there's very few things in my life that I have control over.

1083
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I just have to be honest about that.

1084
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
But my own bettification, my own education, that is something I do have control over.

1085
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I think it's so important to go in and investigate the things that intellectually stimulate me,

1086
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
and to sort of indulge in that.

1087
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
And what a great way to entertain myself, too.

1088
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
It really is a form of entertainment, and what I love, and it's no pressure,

1089
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
because I can look at the courseware beforehand.

1090
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I'll see how long something's going to take, and I can say, you know what?

1091
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I can dedicate 15 minutes, or I can dedicate an hour tonight.

1092
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And then when I go back in, I can resume right where I left off.

1093
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I can go test myself, too, to see if I've slipped at all.

1094
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
It's really fun.

1095
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1096
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Go get that Summer of Learning discount.

1097
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
There's never been a better time to better yourself just a little bit.

1098
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1099
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Go check them out.

1100
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I think you'll be really impressed.

1101
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Also, they've got a great community as well, which us Linux users know is super important.

1102
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
So, I want to talk about something I think the elementary project is not even officially embracing yet,

1103
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
but the people that are involved with the project are doing,

1104
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and if it continues and they're successful with it,

1105
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:57,000
it almost is answering a couple of topics that we have covered on the Linux Unplugged show for a couple of weeks now.

1106
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
So, first off, I want to give them props.

1107
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
In their release announcement, they linked to a step-by-step guide

1108
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
to getting elementary OS Freya or Isis on a Mac using REFI,

1109
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
and you can dual boot or single boot,

1110
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
and it is an out-of-the-box native elementary OS experience on a Mac.

1111
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And I think more, I want to give them so much credit for this,

1112
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
because more distributions need to come to the realization that people are buying Macbooks

1113
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
and they need to make their crap work on the Macbooks.

1114
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And I know in some people it's a bad, bitter pill to swallow, but it is the reality.

1115
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And the fact that elementary OS is like, pfft, here you go.

1116
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
You want to try out our beta?

1117
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Not only can you do it, here's a step-by-step guide for this beta.

1118
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Genius.

1119
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Genius on their part.

1120
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Could be huge.

1121
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I don't know if you guys have heard of this thing called YUM?

1122
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Do you know what YUM stands for, Fade?

1123
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I don't know what it stands for.

1124
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I know what it is and what it does, but no.

1125
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yellow Dog Update Manager.

1126
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Bingo.

1127
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And why is Yellow Dog Update Manager still remembered?

1128
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Because there was Yellow Dog Linux.

1129
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And what was Yellow Dog Linux known for?

1130
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And why did Fedora adopt YUM?

1131
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Because it ran on Macs.

1132
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
It was the distro.

1133
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
If you were going to run it on a Mac, this was the distro you went to.

1134
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
They became world famous for that.

1135
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And elementary OS could be going down the same path.

1136
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Only not just Mac anymore.

1137
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Not just for Mac, because they also have released a really easy way to install elementary OS on Chromebooks.

1138
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So now they've got Chromebooks and Macs that is super simple to get elementary OS running on those bad mamas.

1139
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I think that is sweet.

1140
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I think that is a super smart move on their part.

1141
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
They call it ChromEOS.

1142
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Chrome E-E-O-S.

1143
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Of course, don't call it E-O-S.

1144
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Users will be able to boot into either Chrome OS or elementary OS, whichever they like.

1145
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Right now it has been tested on the Acer C720.

1146
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
It has also been on the HP Chromebook 14.

1147
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And I guess the Acer C720 profile edition, I'm not sure.

1148
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And the Acer's partner Chromebook also has been tested and verified.

1149
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So here you go.

1150
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Elementary OS is saying, here is the new hardware landscape reality.

1151
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
On the low end you've got Chromebooks and we've got millions of them.

1152
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And on the high end you've got Macbooks and we've got millions of them.

1153
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
We want to be the distribution that is easy to install.

1154
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Noah, I'd really like to hear your thoughts.

1155
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I think sometimes you get the impression that I don't want people to own Macbooks because I have something against people owning Macbooks in and of itself.

1156
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:33,000
If you told me I'm buying a Macbook to install Linux on it, I think that would be fantastic.

1157
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I just don't believe it happens.

1158
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And it worries me, even if somebody honestly believed that they were going to go to Best Buy and they were going to buy a Macbook and then they were going to take it home and install Linux,

1159
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I would be really concerned that when they get home and they get into OS X, they're just not going to leave OS X.

1160
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Whereas I have a lot higher confidence that if somebody bought a Windows 8 machine, they're for sure putting Linux on it.

1161
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Why wouldn't they?

1162
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I argue that I still think in your scenario of the Macbook buyer, there's still a percentage of peel off from that, the people that are unsatisfied with the sandbox and want out.

1163
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And even that percentage of that peel off is still more people probably collectively that are using the Linux desktop all told.

1164
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And so if we give them an escape hatch that is 5, 10, 15 steps and they pull that lever and now they're out of the operating system on their hardware they already own, I think that's genius.

1165
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
So could you clarify that?

1166
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:42,000
You said that you think that the number of people that are using Macbooks that want to progress to something else is greater than the entire desktop Linux user base currently?

1167
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Potentially.

1168
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And I'm talking over years, right?

1169
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I'm not talking instantaneously right now.

1170
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I'm talking about future Macbook sales too.

1171
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Okay, fair enough.

1172
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Because I think you get there.

1173
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Like I hear from developers, like we just read an email on Coda Radio on Monday and the guy's name is Texas Linux user and he's switching to a Macbook.

1174
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And I think guys like Texas Linux users will switch to a Macbook and then about a year later or two years later they'll be like hands up in the air, I can't take this anymore, I'm so bored.

1175
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I've mastered this system, it's not changing, they're going in a direction I don't like, I'm ready for something else.

1176
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And he'll find something like elementary OS and be able to load it on that Macbook.

1177
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Recently I was looking for a computer.

1178
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I ended up with a System76 because I wanted to support Linux as a whole.

1179
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:39,000
But when I was looking, a lot of people want a laptop to do their work on because it's portable and there aren't a lot of good laptops.

1180
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Here's why the Macbook math, here's how it works out.

1181
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Because everybody's like, oh, it's so expensive.

1182
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Well, okay, make this list of requirements.

1183
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I want a usable resolution on my screen.

1184
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I want an i7 processor or i5 processor.

1185
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I want SSD.

1186
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I want it under this weight and I want it with this much battery life.

1187
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Depending on what your answer is to those questions, you very quickly come down to almost only a Macbook or a ThinkPad or maybe like a high, like there's like three machines, four machines really to choose from that are great.

1188
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And so the fact that the Macbook's getting picked a lot isn't that surprising when you look at it for that lens.

1189
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And I'm with you, Fay.

1190
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Like if I was out to buy one right now, out of that list that I just said, it would be the Ultra Pro for me because my primary operating system would be Linux.

1191
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Would I consider a Macbook?

1192
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Maybe if the support was perfect.

1193
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I'm a developer.

1194
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I get a Macbook.

1195
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Yeah, I think some people would do because they're like, the other thing is like the Macbook's like, well, I have this option.

1196
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Like if Linux doesn't work out for me, I can bail to the Mac.

1197
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I think some people look at it that way too.

1198
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:47,000
So that's where I think elementary OS just being here, having an operating system that's very well designed.

1199
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So like you're not going to feel like you're having a big experience downgrade by switching from Mac OS to elementary OS and the fact that they've got this guide to install it on and dual boot too.

1200
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And the Chromebook.

1201
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Who else is doing this?

1202
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
What are the distros doing this?

1203
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
The Chromebook though.

1204
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
That's great.

1205
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I mean, hey, you see you got a Chromebook.

1206
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
You want to use something other than a web browser?

1207
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
There you go.

1208
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yeah.

1209
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I can't.

1210
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I mean, it is possible with any distro, but I don't know of anybody that's making it this easy.

1211
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Matt, do you think that makes a difference?

1212
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I would definitely agree with the Chromebook.

1213
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I think you're on crack when it comes to people.

1214
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
You and I live with Mac users.

1215
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Let's be honest.

1216
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
You could light them on fire before they switch to Linux.

1217
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It's not going to happen.

1218
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Yes.

1219
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I mean, they would use it over Windows, but my wife especially, she'll use Linux.

1220
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
She just begrudgingly, but she won't touch a Windows box with a 20 foot pole.

1221
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
But she's trapped in an ecosystem of does it provide me what I want?

1222
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Yes.

1223
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Good.

1224
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Great.

1225
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I'm done.

1226
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It gives me the tools I want to do stuff with.

1227
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
So going back to the Chromebook, however, that I would agree with because Chromebook's

1228
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
experience is great if you're like 18 and going into college, but I think if you want

1229
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
to actually...

1230
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Or on the other end too, like you're retired, maybe all you need to do is check in with

1231
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
the kid's Facebook feed.

1232
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Exactly.

1233
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Or you want to...

1234
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Yeah, exactly.

1235
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
You want to...

1236
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
It's like, and then you discover, oh yeah, I wanted to use Skype.

1237
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Sorry.

1238
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Too bad.

1239
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Little things crop up like that.

1240
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
All of a sudden elementary OS then makes a lot of sense on that type of machine for sure.

1241
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And there's a lot of them out there too, right?

1242
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And the price of the Chromebook is so low that you're not that afraid to experiment

1243
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
with it a little bit.

1244
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Well, maybe your fancy MacBook is a little riskier because it could be like a $2,000

1245
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
computer, whereas a Chromebook could be like a $200 computer.

1246
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Definitely.

1247
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Go ahead.

1248
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Do you remember last week when I said, I don't think it was on the show, but I said last

1249
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
week I bought a Chromebox and I was playing with it and I really liked it, but I'd never

1250
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
put it into production?

1251
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah.

1252
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Six hours later I get a call from one of my clients who said, one of the computers died

1253
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
and we need a new one here right now.

1254
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And I said, well, Dell is 24 hours, 48 hours before I'm going to get a new one out.

1255
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And they said, well, we need something right this second.

1256
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Right, of course.

1257
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
So like an idiot, I take the Chrome...

1258
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Because they're using Linux.

1259
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Like an idiot, I take the Chromebox, I install Ubuntu, and I think to myself, why would anyone

1260
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
restart the Chromebox within 24 hours?

1261
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Of course not, right?

1262
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
You can sit there for 24 hours, right?

1263
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Nobody.

1264
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
You don't need to, right?

1265
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Yeah.

1266
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah.

1267
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Turns out she walks into the room and goes, I don't like which plug he plugged that in

1268
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
because the cord drips across my desk.

1269
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Unplugs and plugs it into the different plug.

1270
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Turns the machine on.

1271
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It says, press space bar to enable...

1272
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Hits the space bar, dumps the OS, and then I said to myself, didn't I just tell Chris

1273
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
six hours ago I'd never put this into production because this exact thing would happen?

1274
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It's the worst, Noah.

1275
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
So there are risks to running Linux on, if you're not an experienced user, you don't

1276
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
understand...

1277
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I mean, if you're putting it on yourself, you probably know what's happening, but this

1278
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
idea that we can install Linux on Chromeboxes like we do on everyone else's laptop, I'm

1279
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
hesitant to do that.

1280
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
True.

1281
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Yeah, you'd have to...

1282
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
That's an excellent example.

1283
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
You'd want to be able...

1284
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Because there is a way to disable that space bar thing, right?

1285
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
But you have to do it within Chrome OS.

1286
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You have to be able to write to the...

1287
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
C BIOS?

1288
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
The firmware.

1289
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Yeah, and so on certain Chrome devices, you can take out a write protect screw.

1290
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I haven't figured out how to do it on the Chromebox yet.

1291
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Yeah, and I know there's different ways for different machines, too.

1292
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Yeah, that's the tricky part.

1293
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Boy, isn't that just a little dose of reality, though?

1294
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
It's what I deserve.

1295
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Yeah.

1296
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I was like, well, that would have been really great if that would have worked out.

1297
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
No kidding.

1298
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Well, you know what, Noah, I feel for you.

1299
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I think it'll be interesting to watch elementary OS, though, when the final version hits.

1300
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Do they sell it all as one big...

1301
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
This is your one platform for your MacBook, your PC desktop, and your Chromebook.

1302
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
The one distribution.

1303
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Of course, they all do it, right?

1304
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
But they'll sell it as the one distribution that runs on all of them.

1305
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
That'll be interesting to see when the ISIS version 1.0...

1306
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I have Freya.

1307
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Freya.

1308
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Froyo.

1309
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Freya.

1310
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I'm trying.

1311
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

1312
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I'm sorry.

1313
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
It's difficult.

1314
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I liked ISIS.

1315
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Okay?

1316
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Yeah, that's true.

1317
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
So I'm not thinking of the Islamic State of Syria.

1318
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I'm thinking about the Linux distribution, okay?

1319
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
You are now thinking.

1320
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Well, I am now, right.

1321
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Yes.

1322
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Also, we are bombing them.

1323
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
But I'm not thinking about that right now.

1324
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
That's tomorrow.

1325
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That's tomorrow's problem.

1326
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
All right.

1327
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Well, we got a couple of interesting things coming up.

1328
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
In fact, one of them involves Noah and a couple other things that...

1329
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Oh, I got a call out, too.

1330
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Oh, shoot.

1331
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Let me grab that right here.

1332
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
First, I will thank our last sponsor for this week, and that is the great folks over at

1333
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
DigitalOcean.

1334
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I have now...

1335
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I am now the proud operator, and I consider myself an operator, like, in the matrix style

1336
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
of operator, of three DigitalOcean droplets.

1337
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Why?

1338
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Because DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

1339
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

1340
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Users can create a cloud server in about 55 seconds.

1341
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
If you're a boss, you can probably get it done in less than 55 seconds.

1342
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And the pricing plans, they only start at $5 a month.

1343
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And here's what you get.

1344
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
512 megabytes of RAM.

1345
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
20 gigabyte SSD.

1346
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
One CPU.

1347
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And a terabyte of transfer for $5.

1348
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Okay?

1349
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
That's cheaper than, like, a lot of pro services for, like, file sync.

1350
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
And you could do everything on your own Dropbox...

1351
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
On your own DigitalOcean Dropbox Droplet thing if you want.

1352
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
You could make it a Dropbox.

1353
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Make it a BitTorrent sync.

1354
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Make it a sync thing.

1355
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I'm using own cloud.

1356
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Make it an own cloud thing.

1357
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
At $5 a month, it can do all of the things.

1358
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
And what I love is that 20 gigabyte SSD gets you that density you need to do that.

1359
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

1360
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
or London.

1361
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
So you've got a lot of geographical locations to choose from.

1362
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
But let's talk about that control panel.

1363
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
It is simple and intuitive.

1364
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
The DigitalOcean control panel rocks.

1365
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And power users can replicate it on a much larger scale with their straightforward API.

1366
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
It's all done in HTML5.

1367
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
No Flash required.

1368
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Nothing funky like that.

1369
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You just get in there.

1370
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
You get access to the console.

1371
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
You can watch it from post all the way up to boot.

1372
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
It's awesome.

1373
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It's really awesome.

1374
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
All done in HTML5.

1375
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
You can deploy a Droplet easily.

1376
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
They've got lots of Linux distributions you can choose from.

1377
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
They've got one-click application installs, which is super handy if you want to do WordPress

1378
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
or GitLab.

1379
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,000
DNS management, Droplet backups, private networking, all running on top of Linux, all using open

1380
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
source technology wrapped around this incredible dashboard for an unbelievable price.

1381
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
But we've got a deal for you.

1382
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
If you use the promo code unpluggedaugust, that's all one word.

1383
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And just like your file system, like it should be, lowercase.

1384
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Case sensitive here.

1385
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
All lowercase.

1386
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
You know why it's case sensitive?

1387
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Linux.

1388
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Linux.

1389
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
So go over to digitalocean.com, use the promo code unpluggedaugust, and you'll get the $10

1390
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
credit.

1391
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Then you could try out that $5 rig that I've been using for a while for two months absolutely

1392
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
free.

1393
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Digitalocean.com.

1394
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Unplugged August when you check out.

1395
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And try out a DigitalOcean Droplet.

1396
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Do you have your own root server up in the cloud?

1397
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You should.

1398
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Because you can do anything with it.

1399
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
You want to make it a game server?

1400
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Do it.

1401
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
You want to make it a web server?

1402
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
You want to make it the backend for an app?

1403
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
You want to do anything on cloud?

1404
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Do it, boy.

1405
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Go over there.

1406
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Use the promo code unpluggedaugust when you check out.

1407
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And don't forget, DigitalOcean rocks hard.

1408
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
You can actually apply those promo codes retroactively.

1409
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
So if you forgot because, I don't know, maybe you were drinking.

1410
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Are you drinking right now?

1411
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Put the beer down.

1412
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Go over to digitalocean.com and put in that promo code unpluggedaugust.

1413
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
It'll let you retroactively apply it.

1414
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Digitalocean.com.

1415
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Unplugged August when you check out.

1416
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And a really big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

1417
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
All right, guys.

1418
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
A couple of last bits of business to take care of before we get out of here.

1419
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
You know, I got Linus Torvalds' treadmill.

1420
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Did you know that?

1421
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I did.

1422
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
That's how I power the studio now.

1423
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I'm not doing it right now because I have a guest.

1424
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
But if you weren't here, I probably would.

1425
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So is the treadmill before or after the shower?

1426
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I mean, that's really the big question.

1427
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I get it.

1428
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I need a shower after the treadmill, Matt.

1429
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I tell you what.

1430
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Hey, we have a couple of upcoming things I want to tell you guys about just to put them

1431
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
on your radar.

1432
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Ohio Linux Fest registrations are now open.

1433
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Mr. Q5 Sis, Noah, and myself will be traveling over to Ohio in October for Ohio Linux Fest.

1434
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
We will attempt to do a live stream, and Matt will be here in studio, I assume, or somewhere

1435
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
on Skype.

1436
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
And this is going to be fun.

1437
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's going to be like this weird, complicated remote setup that I'm strangely looking forward

1438
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
to trying out.

1439
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I don't know what's up with that.

1440
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
So you can go over.

1441
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I'll have a link in the show notes if you want to go to Ohio Linux Fest 2014 and see

1442
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
us there.

1443
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
That would be awesome.

1444
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
We do a little fist bump.

1445
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,000
And before that, even before then, Mr. Noah, Colonel Linux there in the chat room, is going

1446
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,000
to be at LinuxCon in Chicago on the 20th, I think.

1447
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So if you're going to be at LinuxCon and you want to fist bump Noah, say hi to him.

1448
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Or if you are a project that would potentially like to chat with Noah, email us, production

1449
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
at JupiterBroadcasting.com, and maybe we can get in touch.

1450
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Noah, I've already had people ask me from the Fedora camp they want to meet up with

1451
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
you.

1452
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
So you're already in demand.

1453
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
All right.

1454
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
So that'll be fun.

1455
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
You guys can say hi to Noah.

1456
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Because of the short notice, we weren't able to make it.

1457
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
But it was actually kind of a cool thing that happened.

1458
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
The Linux Foundation saw our OSCON coverage and also the self coverage and the Linux Fest

1459
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
coverage.

1460
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
And they just said, we would love to have you.

1461
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
What could we do to get you guys to LinuxCon?

1462
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
And I said, well, a time machine, because it's 20 days from now.

1463
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Actually, it's less than that now.

1464
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And she said, well, I don't have a time machine.

1465
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
And I said, well, let me email Noah.

1466
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
And Noah, being awesome, was like totally down.

1467
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
No, you know what Noah said to me?

1468
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Yeah, just let me know, oh, by the 18th, if I need to go there to Chicago.

1469
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
That's great.

1470
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I know, right?

1471
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
So LinuxCon coming up.

1472
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Then after that, Ohio Linux Fest in October.

1473
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
LinuxCon will be this month.

1474
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
We'll have interviews and clips in our shows, just like you've come to expect from some

1475
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
of our other coverage.

1476
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
And Noah always does great interviews.

1477
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I also have a little tech support question I want to put out there to the audience.

1478
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,000
This problem has been eating at me literally for fricking years.

1479
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
You probably noticed it too.

1480
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It's probably bothered the heck out of you.

1481
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Let's solve this problem together.

1482
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:46,000
The fricking Linux action show RSS feed in podcatchers never shows the damn badge.

1483
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
So if you subscribe to the Linux action show in a podcatcher, all your podcasts got the

1484
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
beautiful artwork in there.

1485
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
And then you scroll through your list, and there's herpa derpa Linux action show with

1486
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
the default app badge.

1487
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Because for whatever reason, feed burner's a jerk and it won't show the image.

1488
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I have trouble shot the snot out of this.

1489
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
If you would take a look at our Linux action show RSS feed, like say grab the MP3 RSS feed

1490
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
right off our site.

1491
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Run that.

1492
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
If you're some sort of RSS whiz or something like that, please take a look at that SOB

1493
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
and tell me what we're doing wrong.

1494
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Because we have verified our local XML.

1495
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
We have set up feed burner six ways to the sun to try to support an image.

1496
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
All of the other shows on all of, for every show we've ever done on the network don't

1497
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
have this problem.

1498
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Frickin Linux action show has this problem.

1499
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And I almost wonder if it's because the feed existed before iTunes existed and before artwork

1500
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
in a feed was common.

1501
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And I don't know if that's what the problem is.

1502
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Help me Obi-Wan.

1503
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
You're my only hope audience.

1504
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I've literally been fighting this for a long time.

1505
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I would love your input.

1506
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
And I have a link in the show notes for more information about that.

1507
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So please.

1508
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
You know.

1509
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I know, right?

1510
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's just one of those things that's like annoying.

1511
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I'm looking at it now and this thing's bigger than my house as far as a logo.

1512
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
That's the more.

1513
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I wonder.

1514
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
That's the more.

1515
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
No, I upped it because I thought, well, maybe it was too low res because it was really old.

1516
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
It was like this old picture of Brian and I like on a Mac, on a Mac.

1517
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Right.

1518
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Because we're doing a computer action show.

1519
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Yeah.

1520
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And then I put the new logo in there.

1521
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Yeah.

1522
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I'll go through my old notes because I actually ran into this like a few years ago.

1523
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Long, long time ago.

1524
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
And I actually found a solution for it.

1525
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
So let me see if I can dig that up.

1526
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Oh, Odin in the chat room says it's because I'm on a rolling distribution.

1527
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
That makes sense.

1528
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Well, that's it.

1529
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Clearly.

1530
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And HTML5.

1531
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
You don't use HTML5.

1532
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Yeah.

1533
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
You guys are jerks.

1534
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
You use Open Broadcaster, right?

1535
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Wait.

1536
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Why not?

1537
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And Mumble.

1538
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Actually, I do use Mumble.

1539
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
All right.

1540
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
We want your feedback.

01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000

We do this show over at jblive.tv.

If you want to be in our chat room, that's great.

1559

You get to help us title the show either way, and we always appreciate you being here.

1561
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Matt, is there anything else we want to cover on this episode of Linux Unplugged before

1562
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
we wrap this ass up?

1563
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I think that's about it.

1564
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Nice.

1565
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
All right.

1566
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Well, I'll just mention real briefly that we have some good interviews coming up on

1567
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
the Linux Action Show, potentially this Sunday, depending if everything works out, and definitely

1568
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
the next Sunday.

1569
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
So don't miss episodes of Linux Action Show or in the can.

1570
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
So Matt, prepare your brain for that and your body.

1571
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Maybe double up on the underwear for this Sunday's Linux Action Show, okay?

1572
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Sounds good.

1573
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
All right, Matt.

1574
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I'll see you on Sunday.

1575
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
See you then.

1576
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
It's a little dirty.

1577
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I'm sorry, Matt.

1578
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I'm sorry.

1579
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
All right, everyone.

1580
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Thank you so much for joining us on this week's episode.

1581
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Fate, thanks for joining us in studio, buddy.

1582
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Yeah, no problem.

1583
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
My pleasure.

1584
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
It was good having you here.

1585
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
It's nice having somebody here to look over at and be like, boom, what do you think of

1586
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
that?

1587
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Yeah, yeah.

1588
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Gotcha.

1589
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
All right, everyone.

1590
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Don't forget, we want your feedback.

1591
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Don't forget to check out github.com.

1592
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Join us live.

1593
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I've told you all of that stuff already.

1594
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,840
And last but not least, go grab one of our RSS feeds, and this show's RSS feed actually

1595
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,840
has the artwork.

1596
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,840
So hey, that's good too, right?

1597
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,840
That's a good bonus.

1598
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,840
All right, everyone.

1599
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,840
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1600
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:54,680
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1601
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:16,920
I don't want to freak anybody out, but we totally just podcasted.

1602
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:17,920
Whoa.

1603
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:18,920
Yay.

1604
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:19,920
Whoa.

1605
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:20,920
There we go.

1606
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:21,920
I just changed our underwear.

1607
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,920
Yeah.

1608
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,920
All right.

1609
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,320
So the first thing I was going to mention to you real quick, two things, the first two

1610
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,240
things that come to mind immediately, and these are things I'm sure you've done five

1611
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:33,280
or six times, so I'm going to mention them anyway, is changing file names on the image

1612
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:38,120
and turning off the browser friendly for testing purposes on your feed burner.

1613
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,920
I don't know about that last one.

1614
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,920
Those would be the very first two things I tried.

1615
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,680
I'll take a look at that last one and try that.

1616
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:43,680
Yeah.

1617
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,680
That's a good one.

1618
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:45,680
Yeah.

1619
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,680
Because I mean, those are two things I know just historically.

1620
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,440
I was looking through some of my old notes, and that's actually something I don't know

1621
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,680
if it still applies or not.

1622
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:56,800
The image that it all shows is a picture of you and Brian as well, Chris.

1623
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,800
That's the video feed though, right?

1624
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,800
Yeah.

1625
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,800
I think so.

1626
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,800
I'm looking at audio feeds here.

1627
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,800
Yeah.

1628
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,800
I'm thinking about the mp3.

1629
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,800
Yeah.

1630
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,160
Some of them need to be updated, but the one that just doesn't work at all is the mp3 feed.

1631
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,480
That's using podcast addicts on Android.

1632
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,680
JemmyTitles.com, everybody.

1633
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:13,680
Go boot.

1634
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,680
I love Antilus.

1635
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,680
Thank that file name too, definitely.

1636
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:16,680
You're booted with Roden.

1637
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:17,680
Especially the imagery.

1638
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,680
Thank Roden.

1639
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,680
I love it.

1640
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:24,520
Okay, do we just need to... See, I've actually... It's funny, the audience has brought me

1641
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,280
back onto the Ubuntu soapbox.

1642
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:31,120
I've actually kind of done ranting about Ubuntu, because I just feel like now we just need

1643
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,120
to wait.

1644
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,760
But then it comes up again, and I get all worked up again, and I get into these big

1645
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,760
Ubuntu rants I didn't even mean to.

1646
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,120
That was a pretty good rant.

1647
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:44,200
You essentially said the worst thing that could possibly be happening is the advance

1648
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,200
of Ubuntu market share.

1649
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,200
I did say that, yes.

1650
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,640
That is kind of a puppy be gone.

1651
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,840
You're a hop, skip, and a jump away from canonicals and antichrists.

1652
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,040
Well, I mean, I'm looking at the end game, man.

1653
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,920
I got in my mental time machine.

1654
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:03,320
I went to the future, and I saw a world dominated by carriers, and I came back to warn the people.

1655
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,120
I'm like John Connor, no.

1656
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,940
Maybe a little bit, if I built a robot version of myself.

1657
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,000
Maybe I'm a robot.

1658
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Now I'm John Connor.

1659
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Ribbit.

1660
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:21,040
So a side note, Ray, when you were talking about DigitalOcean, it came to my mind.

1661
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:26,680
When they, as an elementary team, released the ISO, a lot of people were complaining

1662
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:31,320
like, oh my god, it's so slow, because no one decided to seed.

1663
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:38,520
So I fired up a DigitalOcean droplet, like the two terabyte transfer one, because I was

1664
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,240
just going to have it go for a day.

1665
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,240
Let him seed it.

1666
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,240
Yep.

1667
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:46,600
All it cost me in total, because I've already destroyed it, because I only wanted to run

1668
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,600
for that day.

1669
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,600
Six cents.

1670
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,600
That's it.

1671
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,600
Six cents.

1672
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:51,600
Nice.

1673
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,600
That's actually, you know what?

1674
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,760
Why don't more Linux distros just do that on their own?

1675
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,240
Like on a release day, they should just throw up a few seed boxes on DigitalOcean, and just.

1676
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,240
Seriously.

1677
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:04,720
That's what, when I downloaded the ISO, I let it seed overnight, just to kind of help

1678
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,720
them out.

1679
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:10,240
Yeah, because DigitalOcean's perfectly fine with it.

1680
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,640
They're like, yeah, if it's a legal torrent, whatever, perfectly fine, whatever, we don't

1681
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,640
care.

1682
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,640
So.

1683
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,640
Who me?

1684
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,600
Look, I agree that the whole communication side of it is dominated by the carriers, but

1685
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:26,480
the apps, the music, the video, the content, the e-books, all of that is still carrier

1686
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,480
independent.

1687
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,480
The experience.

1688
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:34,800
Yeah, it's not red themed for Verizon, pink themed or purple themed for T-mobs, or whatever

1689
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,800
it would be.

1690
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,800
Hey, Chris.

1691
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,800
Red, what?

1692
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,800
Speed test requires flash.

1693
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,800
Nobody uses flash.

1694
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,800
They don't want.
