1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
I read email, I write email, I do no coding at all anymore.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,800
Most of the code I write, I actually write inside my mail reader.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,200
So somebody sends me a patch, or more commonly, they send me a pull request,

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,040
or there's a discussion about the next pull request,

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,240
and there's something I react to and say,

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,920
no, this is fine, but, and I send out pseudocode,

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,440
or I'm so used to editing patches that I sometimes edit patches,

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,720
I send out the patch without having ever compiled it, ever tested it,

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,920
because I literally wrote it in the mail reader,

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,400
and saying, I think this is how it should be done.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,600
But this is what I do.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,720
I'm not a programmer anymore.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,840
I read a lot more email than I write,

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,800
because what my job really is, in the end, my job is to say no.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,440
Somebody has to be able to say no to people,

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,440
and because other developers know that if they do something bad,

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,840
I will say no, they hopefully in turn are more careful.

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,440
But in order to be able to say no, I have to know the background,

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,040
because otherwise my no is, I can't do my job.

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,960
So I spend all my time basically reading email about what people are working on.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,280
Well, that just leaves us one burning question.

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:49,680
Which email client?

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,560
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,440
My name is Chris.

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,400
My name is Wes.

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,520
Hello, Wes.

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,240
This episode is inspired by our email.

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,040
We have read emails, tweets, and telegrams,

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,600
and we'll be doing a whole batch of follow-up on topics

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,960
we've talked about before on the show,

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,600
and give you an update on how they're doing.

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,640
Plus, we'll dig into some, well, not exactly community news,

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,760
but similar community news,

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,640
and we'll play a few more Linux clips from a recent talk he was at.

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,440
We have a bunch of good stuff, but before we can really do any of that,

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,160
we have a little bit of upfront work that has to be done.

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
I got to say hello to Drew and Cheese.

38
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
Gentlemen, welcome into the show.

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,640
Howdy.

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,440
Hello.

41
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,720
Thank you for joining Wes and I.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,280
What do you say we give a holler to that virtual lug too?

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,440
Hello.

45
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,320
Hello, hello.

46
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,680
Hello.

47
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,320
Hello.

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,400
We are sneaky recording ahead this week.

49
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,880
So if anything major has happened

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,600
that you think it's a little strange we haven't talked about,

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,640
that's because we're doing a little pre-record

52
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,320
while I'm taking a family trip in Bozeman, Montana right now.

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,000
But don't worry, we'll pick it up next week.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,320
We're just not as clairvoyant as we used to be, you know?

55
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,640
You know, I should have looked at that crystal ball before we started,

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,840
but I just keep forgetting it.

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,240
Put it in the cupboard and I never go in there anymore

58
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,880
because I need a crystal ball to tell me to go get the crystal ball.

59
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,440
I was in Texas, now I'm on a trip to Montana,

60
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,280
and then I'll be on a trip back to the studio.

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,480
So it's all said and done.

62
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,200
I think it's like 40, 45 days on the road.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
It's been a crazy, crazy couple of weeks

64
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,960
or many weeks now on the road, but it's almost over.

65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,360
And so we thought we'd do one more record ahead.

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,400
Most of them have been live,

67
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
but we thought we'd do one more record ahead

68
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,400
so that way I could go do some swimming with the family.

69
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,840
I was enjoying this Linus keynote.

70
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,480
He had a conversation with Dirk Handel, who is

71
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,120
the VP and Chief Open Source Officer at VMware.

72
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,600
It's about a 26-minute talk,

73
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,480
and I have the whole thing linked in the old show notes

74
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,120
if you'd like to listen to the entire thing.

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,640
But I grabbed two other bits about it that I thought were a little fascinating

76
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
that maybe we could play and talk about.

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,440
And one of them was Linus was asked about

78
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,720
the possibility of launching a new project.

79
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,480
So in Jim's introduction, he pointed out 28 years of Linux,

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,040
15 years of Git, and he always forgets mentioning

81
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,400
eight years of subsurface.

82
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,200
The third most important open source.

83
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
Third most important open source project, I agree.

84
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,040
I wholeheartedly agree.

85
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
But isn't it time for a new project?

86
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,800
No, no, no, no.

87
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,680
I am so done.

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,920
I'm very happy with how Git ended up,

89
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,400
but every time Git is mentioned,

90
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,200
I want to make it very, very obvious

91
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,560
that I maintained Git for six months and no more.

92
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,040
And it's been 15 years,

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,720
and the real credit goes to Junio Hamano

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,520
and a lot of other Git developers.

95
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,200
I'll take credit for the design.

96
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,240
And the thing that makes me happy about Git

97
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,040
is not that it's taken over the world.

98
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,960
It's that we all have self-doubt, right?

99
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,080
We all think, are we actually any good?

100
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,200
And one of the self-doubts I had with Linux

101
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,960
was it was just a re-implementation of Unix, right?

102
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,040
Can I do something that isn't just a better version

103
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,360
of something else and Git proved that yes, I can?

104
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes, you can.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,560
And that to me, having two projects

106
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,280
that made a big splash means that I'm not,

107
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,720
three projects, means that I'm not like this one-hit wonder.

108
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,200
To those in the audience who don't get the joke,

109
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,320
so the third project subsurface is one that I now maintain,

110
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,360
so I keep trying to talk it up, but it's okay.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,800
I thought that was very human that even Linus.

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,640
Yeah, right, the Linus Torvalds.

113
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,760
We all have imposter syndrome and doubt our own talents,

114
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,000
even when you're top of the open source world.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,920
I never would have thought that Linux,

116
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
you'd think an accomplishment like Linux

117
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,200
would be so clearly a major accomplishment

118
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,520
that you wouldn't doubt it, you wouldn't question it.

119
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,640
But the human mind, Wes, it finds a way.

120
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,920
It's sneaky like that.

121
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
It'll make you feel bad about anything great you've done.

122
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,240
Dumb mind.

123
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,600
Right? I wonder if there's a world where Linux was less popular

124
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,520
and Git became his biggest project.

125
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,400
I didn't think in some ways it's touched so many more circles.

126
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,800
I mean, yes, Linux runs everywhere and is great,

127
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,640
and that's the whole point of the show,

128
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,960
but so many people who have no idea about Linux

129
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,400
or couldn't care less about Linux,

130
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,240
well, they all collaborate on GitHub.

131
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,600
There was another bit in here

132
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,360
that I never really paid much attention to

133
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,200
because there's no real public-facing example of it,

134
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,120
but were you aware, Wes, that the kernel has secret code names?

135
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,800
Secret code names?

136
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,120
Yeah, each release, like a distro.

137
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,480
Well, now we got to hear some.

138
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,280
A few years ago, you started using code names

139
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,040
for the development kernels,

140
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,440
and in the new release of RC5,

141
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
you changed the code name of the current kernel.

142
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Can you talk about that?

143
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,760
I've used...

144
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,560
How many in the audience know

145
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,880
that kernels don't only have version numbers?

146
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,920
They have names, too.

147
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,480
See, most people now...

148
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,280
Yeah, so it's not just a few years ago.

149
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,040
I've done this since way before 1.0.

150
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,160
The kernels have always...

151
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
In the main top-level makefile,

152
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,360
there's a name variable that gets set,

153
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
and it's usually a random creature.

154
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,200
Where I live, there was this one squirrel

155
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,840
that kept running in front of my car for a week,

156
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,040
and so I named the kernel SuicidalSquirrel.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,080
And the name is not used anywhere.

158
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,560
It's literally just a variable that gets set

159
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,400
and then never ever used again,

160
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,880
but it's been this ongoing joke for me

161
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,440
for the last 20-plus years.

162
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,400
And I think Greg names his stable kernels, too.

163
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,520
And if something happens,

164
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,120
either in the news or in my personal life,

165
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,840
you can sometimes see it in the name change.

166
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,040
So the last release on Sunday,

167
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,240
name change to Kleptomaniac Octopus,

168
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
because we were diving.

169
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,960
This is what Dirk was aiming for.

170
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,080
We were diving and playing with an octopus,

171
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
and two different octopus.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,800
And the first one tried to steal my flashlight,

173
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,960
and the second one tried to steal Dirk's camera.

174
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,000
And the picture of that,

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
if you look at my Twitter handle,

176
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
that was up a moment ago,

177
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
I actually posted a picture of that.

178
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,920
It's pretty hilarious when the octopus goes for my camera.

179
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,480
So the name has absolutely no meaning,

180
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
but sometimes you can guess that,

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,800
oh, something happened in Linus's life

182
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,800
where some random animal did something silly.

183
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,280
SuicidalSquirrel was 3.12 RC1,

184
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,440
and Kleptomaniac Octopus was 5.4 RC5.

185
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,400
That's great.

186
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,960
I like this one, Blurry Fishbutt.

187
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,760
I want to know the deal behind Wet Seal.

188
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,520
What was the story there?

189
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,040
Or Deceased Newt?

190
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,540
Aw.

191
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
Or one that's not really an animal, Series 4800.

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,360
Don't know, don't know.

193
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,680
But how are you feeling, Wes?

194
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,240
Are you ready?

195
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,400
Do you have an SSH session open to our Arch server?

196
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,960
Are you ready for one of those famous live Arch server updates?

197
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,560
This is our follow-up episode after all.

198
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Establishing connection right now, Chris.

199
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,800
All right, well, we figured we've collected

200
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
a lot of topics on this show, told you a lot of things

201
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,080
we've switched to or tried, and it was time to tell you

202
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,160
how they're holding up, so we start with the Arch server.

203
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,920
Of course, something that we're keeping on top of all the time,

204
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,400
right, Wes?

205
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,040
I'm sure we've been doing lots, yeah, lots of updates.

206
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,540
That's right.

207
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,320
Synchronizing package databases,

208
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,880
totally not a, totally not 173 of these right here.

209
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,720
Including a new stable kernel.

210
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,000
Jog my memory.

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,280
Jog my memory, did we switch this box over to the LTS kernel

212
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,720
or did we not do that yet?

213
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,360
Yes, we did.

214
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,240
We got a little less crazy on the Arch front.

215
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,080
Okay, Wes, let's do it.

216
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,160
Hit the upgrade button.

217
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,680
Now, this is a little bit more critical while I'm on the road

218
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,800
because I use WireGuard to connect into the studio

219
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,880
to do a lot of job functions.

220
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,200
I do see a new version of WireGuard

221
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,360
coming on down the pipe right now.

222
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
We got a new kernel, got a new WireGuard.

223
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,600
New GCC.

224
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,480
All kinds of good stuff.

225
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,360
Probably means a new ZFS, DKMS module.

226
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
Yeah, we're gonna need to rebuild some of those, that's for sure.

227
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,360
This is probably the most critical update we've ever done

228
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,200
because if it breaks, I'm really screwed.

229
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
Yeah, you know we have a show to record this week.

230
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,840
Yeah, yeah, I pretty much WireGuard in

231
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,760
almost every single day to do something.

232
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,560
Oh, a new version of Docker, that doesn't matter for us, right?

233
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
No, we just run everything in Docker, what could go wrong?

234
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,160
It's gonna be fine.

235
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,000
Now, for those of you new to the show, Chris and Wes do not recommend

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,440
that you run a rolling release distro as a server

237
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,320
unless you really can babysit the thing.

238
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,320
But what Wes and I wanted to do was try to build an arch server

239
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,640
with as few moving parts as possible

240
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,480
so that we could test the theory if it's possible

241
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,840
to build a minimum viable Linux server and run it rolling

242
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,040
with the applications containerized whenever possible,

243
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,360
the data broken off onto its own array,

244
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,200
in ZFS, in theory, the arch system is just a user land set of tools,

245
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,720
the kernel gets it going, and then it fires up the containers

246
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
and gets us access to our data.

247
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,960
So this was our philosophy when building a minimum viable arch server.

248
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,760
Don't recommend it, but we're doing it so you don't have to.

249
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,200
Where are we at there, Wes?

250
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640
Well, we're currently removing the current set of ZFS packages

251
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,280
and DKMS on its way to build a new one.

252
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,360
However, we're gonna need to do that again

253
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,680
because there's some updates on the open ZFS side

254
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,120
that we need to get in place as well.

255
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,840
You ever wonder if there's a better way to do these kind of updates?

256
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,400
Like you've already crossed the point of no return now

257
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,960
before we even installed the new stuff.

258
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,280
We just got to not reboot, I guess.

259
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah.

260
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,200
And that said, we do have those snapper snapshots set up

261
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,760
and it did take one right before we started this upgrade.

262
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,440
So we've got a recovery path, we just don't want to have to use it.

263
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:17,920
True.

264
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
That was part of our belt and suspenders approach,

265
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,360
was getting snapshots in there.

266
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,000
If this was a VM system, I would absolutely take a VM snapshot as well,

267
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,440
but we're running it on bare metal super micro box

268
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,960
that I got from Unix Surplus.

269
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,160
Old school.

270
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,440
Still would buy it again.

271
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,080
I got to say, speaking of follow-ups of all follow-ups.

272
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,360
That has just been such a great recommendation by Alan Jude right there.

273
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,640
Yep, I would buy that again.

274
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,560
Unix Surplus was a good way to go.

275
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,760
There's probably other ways to do it too, but it's been pretty great.

276
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,000
So I guess I'll kind of know when you do it

277
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
because I'll lose connection to the studio.

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,920
I'll lose connection to the studio for a bit.

279
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,640
So nothing like doing it live.

280
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,760
I'm only sweating a little bit over here, but thankfully you can't see it.

281
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,560
That's true.

282
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,360
That's true.

283
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,880
Oh, oh, we're loading our freshly compiled ZFS module.

284
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,480
That built pretty fast actually.

285
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,280
Yeah, not too bad.

286
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,160
All right, now we are going to go update our AntRAM FS as one needs to do.

287
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,240
I have to admit this box went a little bit longer than we'd normally go

288
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,880
because there's been some transitions at work, plus I've been on the road.

289
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,400
So this entered the worst case scenario zone as far as I'm concerned.

290
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,200
I think we intended to probably upgrade this thing at least every 30 days.

291
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,160
Yeah, you know, once a month at least, maybe more often,

292
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,440
depending on how often it comes up.

293
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,000
Because, you know, with Arch, most of the time,

294
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,760
it's just a couple of packages if you stay up on it.

295
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,800
It's not a big deal.

296
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,760
And if something does break, well, you only upgraded six things.

297
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,800
And usually there's a note about what went wrong.

298
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,560
Okay, I'm not nervous.

299
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,760
I'm not sweating.

300
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,880
It's totally fine.

301
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,560
I'm not concerned.

302
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,600
We're good now.

303
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,720
So we've moved on.

304
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,520
We're using Yeay, the AUR helper on this box,

305
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,400
which I've been very pleased with and continue to be.

306
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,800
So it's figured out that we also have some AUR upgrades that are needed.

307
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,400
And now we are compiling the newer version of OpenCFS.

308
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,960
Oh.

309
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,600
Yeah, so previously we upgraded the new kernel.

310
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,080
That was smart enough for DKMS to figure out

311
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,680
that it needed to go rebuild the module

312
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,200
from the existing code base for the module for the new kernel.

313
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,760
Now we're getting a new code base for ZFS.

314
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,960
And then we'll build the module for the new kernel and that.

315
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,680
Boy, that's really good that you mentioned that

316
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,120
because my standard move there would have been to skip AUR updates

317
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,880
when you're just doing a core server upgrade.

318
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,800
So I'm glad you're the one driving right now.

319
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,080
So you keep an eye on that.

320
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,440
Flag me when it's ready.

321
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,320
I want to move on to some of the follow up that we wanted to do

322
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,320
because this got kind of kicked off when I tweeted a question

323
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
about how our Nextcloud install is doing.

324
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,680
And so I wanted to go look up everything about it

325
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,840
so that way we could talk a little bit about how big it is,

326
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,080
how it has worked or hasn't worked for us

327
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,240
because Nextcloud promises for a team like us

328
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,680
to solve the horrendous cost of Dropbox.

329
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,520
A Dropbox pro account or enterprise,

330
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,680
whatever the crap they call it, is $1,000 a year for five users

331
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,280
and you have to have a minimum of five users.

332
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,560
It's too much.

333
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,640
And our core function here is we record a podcast

334
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,080
and we need to share the files with an editor like Drew.

335
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,560
You know how mad he gets if you don't send him the files right away?

336
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,280
You know what, Wes?

337
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,680
He gets so mad.

338
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,040
He really, he gets so mad that I just have a soundboard clip of it.

339
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,080
I get so mad.

340
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,360
So that's how you know he gets so mad.

341
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
We want to send Drew Flacks, for example,

342
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,240
or we have a bunch of assets

343
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,560
that we want to work with for putting a show together

344
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,120
or Cheese is working on an art project

345
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,680
and he wants to share it with us and sync it and back it up.

346
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,720
So in the past, we had used Dropbox.

347
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,960
The Dropbox advantage would be they manage the server,

348
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,080
they manage the storage,

349
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,560
and they have a really high speed CDN network.

350
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,440
So you get a pretty decent user experience.

351
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,200
It works fairly good for transferring large media files.

352
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,840
Even people that are spread out around the world.

353
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,960
And for the most part, other than the cost,

354
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,360
you really don't have to even give any thought to the storage.

355
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,600
It just grows as you need it.

356
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,800
Nextcloud, when you roll it yourself,

357
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,800
doesn't have a global CDN,

358
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
doesn't have anybody managing the storage,

359
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,360
and for the most part, it's cheaper

360
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,560
until you really start using it a lot

361
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
and then it can get pretty expensive.

362
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,840
So I want to talk about that too

363
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,800
because it sort of depends on how we have it deployed.

364
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,720
And in this case, what we opted to do

365
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,320
was deploy Nextcloud on DigitalOcean.

366
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,560
And when we made this decision,

367
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,800
we experimented with different DigitalOcean data center regions

368
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,760
to try to find a somewhat middle ground

369
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,680
between transfer rates for folks in Texas versus Savannah

370
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,640
versus London versus Seattle versus New York

371
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,440
and et cetera, et cetera.

372
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,960
Just where we have people spread out,

373
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,760
we wanted to stand up instances in different areas

374
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,920
in different data center locations

375
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,160
and see if they made any noticeable difference

376
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,880
in transfer speeds.

377
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,640
Well, yes, they do, very much so.

378
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,280
So we ended up kind of, I think, splitting the difference.

379
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,880
Wes, do you remember what data center?

380
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,800
Located in NYC right now.

381
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,240
Okay, so we went on the East Coast

382
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,440
to help Drew and Savannah and Joe in London.

383
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,880
It just kind of made the most sense

384
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,840
because folks in Texas still got a decent connection

385
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,440
and it was totally serviceable for Wes and I on the West Coast.

386
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
And now, like right now, when I'm traveling,

387
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,520
it's sort of more centralized to where I'm at.

388
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,120
We solved that one problem.

389
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,600
But then we had the problem of storage

390
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,040
because one of the problems with past attempts

391
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,000
to use Nextcloud was we would just run out of disk.

392
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,640
Everybody's working away on the team.

393
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,800
They're saving files every single day.

394
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,920
Maybe you have it keeping copies of deleted files too

395
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,600
so that takes up space.

396
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,760
And it would just grow and grow and grow.

397
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,000
We eventually would extinguish local storage

398
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
and we'd have to come up with all these different solutions.

399
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,880
I one time famously almost lost an entire episode of Unfilter

400
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,760
because the Nextcloud system started to eat itself.

401
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
And I swore off Nextcloud for like a year after that.

402
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,720
But this time around, we had a couple of advantages.

403
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,840
We had an idea of how to solve the storage issue

404
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,600
and we had people on the team that had used Nextcloud.

405
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,680
I'll talk about what storage option we went with

406
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,720
because it's very unique.

407
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,560
But before we get to that,

408
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,320
I thought I'd let Cheese chime in on this part

409
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,640
because you were there when we were really trying

410
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
to make the decision about dropping Dropbox

411
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,600
and switching to Nextcloud

412
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
and you were one of the guys advocating for it.

413
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
And I'm curious with what,

414
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,200
over a year now that we've been running it,

415
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,920
what your hindsight is on that original discussion

416
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,200
and using Nextcloud in production as we have.

417
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,040
Overall, it's been a pretty good experience.

418
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,920
There has been times where, you know,

419
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,080
syncing all of the things,

420
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,320
maybe it's not quite as intelligent as Dropbox

421
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,960
in some regard,

422
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,400
it seemed like it would flood and just saturate the Droplet,

423
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,120
preventing others from accessing

424
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,920
or having varied quality with their throughput to the server.

425
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,000
But overall, it's been pretty good.

426
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,280
In my personal Dropbox,

427
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
at one point I had, you know,

428
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,160
like WeChat and Tmux kind of set up

429
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,000
and then I had tiny RSS for news feeds

430
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,400
and just a bunch of random little Droplets.

431
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,640
And I was able to condense majority of that into Nextcloud.

432
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,240
So there's a news application that you can add on.

433
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
It's been great for me.

434
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
The companion app for the Android device

435
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,560
for the news app is great.

436
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,040
You use the notes app,

437
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,280
which also you can preview and mark down.

438
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,560
I don't know what we're up to now with the JB

439
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
because the amount of storage that we have there,

440
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,720
but I'm spending 10 bucks a month.

441
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,160
So a $5 Droplet and excuse me,

442
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,760
a $10 Droplet, $15 a month,

443
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,320
a $10 Droplet and 50 gigs of volume storage.

444
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,640
The use of Nextcloud for yourself

445
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,280
and a significant other is really great

446
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,320
because as you go on, you've got documents,

447
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
you know, just all kinds of things

448
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,000
for vehicle purchases or insurance stuff.

449
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,280
There's just so many places

450
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,520
where you both want access to something

451
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,240
and a lot of it is confidential.

452
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,720
And I'm not super confident storing that stuff

453
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,600
in any cloud service that's on somebody else's

454
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,000
service.

455
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,480
So being able to run Nextcloud on your LAN

456
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,040
or on a Droplet that you have root access to

457
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,960
is, it's a huge feature of it.

458
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,200
And I wasn't sure if it would go from that scenario

459
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,560
to a team scenario,

460
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,320
but Drew, you're also a Nextcloud guy

461
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
and you were advocating for us to give it a shot.

462
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,280
I'm curious what you think now a year plus into using it.

463
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,880
And from a perspective of somebody

464
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,440
who's often looking to get files

465
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,920
from the various hosts that are spread around the world,

466
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,080
you're looking at it maybe in a bit more

467
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,400
of a day-to-day production scenario than I am

468
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,320
where I just drop files on there for you.

469
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,000
It makes a big difference in your day.

470
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,520
So what I like about it,

471
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,480
which is not necessarily unique to Nextcloud per se,

472
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,880
but I really like the permission systems

473
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,080
and being able to hand a URL to like a contractor

474
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,120
or a guest and have it just be a Dropbox for them

475
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,560
to upload files without actually giving them access

476
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,880
to read anything in the system.

477
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,160
I love that feature.

478
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,400
I can get stuff from people

479
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,640
without actually creating an account

480
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,000
or having to do any kind of complicated stuff.

481
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
It's literally just drop the file on the browser,

482
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,880
you're done.

483
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,520
And being able to do specific syncs,

484
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
like specific folders

485
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,720
where I don't have to pull down everything to me is great.

486
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,760
Especially given that with Dropbox,

487
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,200
you have to default to sync all

488
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,840
and then you have to go in and unselect everything.

489
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,800
Whereas with Nextcloud,

490
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,160
you can take the opposite approach

491
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,080
and I just sync specific folders,

492
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,080
which is great for me

493
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,360
because it significantly limits the amount of stuff

494
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,720
that I have to actually pull down.

495
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,560
Because like I don't need Jesus design folder

496
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,680
on my local computer.

497
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,800
I don't need half the stuff in our team share.

498
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,760
I really just need these raw audio files.

499
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,880
And so that's what I sync.

500
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,240
So the ability to really narrow it down

501
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,080
and have that much more control

502
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,320
over what we're doing versus how I felt Dropbox was,

503
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,640
it's to me it's a significant improvement.

504
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,480
Yeah, I like your point about

505
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,800
it's much safer and simpler

506
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,920
to just loop in a contractor or a new team member

507
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,240
and just set them up an account

508
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,640
and get them going with Dropbox.

509
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,920
It would be a license

510
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,680
and it would be a significant cost.

511
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
I have found myself in the past

512
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,400
creating a contractor account

513
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,080
that I pay one license for

514
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,600
and then I just change the password

515
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,280
when I share it with different people.

516
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,720
I'm sure that's probably not the way

517
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,080
Dropbox wants me doing it.

518
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,240
You know, I don't think that's the way

519
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,360
anyone wants you to do it.

520
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,800
No, I don't even like it.

521
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,480
So that's one of the things I've definitely liked

522
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
about switching to Nextcloud.

523
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,960
So right now, as we record our monthly run cost

524
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,720
for 161 gigabytes of data in the cloud

525
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,080
and the Droplet that runs it is $305 a month,

526
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
which obviously is quite a bit.

527
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm not happy with that to tell you the truth

528
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,880
because one of the things we wanted to do

529
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,640
was lower the cost by switching from Dropbox.

530
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,840
And any of you who are doing the quick math

531
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,760
on $305 a month is quickly coming to the realization

532
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,680
that we're paying significantly more

533
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,880
than $1,000 a year for the storage.

534
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,200
But it does bring a lot of other perks and benefits,

535
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,160
one of which of course is that we're hosting ourselves.

536
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
But I mentioned we're running on DigitalOcean, Wes.

537
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,280
It's a box with eight gigs of RAM, two virtual CPUs

538
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,920
and 25 gigabytes of local disk.

539
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,520
But it's got a database

540
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
and it's got kind of a unique storage setup.

541
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,800
Yeah, you know, well, we were worried

542
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,640
about having to do upgrades,

543
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,040
deal with expanding storage down the road

544
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,920
because, well, some of the team uploads wave files

545
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,240
or just giant flacks for some reason.

546
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,440
And, you know, that stuff eats up disk space really fast.

547
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,160
And pretty much always from production standpoint,

548
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,960
if you can leave the original sources around for a while,

549
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,160
that's just the better option.

550
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,080
You might need them again down the road.

551
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
And once they're gone, they're gone.

552
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,480
So we're actually hooking into the backend

553
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,680
and putting all of the stuff that's not just, you know,

554
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,280
some of the configuration files and stuff

555
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,440
that's on the local disk, but all the stuff

556
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,920
that's uploaded through the UI, through the syncing system,

557
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,720
that all lives on DigitalOcean Spaces,

558
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,080
which if you're not a DigitalOcean user,

559
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,680
is basically their S3 equivalent object storage.

560
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,840
Now, did we essentially use Nextcloud's support

561
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
for S3 storage to use Spaces?

562
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,280
Is this some sort of hack?

563
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,760
What happened? How did this, how is this possible?

564
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,320
Yeah, so you can go into the Nextcloud configuration

565
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
and they've got a storage configuration.

566
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,040
And yeah, they support basically, you know,

567
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,520
anytime it's gonna do some file operations on the backend

568
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,160
instead of writing it to the disk.

569
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,000
Well, in the Nextcloud world,

570
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,160
this is all handled in the database anyway, right?

571
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,040
These are not like, they're not just named the regular name.

572
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,360
There's database entries, there's quids involved,

573
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,240
and then eventually that gets written somewhere on your disk.

574
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,720
So instead, once you've set this up to use S3,

575
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,600
then that call just gets made, sent to the cloud,

576
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,960
stored up there, and from the user experience,

577
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,920
you're none the wiser.

578
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,280
It's totally transparent to you, at least when it works.

579
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,920
The nice part here is while the S3 storage protocol

580
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,760
is not really a standard,

581
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,960
it's been around long enough now

582
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,400
that basically everyone implements it.

583
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,360
So whether you're actually using S3 on real AWS

584
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,440
or you're using DigitalOcean Spaces,

585
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,400
they talk the same language and it pretty much just works.

586
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,160
I haven't seen this lately, it may have been fixed.

587
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,920
I know DigitalOcean had some issues open on it,

588
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,840
but there's a couple different, you know,

589
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,760
nuances of the protocol that they didn't support

590
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,000
exactly the same as Amazon did.

591
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,760
And so it meant when some of our contractors

592
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,280
were uploading multiple files,

593
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,440
some of our contractors were uploading multiple files

594
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,680
at the same time through the web UI.

595
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,880
Specifically, sometimes some of those would fail,

596
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,920
but 95% the rest of the time, you know,

597
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,320
uploads from the studio, uploads that I'm doing,

598
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,760
it's pretty much just worked.

599
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,440
Yeah, I do recall a few issues early on,

600
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,240
like you mentioned when people were uploading multiple files

601
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
or if somebody was trying to upload files

602
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,160
and somebody else was cleaning up a directory

603
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,360
at the same time and it involved removing files,

604
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,840
everyone's sync operations would just halt

605
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,000
until something had sorted itself out.

606
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,920
And, you know, sometimes you have an editor

607
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,720
on the other end that's like,

608
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,760
hey, where the hell's my files?

609
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,040
So that was a little sketch, but it seems like it's either

610
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
we've all just sort of internalized a way to use NextCloud

611
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,160
that hasn't caused this problem,

612
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,120
or it's just, it hasn't been an issue recently.

613
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,520
The nice part is we just don't have to think about it

614
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,000
because, you know, we just pay for the usage on Spaces.

615
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,960
So someone wants to drop in a giant file,

616
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,840
it doesn't matter at all.

617
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,520
There's no quota, there's no limit.

618
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,600
It pretty much just works.

619
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,760
And you still actually have access

620
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,800
behind the scenes to the system.

621
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,200
So you can go ask in the NextCloud database

622
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,160
and go find out what the long random string name

623
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,280
of the file that you want is,

624
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,360
and then you can access it directly in Spaces too

625
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,440
and take advantage of their CDN system if you want to.

626
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:15,360
Yeah, which is pretty cool

627
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,200
and it feels pretty performant

628
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,720
as far as we've noticed, you know,

629
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,960
the files come slamming down on our machines

630
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,040
and I generally just use the NextCloud client itself.

631
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,200
I think that tends to work best for me,

632
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:56,320
but something else that is nice is the web UI

633
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:25,920
and the fact that we've got $305 a month that we pay

634
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:53,920
and we've suffered performance penalties for that.

635
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:23,120
And that meant a managed database server.

636
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:52,720
So that's something that I think has to change

637
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:52,720
or the database schemas need to change.

638
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:22,320
So that's something that I think has to change.

639
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:51,920
So that's something that I think has to change.

640
00:30:51,920 --> 00:31:21,520
So that's something that I think has to change.

641
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:51,120
What I opted to do for that kind of stuff is use something else, and I didn't want to get sucked back into the Dropbox situation, I decided to double down again on Syncthing, something I've tried in the past when it was brand new.

642
00:31:51,120 --> 00:32:05,920
And I just found that so frustrating because there's not really a way in Syncthing to say, maybe there is at the configuration file, but in the web UI, there's not really a way to say sync to this IP, right?

643
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,280
You sync to a machine ID, which looks like a Bitcoin address.

644
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:14,400
It's not like 192.168.0.5 and now it's syncing.

645
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,320
It's a big old hash.

646
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,680
And so when it quits discovering it after that, it's like you got no recourse.

647
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,800
And so that would drive me crazy and I would quit using it.

648
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:34,400
And then the other thing that was just unforgivable for me was, say it was just going along, doing its little sync thing, maybe for a few months, just syncing right along.

649
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,440
And then it would just stop and then it would never connect back up and it would never sync.

650
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,200
And I wouldn't know that was happening because there was no immediate error messages and my machines just would fall out of sync.

651
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,040
And that just drove me nuts.

652
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,760
Now, keep in mind, this is a couple of years ago, this is like when BitTorrent sync was still a thing.

653
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,320
And I kind of hit the pause button and said, I'm going to come back and visit Syncthing in a couple of years and see how it's doing.

654
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,360
And boy, am I glad that I did, because am I just using the hell out of it now?

655
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:11,520
I use Syncthing more and more because the beautiful, beautiful thing about Syncthing is it's peer to peer, no cloud service at all.

656
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,160
So your storage is whatever you got in disk space on your machine.

657
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,640
So if you've got machines with terabytes of storage, then you've got terabytes of syncing.

658
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:33,520
The other thing I absolutely love about it is it essentially creates a network file system for me that doesn't require any fancy VPN or crazy ass file system.

659
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:42,640
In fact, it can be across multiple OS's using multiple different file systems and they just sync because with Syncthing, you can sync any folder,

660
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,880
much like you can with the next cloud client if you set it up right, but not like Dropbox where Dropbox only syncs the Dropbox folder, right?

661
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,240
Syncthing syncs anything.

662
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,760
It has its own little world. Yeah.

663
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,400
Yeah. And so I can point at maybe a media folder on a server.

664
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,120
I can point at an editing working directory over here.

665
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,880
It just syncs and you put something in one place and it just shows up in the other place, even if it's some five directories deep folder.

666
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:14,560
And what I realized is this was a brilliant solution for clients of mine that look to move media files around.

667
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:23,520
So I've launched this ChrisLass.com consulting arm, which is part of the Chris Lass empire.

668
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,560
I'll take over the world with my podcasting consulting anyways.

669
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:44,080
And I realized that I would get people all set up with a lot of things going into a podcast, but I wouldn't have a solution for how to actually move files from where they're recorded to somebody who's editing or transfer stuff back and forth.

670
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,720
And we experimented with Firefox and for a little while and that that was frustrating for people and on people that run only Linux.

671
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,680
I had them try magic wormhole for a bit, but that was too clunky because it requires dropping to the command line.

672
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,240
And then one day it just hit me. Sync thing, you idiot, just use sync thing.

673
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:10,160
And there's like a sync thing tray application you can get for Windows and there's a sync thing bundle you can get for the Mac that takes sync thing and makes it usable for those platforms.

674
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,520
And then, of course, it's just available on Linux as a package and it works fantastic.

675
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:24,720
I set them up with a little sync thing instance and then I pointed at a directory on their folder and I just say, when you need to send something to an editor, put it in this folder.

676
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,560
And then I have their editor on the other end, install the bundle, set up a directory and give me the ID.

677
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,480
The two things discover each other over the sync thing network.

678
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,560
They have a little broadcast system they use and a little relay system, and then they connect peer to peer and they begin syncing.

679
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,760
And it just works now. It doesn't so far.

680
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,960
None of them have lost sync. None of them have failed to discover each other.

681
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:58,720
It's worked every single time. And I've also started using it as a way to move home media files around.

682
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:07,600
I've got a Blu-ray player at the studio or I've got a DVD or something that I've ripped to my hard drive and I've made a big old fat MKV out of it like I do.

683
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,440
And I want to get that to the RV. Well, the RV has a super slow connection.

684
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:24,640
It's on my fi and I don't want to sneaker net it because that's a pain in the butt to hook up a drive, copy it over and then you get home and get to my Raspberry Pi and plug it in and then SSH in and copy the file to this.

685
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,760
Just who's got time for that? Nobody.

686
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,360
I just point sync thing at the TV or movie folders that I want to have currently at the RV.

687
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,560
Like right now, I've recently got into the television show Alone.

688
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,080
Have you heard of this? No.

689
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,880
You should watch Alone because they film a lot of it in the Pacific Northwest. So it's pretty great.

690
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:54,640
Oh, it's like 10 contestants go out to Vancouver Island and have no contact with society, have no assistance except for the 10 things they can bring in their bag.

691
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,760
And then whoever lasts the longest wins five hundred thousand dollars.

692
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,440
It's silly, but it's a lot of fun.

693
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:14,880
And I watch it with the family and I decided, you know, why why sit here and move these files all around when I could just sync them using sync thing and been able to just set that up, point it at my Raspberry Pi and it just goes.

694
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:30,800
And when a new episode comes out and I have it in the folder on my server, it just over time as you know, however long it takes, trickles down to the RV and sync thing is pretty good about not abusing your bandwidth, about noticing if there's other things going on.

695
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,240
And sort of scaling back.

696
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,320
So I don't even really notice a hit.

697
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,880
I maybe every now and then have gone in and pausing thing for a bit.

698
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,400
So that way I have just a little bit more of the kilobits, but it works pretty well.

699
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,280
All right, Wes, it's time to check in on that arch server upgrade.

700
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,480
How's it doing over there?

701
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,000
Colonel's upgrade DKMS has been rebuilt.

702
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
So we're ready to reboot.

703
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,080
Yeah, that's reboot time.

704
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,320
All right, ping is going and reboot is away.

705
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:13,920
So as if you were going to set yourself up a home server, like an actual home server, do you think you'd do you think you'd go with something as complicated as we've done here?

706
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,800
Would you go with arch?

707
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,840
Would you go with next cloud?

708
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,400
What would you do?

709
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,160
Oh, good question.

710
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,640
You know, honestly, I've been pretty impressed.

711
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:29,600
The arch system has really not been as painful as I thought that it might when we first discussed this kind of crazy plan, keeping things simple, not overloading the system.

712
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,920
And mostly just running everything containerized.

713
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,040
That has helped a lot.

714
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,600
I would be tempted now that it's post 2004.

715
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,160
I honestly I'd be very tempted for my personal stuff.

716
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:50,000
If I didn't need any customization or if I wasn't trying to do something really fancy in the arch setup, you know, where the minimalism and simplicity helped, I would probably just install 2004.

717
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,160
Just especially because the ZFS stuff is taken care of for you.

718
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,400
Arch has been the best besides Ubuntu, I think for us by far in that respect.

719
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,960
But you just can't beat Canonical building it for you.

720
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,760
Yeah.

721
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,920
And I think the math has changed here a little bit.

722
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:11,520
In the past, arch was how we got access to the most recent, freshest packages.

723
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,360
You know, and you and I doing this show and just kind of being the guys we are.

724
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,000
That's what we like.

725
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,880
We like getting that.

726
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,480
We like getting the latest software.

727
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,720
Give me the beta, whatever you translated to Rust.

728
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,600
I just want to run it.

729
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,480
But do you really need that anymore?

730
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,560
Is that really how you need to get software?

731
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,080
I mean, with everything either in a container or in a flat pack or a snap, like, do you

732
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,520
really need to be running a rolling distro to get the latest software?

733
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,960
That's kind of one of the things I think we're also trying to test out here is,

734
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,720
is there still a benefit to it?

735
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,960
I think it depends too on how high touch a system is.

736
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,640
And this server is sort of in the middle.

737
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,320
There's some weeks where we're doing stuff or setting up a project that we're playing with.

738
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,640
And I'm kind of glad that it's arch because it's so simple.

739
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,680
We understand the system because there's not a bunch of stuff configured in the background

740
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,560
that we didn't set up.

741
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,960
But the flip side of that is if it's just a box that you leave in the corner,

742
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,000
you set it up once, you never want to touch it again.

743
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,920
Well, that's not where art shines.

744
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,280
Yeah, very true.

745
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,600
All right.

746
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,400
Well, while you're doing that, because I know it's going to take a minute,

747
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,760
let's sneak in a little housekeeping.

748
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,680
I don't have a whole bunch to update everybody on on the housekeeping,

749
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,040
but I want to give a plug for the old self-hosted podcast.

750
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,800
Check it out at selfhosted.show.

751
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,200
I say old now because we've officially crossed the 20 episodes mark.

752
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,880
Thank you.

753
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,760
Thank you.

754
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,000
And episode 22, slow cooked servers.

755
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,360
I give everyone an update on how my Raspberry Pi servers are doing

756
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,040
in the intense Texas heat.

757
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,800
I will tell you now that yesterday my server booth was up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit

758
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,400
where those Raspberry Pis are sitting.

759
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,280
Oh, man.

760
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,800
So I talk about what's going on there, what I'm doing to mitigate that,

761
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,320
and what I think is going to fail first.

762
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,360
And how I monitor all of this is covered in selfhosted.show slash 22.

763
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:13,120
Plus, Alex goes into this super cool self-hosted image recognition AI tool

764
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,080
that you can throw at like a security camera.

765
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,000
And it can recognize cars, dogs, all these different objects

766
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,680
in the video feed locally on your LAN without having to go in any third-party service

767
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,160
and then generate alerts based on that.

768
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
But there's some really other cool things it does,

769
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,480
including how it records the video and all of that to save you a ton of storage.

770
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,520
So Alex can run 4K cameras and not burn through disk like a madman.

771
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,880
It's a really neat system.

772
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,800
So we talk about both those things in a little bit more in self-hosted.show slash 22.

773
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,560
So I just hope by the time I make it back to the Pacific Northwest,

774
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,480
I haven't burned through every Raspberry Pi in the garage.

775
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,800
So check that out, selfhosted.show.

776
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,480
Also, please do join us live.

777
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,760
We do this show on Tuesdays.

778
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,640
We'd love to have you here.

779
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,080
Now, I won't be live on the Tuesday that this came out, Willie.

780
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,080
But normally we are live at jblive.tv.

781
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,640
You can get that at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

782
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,480
And that's why we have the calendar, right?

783
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,040
Is that most of the time we remember to update it

784
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,680
so you'll know in advance if we'll be here or we won't.

785
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,400
That's the theory.

786
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,960
I talk about the live show all the time.

787
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,120
I do not proportionally talk about how much we appreciate everybody downloading the show,

788
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,200
sharing it with friends and that kind of stuff.

789
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,640
That's obviously the vast, vast, vast majority of the audience.

790
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,520
We appreciate you.

791
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,960
We recognize you.

792
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,760
Thank you so much.

793
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,680
So I always talk about the live stream,

794
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,880
but I want to take a moment and say thank you to those who've been downloading the show,

795
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,240
sharing it with friends, anything to help spread the word.

796
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,000
That's that's what makes podcasts tick.

797
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You know, you don't see a bunch of podcast ads out there

798
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,520
because the only marketing that works for podcasts is the word of mouth.

799
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,920
So thank you.

800
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,200
It's you, the audience.

801
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,680
That's right.

802
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,960
You're the ones that make this possible.

803
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,280
So we will be back at our regularly scheduled live streaming time.

804
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:04,880
I think the week of the 21st, if you want to join us, July 21st at jblive.tv at noon Pacific.

805
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,440
And then, of course, one more mention for that love blog, which is happening right now.

806
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,000
As we record this episode, you never know what's going to happen during a love blog.

807
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,240
And that's Sunday's same exact time, the same mumble server, same IRC server, just different rooms.

808
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,520
So check all that out.

809
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,880
You've got two days to try and the love blog is a great chance.

810
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,320
If you just, you know, you've got a new microphone,

811
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,200
you've been wanting to join the virtual log for a while.

812
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,000
Try it out on Sunday.

813
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
If everything goes well, then come join us on Tuesday.

814
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,680
Yeah, it's a good way to kind of warm up to maybe if you're a little shy or something like that.

815
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,000
Right.

816
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,400
Start talking with some of our wonderful mumble regulars.

817
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:37,360
Yep.

818
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,880
Totally understandable and a great way to do it.

819
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,360
All right. That's the housekeeping for this week.

820
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,440
And that puts you back in the hot seat, Wes.

821
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,880
How's that server reboot going?

822
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,000
You say hot seat.

823
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,640
My seat is nice and cool over here.

824
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,200
All of our docker containers back up and running.

825
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,760
ZFS remounted, no issues at all.

826
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,240
And we're on the latest LTS kernel.

827
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,280
You're kidding me.

828
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,320
All like that?

829
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,920
Boom. Arch for the win.

830
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,400
Arch for the win.

831
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:06,720
Wow.

832
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,480
Not only was that our longest time between updates,

833
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,400
but that's got to be one of the smoothest.

834
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,840
I'm very impressed.

835
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,320
That was an odd issue because essentially everything in the stack got upgraded.

836
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,560
Now, I will say I did have to go build one set of packages by hand just because,

837
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,080
all right, I was previously singing the praises of yay, and I do really like it.

838
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,800
But there's like the way the package dependencies work between ZFS utils and ZFS

839
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,200
DKMS. You have to install both of them at the same time.

840
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,000
Otherwise, you break a dependency on the previous version.

841
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,400
So I just did that by hand in the shell with make package,

842
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,680
which was also pretty simple.

843
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,360
All right.

844
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:41,920
I'll allow it.

845
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,400
That's borderline though, Wes Payne.

846
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,280
It's borderline.

847
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:45,760
I know.

848
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,080
I know.

849
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,840
All right.

850
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,200
Moving on to the things that folks asked us to follow up on.

851
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,400
Thoughts on our ThinkPads.

852
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,280
How are they running?

853
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,280
Anything like that.

854
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,800
And Chaz wrote, he says, if we could also talk about maybe if we would spec them differently.

855
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,400
He says, hey, just a quick question.

856
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,320
I'm in the market for a new laptop and thinking about getting one spec'd out with the same way

857
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,360
your T480s are.

858
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,480
He listened to our episode, which was forever ago now.

859
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,480
Like almost, geez, Wes, it was almost two years ago that we got the ThinkPads.

860
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:14,880
Wow.

861
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,560
That's crazy.

862
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,200
Is that right?

863
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,080
Yeah.

864
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,160
It still kind of feels like a new laptop.

865
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,720
So there's that.

866
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,400
He says, were those the models that had integrated graphics or did they have the MX150 card?

867
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,720
And are there any changes that you would make to their configuration if you could?

868
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,880
Answering the graphics question, they are the Intel integrated graphics.

869
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,240
We did that on purpose to just keep things very simple because these were work machines.

870
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,520
I will say, though, that, you know, those integrated graphics, the modern ones,

871
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,960
really not too bad of a slouch.

872
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,160
Like I'm not playing a ton of games, but 3D shooters, all kinds of stuff on there,

873
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,840
that worked surprisingly fine.

874
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,640
I mean, OK, I turned down some of the graphics settings, but it was playable without a problem.

875
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,240
And then I forgot I'd ever turned those down.

876
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,680
So I was pretty impressed.

877
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,800
On how are they running?

878
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,840
Now, there's not really much to say here.

879
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,480
They just run.

880
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,240
They run great.

881
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,480
What a great Linux machine, really.

882
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,560
I would absolutely fully recommend them.

883
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:15,760
Now, I'm curious, Wes, would you change the screen and go from 1080p to 4K in 2020?

884
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,600
Oh, that's a good question.

885
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,400
You know, the screen is one of the, let's call it, limiting factors on these bad boys.

886
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,680
And you recently spent a little time with the new XPS 13, which has incredible screen.

887
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,640
Just amazing.

888
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,320
Yeah, I would like a better screen.

889
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,960
It's not so bad, especially, you know, you're going to put it on a dock.

890
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,960
You've already got, you know, monitors on your desk, whatever.

891
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,520
And it's fine.

892
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,480
It works on the plane.

893
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,440
It works at a coffee shop.

894
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,800
Like, you can read it.

895
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,720
I would want a nicer screen, though.

896
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,360
Yeah, probably.

897
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,640
If it was a very high-end 1080p panel, maybe we would feel differently.

898
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,360
But it's just not a great screen.

899
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,160
It'd be terrible, too.

900
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,880
Like, if you're going to try to do any serious graphics work where you needed, you know,

901
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,920
good colors or brightness, like, I take a picture on my phone, I look at it there,

902
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,440
and then I look at the same one in Telegram or something on the ThinkPad.

903
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,560
And it's just a joke.

904
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,600
And on top of that, it's 14 inches.

905
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:09,040
So I'm not positive 4K would be the right resolution, unless you were pixel doubling

906
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,600
everything.

907
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:15,280
I think a 2K screen on that 14-inch laptop would be the absolute sweet spot.

908
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,720
But they don't offer it.

909
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,360
So in light of the fact that it's kind of a crappy 1080p panel or a nice 4K panel, at

910
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,280
this point, I'd go with the 4K panel.

911
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,000
I don't think I would have a year ago, but I think I would now.

912
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,080
One thing I wouldn't change, keep that 32 gigs of RAM.

913
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:36,000
Maybe it's not essential, but it's just been so nice, especially when, you know, you're

914
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,800
doing serious work.

915
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,320
You've got a lot of stuff going on in the system.

916
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,400
Or you're just trying to run a bunch of virtual machines.

917
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,320
Or you're like, Wes, and you just run out of RAM for a week, and your whole OS is in

918
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,400
RAM, and everything you do is in RAM.

919
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,480
It really enables my bad behavior.

920
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,440
It's great.

921
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,000
There is a niggling issue still, which is shameful it hasn't been fixed fully, with

922
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,560
how the 480 handles thermal throttling under Linux.

923
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,360
And it's an unfortunate issue, because if you fix it with the workarounds, the laptop

924
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,880
runs noticeably warmer.

925
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,440
And the fans run more often, and it becomes annoying.

926
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,720
But if you don't fix it, you're robbed of performance.

927
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,880
You've got two bad options when it comes to the T480 and thermal throttling.

928
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,880
I don't know if with later revisions that's been solved, but I can tell you that the firmware

929
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,520
updates that we were told would solve it did not solve it.

930
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,320
And we can test it.

931
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,120
We can, we can verifiably prove it.

932
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,440
I'm trying to remember what we did semi-recently, Wes.

933
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:36,640
You remember that encoding trick we did where, like, the 2015 MacBook kicked the hell out

934
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,520
of it, but at first, on our T480s, just, like, shamed it on an encoding test?

935
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,480
Oh, yeah.

936
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,560
And it came down to the thermal throttling on the T480 was kicking into aggressively

937
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,960
and reducing the overall speed.

938
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,120
And so that older MacBook, until it heated up, was winning.

939
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,800
And then once the MacBook started heating up...

940
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,880
Once they were both throttling, right?

941
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,280
Yeah.

942
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,800
The super aggressive throttling kicked in on the MacBook, and then the T480 pulled ahead.

943
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,160
But meanwhile, the XPS 13 never missed a beat.

944
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,680
It remained consistently performant in our test.

945
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,480
That was unfortunate because, you know, here we are, like a couple of jerks with our T480s,

946
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,080
and they're getting stomped by a MacBook from 2015.

947
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,360
Embarrassing.

948
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:17,860
Yeah.

949
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,720
So there are fixes out there.

950
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,840
And that encoding test we did was after my firmware fix was installed.

951
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,320
And I was still disappointed with the arrangement they'd came to.

952
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,840
And I don't know if they were just adjusting things and maybe it'll get better, but...

953
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,720
Yeah, the firmware has been kind of annoying in general.

954
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,520
You know, there's also we ran into issues with the Thunderbolt controller,

955
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
where you had to do an upgrade.

956
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,920
Otherwise, you might eventually break your system.

957
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,040
The nice part about that is that, you know, it works splendidly with FWAP-D.

958
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,840
That's true.

959
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,480
Good point.

960
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:46,800
It does.

961
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,960
It's really easy to get the firmware updates.

962
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,360
So Drew, you ended up with one of these T480s, and I think you got the same unit, didn't you?

963
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,400
Because you came on a little bit after Wes and I,

964
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,640
and I don't remember if you got the same exact model or not.

965
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,320
Yeah, I've got the Core i7 T480.

966
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,680
And it's been a pretty good machine for me.

967
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,640
I do have a couple of small things that I have noticed about it.

968
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,800
With the thermal throttling,

969
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,040
I've noticed that it has been better when I've been doing pro audio work

970
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,920
than it had been in the past, but it's still not great.

971
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:27,680
I've always been a little suspicious of putting something so hot as an i7 in a laptop.

972
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,880
And this has been kind of proving me right.

973
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,960
Now, one thing that I did do that helped immensely

974
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,720
is I replaced all of the thermal paste on the CPU in the ThinkPad itself

975
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,720
with some higher quality thermal paste.

976
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,520
And that did improve things quite a bit.

977
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,080
And that was even before the firmware fix came out.

978
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,600
That might be why I'm having a little bit better luck than you are

979
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:59,360
with my thermal throttling fix is just they use cheap paste in the stock configuration.

980
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,560
Now, the biggest problem that I have

981
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,640
is I can't have the laptop in the booth with me while I'm recording

982
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:14,080
because even when it's running at its lowest possible heat and everything else,

983
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,840
the fan is still too loud for me as a pro audio engineer.

984
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,680
It just annoys me to no end how loud that fan is at idle.

985
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,240
And I actually keep it outside of my booth and run an external monitor

986
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,040
and keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse just to avoid that issue entirely.

987
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,600
Good man.

988
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:38,640
Like if I had to do it over again, I think I'd go with something a little quieter,

989
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,600
you know, maybe something that's even fanless.

990
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,560
Because my main thing with this is recording and then simple editing.

991
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,440
I don't need a super high powered machine for that.

992
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,040
Most of my actual renders and stuff I can do on higher powered machines.

993
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,240
I think that's my one big thing is just it's kind of noisy.

994
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:04,960
Yep, I am talking to you right now on a Pinebook because of that very issue is

995
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,960
the Pinebook doesn't make noise and it's slow and it's not nearly as nice to use,

996
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,560
I would say, as my ThinkPad just because of the overall performance difference.

997
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:21,360
But it's silent and I mean, right now my microphone is hovering over the keyboard.

998
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,040
It's right above the keyboard.

999
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,360
So if the fans were going crazy in my ThinkPad or just making constant noise,

1000
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,560
it would be getting picked up.

1001
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,640
And that has been a problem.

1002
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,880
I don't find it to be a huge issue for me unless I'm really in a kind of a cramped

1003
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,240
setup where my microphone is right next to the laptop.

1004
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,200
I have kind of compensated too for some of the shortcomings of the ThinkPad by using

1005
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,800
an eGPU as well.

1006
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,800
So I think that's extended the life of the ThinkPad for me because I have a eGPU with

1007
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,560
um, it's an AMD graphics card and it's not a great one anymore.

1008
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,760
I want to say it's an AMD like 580, I could be wrong, might be even less, might be like

1009
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:06,240
like a cheap 570 or something, but I can plug that in and it acts as a dock.

1010
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,640
It's not a dock technically.

1011
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,080
I got the Mantis eGPU case and it has gigabit ethernet.

1012
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:21,280
It has a SATA adapter too so you can have storage in the dock and then it has a full

1013
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,840
array of ports, USB and all that kind of stuff.

1014
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:29,440
And so I plug that in just as a matter of course and then I selectively execute applications

1015
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,720
on that GPU.

1016
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,680
I launch a terminal, I set the environment variable to use GPU one instead of zero because

1017
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,280
zero is the Intel GPU and then I launched the application and any application I launch

1018
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,400
in that terminal session, once that environment variable is set, launches on the eGPU.

1019
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:53,120
This is so much better than how Windows and Mac OS handle eGPUs and it's kind of what

1020
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,720
System76 is working towards.

1021
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,080
We talked to them recently about it and it's, it's the way to go.

1022
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,320
I have a big GPU for when I need it and then I just otherwise run everything off of the

1023
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:09,760
Intel GPU and I have found that to be a pretty solid setup and it remains my primary workflow

1024
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,680
for the ThinkPad at home today.

1025
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,840
And then while I'm in the studio I have two different Thunderbolt docks which are ridiculously

1026
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,320
stupid expensive and I hate it.

1027
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,400
Wes, you see one there, right?

1028
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,680
What is the brand on that one?

1029
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,960
I can't even remember.

1030
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,240
OWC.

1031
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,920
Oh, is that Other World Computing?

1032
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,600
Yes, that's where I got it from.

1033
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,320
I got it from Other World Computing because they seem to make the best dock with the most

1034
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,240
port options and all that stuff.

1035
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,760
And so I have one in the studio and I have one up at my desk upstairs and I just move

1036
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,800
between them.

1037
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,360
I have my monitors hooked up to that now and I have my ethernet hooked up to that and that

1038
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,400
works really well for me.

1039
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,200
And I'm kind of just in a way getting myself ready for a pure USB-C lifestyle ahead of

1040
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,240
time.

1041
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,800
I don't think I'll get another ThinkPad.

1042
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,320
I think my next machine will be probably something different but I'm not at that point yet.

1043
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,160
And that's just because I want to try other things.

1044
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,800
Maybe there will be a ThinkPad that catches my attention.

1045
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,080
That new Oryx Pro from System76 is pretty high on my list right now, I have to be pretty

1046
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,880
honest.

1047
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,920
But I wanted to get to a lightning round just to cover a couple more things.

1048
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,080
Joshua wrote in and I wanted to recap on what the hell's going on with the Debian project.

1049
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,120
Dang it.

1050
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,680
Because I had raised some concerns on Linux Action News.

1051
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,400
Well, the Debian project leader elections wrapped up.

1052
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,000
Jonathan Carter won.

1053
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,160
He has been the Debian project leader since April, I believe.

1054
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:38,160
I've noted that recently Debian chatter seems to be, well, A, it's spread across many, many,

1055
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:38,960
many lists.

1056
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,720
I'll link you the complete index.

1057
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,520
Right?

1058
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,040
Can you believe that list, Wes?

1059
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,560
Ooh.

1060
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:49,840
But still, with all those mailing lists, it seems that certain conversations may be happening

1061
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,520
in other places, not in the public from what I can tell.

1062
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,960
But what I have noticed is that Jonathan Carter himself has a blog.

1063
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,720
And it doesn't get updated all the time, but he does a pretty good job of posting over

1064
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,440
there.

1065
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,480
So if you want to see where he's at, you can check out his blog.

1066
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,480
I'll have that linked in the show notes.

1067
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,600
And he has some good stuff in there, including what's going on with the Debian project.

1068
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,960
A little mini DebConf updates and whatnots are in there.

1069
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:21,120
And then additionally, speaking of conferences, DebConf 20 this year has moved to online, which

1070
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:21,920
everything has.

1071
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,680
And it's happening August 23rd through the 29th.

1072
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,800
And it's going to be a shorter conference.

1073
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,800
They're going to do DebCamp and DebConf.

1074
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,960
But maybe more of us will have a chance to attend now that it's online.

1075
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,400
The flip side is these online conferences are kind of a shadow of the in-person event.

1076
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,960
However, more of us can attend.

1077
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,560
So it's also kind of great.

1078
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,160
So I'm hoping we'll be able to attend.

1079
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,720
They currently have the call for papers open.

1080
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,880
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes too.

1081
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,560
And DebConf 20 will be going online.

1082
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,040
And I hope from that we'll be getting a more clear picture of how Debian is doing.

1083
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,800
I think one of the things that will really tell us is when there's a big decision that

1084
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:06,320
has to get made, something that really affects the project and requires them coming together

1085
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,520
and having a civil discourse on how to proceed.

1086
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,720
That will be the test.

1087
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,400
But Jonathan's leadership so far seems to be steady, open.

1088
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,320
And I think he's, from what initial kind of ways I can tell, it seems like he's doing

1089
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,360
a pretty good job.

1090
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:25,600
And I'll link to some of those things that you can read more about.

1091
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,960
Also, Joshua asked if we ever ended up installing those minimal distros that we used in our

1092
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,240
small distro bake-off.

1093
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,480
And I'm happy to report that, yep, my VM distro is now Sparky.

1094
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,400
I just have a Linux VM on every machine, even if it's a Linux box, that is sort of

1095
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
like a playground where I can go in and try stuff.

1096
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,680
In the past, I had used just my machine to just trash it, install stuff for the show.

1097
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,960
Then when I switched to Fedora for a while, I discovered Fedora Toolbox, which is awesome.

1098
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,760
And it was a game changer for how I decided to experiment with software.

1099
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,840
When I moved away from Fedora, I didn't want to go back to just trashing up my system.

1100
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,520
And so I went with a dedicated tester VM.

1101
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,080
And I like that Sparky's Debian-based for this very reason, because it gives me kind

1102
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,160
of a, I don't know, how would you describe it?

1103
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:14,880
Because it's not-

1104
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,840
It's a leg up.

1105
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,680
Yeah, it's not a boon to, it's not arch.

1106
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,040
I know, it's like it's slightly different, but it's not too far off the mainstream.

1107
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,000
Does that make sense?

1108
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,560
It's like, it just, it's a good test distro for me.

1109
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,480
Yeah, it has some of its own uniqueness, but at the end of the day, there's apt underneath

1110
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,160
and you know what you're doing on the command line.

1111
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:35,120
Another question that came in, did we ever end up installing i3 on the streaming rig

1112
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,720
like we said we'd consider it?

1113
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:43,440
And I don't think we tried it on the streaming rig, but we did try i3 in the studio for a

1114
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:43,920
bit.

1115
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,000
And I think we did a live stream of me experimenting with Regolith for a little bit.

1116
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And then we thought about putting it on the Reaper machine.

1117
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,640
Ultimately, on the streaming machine, we've stuck with plasma and Kwin rules.

1118
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:00,080
And then on the recording machine, we've stuck with XFCE, but that's just because we

1119
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,080
haven't reloaded that box and it works.

1120
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,040
Right, I don't, I don't think we would go XFCE again, maybe.

1121
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,280
It hasn't been bad, but it's, I think it is missing a couple niceties that would go a

1122
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:09,840
long way.

1123
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,920
I would be very curious to see how that new pop shell did on the recording machine because

1124
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,640
we've got a lot of tiled windows, but some of the applications we use, especially like

1125
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,680
software to control a mixer, sort of random apps like that.

1126
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,040
Well, they don't always play nice.

1127
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,240
They've got weird floated windows.

1128
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:29,040
They don't perfectly fit with a tiling thing, but I think maybe a hybrid environment could

1129
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,240
find the right balance.

1130
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,640
When Wes said that XFCE hasn't been perfect for us, that's been kind of one of the problems

1131
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,040
is we run these weird apps like X32 edit, which is a little bit different.

1132
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:44,880
X32 edit by Barringer for our mixer is just not a common Linux app.

1133
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,520
No, and it's not using regular toolkits or anything.

1134
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,960
Yeah, it's very important to us.

1135
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,760
It's very important to us, but at the same time, it's like most Linux desktop environments

1136
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,440
don't know what to do with the window of it.

1137
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,880
They just, they can't figure it out.

1138
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,480
It doesn't have any traditional borders.

1139
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,440
It's just totally perplexing.

1140
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,560
And then additionally, when you have multiple monitors under XFCE, it seems like some of

1141
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,080
the applications we run like Reaper, for example, which again, love Reaper.

1142
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:14,800
But it's weird in this one way in that it just opens up dialog windows on what seemingly

1143
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,640
seems random or maybe not random.

1144
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,120
It's just whatever monitor you're not presently using.

1145
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,480
It's almost guaranteed to be the monitor that you don't think it should be on.

1146
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:22,800
I know.

1147
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,000
And then you're sitting there like, well, why is this application not responding?

1148
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,560
What's going on?

1149
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,440
Why did it freeze?

1150
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,160
What's happening?

1151
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:28,960
Yes, yes.

1152
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,960
And then you look, oh, oh, there's a yes, no dialog on another screen somewhere.

1153
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,840
And that's where XFCE hasn't been ideal.

1154
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:41,120
And we kind of speculated that i3 might be better, but we don't know yet.

1155
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,520
And we will have a link to the i3 live stream in the show notes, as always, if you'd like

1156
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,960
to catch that, if you missed it before.

1157
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,680
Wes, where do they find those handy show notes?

1158
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,720
LinuxUnplugged.com slash 362.

1159
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,280
You got it.

1160
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:53,840
You got it.

1161
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,160
All right.

1162
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,280
So that's batch one.

1163
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,720
We want to do this from time to time.

1164
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,520
We like following up on the stuff that we talked about because I think some of the most

1165
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,080
valuable reviews are the ones after you've used them for a while.

1166
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:06,560
So if you've got other things you'd like us to follow up on in a future episode, send

1167
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:06,800
them in.

1168
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,200
Go to LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact.

1169
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,000
We need your help.

1170
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,400
That's right.

1171
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,120
Or you could tweet me.

1172
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,480
That's how this whole thing kicked off.

1173
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,920
I'm at Chris Lass.

1174
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,720
Wes, what about you?

1175
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,920
At Wes Payne.

1176
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,440
Drew, Cheese, you guys, you online?

1177
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,320
You on the Twitters?

1178
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,520
At Cheese Bacon.

1179
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,720
I'm at Drew of Doom.

1180
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,920
Holy smokes.

1181
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,120
How about that?

1182
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,080
Oh, yeah, I follow you.

1183
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:24,560
I knew that.

1184
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,440
Well, you can also follow this show at Linux Unplugged and the network at Jupiter Signal.

1185
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,200
Now, we will be back soon.

1186
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,600
Actually, by the time you're hearing this, we'll be back at our regular time.

1187
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,920
So you can just join us Tuesday or go to LinuxUnplugged.com slash subscribe and get it

1188
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,800
every single week.

1189
01:01:38,800 --> 01:02:02,000
See you next Tuesday.

1190
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:26,640
Oh, I ran out during the music and turned on the AC again because this place I'm at

1191
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,720
doesn't run on the weekends.

1192
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,800
So it's 87 degrees in the studio right now.

1193
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,120
Chris, how in the world did you manage to last an hour and a half like that?

1194
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,240
Well, he's not wearing many clothes right now.

1195
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,160
They got an override mode on the old air conditioning, but it only lasts for an hour.

1196
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,600
So it resets to whatever the schedule is after an hour.

1197
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,600
So wait, Chris, were you a melting for the last 30 minutes?

1198
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:53,920
Oh, at least because we were we took like 45 minutes in the you know, before we got

1199
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,680
started just chatting.

1200
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,960
Ultimate pre-show.

1201
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,280
Yeah, it was pretty much just right at the top of the show.

1202
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,280
I'm oh, hey, guys, just a little visual.

1203
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,000
My back is like Niagara Falls right now.

1204
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,240
Let's just put it that way.

1205
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:36,720
Oh, Jesus, Chris.
