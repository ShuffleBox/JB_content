00:00.000 --> 00:01.300
There's this thing in the back of your mind

00:01.300 --> 00:02.360
where you sometimes wonder,

00:02.360 --> 00:04.100
I feel like computers used to be easier

00:04.100 --> 00:06.400
or they were faster or you could do more with less space

00:06.400 --> 00:08.820
and you always sort of kind of dismiss that.

00:08.820 --> 00:10.680
The practical voice comes in and says,

00:10.680 --> 00:12.280
oh, come on now, Chris.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.120
Computers are great.

00:13.120 --> 00:13.960
They do so much more.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.000
They're connected to the internet

00:15.000 --> 00:16.360
and they have richer content

00:16.360 --> 00:19.000
and they're so much more sophisticated.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.400
And I go, yeah, you know what?

00:20.400 --> 00:22.660
Practical self, you're right, you're right.

00:22.660 --> 00:25.400
But then you try out like Haiku OS,

00:25.400 --> 00:28.020
which is, it's from an era

00:28.020 --> 00:30.480
that almost feels like an alternative universe,

00:30.480 --> 00:32.920
the way personal computers could have gone

00:32.920 --> 00:36.760
and you realize that things may actually have been better

00:36.760 --> 00:38.640
and they were way ahead of their time.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.360
I didn't really expect to have this,

00:40.360 --> 00:41.500
but it just hit me in waves

00:41.500 --> 00:43.860
as I was trying out Haiku this week.

00:43.860 --> 00:46.020
It is another way of doing computing

00:46.020 --> 00:47.280
that I think was better.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.680
Like they nailed it back then.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.340
If BIOS or B-O-S, however you like to say it,

00:53.340 --> 00:57.040
had gotten the user desktop share that Linux has today,

00:57.040 --> 00:59.280
you know, something that's not substantial,

00:59.280 --> 01:02.160
but it's respectable and sustainable.

01:02.160 --> 01:06.880
If BIOS had achieved that back in the late 90s, early 2000s,

01:06.880 --> 01:08.320
they would be the most advanced,

01:08.320 --> 01:11.480
sophisticated operating system on the planet today

01:11.480 --> 01:14.000
because where Haiku is at right now

01:14.000 --> 01:15.640
is phenomenally mind blowing.

01:17.360 --> 01:22.360
This is Linux Unplugged episode 269 for October 2nd, 2018.

01:22.360 --> 01:27.360
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

01:36.120 --> 01:41.000
that's post-test barbecue and pre-switching to HaikuOS.

01:41.000 --> 01:41.840
My name is Chris.

01:41.840 --> 01:42.660
My name is Wes.

01:42.660 --> 01:43.840
Hello, Wes.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.800
We have a really fun episode today.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.240
In fact, it was one of these special episodes

01:48.240 --> 01:51.160
where I jumped on a train, took a ride down to Seattle

01:51.160 --> 01:53.480
and met up with Wes in his home turf

01:53.480 --> 01:55.920
so that way we could brainstorm about the show over lunch

01:55.920 --> 01:56.760
and on the drive up.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.640
At least that's our excuse.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.480
Worked pretty well.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.680
It did actually work really well.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.760
Thank you for the ride, by the way.

02:00.760 --> 02:01.660
That was great.

02:01.660 --> 02:03.320
I really enjoyed it because I could work on the train

02:03.320 --> 02:07.040
the whole way down and prep today's big, big show.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.440
So coming up, we'll get into some community news

02:09.440 --> 02:11.360
that I think is gonna peak your interest

02:11.360 --> 02:13.120
and things that we should probably just keep an eye on

02:13.120 --> 02:14.560
over the next few months.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.280
Plus we'll look back at what some may say

02:18.280 --> 02:20.160
was the heyday of computing.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.240
When everyone hated Microsoft

02:22.240 --> 02:24.760
and BOS was possibly going to be a thing.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.800
And then we'll look forward now with the new release

02:27.800 --> 02:30.320
that the Haiku project has just put out

02:30.320 --> 02:33.160
after a really, really long time.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.880
And we'll try to make the case for Haiku

02:34.880 --> 02:35.920
and why you should care.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.560
If you're sitting there thinking to yourself,

02:37.560 --> 02:38.920
what's the point?

02:38.920 --> 02:40.760
I hope we answer that today.

02:40.760 --> 02:45.320
Then we'll give you an update on our ThinkPad T480s.

02:45.320 --> 02:49.160
My thought on this is what's the point of doing a review

02:49.160 --> 02:51.440
if you don't follow up after using it for a while

02:51.440 --> 02:53.160
and tell you about some of the road bumps you've hit.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.320
And some of these apply to multiple breeds of laptops

02:56.320 --> 02:57.160
from several vendors.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.720
So we'll get into that, do a little followup there.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.600
Then we'll tell you about some of the new things we set up,

03:01.600 --> 03:03.720
the VM environments that we're doing

03:03.720 --> 03:06.000
and some of the tools we're using

03:06.000 --> 03:08.440
to try to manage those VM environments on our laptop.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.600
And then last but not least, a little bit of a tip.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.440
We've talked a lot about the LVFS project.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.120
Well, today we're gonna talk about doing LVFS the hard way.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.840
So perhaps you're not a Gnome Shell user,

03:19.840 --> 03:21.840
you don't have Gnome software.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.480
How do you get all of those great firmwares

03:24.480 --> 03:26.840
onto your machine and get your firmware updated

03:26.840 --> 03:28.760
if you don't have Gnome software?

03:28.760 --> 03:29.600
How do you do it?

03:29.600 --> 03:30.420
I wanna know.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.260
We'll tell you how to do it.

03:31.260 --> 03:33.340
It's just a few couple of easy commands

03:33.340 --> 03:35.720
that are probably already installed on your machine.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.080
And you can update your firmware from the command line,

03:38.080 --> 03:39.720
which is the proper way to do it.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.240
It's the proper, come on, that's the proper way to do it.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.400
Well, we can't go any farther though

03:44.400 --> 03:45.760
without bringing in our virtual lug.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.360
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.200
Hey, hello.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.040
Hello.

03:49.040 --> 03:49.860
Good morning.

03:49.860 --> 03:50.700
Wake up and smell the coffee.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.120
Ha, ha, ha.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.360
We got a great turnout.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.720
Brent is in there, Brandon is in there.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.720
We have two Erics, Eric and Eric the IT guy.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.960
Mr. KP, Mini-Mech, Ryan Sipes returns

04:00.960 --> 04:03.400
for a second show in a row, and Sean's back too.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.860
And Sean, you've been here for a while too.

04:04.860 --> 04:06.580
So guys, thank you so much.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.900
That Mumble Room is open.

04:07.900 --> 04:10.000
You can find out more by just googling

04:10.000 --> 04:11.200
Jupiter Colony Mumble, really.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.360
There's a setup guide.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.720
You just have to pass a mic check and have headphones,

04:14.720 --> 04:16.320
learn how to use Push to Talk,

04:16.320 --> 04:19.000
and you can join the conversation in the show.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.480
Next week is gonna be 270.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.320
What?

04:22.320 --> 04:23.800
Be really awesome to have a great showing.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.640
Yes, it would.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.460
Come join us.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.300
It's lots of fun.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.480
We did do the test barbecue after last week's episode.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.520
It went pretty well.

04:29.520 --> 04:33.640
There was one dynamic situation that,

04:33.640 --> 04:36.920
all in all, all things considered went pretty well.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.560
Wes brought us a surprise sous vide,

04:38.560 --> 04:41.360
but the sort of dynamic situation

04:41.360 --> 04:44.160
that had to be dealt with was the brown bear.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.000
You see.

04:45.000 --> 04:45.820
Oh boy.

04:45.820 --> 04:49.520
He, myself, not a big fan of the schnapps,

04:49.520 --> 04:51.400
but brown bears recently discovered Rupplemintz,

04:51.400 --> 04:54.460
which he's a pretty big fan of and it's pretty strong.

04:54.460 --> 04:58.080
So we discovered the boundaries

04:58.080 --> 04:59.780
of how much booze should be at the barbecue.

04:59.780 --> 05:01.280
So we'll get that right on the next one.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.480
It's an important thing to work out because,

05:03.480 --> 05:05.240
well, the results could have been disastrous.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.480
Yeah, everything went fine.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.300
It all went good.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.140
Only small damage.

05:09.140 --> 05:09.980
We're healed now.

05:09.980 --> 05:12.120
Had some good conversations though in the meantime.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.240
Speaking of great conversations,

05:13.240 --> 05:15.100
before we get into the community news,

05:15.100 --> 05:16.400
I just wanted to put out there

05:16.400 --> 05:18.800
that if you've been wondering, why was Chris gone?

05:18.800 --> 05:19.640
What happened to him?

05:19.640 --> 05:22.360
Why is he talking about himself in the third person?

05:22.360 --> 05:25.180
All of that gets explained in this week's,

05:25.180 --> 05:27.240
or last week's, I suppose, User Air,

05:27.240 --> 05:30.940
episode 49, not dead yet, air.show slash 49.

05:30.940 --> 05:33.080
I talk about my recent brush with death

05:33.080 --> 05:36.560
and what happened to me while I was in Texas.

05:36.560 --> 05:39.760
And then also we get into some bigger questions

05:39.760 --> 05:43.760
about Windows affecting bare metal Linux adoption now.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.720
And it's a pretty great episode.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.920
The guys invited me on to tell my story

05:46.920 --> 05:48.480
about my near brush with death.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.740
And I had a great time hanging out

05:49.740 --> 05:51.520
with Dan and Popey and Joe.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.520
And if you've been wondering what happened,

05:53.520 --> 05:58.520
I invite you to check out User Air, air.show slash 49.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.920
But with that out of the way,

05:59.920 --> 06:01.880
let's get into some community news.

06:01.880 --> 06:05.520
I have had an interesting conversation

06:05.520 --> 06:09.160
over the last week and a half with System76.

06:09.160 --> 06:13.320
And they've released publicly now information.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.740
It's just a bit of a tease at this point,

06:15.740 --> 06:18.280
but it's peaking my interest.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.560
Posted just recently on the System76 blog,

06:21.560 --> 06:24.820
they announced, quote, System76 is releasing

06:24.820 --> 06:27.740
a new open source computer available

06:27.740 --> 06:30.280
for pre-order next month.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.160
Hmm, really now?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.680
Yeah, yeah, an open source computer.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.160
Yeah, okay, well, so their CEO, Carl,

06:37.160 --> 06:39.720
posted a few days ago on Twitter

06:39.720 --> 06:41.560
that at this week's Open Hardware Summit,

06:41.560 --> 06:44.560
they'll be showing off this soon-to-be-released

06:44.560 --> 06:48.560
open hardware desktop, and it might be called Thelio.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.440
Yeah, it looks like it will.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.680
And there's not a ton of details yet.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.800
We know that System76 has been spinning up a warehouse

06:54.800 --> 06:57.120
where they're gonna build their own systems.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.920
But you're left with a lot of questions.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.560
And I'm kind of a naturally skeptical guy.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.600
So it's like, is this x86-based?

07:02.600 --> 07:03.940
Is this gonna be a RISC computer?

07:03.940 --> 07:06.240
Because really, you'd have to go RISC-V to go,

07:06.240 --> 07:07.400
I mean, I would think.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.800
Or is this something about the binary blobs

07:10.800 --> 07:11.800
will be required to run it?

07:11.800 --> 07:16.320
Like, what is the definition of fully open source here?

07:16.320 --> 07:17.760
What does that mean?

07:17.760 --> 07:20.560
And I haven't gotten a clear answer from them,

07:20.560 --> 07:23.720
but I did get an invitation to go out

07:23.720 --> 07:27.020
and visit towards mid-November-ish, I'm not quite sure,

07:27.020 --> 07:29.060
somewhere in the November month,

07:29.060 --> 07:30.480
to actually see the machine in person.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.040
So I'll be able to see it with my own eyes

07:32.040 --> 07:33.900
and see if it boots and what it is.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.520
But I think this is a pretty exciting opportunity

07:36.520 --> 07:37.900
because they're in a unique position

07:37.900 --> 07:40.040
to deliver on something like this.

07:40.040 --> 07:43.360
And it is obviously gonna resonate with a core audience

07:43.360 --> 07:45.560
that they are already well-established with.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.960
So there's a lot of possibilities here,

07:47.960 --> 07:50.400
depending on how free this thing is

07:50.400 --> 07:52.600
and if they're able to live up to expectations, I think.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.480
Right, these are goals that we talk about all the time

07:54.480 --> 07:56.760
that we wish, you know, when we're reviewing laptops,

07:56.760 --> 07:58.120
these are things we complain about.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.740
But what does it actually look like?

07:59.740 --> 08:02.000
It does seem like they're having a lot of fun

08:02.000 --> 08:04.500
setting up all their facilities to make this thing.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.320
So people just get to have fun

08:06.320 --> 08:07.640
playing with their new hardware.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.000
It's an unbelievable, mind-boggling,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.440
honestly panic-inducing investment, if you think about it.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.720
Carl must be a brave man

08:18.720 --> 08:21.880
because they had a very nice office in Denver

08:21.880 --> 08:26.120
and to move all of the operations into a warehouse

08:26.120 --> 08:30.000
and then really be learning how to set this thing up

08:30.000 --> 08:32.360
and how to manage a warehouse,

08:32.360 --> 08:34.120
while at the same time also trying

08:34.120 --> 08:36.120
to get new products spun up,

08:36.120 --> 08:38.560
I get overwhelmed at the idea of how do I even lay out

08:38.560 --> 08:39.880
a warehouse to manufacture computers?

08:39.880 --> 08:43.120
Like that detail alone is overwhelming to me,

08:43.120 --> 08:44.800
not even to consider the fact that I've,

08:44.800 --> 08:46.880
it's this massive financial investment

08:46.880 --> 08:48.880
for a business like System76

08:48.880 --> 08:50.920
and moving your crew and having them set up

08:50.920 --> 08:53.960
in a new location is a massive work culture change for them.

08:53.960 --> 08:58.920
Like every single level, this is a very big gamble

08:58.920 --> 09:02.020
and it could pay off very well for them.

09:02.020 --> 09:04.360
It could position them as a particular kind of leader

09:04.360 --> 09:07.520
in this market and it also could fail

09:07.520 --> 09:10.080
to gain enough traction to make everything sustainable.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.240
And it's not the only machine

09:11.240 --> 09:13.000
they're gonna make out of this place,

09:13.000 --> 09:14.840
but it is fascinating to watch

09:14.840 --> 09:17.560
and I'm kind of glad they're the ones doing it

09:17.560 --> 09:20.000
because I couldn't imagine anybody else pulling this off.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.400
Right, it does seem to be like them living their values

09:22.400 --> 09:24.600
to some extent and if a company is gonna do it,

09:24.600 --> 09:28.140
well, System76 has talked the talk for sure, so.

09:28.140 --> 09:29.520
Ryan, I'm not gonna put you on the spot.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.280
I notice you're not tagging me in mumble

09:31.280 --> 09:32.780
to say anything about this.

09:32.780 --> 09:36.040
Do you have any thoughts in general on this topic?

09:36.040 --> 09:38.760
Yeah, I think that it's a great company

09:38.760 --> 09:42.400
and this has been a big goal of theirs for a while

09:42.400 --> 09:47.400
and I know that everyone there is really excited to do it

09:47.840 --> 09:51.120
and if somebody's gonna pull it off,

09:51.120 --> 09:53.160
I'd love to see somebody who cares as much

09:53.160 --> 09:56.880
about the open source ethos as they do

09:56.880 --> 09:58.140
be the ones to do it.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.040
You know, you could almost run for office with that answer.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.520
That is a very good answer.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.360
Be careful.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.960
It's a safe answer but I know what you mean, I follow you.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.940
All right, well, let's keep going.

10:08.940 --> 10:10.760
Let's talk about something

10:10.760 --> 10:13.060
that Haiku has apparently nailed already.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.600
Oh, yes, okay, that is true.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.040
Now, Chris, you might be familiar

10:18.040 --> 10:20.200
with a little distribution known as Fedora.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.040
Oh, yeah.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.040
Okay, well, then you probably know Fedora29

10:23.040 --> 10:25.240
is right around the corner.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.180
There's a lot of goodies coming out there,

10:27.180 --> 10:29.220
including, well, you know, some of that work

10:29.220 --> 10:32.040
they have done optimizing battery life.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.400
One exciting thing I noticed,

10:34.400 --> 10:36.520
Fedora29 is looking to provide

10:36.520 --> 10:39.960
a flicker-free boot experience.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.160
Flicker-free, you say?

10:41.160 --> 10:42.480
Yeah, I mean, this is kind of the goal

10:42.480 --> 10:43.320
we've been waiting for.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.080
You get it on those other operating systems,

10:46.080 --> 10:47.500
even some surprising ones,

10:47.500 --> 10:50.640
but even with like fancy Plymouth setups,

10:50.640 --> 10:52.840
there's still a little flicker left.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.320
You know, it's one of those intangibles too

10:54.320 --> 10:55.800
because you look at it and go, who cares?

10:55.800 --> 10:58.360
You know, but then when you power up a system

10:58.360 --> 11:02.400
and the entire process is smooth and flicker-free,

11:02.400 --> 11:05.720
there is a intangible cohesiveness to it

11:05.720 --> 11:08.480
that feels polished and complete

11:08.480 --> 11:11.400
and the opposite of rough.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.040
Like when you see it flashing,

11:13.040 --> 11:14.220
it feels like you can kind of see

11:14.220 --> 11:15.280
where the tape's holding it together,

11:15.280 --> 11:16.120
like the little rough.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.600
Exactly, yeah, the connection points.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.280
Yeah, and I kind of commend Fedora

11:21.280 --> 11:23.400
for just plugging away at this now

11:23.400 --> 11:26.560
for what feels like a fricking decade.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.280
But they've had a lot of curveballs.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.640
You know, the premise of this long desired

11:30.640 --> 11:35.600
fricker-free boot is to maintain the same resolution

11:35.600 --> 11:37.420
and mode set from the system boot

11:37.420 --> 11:39.320
through the desktop loading

11:39.320 --> 11:42.160
without any of those unnecessary mode set operations

11:42.160 --> 11:43.600
that will cause your screen to flash

11:43.600 --> 11:45.840
or sudden graphics changes in order to provide

11:45.840 --> 11:48.360
this whole smooth experience all the way.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.400
Yeah, they've got a great video

11:49.400 --> 11:50.240
showing you what it looks like

11:50.240 --> 11:53.760
and it looks like what you see on other operating systems,

11:53.760 --> 11:55.400
but that motherboard logo,

11:55.400 --> 11:57.480
whoever you're system manufacturing,

11:57.480 --> 11:59.360
well, it just stays on the screen

11:59.360 --> 12:01.640
and then your operating system loads.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.760
Oh, so they're doing it through an EFI frame buffer, really.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.280
So it's not like they're putting a Fedora logo

12:06.280 --> 12:07.280
up on the screen.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.440
Right, now there may be some options to add,

12:09.440 --> 12:12.580
let's say, additional overlay graphics on top of the logo,

12:12.580 --> 12:15.240
but the whole idea and the work they've done

12:15.240 --> 12:18.440
is that whatever the system has drawn at the very start,

12:18.440 --> 12:21.120
you keep that buffer and then you just add things on top

12:21.120 --> 12:24.420
or hand it off, let's say, to grub or to the kernel.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.460
A lot of my machines, not all of them,

12:26.460 --> 12:29.080
but a lot of my machines let you replace that logo.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.040
So you could put a Fedora logo in there.

12:31.040 --> 12:31.880
Perfect.

12:31.880 --> 12:32.720
Or just screw with people

12:32.720 --> 12:34.020
and put a Debian logo in there

12:34.020 --> 12:35.560
so when they think they're putting their faces in it,

12:35.560 --> 12:37.520
there's a lot of fun you can have with that.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.160
There is a caveat to this story,

12:39.160 --> 12:41.840
like many of these new shiny things,

12:41.840 --> 12:43.680
there still is work that has to be done

12:43.680 --> 12:46.680
to get this working with Radeon or NVIDIA drivers.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.200
So it's Intel only at the moment.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.960
Not too unusual there with that,

12:51.960 --> 12:54.240
but from the unusual department,

12:54.240 --> 12:57.660
this is a big secret that we've heard rumors about,

12:57.660 --> 13:00.120
I think we covered them back in March on this show,

13:00.120 --> 13:01.600
so don't tell anybody about this one.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.040
The cone of silence.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.860
All right, now that it's just us kids,

13:09.860 --> 13:12.800
Google is working on bringing game streaming

13:12.800 --> 13:13.800
to the Chrome browser,

13:13.800 --> 13:17.440
and this could have massive implications for desktop Linux.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.600
All of the other places out there like TechCrunch

13:19.600 --> 13:22.020
and The Verge are talking about Chrome OS,

13:22.020 --> 13:23.200
but screw Chrome OS.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.200
Think about desktop Linux in general,

13:25.200 --> 13:26.520
because you know this is gonna be a feature

13:26.520 --> 13:27.400
that lands in Chrome.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.880
I mean, we're talking about H.264 decoding,

13:29.880 --> 13:32.920
some super fancy input management.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.680
We're talking about technologies

13:34.680 --> 13:36.040
that are gonna be a general stack

13:36.040 --> 13:37.780
that gets baked into Chrome itself.

13:38.680 --> 13:43.680
When you take just the native library of Steam,

13:43.720 --> 13:45.560
plus now what you can do with Proton

13:45.560 --> 13:47.760
or what you will be able to do in the future,

13:48.680 --> 13:52.380
and then you combine it with this Google Stream project,

13:52.380 --> 13:53.200
where it's gonna probably be

13:53.200 --> 13:55.220
a whole nother category of games,

13:55.220 --> 14:00.180
we may be months away from just about every game

14:00.180 --> 14:01.800
being available to Linux.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.560
The year of the Linux gaming desktop?

14:03.560 --> 14:06.600
Well, it's really the year of the Chrome gaming desktop,

14:06.600 --> 14:07.760
if this is true.

14:07.760 --> 14:10.760
Google this week unveiled Project Stream,

14:10.760 --> 14:13.080
and while Google calls this a technical test,

14:13.080 --> 14:16.140
pay no attention, we all kind of see where this is going.

14:16.140 --> 14:20.000
It's a test to see how well streaming a game to Chrome works,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.200
and it's clear that this is a foundational technology

14:22.200 --> 14:24.360
for game streaming service in general.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.480
So far, they've partnered with Ubisoft

14:26.480 --> 14:28.880
and are giving a limited number of players access

14:28.880 --> 14:30.680
to Assassin's Creed Odyssey

14:30.680 --> 14:32.680
for free for the duration of the test.

14:32.680 --> 14:33.980
It's U.S. only.

14:33.980 --> 14:37.200
You have to be able to handle 25 megabits per second,

14:37.200 --> 14:39.520
and you have to be older than 17 to participate,

14:39.520 --> 14:41.680
and you have to have an Ubisoft account

14:41.680 --> 14:44.020
and a Google account.

14:44.020 --> 14:45.200
I don't know if I have an Ubisoft account,

14:45.200 --> 14:46.040
but I'd make one.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.720
So you could sign up already.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.720
I did, perfect.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.560
Have you tried it?

14:49.560 --> 14:50.380
Are you gonna sign up?

14:50.380 --> 14:51.220
Oh, I already did, yeah, of course.

14:51.220 --> 14:52.720
We probably all did, really.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.880
I'm not so sure about this.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.720
I am not as much of a doubter

14:58.720 --> 15:00.880
as I think most of the audience is about streaming games.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.680
I've tried several.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.600
Nvidia has their own service

15:04.600 --> 15:07.920
that works fantastic on the Nvidia Shield,

15:07.920 --> 15:10.280
and I've played many games on that,

15:10.280 --> 15:12.160
just tried it out for like three months,

15:12.160 --> 15:14.000
and never really had any issues.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.360
I've played games I've been wanting to play for ages,

15:16.360 --> 15:18.520
but just was never gonna install Windows to play them,

15:18.520 --> 15:19.720
and they were great.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.240
As long as they worked okay with a controller,

15:21.240 --> 15:22.200
they were great.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.640
This, by the way, this setup,

15:23.640 --> 15:25.400
will require that you hook up a controller

15:25.400 --> 15:26.240
to your Chromebook.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.080
Oh, interesting.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.400
Or your machine learning Chrome.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.960
They say either a PlayStation controller or an Xbox.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.440
It does seem like it's gonna work better

15:33.440 --> 15:35.040
for some classes of game.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.800
Various games are more or less sensitive

15:36.800 --> 15:38.520
to different input latencies,

15:38.520 --> 15:41.360
so maybe it's not gonna be the best for your FPSs,

15:41.360 --> 15:43.320
but it's exciting.

15:43.320 --> 15:46.160
Do we want to moan about how big and bloated

15:46.160 --> 15:47.120
Chrome is getting?

15:47.120 --> 15:50.280
I mean, a game streaming engine in this thing now.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.400
They've got remote desktop capabilities.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.280
It really is a platform with a browser included.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.240
I am curious, has there been discussion of,

15:58.240 --> 15:59.320
obviously, it seems like right now

15:59.320 --> 16:02.480
they're just donating all the compute and GPUs

16:02.480 --> 16:04.200
to do this in the cloud somewhere.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.040
Oh, it's gonna be a pay service.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.600
So yeah, what is that gonna look like?

16:06.600 --> 16:08.840
How much would you pay for that

16:08.840 --> 16:11.200
if you didn't have to get a Windows box?

16:11.200 --> 16:12.360
You know, if you look at Google's history,

16:12.360 --> 16:13.660
oh, that's a good way to put it.

16:13.660 --> 16:14.500
You're right.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.160
This could save you even a Windows license.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.520
Right, because you could set up a gaming machine

16:18.520 --> 16:20.260
and do like the Steam streaming, for instance,

16:20.260 --> 16:21.320
if you wanted to now.

16:22.780 --> 16:26.160
I would say the way Google's gonna do this

16:26.160 --> 16:28.420
is they're gonna bundle it with some other service.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.560
Like, you know how they have YouTube Premium now,

16:30.560 --> 16:32.260
and then when you get that,

16:32.260 --> 16:34.840
you also get Google Music with it and things like that.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.620
They'll bundle, I bet.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.160
That could be one way they do this.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.760
You could discharge separately for the service,

16:40.760 --> 16:41.960
but I'm trying to think,

16:41.960 --> 16:45.400
I can't remember the name of that gaming service.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.320
On Live, I think it was?

16:46.320 --> 16:47.160
Yeah, I can't remember it.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.460
On Live.

16:48.460 --> 16:49.940
They couldn't make it sustainable.

16:49.940 --> 16:51.380
Think about the overhead with this.

16:51.380 --> 16:55.020
You have to have racks and racks and racks

16:55.020 --> 16:58.200
full of machines with monster GPUs

16:58.200 --> 17:00.320
with incredible network performance

17:00.320 --> 17:02.120
with huge CDN connections.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.600
Like, this is not a cheap operation.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.400
Even if you have 500 users,

17:06.400 --> 17:09.200
just think about the load of 500 users

17:09.200 --> 17:12.320
playing high-end 1080p, 60 frames per second,

17:12.320 --> 17:13.240
Assassin's Creed.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.760
That's a big job for a data center.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.720
Google does have a pretty big head start, right?

17:18.720 --> 17:19.560
They've already got...

17:19.560 --> 17:20.400
They're probably one of the few

17:20.400 --> 17:21.760
that has an infrastructure to do this

17:21.760 --> 17:23.920
at a massive million user scale.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.680
See, On Live ran into just run costs.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.200
They couldn't charge enough.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.360
Plus, they kept running into the issue

17:29.360 --> 17:31.940
of the game publishers also wanted a ton of money

17:31.940 --> 17:34.080
for every time somebody played a game,

17:34.080 --> 17:36.120
and they had problems just porting the games

17:36.120 --> 17:38.640
to some of the requirements of their platform.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.280
So to do this at a scale,

17:40.280 --> 17:42.960
you almost have to be making money

17:42.960 --> 17:45.200
on the infrastructure with other things.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.600
And then the gaming is something you can afford to do.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.120
It can't be like the only thing that makes you money.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.960
So they've got the infrastructure in place

17:51.960 --> 17:53.440
for all the other Google services.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.360
They've got the bandwidth to the homes.

17:55.360 --> 17:59.280
They've got some of their own fiber that they own.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.960
And they've got the compute.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.840
So it seems like they could probably charge

18:03.840 --> 18:05.840
eight to 15 bucks a month,

18:05.840 --> 18:08.020
and you get access to a huge gaming library

18:08.020 --> 18:09.480
right in your Chrome browser.

18:09.480 --> 18:10.320
And you hit full screen,

18:10.320 --> 18:11.520
you don't even know you're in Chrome.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.360
Now, the question is,

18:12.360 --> 18:14.000
do we trust Google of all companies

18:14.000 --> 18:16.560
to run a service like this for a long time?

18:16.560 --> 18:19.020
Like, is this gonna be a test that they do once,

18:19.020 --> 18:21.400
and then nothing happens?

18:21.400 --> 18:22.760
Maybe if we knew more,

18:22.760 --> 18:25.420
if we could just know more about what they're doing here,

18:25.420 --> 18:26.860
like Ryan points out,

18:26.860 --> 18:28.480
wouldn't it be great to have the details?

18:28.480 --> 18:30.540
Yeah, I was just thinking about the fact

18:30.540 --> 18:33.760
that we don't really know how this is running

18:33.760 --> 18:36.020
on their infrastructure.

18:36.020 --> 18:38.320
And you talked about OnLive.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.880
Did OnLive have a Windows license

18:40.880 --> 18:44.480
for every instance that ran a game?

18:45.360 --> 18:46.720
Is this using Proton?

18:46.720 --> 18:49.640
Is this doing something else entirely?

18:49.640 --> 18:51.120
I'd be really interested to know.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.480
Yeah, I wonder too, since they require controllers,

18:53.480 --> 18:55.320
they could be the console version somehow,

18:55.320 --> 18:56.260
although very doubtful.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.960
You're gonna want them in a PC platform, I would think.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.880
We'll keep an eye on it, as we do.

19:00.880 --> 19:05.120
It gave me the thought that maybe I should consider

19:05.120 --> 19:07.760
getting a Chromebook, now that they can run Linux apps,

19:07.760 --> 19:09.360
and soon they'll be able to stream games,

19:09.360 --> 19:11.400
and they have a Samba file browser in them.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.920
Be part of the Zeitgeist, Chris.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.520
Well, I feel like maybe I have a blind spot all of a sudden.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.320
You know, like I'm not really following that.

19:17.320 --> 19:20.240
No, I don't use them, I don't have one, but I'm curious.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.200
Let's go back in time a little bit.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.500
These days, the conversation around Microsoft

19:26.500 --> 19:28.000
is how they've embraced open source,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.760
20,000 developers on GitHub.

19:30.760 --> 19:34.640
They just released DOS as open source on GitHub.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.280
I think, what was it, MIT license, I can't remember.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.280
But no pull requests.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.120
No pull requests.

19:39.120 --> 19:39.940
No, thank you.

19:39.940 --> 19:40.780
No pull requests.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.240
But the conversation's really shifted.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.000
Azure is dominated now by Linux.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.640
Their workload on Azure, or Azure,

19:46.640 --> 19:50.360
is 50% to 60% Linux boxes now.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.640
Visual Studio Code is a massive project.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.560
.NET Core, PowerShell Core, all open source projects.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.400
TypeScript.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.240
Huge, yeah.

19:57.240 --> 19:58.080
Really huge.

19:58.080 --> 20:01.960
And so, there is an understandable kind of cock-the-head,

20:01.960 --> 20:04.800
why do so many Linux users still hate Microsoft?

20:06.040 --> 20:09.440
And if you go back in time, all is revealed.

20:09.440 --> 20:13.280
And October marks the 20th anniversary

20:13.280 --> 20:14.920
of the Halloween documents.

20:15.920 --> 20:20.360
In October of 1998, a confidential Microsoft memorandum

20:20.360 --> 20:22.240
on Redmond's strategy against Linux

20:22.240 --> 20:24.740
and open source software was leaked.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.600
And it's sort of just gone away.

20:28.600 --> 20:33.600
Now, this represents, in my view, a tactical Microsoft.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.880
One that was looking at a new threat to its business model

20:36.880 --> 20:40.320
and being honest with what its advantages were.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.720
And I'll give you a couple of examples here.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.880
So, here's some key quotes from their analysis of Linux.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.040
So, they say, the Linux OS could become,

20:51.040 --> 20:53.640
in a sense, the next Java VM.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.320
And that sounds weird, but they were kind of right.

20:57.320 --> 21:02.160
I mean, back in the mid-90s to late-90s, Java was huge.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.960
And now, Linux runs everywhere,

21:04.960 --> 21:07.880
even on Windows, just like Java.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.400
So, they were kind of right.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.440
It has kind of become the universal platform.

21:12.440 --> 21:13.720
Couple of other things they noted

21:13.720 --> 21:16.040
in these Halloween documents,

21:16.040 --> 21:18.460
which was so controversial back in the time.

21:18.460 --> 21:20.380
How could they say this?

21:20.380 --> 21:21.460
Here's one.

21:21.460 --> 21:25.260
An advanced Win32 GUI user would have a short learning cycle

21:25.260 --> 21:27.360
to become a productive user under Linux.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.200
Oh, boy.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Here's another one.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.240
Consumers love it.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.520
Yeah, they do.

21:34.520 --> 21:35.360
That's it right there.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.480
That's a pull quote from the memorandum.

21:37.480 --> 21:38.900
Using today's server requirements,

21:38.900 --> 21:40.480
Linux is a credible alternative

21:40.480 --> 21:41.880
to commercial developed servers

21:41.880 --> 21:44.140
in many high-volume applications.

21:46.320 --> 21:47.360
That seems to be interesting.

21:47.360 --> 21:49.480
They also note the effect of patents and copyright

21:49.480 --> 21:52.760
in combating Linux remains to be investigated.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.360
So, there is a couple of interesting quotes in here,

21:54.360 --> 21:58.440
but what I read is a strategic plodding Microsoft

21:58.440 --> 22:00.680
that hasn't accepted where things are going yet,

22:00.680 --> 22:02.640
because this is the 90s.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.240
They haven't seen anything like this before.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.380
Right, was trying to wrap their head around this.

22:06.380 --> 22:09.620
But it caused such an outrage in the community

22:09.620 --> 22:12.360
that a bunch of anti-Microsoft camps came up.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.880
And there is a lot in these memorandums,

22:13.880 --> 22:16.360
including doing damage control,

22:16.360 --> 22:18.760
where Microsoft develops an emergency response team

22:18.760 --> 22:21.640
to cope with Linux conversation announcements,

22:21.640 --> 22:22.840
I'm sorry, conversion announcements,

22:22.840 --> 22:25.040
and people announce they're converting their systems

22:25.040 --> 22:26.960
over to Linux, Microsoft would create a strike team

22:26.960 --> 22:28.520
to try to help mitigate that.

22:28.520 --> 22:30.480
There's some good stuff in there,

22:30.480 --> 22:32.140
including the Get the Facts campaign,

22:32.140 --> 22:33.480
which really got people riled up.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.320
Do you remember that?

22:34.320 --> 22:35.560
I forgot about that, oh!

22:35.560 --> 22:37.560
Yeah, yeah, the Get the Facts campaign

22:37.560 --> 22:39.800
and the total cost of ownership, which really riled up.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.960
Gotta have that TCO.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.600
How dare Microsoft talk about the total cost of ownership

22:43.600 --> 22:46.720
when we're offering a free operating system for life?

22:46.720 --> 22:49.040
You know, it was just great.

22:49.040 --> 22:53.000
And it really puts you in that mindset of the 90s.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.800
And it was fun to revisit,

22:54.800 --> 22:57.040
but you really can see how things have changed,

22:57.040 --> 22:58.980
how far things have come.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.440
Well, not everything.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.800
Some things may have been better in the 90s.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.880
I hate to be that guy.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.080
So let's go with the 2000s.

23:08.080 --> 23:11.040
In fact, let's go with March 2000.

23:11.040 --> 23:14.960
In March of 2000, one of the best operating systems

23:14.960 --> 23:17.880
ever released to humanity came out.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.040
And it was called BOS R5.

23:20.040 --> 23:24.460
It was the final version of BOS from B Incorporated.

23:24.460 --> 23:28.340
It came in two varieties, professional and personal.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.920
And this was the release that I got my hands on.

23:32.920 --> 23:37.580
It was also the first release of BOS for the x86 platform

23:37.580 --> 23:39.920
and made freely available to download.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.720
So check, check, check for me, right?

23:41.720 --> 23:42.560
Ooh!

23:43.480 --> 23:46.400
You would download it or you could order a CD-ROM.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.360
And if you did that, it would ship with legal encoding

23:49.360 --> 23:50.840
and decoding for MP3.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.920
On a live CD, a live CD.

23:53.920 --> 23:58.760
So it was a very well-designed operating system, I felt.

23:58.760 --> 24:02.700
But my bias was I didn't grow up with DOS in the home

24:02.700 --> 24:04.040
or Unix in the home.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.360
After the early computer era,

24:07.360 --> 24:11.260
after like the trashes and the early consoles,

24:12.220 --> 24:14.960
I jumped on a Mac because my mom was a graphic artist.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.920
So she got herself an old-

24:16.920 --> 24:17.760
That makes sense.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.520
This is like the black and white days of Mac OS,

24:19.520 --> 24:21.020
like Mac OS system one.

24:21.020 --> 24:24.660
Or it's just, I don't know what it was called back then.

24:24.660 --> 24:27.600
And it had some simple advantages to it.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.620
If you wanted to extend the operating system,

24:29.620 --> 24:31.520
you would take an extension file

24:31.520 --> 24:33.640
and you would drag it into the extensions folder.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.400
And if you no longer wanted that functionality

24:35.400 --> 24:36.920
or it conflicted with something else,

24:36.920 --> 24:38.920
you would just go into the extensions folder

24:38.920 --> 24:40.080
and you would move it out.

24:40.080 --> 24:40.900
And then it would no longer,

24:40.900 --> 24:42.320
your system would no longer have that.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.860
If you wanted to install an application,

24:43.860 --> 24:46.480
you would just drag it into a folder and it was installed.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.640
There was a simplicity to it.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.820
If you needed to get access to your hard drive,

24:49.820 --> 24:51.800
you could just plug it into another Mac.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.500
It would mount right there on the desktop.

24:53.500 --> 24:54.440
You could move files around.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.640
You could even copy over the system folder, reboot,

24:57.640 --> 24:59.380
and now boot off of that system folder

24:59.380 --> 25:01.280
that you just copied over there.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.040
It was remarkably simple,

25:03.040 --> 25:06.820
but yet pretty sophisticated for its day.

25:06.820 --> 25:08.940
It also had a lot of issues.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.880
It wasn't properly threaded.

25:10.880 --> 25:14.000
It crashed all the time.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.360
But an intrepid group built BOS

25:16.360 --> 25:19.000
around some of those same concepts.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.280
But they built it to be multi-threaded

25:21.280 --> 25:23.920
at a ridiculously fundamental level.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.160
And they created a file system

25:26.160 --> 25:27.620
that even Redmond had to dream about,

25:27.620 --> 25:29.360
something that was database powered.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.880
They created a system that was powerful,

25:31.880 --> 25:34.280
very fast, very stable,

25:34.280 --> 25:36.440
Unix-like in a lot of ways,

25:36.440 --> 25:40.240
but simple in a Mac OS classic way.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.720
But unfortunately, they just weren't successful.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.680
They just couldn't really be sustainable.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.880
And you do wonder what things would be like

25:48.880 --> 25:51.640
if they had been successful.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.300
And that's where the Haiku project comes in

25:54.300 --> 25:56.680
and brings us all something wonderful.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.200
If we can take an afternoon or an evening

25:59.200 --> 26:01.600
just to play with this free software.

26:01.600 --> 26:05.680
And they finally released another beta release.

26:05.680 --> 26:10.880
Yeah, it's been, well, almost six years since Haiku's last release.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.440
Yeah, November 2012.

26:13.440 --> 26:16.440
That's kind of too long and it makes you worry about a project.

26:16.440 --> 26:20.320
But after all that time, there are a ton of new features

26:20.320 --> 26:22.640
and we have a brand new beta.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.240
Haiku is really now its own project.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.760
It's a continuation of the philosophy and themes of BOS,

26:27.760 --> 26:29.880
but mostly it's its own thing now.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.760
But it does still have some of that heritage.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.880
For example, it has two flavors, 32-bit and 64-bit.

26:35.880 --> 26:39.800
The minimum requirements are an Intel Pentium 2 or AMD Athlon,

26:39.800 --> 26:44.760
256 megabytes of RAM, and you need at least an 800 by 600 screen

26:44.760 --> 26:46.880
and they recommend three gigs of storage.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.360
I think I got that.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.880
Now, their 64-bit version, they recommend an i3 at least

26:50.880 --> 26:53.680
and two gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of storage.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.120
But some of the things they've introduced in Haiku

26:56.120 --> 26:57.440
are delightful now.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.440
They've introduced Haiku Depot, which

26:59.440 --> 27:01.920
is probably the biggest change in the way

27:01.920 --> 27:02.960
that you work with Haiku.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.520
They have a legitimate package management system

27:05.520 --> 27:07.800
and Haiku Depot sits on top of that.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.600
And it's very easy to use.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.640
Lots of cute applications in there, as in QT.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.520
It's nice.

27:14.520 --> 27:18.680
And pretty fast, pretty complete too.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.920
And it matches it with a command line.

27:21.920 --> 27:23.920
But the cool thing is, like the Mac Classic,

27:23.920 --> 27:25.760
some packages are merely activated.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.200
They're not installed.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.760
And that, unlike the Classic Mac,

27:29.760 --> 27:31.840
means you can do even more with Haiku.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.320
The bootloader has been given some capacity to affect them.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.320
So you can now boot into a previous package state,

27:37.320 --> 27:39.880
like say you have a bad update, or you can even

27:39.880 --> 27:42.520
go in and blacklist an individual file, which is just

27:42.520 --> 27:43.600
stored in a settings file.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.000
So if you want to mount the BOS drive from another system,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.400
you can go in there, blacklist an individual file,

27:48.400 --> 27:50.600
plug the hard drive back into the machine, boot up.

27:50.600 --> 27:51.760
It's done.

27:51.760 --> 27:52.960
That's fantastic.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.680
We don't really have that feature now.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.480
No.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.960
No, and of course, it's got all the other kinds

27:57.960 --> 28:00.960
of nice advanced features too, like disk transactions

28:00.960 --> 28:03.160
for managing packages.

28:03.160 --> 28:06.040
Not only does it do it there, but it's all transactions

28:06.040 --> 28:07.840
written to the file system.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.920
You can thus also manage installed package sets

28:09.920 --> 28:11.800
on non-running Haiku systems.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.560
And accompanying the package manager

28:13.560 --> 28:16.440
is a massively revamped port system

28:16.440 --> 28:18.560
that has moved from an organized array of build scripts

28:18.560 --> 28:21.040
to a well-oiled, full-fledged port street,

28:21.040 --> 28:24.000
containing a wide variety of both native software

28:24.000 --> 28:27.080
and software that's getting ported to Haiku.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.680
It's a good list of stuff in there too.

28:28.680 --> 28:29.200
It really is.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.080
I mean, you can use it too.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.320
It has Wi-Fi support.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.560
They've borrowed the network stack from FreeBSD,

28:34.560 --> 28:37.800
so you've got all kinds of networking goodies in there.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.680
And here's another example of cleverness.

28:39.680 --> 28:43.720
Haiku's native remote desktop application is slick.

28:43.720 --> 28:46.800
Unlike VNC or other bitmap-based protocols,

28:46.800 --> 28:49.680
Haiku's remote desktop forwards the drawing commands

28:49.680 --> 28:53.040
from the host system to the client system, which

28:53.040 --> 28:55.480
for most applications, and pretty much all of them

28:55.480 --> 28:59.360
except for video, consume significantly lower bandwidth.

28:59.360 --> 29:02.240
It's similar to how pre-compositing X11 operates,

29:02.240 --> 29:05.480
or it's pretty close to how Microsoft's RDP operates,

29:05.480 --> 29:07.320
where you don't send the bitmaps,

29:07.320 --> 29:09.920
you send the draw commands, which are just commands,

29:09.920 --> 29:12.200
and then the client actually does the drawing locally.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.360
You don't need any special server.

29:14.360 --> 29:17.200
As long as you have SSH access, you can do this.

29:17.200 --> 29:20.000
And you get a native client included with Haiku,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.220
but there's also an HTML5 client you

29:22.220 --> 29:24.040
can run in any web browser.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.000
And we've had some fun with it.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.080
We tried it out on this Dell that

29:28.080 --> 29:29.480
will be the precision laptop that we're

29:29.480 --> 29:30.800
going to try to review next week.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.800
We were going to review it this week,

29:31.800 --> 29:32.840
but we're going to try to review it next week.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.200
We loaded on that with the 4K screen.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.880
And I also put it under virtualization on my Lenovo,

29:38.880 --> 29:41.400
which I'll talk more about my virtualization setup.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.880
But I was pleased to see that they

29:42.880 --> 29:44.720
have made modifications to the new release

29:44.720 --> 29:47.640
to support virtio, bus, and drivers.

29:47.640 --> 29:50.560
So it works pretty great under QEMU and KVM.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.920
I did have to make a slight change to actually have

29:52.920 --> 29:54.120
the mouse input work well.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.400
So if you want to try out Haiku and you just

29:56.400 --> 29:58.840
want to run it under VM, it'll work pretty good.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.160
It's snappy, yeah.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.500
But if you're using like Virt Manager and your mouse

30:02.500 --> 30:06.000
is jumpy, go into the details of the virtual machine

30:06.000 --> 30:09.200
that you have Haiku installed, go to Add Hardware,

30:09.200 --> 30:14.440
and then Input, and then add an EV Touch USB graphics tablet.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.280
And the reason why you do this is it

30:16.280 --> 30:20.280
forces Virt Manager to operate with an absolute mouse

30:20.280 --> 30:23.200
resolution instead of like a guesstimated mouse resolution.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.400
Because it thinks maybe you're dealing with a tablet

30:25.400 --> 30:26.560
or something, I don't know.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.920
And that made my mouse nice and smooth under Haiku under VM.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.380
So if you want to try it, that's the way to go.

30:32.380 --> 30:32.960
So it's nice.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.000
It's really, really nice.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.160
But you might be wondering what's

30:36.160 --> 30:39.240
really so great about it besides the simplicity, the speed,

30:39.240 --> 30:41.960
the stability, and really the cleverness of it.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.920
Yeah, I already run a Tiling desktop on my Linux computer,

30:44.920 --> 30:45.400
Chris.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.320
What am I getting here?

30:46.320 --> 30:47.680
What are you getting here?

30:47.680 --> 30:51.080
Well, eventually, someday, maybe, no.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.580
Actually, what you see is, like I was talking about earlier,

30:53.580 --> 30:56.040
it's almost an alternative universe of the way computing

30:56.040 --> 30:57.220
could have been.

30:57.220 --> 31:02.120
And you can't help but observe just how far ahead of everyone

31:02.120 --> 31:02.960
they were.

31:02.960 --> 31:06.320
And they're able to pull off some stuff that we still

31:06.320 --> 31:08.960
haven't nailed down in Linux.

31:08.960 --> 31:12.460
Like, for example, Haiku has a series of kits.

31:12.460 --> 31:13.960
And it's all explained in the B-book,

31:13.960 --> 31:16.600
which we'll have linked in the show notes.

31:16.600 --> 31:20.960
But they have an application kit, a device kit, a game kit,

31:20.960 --> 31:24.240
an input server kit, the mail kit, the network kit.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.640
These are all essentially kits that are

31:26.640 --> 31:28.320
starting points for developers.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.160
The application kit, for example,

31:30.160 --> 31:33.160
is classes that establish an application

31:33.160 --> 31:35.960
as an identifiable entity, one that could cooperate,

31:35.960 --> 31:37.640
and then also tells it how to communicate

31:37.640 --> 31:40.300
with other applications, all described in the application

31:40.300 --> 31:40.800
kit.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.280
If you want to connect an input device to Haiku,

31:43.280 --> 31:44.720
there's a device kit that describes

31:44.720 --> 31:46.820
how you build that for Haiku.

31:46.820 --> 31:48.120
And it's all out there, everything

31:48.120 --> 31:50.040
from how the windows should be drawn on the screen

31:50.040 --> 31:52.040
to the way they should look to how you communicate

31:52.040 --> 31:54.680
with the network stack or draw OpenGL on the screen.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.560
They have all of it out there for developers in a clear,

31:57.560 --> 31:59.920
documented, communicated way that's

31:59.920 --> 32:01.280
been stable for years now.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.600
Yeah, like imagine if MSDN was actually helpful and included

32:04.600 --> 32:05.960
and in a book on your OS.

32:05.960 --> 32:08.560
Just right there in a bookmark that you could just go read.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.960
It is really smart.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.380
The things they've thought about,

32:12.380 --> 32:14.760
you have to wonder why they haven't taken off.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.520
And that's why, after all this time,

32:17.520 --> 32:22.400
after being failed in the early 2000s,

32:22.400 --> 32:24.680
that's why people are still excited about this.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.900
Because it is something that is truly unique,

32:27.900 --> 32:29.600
and you can actually put your hands on it.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.400
You can use it.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.000
Yeah, it's a living entity.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.500
I mean, yes, you can virtualize it, but you can boot it.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.000
We got it booted, and we plugged it

32:36.000 --> 32:38.540
in a mouse and the keyboard, and it worked.

32:38.540 --> 32:41.840
You can get Wi-Fi working if you have just the right hardware.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.400
So you can get a feeling for the ideas here.

32:44.400 --> 32:45.860
And I think there are still some ideas

32:45.860 --> 32:47.360
that we could stand to use.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.680
We don't need to just leave this in the waste bin of history.

32:50.680 --> 32:54.840
It's complete and integrated in a way that, I mean,

32:54.840 --> 32:57.160
the BSDs explore this a little bit more,

32:57.160 --> 33:01.060
but it's just so different from a traditional Linux desktop.

33:01.060 --> 33:03.960
It was almost the future Mac OS.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.960
Apple, and I think this is one of the reasons

33:05.960 --> 33:08.720
that B Incorporated failed, and you could probably

33:08.720 --> 33:10.960
find out more if you just go read their Wikipedia page.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.880
My recollection goes like this.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.040
Apple was in serious negotiations

33:15.040 --> 33:18.760
to use BIOS as the next Mac OS.

33:18.760 --> 33:21.160
And that was until Steve Jobs came back

33:21.160 --> 33:23.560
to the company, which brought along Next with it,

33:23.560 --> 33:26.440
and then they based Mac OS off of Next.

33:26.440 --> 33:29.200
But they were in early communications with B.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.040
When Steve came back, the decision

33:31.040 --> 33:33.280
hadn't been made to drop B yet.

33:33.280 --> 33:37.920
And so while Steve was still interim CEO of the company,

33:37.920 --> 33:41.120
they evaluated B, they tried to hire Linus,

33:41.120 --> 33:43.400
and they evaluated Next.

33:43.400 --> 33:46.800
And the issue really came down to is the people on the team

33:46.800 --> 33:48.840
that had joined now coming from Next,

33:48.840 --> 33:52.320
like folks like Scott Forstall, were familiar intimately

33:52.320 --> 33:53.280
with how Next worked.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.700
And so they had an internal team that just knew Next.

33:56.700 --> 33:58.280
And so that was what they decided

33:58.280 --> 34:01.160
to build Mac OS 10 off of.

34:01.160 --> 34:04.280
It was almost BIOS, though.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.800
It was almost BIOS for a time.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.220
And if that would have happened, we

34:07.220 --> 34:08.080
would have it in crap.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.200
Of course, it would be locked down to Apple,

34:09.200 --> 34:10.040
so it wouldn't be as exciting.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.680
Because this, you can load on a brand new Dell Precision,

34:12.680 --> 34:16.040
or you can load it on a Pentium system that's 32-bit.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.800
So in a way, you get a lot more fun with it.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.640
And after using it, I really felt,

34:21.640 --> 34:24.400
I wish this was the operating system I could deploy

34:24.400 --> 34:28.720
to friends and family who don't really like to use computers,

34:28.720 --> 34:32.160
but use them as a tool, and strictly a tool.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.940
They facilitate some singular purposes for them.

34:34.940 --> 34:36.900
They need to do just something in the web browser,

34:36.900 --> 34:39.760
maybe print something, maybe scan it most.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.820
And they want a computer that just runs

34:41.820 --> 34:44.020
and is very simple to understand.

34:44.020 --> 34:47.520
This Haiku OS is so easy and simple

34:47.520 --> 34:51.540
to understand that you begin to just instinctively navigate it

34:51.540 --> 34:54.400
within five minutes of using it.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.920
It's obvious.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.320
It's non-offensive.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.120
And consistent.

34:58.120 --> 34:58.960
I think that's the other thing, right?

34:58.960 --> 35:00.720
There's like a base set of abstractions,

35:00.720 --> 35:03.240
and they're used everywhere, and they're all tied together.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.700
Which is probably responsible from those kits.

35:05.700 --> 35:07.920
And so that kind of thing, I think,

35:07.920 --> 35:10.640
works really well for that type of user base.

35:10.640 --> 35:14.720
And my hope for Haiku is that they get more people trying it.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.600
Maybe they get more people into the project,

35:16.600 --> 35:19.800
and they don't have to go so long between releases.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.840
And maybe we could actually someday get a Haiku 1.0

35:22.840 --> 35:25.160
that is deployable to end users.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.440
Yeah, and there is a surprising amount of software

35:27.440 --> 35:29.440
on there, things like LibreOffice, right?

35:29.440 --> 35:31.140
You can get real work done.

35:31.140 --> 35:35.280
Which was, for me, that was the killer thing for BOS R5.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.640
When I was using it back in the early 2000s,

35:37.640 --> 35:39.120
they did two things.

35:39.120 --> 35:43.000
Is they let you install BOS from within Windows, which

35:43.000 --> 35:45.880
was really high tech, right?

35:45.880 --> 35:47.440
Especially back then.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.280
The other thing that they had is StarOffice.

35:50.280 --> 35:50.800
Remember that?

35:50.800 --> 35:51.600
Remember StarOffice?

35:51.600 --> 35:52.720
StarOffice.

35:52.720 --> 35:53.760
Those are the days.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.200
I was trying to advocate that my school district,

35:56.200 --> 35:59.280
because I was an employee then, and I

35:59.280 --> 36:01.600
saw the amount of money that we were spending on Microsoft

36:01.600 --> 36:05.260
licensing, and I just said, let's use something else.

36:05.260 --> 36:06.400
Let's use StarOffice.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.480
And I was advocating at the time for StarOffice,

36:08.480 --> 36:11.160
and I can't remember if I was actually by then.

36:11.160 --> 36:13.360
I don't think I was pushing for the Linux desktop yet,

36:13.360 --> 36:15.920
but I was like, we've got to stop paying these $300,000

36:15.920 --> 36:17.280
Microsoft bills.

36:17.280 --> 36:19.120
And that was just the tip of the iceberg.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.440
And so StarOffice was like, that was my foot in the door.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.440
I was advocating StarOffice.

36:24.440 --> 36:28.120
And so when I saw that that was available for BOS,

36:28.120 --> 36:29.120
I was a match made in heaven.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.360
I had the main office suite that I

36:30.360 --> 36:32.160
was trying to get everybody to switch to,

36:32.160 --> 36:33.580
and I had a great desktop environment

36:33.580 --> 36:37.040
that you could install on the existing x86 PCs.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.600
Sounds a lot like Linux now.

36:38.600 --> 36:39.980
And yeah, so there are some apps.

36:39.980 --> 36:41.960
LibreOffice is out.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.600
They have a web browser that is based on WebKit

36:44.600 --> 36:47.000
that they had somebody work on, I think near full time,

36:47.000 --> 36:48.660
as part of a Google Summer of Code.

36:48.660 --> 36:50.960
They've gotten a few Google Summer of Code sponsorships

36:50.960 --> 36:53.600
over the years, and that's helped out a lot.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.160
But it's so neat, and it's really worth checking out.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.920
It's not going to be your daily driver.

36:57.920 --> 37:02.160
Ours gave it a go, and it didn't really work out so well

37:02.160 --> 37:03.720
for the author over there.

37:03.720 --> 37:04.480
It's pretty funny.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.840
Sean Gallagher tried to use Haiku for a week

37:07.840 --> 37:12.960
to get the job done, and it sort of failed on him pretty hard,

37:12.960 --> 37:14.460
mainly around the browsers.

37:14.460 --> 37:15.960
They just weren't able to do things

37:15.960 --> 37:17.340
like some of the Google apps that he needed,

37:17.340 --> 37:20.200
like Docs and Gmail just didn't work super well.

37:20.200 --> 37:24.880
WebPositive was also the new browser, also not so great.

37:24.880 --> 37:27.640
But he noted something of interest.

37:27.640 --> 37:31.120
Of all things, the Swift programming language

37:31.120 --> 37:32.980
has been partially ported to Haiku,

37:32.980 --> 37:34.600
thanks to a Google Summer of Code effort.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.440
I think they're working on Rust as well.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.600
So hey, maybe some of the future apps

37:38.600 --> 37:40.240
will run just native to Haiku.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.840
Yeah, and OpenJDK was already ported.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.960
So if you can put up with the email client that's

37:44.960 --> 37:46.920
a bit bare bones, and the web browser that

37:46.920 --> 37:49.320
won't support all the websites that you want to go to,

37:49.320 --> 37:51.560
and limited applications, you might

37:51.560 --> 37:52.760
be able to use it for a week.

37:52.760 --> 37:56.240
But Sean Gallagher over at ours wasn't able to pull it off.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.520
I didn't try.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.620
I don't look at it as a, I don't think

37:59.620 --> 38:01.920
it's fair to compare it to modern desktop Linux,

38:01.920 --> 38:04.640
or Windows, or Mac OS.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.880
It's more of like going to a museum that's

38:06.880 --> 38:11.040
being refreshed and rebuilt. It's a historical adventure.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.560
You're going spelunking here.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.920
You're not trying to make it your new desktop home.

38:14.920 --> 38:18.880
But I got to say, if in another six years or so,

38:18.880 --> 38:21.760
they release something that is usable on the desktop with,

38:21.760 --> 38:26.720
maybe Firefox, like an actual Firefox browser or something,

38:26.720 --> 38:28.800
I'd be pretty tempted to give that a go again.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.040
I think they could really have something special there.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.400
So we'll have links in the show notes for all of that.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.560
You can see everything that we've tried,

38:35.560 --> 38:38.480
including some fixes to get it working a little bit better

38:38.480 --> 38:39.660
under virtualization.

38:39.660 --> 38:41.140
It's really easy to give a go.

38:41.140 --> 38:43.120
Yeah, it works great under virtualization.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.820
And you can just etcher or DD the ISO

38:45.820 --> 38:48.360
that they provide to a USB disk if you want to try it out live.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.840
So yeah, it's pretty neat.

38:50.840 --> 38:51.880
It's pretty neat.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.240
I want to now shift gears, though,

38:53.240 --> 38:54.140
and talk about these laptops.

38:54.140 --> 38:55.560
So we mentioned virtualization.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.640
I was doing it on my new T480.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.200
We did a review a couple of weeks ago.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.360
We got these new work rigs.

39:00.360 --> 39:02.160
They're identical, Wes and I. And so we did a review

39:02.160 --> 39:02.660
on the show.

39:02.660 --> 39:05.320
But I thought, after using it for about three weeks

39:05.320 --> 39:07.120
after that review, a couple of things

39:07.120 --> 39:11.040
have stood out that I would like to amend the review and include.

39:11.040 --> 39:13.000
And it's nothing that's a showstopper,

39:13.000 --> 39:14.400
so it's not a big deal.

39:14.400 --> 39:18.240
But for me, I'd have to say, in the not pleased category,

39:18.240 --> 39:20.600
I'm not so happy with the speakers.

39:20.600 --> 39:24.680
They're weaker than I'd like for serious work,

39:24.680 --> 39:28.280
like editing or recording a show.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.600
I'd be putting on headphones anyways.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.400
But I'd say if you're looking at getting

39:32.400 --> 39:35.320
one of these ThinkPads, one of these thinner, smaller ThinkPads,

39:35.320 --> 39:37.120
I've seen a couple of them now.

39:37.120 --> 39:38.920
Just don't plan to binge Netflix with them.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.160
You can hear your system alerts.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.120
You can make a call.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.160
It's going to work.

39:43.160 --> 39:46.320
I was watching some Netflix on here just this weekend, Chris.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.520
Were you underwhelmed?

39:47.520 --> 39:49.720
Well, I attached a Bluetooth speaker.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.220
Very good.

39:50.220 --> 39:51.680
There you go.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.120
Also, something we didn't mention in the review,

39:54.120 --> 39:57.560
but we got the keyboards that don't light up.

39:57.560 --> 40:01.440
Now, that said, this is one of my all-time favorite keyboards

40:01.440 --> 40:02.560
on a laptop ever now.

40:02.560 --> 40:05.040
But these keyboards are not backlit.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.660
After some conversations and reading some reviews online,

40:07.660 --> 40:10.640
it seems there's two types of keyboards with these ThinkPads.

40:10.640 --> 40:14.400
And the one that has the transparent keycaps

40:14.400 --> 40:17.840
so that the light shines through has a slightly softer feel.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.780
And I guess the keycaps wear off.

40:19.780 --> 40:22.840
And then there's one with an antimicrobial covering.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.480
That's the one we have, where the keycaps last longer

40:25.480 --> 40:27.440
and it's a little bit better of a tight feel,

40:27.440 --> 40:28.600
but they don't light up.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.280
So that's something I thought I'd mention.

40:30.280 --> 40:32.160
Also, I know you've already switched it,

40:32.160 --> 40:35.400
but the function key, control key, it's still,

40:35.400 --> 40:37.120
it's, I didn't switch it right away,

40:37.120 --> 40:38.440
and now my brain is broken.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.840
My hands are broken.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.520
Yeah, I had to make a call on that.

40:41.520 --> 40:44.200
So on the keyboard, in my opinion and Wes's opinion,

40:44.200 --> 40:46.440
the function button is where the control button should be.

40:46.440 --> 40:47.480
It's on the far left.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.660
The far, far left key, that should always be control,

40:49.660 --> 40:51.960
so that way you can just blindly mash it, right?

40:51.960 --> 40:53.160
Exactly.

40:53.160 --> 40:56.520
On the Lenovo ThinkPads, it's where the function button is.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.780
And then control is one button over.

40:58.780 --> 41:00.960
And then the worst part is that the sizes are the same.

41:00.960 --> 41:04.480
So you can switch them in the BIOS,

41:04.480 --> 41:05.600
but then your control button

41:05.600 --> 41:06.880
is like half the size it should be.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.400
Yeah, yeah, that is the downside.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.960
So I had to make that call.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.520
They do make it a BIOS level change.

41:12.520 --> 41:13.360
You go in there and you flip it.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.240
So obviously they know it's a problem.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.920
And I decided to do it sooner than later.

41:17.920 --> 41:19.240
I went about three days,

41:19.240 --> 41:21.760
and I think I went one day too long,

41:21.760 --> 41:25.120
because I started to remap it in my brain.

41:25.120 --> 41:28.320
But the sooner you switch it, it's just easier on you.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.160
It's just easier.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.520
And then it persists between reinstalls.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.240
It's just, it's the way to go.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.760
I did finally run into that problem

41:34.760 --> 41:36.760
that we did bring up in the initial review,

41:36.760 --> 41:38.680
that hey, some folks have had a problem

41:38.680 --> 41:40.980
where their CPUs are throttling.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.160
And it wasn't a big problem.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.000
In fact, I kind of liked it

41:44.000 --> 41:45.360
because I kept my laptop slightly cooler

41:45.360 --> 41:48.320
and I didn't really notice the performance difference.

41:48.320 --> 41:50.400
But I started having a problem when I closed the lid,

41:50.400 --> 41:51.880
the laptop wouldn't go to sleep.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.400
And it was reporting about thermal,

41:53.400 --> 41:54.760
a thermal trigger event.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.600
So, okay, well, let's look into this.

41:56.600 --> 41:57.640
So I started digging around

41:57.640 --> 42:00.000
and I found this great terminal app

42:00.000 --> 42:02.120
that I wanna tell you guys about this week.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.840
It's a terminal based CPU stress monitoring utility,

42:05.840 --> 42:09.520
and it's called STUI, S-TUI.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.160
And man, does it look slick.

42:12.160 --> 42:14.080
And it shows you everything,

42:14.080 --> 42:18.120
the frequency of your CPU, the utilization,

42:18.120 --> 42:19.540
the temperature and the power.

42:19.540 --> 42:22.960
And it puts it all on a really nice looking bar graph

42:22.960 --> 42:25.540
that persists on the screen for a while.

42:25.540 --> 42:28.060
So you can get a real sense of the range of punishment

42:28.060 --> 42:29.400
you're putting your machine through.

42:29.400 --> 42:30.820
And when I started watching this,

42:30.820 --> 42:33.560
I did start to see where the CPU was throttling me back,

42:33.560 --> 42:34.460
throttling me back.

42:34.460 --> 42:36.520
And I thought, well, this is bullshit.

42:37.420 --> 42:38.440
So I started digging into this

42:38.440 --> 42:40.880
and yeah, it's a firmware bug in the Lenovo's.

42:40.880 --> 42:42.540
But like all things Linux,

42:42.540 --> 42:44.580
there is a workaround for this issue

42:44.580 --> 42:46.000
that's been posted on GitHub.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.680
And this also works for the Dell XPS 9370s.

42:49.680 --> 42:53.000
So hot tip there, and a whole range of Lenovo's.

42:53.000 --> 42:58.000
And it kind of tweaks what the range of power frequencies are

43:00.560 --> 43:03.440
that your CPU is allowed to reach.

43:03.440 --> 43:06.860
So it's not without some risk, I suppose.

43:06.860 --> 43:10.680
And it does require that you disable secure boot.

43:10.680 --> 43:13.520
You are mostly just banging some bits into,

43:13.520 --> 43:16.100
you know, firmware control parts of memory.

43:16.100 --> 43:17.900
So yeah, maybe some caution.

43:17.900 --> 43:21.000
Yes, and you have to disable the thermal D service.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.400
So I did that.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.120
So I disabled secure boot, I disabled thermal D,

43:26.280 --> 43:28.580
and you can turn this script off

43:28.580 --> 43:30.360
with a system D stop command.

43:30.360 --> 43:33.080
So it's not like it's, the reverse process is just-

43:33.080 --> 43:34.160
It's easy to undo.

43:34.160 --> 43:35.040
Yeah, yeah.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.600
And so then I started up the script

43:36.600 --> 43:39.400
and I immediately noticed that my laptop

43:39.400 --> 43:44.000
was reaching 4.2 gigahertz as it's specced.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.160
And I rebooted and immediately for the first time

43:47.160 --> 43:48.400
as the system was logging in,

43:48.400 --> 43:49.840
noticed the fans kicking up.

43:49.840 --> 43:50.680
They've never done that before.

43:50.680 --> 43:52.320
I haven't heard my fans today, no.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.760
No, no, you don't.

43:53.760 --> 43:55.140
So if you don't fix this bug,

43:55.140 --> 43:57.400
it keeps the CPU running it like,

43:57.400 --> 43:59.600
I don't think it goes beyond 3.5 gigahertz

43:59.600 --> 44:00.440
or something like that.

44:00.440 --> 44:01.760
Maybe, it depends on your rig,

44:01.760 --> 44:03.080
it can go up a little higher,

44:03.080 --> 44:05.060
but that actually makes it run cooler.

44:05.060 --> 44:07.240
And it makes the battery last a little bit longer.

44:07.240 --> 44:10.880
So I did also see a small hit to battery life.

44:10.880 --> 44:13.480
Also did not fix my suspend issues that I was having,

44:13.480 --> 44:14.800
that I originally tried to fix.

44:14.800 --> 44:15.840
No, really?

44:15.840 --> 44:17.240
So they're still there.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.480
Yeah, and it's weird, it's not every time.

44:19.480 --> 44:23.200
I close the lid and I'd say 80% of the time

44:23.200 --> 44:25.360
the machine goes to sleep, no problem.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.920
But I have run into the problem

44:26.920 --> 44:28.960
where I thought it's asleep and I put it in the bag.

44:28.960 --> 44:30.560
I take it out of the bag two hours later and it's-

44:30.560 --> 44:32.640
Burning up, wasted battery.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.320
Yeah, and-

44:34.320 --> 44:36.040
It's only on battery when this happens.

44:36.040 --> 44:37.040
I believe so.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.800
I believe it only happens when it's on battery.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.720
I have yet to have it trigger when it's plugged in.

44:40.720 --> 44:44.840
I can unplug it after I've put it to sleep and it's fine.

44:44.840 --> 44:46.120
See, now I'm just worried.

44:46.120 --> 44:48.120
This is lying and wait, I'm gonna run into it.

44:48.120 --> 44:48.960
I haven't yet.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.000
I was worried today on the train.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.440
In fact, it happened on the train.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.760
I was on battery the whole train ride down to see you today.

44:54.760 --> 44:56.640
And when we got to King Station,

44:56.640 --> 44:59.240
I closed the lid and it didn't go.

44:59.240 --> 45:01.440
I watched it and it didn't go to sleep.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.120
And I'm like, I wanna put it in my bag

45:03.120 --> 45:04.120
because we're at the train station.

45:04.120 --> 45:05.160
And I'm like, it's not going to sleep.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.720
Like I had to open it back up, put my password in,

45:07.720 --> 45:10.920
shut it down, confirm shutdown, wait for it to shut down.

45:10.920 --> 45:12.640
And I, you know, I had stuff open.

45:12.640 --> 45:14.400
I gotta say, Chris, your experience

45:14.400 --> 45:18.520
with just niggling little issues like that,

45:18.520 --> 45:20.480
it mirrors my own.

45:20.480 --> 45:23.960
And I don't know exactly what causes these things,

45:23.960 --> 45:25.400
but they're super frustrating, right?

45:25.400 --> 45:28.520
And they detract massively from the overall experience.

45:28.520 --> 45:30.640
Yeah, yeah, it's a little bit unfortunate.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.280
Welcome back to the show, Alex.

45:32.280 --> 45:35.320
Brandon, you fixed this on your X1 Carbon, do tell.

45:35.320 --> 45:38.280
Yeah, so have you guys updated your bios?

45:38.280 --> 45:40.080
Well, that's where we're going to next actually,

45:40.080 --> 45:40.920
but go ahead.

45:40.920 --> 45:43.840
Yeah, and that fixed the initial stuff.

45:43.840 --> 45:48.840
And then if I was using Wayland at all,

45:49.000 --> 45:50.560
it would not go into suspend at all.

45:50.560 --> 45:52.640
So right now I'm using X11.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.760
I believe I'm on X11, yeah, I'm on Neon.

45:54.760 --> 45:57.400
So I think that's, yeah, that's X11.

45:57.400 --> 46:02.000
So the thing is the plasma desktop doesn't yet,

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
although it will soon have a way to update your firmware

46:06.000 --> 46:08.120
from the graphical desktop.

46:08.120 --> 46:09.880
You're saying it's worse than Gnome.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.720
I never thought I'd hear you say it, Chris.

46:11.720 --> 46:13.600
The advantage on Gnome is when you go into Gnome software,

46:13.600 --> 46:15.680
it's just along with all your software updates is boom,

46:15.680 --> 46:17.160
here's a firmware update.

46:17.160 --> 46:20.400
Or maybe you, for some reason, are an XFCE user,

46:20.400 --> 46:22.960
or like you say, a tiling window manager,

46:22.960 --> 46:23.880
you're not going to get this stuff

46:23.880 --> 46:26.200
unless you specifically want to install all the Gnome stuff

46:26.200 --> 46:27.200
to run Gnome software.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.840
And I don't.

46:28.840 --> 46:30.320
So in the case of the T480,

46:30.320 --> 46:32.240
the firmware update does not fix this issue,

46:32.240 --> 46:33.800
but it does for some systems.

46:33.800 --> 46:35.920
But there is a way to do LVFS the hard way.

46:35.920 --> 46:38.720
Now remember, the Linux Vendor Firmware Service

46:38.720 --> 46:40.880
is the project that's collecting all of these different

46:40.880 --> 46:42.080
firmwares from the vendors

46:42.080 --> 46:44.580
and then shipping them down to your machine.

46:44.580 --> 46:49.580
And part of that is the FW update daemon, or FWPT.

46:49.960 --> 46:50.800
FWPT.

46:50.800 --> 46:53.600
It's a simple daemon that allows session software,

46:53.600 --> 46:57.040
which could be Gnome software,

46:57.040 --> 46:59.120
could be Discover, or will be soon.

46:59.120 --> 47:00.760
It's coming soon in an update.

47:00.760 --> 47:05.160
It allows them to check for firmwares on your local system

47:05.160 --> 47:06.820
by enumerating the hardware,

47:06.820 --> 47:10.020
seeing what their firmware versions are,

47:10.020 --> 47:12.440
and then delivering that information back to the client.

47:12.440 --> 47:15.040
So in this case, we're going to be using the command line.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.160
It's designed for desktops,

47:16.160 --> 47:17.960
but it's also actually usable on phones

47:17.960 --> 47:21.320
and several headless servers where you can just SSH in

47:21.320 --> 47:23.120
and you can use these same exact commands

47:23.120 --> 47:26.920
to update the firmware on your servers if you want.

47:26.920 --> 47:29.560
So if you want to find out if you have a device

47:29.560 --> 47:32.600
with firmware that is supported by FW update,

47:32.600 --> 47:34.520
you have to get on the command line

47:34.520 --> 47:38.800
and run the command FW update manager get devices.

47:38.800 --> 47:41.360
And we'll have a link to all of this in the show notes.

47:41.360 --> 47:42.960
Once you get the devices,

47:42.960 --> 47:46.280
there's an FW update manager refresh command,

47:46.280 --> 47:50.440
which goes out and it's like a package repo refresh.

47:50.440 --> 47:52.480
It goes out and it gets all the latest firmwares

47:52.480 --> 47:53.420
that are applicable,

47:53.420 --> 47:55.840
versions that are applicable to your hardware.

47:55.840 --> 47:56.680
Nice.

47:56.680 --> 47:57.800
And then you can just simply update

47:57.800 --> 48:00.800
the command FW update manager, get dash updates.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.360
It goes out and downloads all them

48:02.360 --> 48:04.960
and then FW update manager update.

48:04.960 --> 48:05.800
Again, all this will be linked to the show notes.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.280
So you just made a guide for me

48:07.280 --> 48:09.400
because I haven't played with any of this yet,

48:09.400 --> 48:10.960
but it's coming up.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.360
Yeah, and it makes it really nice

48:13.360 --> 48:15.240
because you can just do all this from the command line.

48:15.240 --> 48:17.400
Doesn't matter what desktop environment you have.

48:17.400 --> 48:18.680
And it's kind of neat.

48:18.680 --> 48:22.400
Like the FW update manager, get dash devices

48:22.400 --> 48:24.680
shows you a bunch of cool information about the hardware.

48:24.680 --> 48:26.840
Here's my T480 Thunderbolt controller.

48:26.840 --> 48:27.680
Isn't that neat?

48:27.680 --> 48:29.640
And then you do the refresh command

48:29.640 --> 48:31.640
to go out and pull down the latest repos,

48:31.640 --> 48:33.320
get dash updates to download them,

48:33.320 --> 48:34.480
and then just update.

48:34.480 --> 48:36.600
It will download and apply all the updates for your system

48:36.600 --> 48:39.160
and updates that can be live will be done immediately.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.400
And then it will also set aside updates

48:41.400 --> 48:42.400
that need to run at boot up.

48:42.400 --> 48:44.520
And next time you reboot your distro,

48:44.520 --> 48:46.500
it'll stage them and apply them.

48:46.500 --> 48:47.960
That's just fantastic.

48:47.960 --> 48:48.800
Wow.

48:48.800 --> 48:49.620
Isn't that great?

48:49.620 --> 48:51.160
How did this happen?

48:51.160 --> 48:54.320
Like in the back room without any of us really noticing

48:54.320 --> 48:56.880
and now not only does it not brick our machines,

48:56.880 --> 48:58.480
but it just works.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.840
Yeah, and it's another cool way to get information

49:00.840 --> 49:02.700
about the devices in your system.

49:02.700 --> 49:04.800
So that's all outlined in the show notes.

49:04.800 --> 49:08.560
There's also a really simple EZR Twiki go figure,

49:08.560 --> 49:10.120
as well as the project's documentation.

49:10.120 --> 49:15.020
In fact, if you just run FW update MGR dash dash help,

49:15.020 --> 49:16.080
all the stuff is right there.

49:16.080 --> 49:19.000
It's really super simple to mess around with.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.840
So I ran that on my T480 and we were fully up to date.

49:22.840 --> 49:24.180
They shipped all up to date.

49:24.180 --> 49:25.760
And they're pretty new, so that makes sense.

49:25.760 --> 49:26.720
Right, yeah.

49:26.720 --> 49:28.720
Unfortunately, it's not a firmware update for us.

49:28.720 --> 49:30.760
But I have read that some X1 users have

49:30.760 --> 49:32.840
been able to resolve the issue with a firmware update.

49:32.840 --> 49:34.600
So I'm hopeful it might come around to us.

49:34.600 --> 49:36.400
And now we know how to do it.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.640
So we'll keep an eye out.

49:37.640 --> 49:38.640
A couple other things.

49:38.640 --> 49:40.480
Setting up this machine, I decided

49:40.480 --> 49:43.480
I got this thing with 32 gigs of RAM, an MV and eDrive.

49:43.480 --> 49:44.760
Let's do some virtualization.

49:44.760 --> 49:45.560
Right?

49:45.560 --> 49:45.920
Right?

49:45.920 --> 49:47.720
You got to put this thing through its paces.

49:47.720 --> 49:52.000
So I'm trying out two different virtualization managers.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.040
First and foremost, you've got to get Vert Manager.

49:55.040 --> 49:57.560
It's the go-to tool for the desktop.

49:57.560 --> 49:59.160
So I installed Vert Manager.

49:59.160 --> 50:03.280
And that's what I was using for my Haiku review and drive

50:03.280 --> 50:04.780
through, whatever you want to call it.

50:04.780 --> 50:06.320
It's not really a review.

50:06.320 --> 50:09.040
And it works pretty good.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.920
But it's not HTML5 enough, you know what I'm saying, Wes?

50:11.920 --> 50:13.600
No, it is not.

50:13.600 --> 50:14.400
I mean, it's nice.

50:14.400 --> 50:15.000
It's there.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.360
But, well, it's just not that slick.

50:17.360 --> 50:18.900
I actually kid.

50:18.900 --> 50:19.600
I'm just joking.

50:19.600 --> 50:24.840
But both Wes and I decided to take a little look at Kimchi

50:24.840 --> 50:28.280
over the last week, which is an HTML5-based management

50:28.280 --> 50:29.540
tool for KVM.

50:29.540 --> 50:31.640
And it's designed to make it as easy as possible

50:31.640 --> 50:34.760
to get started with KVM and create your first guess.

50:34.760 --> 50:37.240
And I like this a lot, because it

50:37.240 --> 50:39.920
makes it accessible to people that maybe have never really

50:39.920 --> 50:41.640
messed around with this before.

50:41.640 --> 50:46.960
We have KVM baked into our Linux desktops.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.320
I don't know how to state this to you.

50:49.320 --> 50:51.600
That is an enterprise-grade virtualizer

50:51.600 --> 50:56.600
that entire companies base their revenue source off of.

50:56.600 --> 50:58.840
In the early days, like back when

50:58.840 --> 51:03.880
I was trying out BOS R5, we had mainframes that did this.

51:03.880 --> 51:05.580
This is what mainframes did.

51:05.580 --> 51:08.080
And they cost so much money.

51:08.080 --> 51:11.440
And they had to have massive support contracts.

51:11.440 --> 51:14.240
And they had to have proprietary hardware.

51:14.240 --> 51:16.640
And it was a massive investment to have

51:16.640 --> 51:17.840
a bunch of virtual machines.

51:17.840 --> 51:22.600
And now, we have something 100 times better, more powerful,

51:22.600 --> 51:25.480
and faster just baked into our Linux desktops.

51:25.480 --> 51:28.800
Every Linux laptop, every Linux desktop out there

51:28.800 --> 51:31.080
has the potential to access this thing called KVM.

51:31.080 --> 51:33.280
You just have to install a few tools.

51:33.280 --> 51:37.960
And the power of that is just sort of underappreciated

51:37.960 --> 51:39.840
by those of us that have just grown used to it.

51:39.840 --> 51:42.400
But when people are coming over to Linux,

51:42.400 --> 51:44.240
it's one of those cornerstone features.

51:44.240 --> 51:46.700
It's something that maybe they want to try for their work,

51:46.700 --> 51:49.200
or maybe it's something they've read about and learned about.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.400
And Kimchi makes it all accessible.

51:51.400 --> 51:56.200
It is a very nice web GUI that sits on top of KVM that makes

51:56.200 --> 51:58.040
it simple to manage your VMs.

51:58.040 --> 52:00.040
Yeah, because unfortunately, a lot of the tooling

52:00.040 --> 52:04.180
that ends up sort of focused around the big server cases,

52:04.180 --> 52:08.280
because that's like probably 99% of what actually runs on KVM.

52:08.280 --> 52:12.560
But these days, it runs pretty darn well just doing desktops.

52:12.560 --> 52:13.240
Yep.

52:13.240 --> 52:16.480
I also, I really liked, I would never use it now,

52:16.480 --> 52:19.360
but back in the day, when I first was trying to set up Linux,

52:19.360 --> 52:21.120
having a tool like even like Webman,

52:21.120 --> 52:24.960
which was a little dangerous, but was very useful for just

52:24.960 --> 52:27.920
kind of closing a couple of gaps.

52:27.920 --> 52:31.760
I didn't really understand how to do something like under Samba

52:31.760 --> 52:34.980
and having Webman available to help sort of build out

52:34.980 --> 52:35.800
that config file.

52:35.800 --> 52:38.140
Then I could then go reverse engineer what it had done.

52:38.140 --> 52:38.360
Right.

52:38.360 --> 52:40.480
When you're learning, you just want like a nice GUI

52:40.480 --> 52:44.000
that you can explore and poke around and fiddle with options.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.960
For my own systems that I run on Digital Ocean,

52:45.960 --> 52:47.640
I use Cockpit to manage them.

52:47.640 --> 52:48.200
There you go.

52:48.200 --> 52:48.720
And I love it.

52:48.720 --> 52:49.640
I think it's great.

52:49.640 --> 52:50.780
So Kimchi is pretty nice.

52:50.780 --> 52:54.480
It's a little tricky to get working on Ubuntu 18.04.

52:54.480 --> 52:58.480
It requires a package called Python Imaging, which is not

52:58.480 --> 53:01.480
in at least the regular Ubuntu repo.

53:01.480 --> 53:03.440
It might be in Universe.

53:03.440 --> 53:05.120
And it won't install without that,

53:05.120 --> 53:07.800
even though it has been replaced by, what was it,

53:07.800 --> 53:09.400
Python Ping or something?

53:09.400 --> 53:12.600
PIL, the pillow, I think is what you would have been installing,

53:12.600 --> 53:14.200
an alternative imaging library.

53:14.200 --> 53:16.700
So Kimchi could use that, but they

53:16.700 --> 53:18.440
have hardcoded in the deb that it

53:18.440 --> 53:20.620
needs this specific package.

53:20.620 --> 53:22.080
It is available for 18.04, so I've

53:22.080 --> 53:24.780
linked it in the show notes if you want to try giving it a go.

53:24.780 --> 53:26.920
It's still early days for Kimchi,

53:26.920 --> 53:28.200
but I have a lot of hope that it's

53:28.200 --> 53:30.100
going to be a super nice way for people

53:30.100 --> 53:31.600
to manage a handful of VMs.

53:31.600 --> 53:33.940
You know, you imagine something like this on your LAN,

53:33.940 --> 53:36.320
you throw a machine in the closet or in the garage,

53:36.320 --> 53:38.500
and you could use this to replace something

53:38.500 --> 53:39.360
like Proxmox.

53:39.360 --> 53:40.320
Right, yeah, exactly.

53:40.320 --> 53:42.360
And it's just nice for those cases

53:42.360 --> 53:45.720
where maybe you don't use libvert on the command line

53:45.720 --> 53:46.600
all the darn time.

53:46.600 --> 53:48.480
You just forget what flags there are.

53:48.480 --> 53:49.320
Well, here you go.

53:49.320 --> 53:51.440
I'll tell you one other thing I've

53:51.440 --> 53:53.880
used this week for the first time was boxes.

53:53.880 --> 53:54.400
Oh, yeah.

53:54.400 --> 53:58.080
And I had to install Windows for some stupid reason.

53:58.080 --> 53:59.160
I can't remember who it was.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.600
I'm so sorry.

54:00.600 --> 54:01.320
Thanks.

54:01.320 --> 54:05.440
And I threw the ISO into boxes, and 20 minutes later,

54:05.440 --> 54:07.240
or 15 minutes later or something,

54:07.240 --> 54:10.480
I had a fully booted, activated Windows 10 system,

54:10.480 --> 54:12.400
completely touch-free installer.

54:12.400 --> 54:13.840
Amazing experience.

54:13.840 --> 54:17.120
Yeah, but if you're on the GNOME desktop, boxes is so great.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.660
I considered installing under Plasma,

54:18.660 --> 54:20.520
but I ended up going for Vert Manager.

54:20.520 --> 54:22.960
Brandon, I'm curious about your use of Cockpit

54:22.960 --> 54:25.000
from your workstation and laptop.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.380
Yeah, so I use it to manage virtual machines

54:28.380 --> 54:30.060
with the machines plug-in.

54:30.060 --> 54:35.360
So it basically does most of the things I need.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.920
If I need to create special networks,

54:37.920 --> 54:42.200
I have to go to the command line or open up Vert Manager

54:42.200 --> 54:47.440
to set up networks that are not just the default NAT network.

54:47.440 --> 54:52.960
But everything else is available right in Cockpit.

54:52.960 --> 54:54.280
It's super easy to use.

54:54.280 --> 54:58.960
You can get access to a console, add additional disks to a VM.

54:58.960 --> 55:03.160
Basically, all the things I would need to use locally.

55:03.160 --> 55:05.720
Yeah, and so you use that to manage your own local VMs,

55:05.720 --> 55:07.560
not even VMs up on a server.

55:07.560 --> 55:13.000
Just local VMs on my workstation for servers in my basement.

55:13.000 --> 55:17.760
I have a cluster of three servers that are running.

55:17.760 --> 55:20.320
But in that case, I'm running Obert.

55:20.320 --> 55:22.400
As one does in his basement, right?

55:22.400 --> 55:25.640
Yeah, that's what you do when you have a basement, right?

55:25.640 --> 55:27.840
And one gig up down the century link.

55:27.840 --> 55:28.680
Oh, yes.

55:28.680 --> 55:29.600
That is what you do.

55:29.600 --> 55:32.440
Yeah, those are the two requirements, a good basement

55:32.440 --> 55:35.280
or, in my case, a garage and a great link.

55:35.280 --> 55:37.880
My basement is full of scary spiders that jump.

55:37.880 --> 55:39.880
I do not like it.

55:39.880 --> 55:42.920
Yeah, they got a lot of those down there, Alex.

55:42.920 --> 55:44.720
They got them up here in Washington, too.

55:44.720 --> 55:46.800
You can't get away from the spiders in the States,

55:46.800 --> 55:47.640
unfortunately.

55:47.640 --> 55:49.920
Just don't let the ones with red bellies get near you.

55:49.920 --> 55:51.640
That's the one you need to worry about.

55:51.640 --> 55:52.160
Oh, gosh.

55:52.160 --> 55:55.120
The spiders around here have a legal right to marry.

55:55.120 --> 55:57.920
Let's not freak out people with arachnophobia,

55:57.920 --> 55:59.160
because I'm one of them.

55:59.160 --> 56:01.080
And it's making me a little uncomfortable.

56:01.080 --> 56:02.440
There's a bunch of different ways

56:02.440 --> 56:04.320
to manage your virtual machines.

56:04.320 --> 56:06.520
But Vert Manager and Kim Chi were the one

56:06.520 --> 56:07.520
that I thought would be worth talking about,

56:07.520 --> 56:09.720
but definitely a good, big, hearty plug for Cockpit,

56:09.720 --> 56:12.480
because that's what I personally use to manage mine.

56:12.480 --> 56:14.200
I mean, you could be hardcore like Wes Payne

56:14.200 --> 56:16.160
and just do it all with QMU on the command line,

56:16.160 --> 56:18.320
and then VMC in, and just what's the problem?

56:18.320 --> 56:19.000
What's the problem?

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
That's what Wes says.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.880
So next week, we should have a review

56:21.880 --> 56:23.680
of that Dell Precision laptop.

56:23.680 --> 56:25.080
I wanted to give it enough time.

56:25.080 --> 56:27.640
I just felt like I hadn't had enough time with it.

56:27.640 --> 56:29.960
I did run some pretty hardcore benchmarks.

56:29.960 --> 56:32.360
One of the things I'd love to get the audience's feedback

56:32.360 --> 56:37.000
on is I'm thinking about trying to come up

56:37.000 --> 56:38.960
with a framework to review laptops

56:38.960 --> 56:41.040
when they're under extreme load.

56:41.040 --> 56:43.040
So how does it handle thermals?

56:43.040 --> 56:46.360
Does it start cutting back on the CPU

56:46.360 --> 56:47.840
to bring the temperature down?

56:47.840 --> 56:50.840
How long can it run it back before it has to start caving?

56:50.840 --> 56:52.360
I've been testing that on the ThinkPad

56:52.360 --> 56:54.120
and on the Dell Precision, and I find

56:54.120 --> 56:57.000
that to be interesting workload, because every now and then,

56:57.000 --> 57:00.440
you just need your machine to be a champion for two hours.

57:00.440 --> 57:04.000
And so how does it run at full bore, sustainable workloads?

57:04.000 --> 57:05.200
Does it start cutting back?

57:05.200 --> 57:07.040
I'm curious what folks think about that idea

57:07.040 --> 57:09.680
and other things of that nature we could start testing

57:09.680 --> 57:13.960
on these laptops, because the goal of these reviews

57:13.960 --> 57:16.480
is to give you usable information

57:16.480 --> 57:18.960
to make a purchase or to defer a purchase

57:18.960 --> 57:22.000
or to just reflect on your own setup.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.200
I'm not here to sell a laptop.

57:24.200 --> 57:26.720
I'm here to try to tell you if this is a reasonable tool

57:26.720 --> 57:27.320
or not.

57:27.320 --> 57:29.440
And so I'm always struggling to come up

57:29.440 --> 57:32.080
with ways to properly do that.

57:32.080 --> 57:34.440
Benchmarks are one way, but what's

57:34.440 --> 57:37.080
the real point of those, unless you could actually

57:37.080 --> 57:38.640
compare it to a real-world globe?

57:38.640 --> 57:40.480
We want to get closer to simulating something

57:40.480 --> 57:41.800
that you might actually do.

57:41.800 --> 57:43.520
So I'd love ideas on that and tests.

57:43.520 --> 57:47.920
I'd love some objective way of measuring fan noise,

57:47.920 --> 57:49.000
because that really annoys.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.360
So when you hear a MacBook about to take off,

57:51.360 --> 57:53.440
that might be different to what an XPS sounds like

57:53.440 --> 57:54.200
or something.

57:54.200 --> 57:54.680
Yeah.

57:54.680 --> 57:56.680
I mean, I have tools to measure the decibel output

57:56.680 --> 57:58.320
of the laptop, and I could just get it under load,

57:58.320 --> 57:59.280
and I could start measuring that.

57:59.280 --> 58:01.240
That's definitely something I could check.

58:01.240 --> 58:02.000
That's a good one.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.200
And if you guys out there listening have suggestions,

58:04.200 --> 58:06.720
just go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

58:06.720 --> 58:09.960
You can send them in that way or tweet me, at Chris LAS.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.160
I'd just be curious to know.

58:11.160 --> 58:14.280
I showed some recent benchmarks that I was doing

58:14.280 --> 58:16.440
and kind of put a little context as to what

58:16.440 --> 58:17.440
I was trying to achieve.

58:17.440 --> 58:19.440
And I got some great suggestions on Twitter, too.

58:19.440 --> 58:21.080
So I've been collecting information,

58:21.080 --> 58:22.640
and I've always really kind of wanted

58:22.640 --> 58:24.720
to nail this down to try to make it something

58:24.720 --> 58:28.320
that, even if you're not in the market yet, it's still useful.

58:28.320 --> 58:30.360
So I want to try to achieve that.

58:30.360 --> 58:32.240
So give me your tips and what you'd like to see,

58:32.240 --> 58:34.800
and hopefully we'll have a decent review for you next week.

58:34.800 --> 58:37.000
I can't promise that I'll have it nailed by next week.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.680
But over the next few reviews, as we start thinking this way,

58:40.680 --> 58:41.600
I think we'll get it.

58:41.600 --> 58:43.080
Yeah, get a little more systematic.

58:43.080 --> 58:44.960
Yeah, come up with a way to do that.

58:44.960 --> 58:48.080
We have so much stuff going on behind the scenes these days.

58:48.080 --> 58:50.180
So we'll be talking about some of that as well,

58:50.180 --> 58:52.340
some of the changes that we're making to our pipeline

58:52.340 --> 58:53.880
and how we're going to open source all of that.

58:53.880 --> 58:56.220
So that's coming in the future in a future episode

58:56.220 --> 58:57.360
as well as time permits.

58:57.360 --> 58:59.760
So we have a lot to get into, but I

58:59.760 --> 59:01.680
think that's probably where we'll leave it for this week.

59:01.680 --> 59:03.180
We'll try to keep it a little shorter.

59:03.180 --> 59:05.060
I'm flirting with the time formats,

59:05.060 --> 59:07.040
trying to see what people like.

59:07.040 --> 59:08.360
Tuesdays can be pretty busy.

59:08.360 --> 59:09.080
That is true.

59:09.080 --> 59:10.360
So you've got to let us know.

59:10.360 --> 59:11.680
Middle of the week.

59:11.680 --> 59:13.880
People got a lot of shows by the time this comes out.

59:13.880 --> 59:16.380
We want you to want to fit in Linux Unblogged.

59:16.380 --> 59:17.880
You've got to get in that sweet spot.

59:17.880 --> 59:19.500
And don't forget, next week is 270.

59:19.500 --> 59:22.520
We'd love to have you show up in our virtual lug and hang out.

59:22.520 --> 59:25.320
Just Google for the Jupiter Colony Mumble Guide.

59:25.320 --> 59:27.000
Mumble is free open source software.

59:27.000 --> 59:27.920
You can get installed.

59:27.920 --> 59:29.480
We'd like it if you have a headset.

59:29.480 --> 59:32.200
And with that, a mic and headphones.

59:32.200 --> 59:34.120
You know, not just something that's on your head.

59:34.120 --> 59:34.680
Not like a tiara.

59:34.680 --> 59:35.400
That doesn't count.

59:35.400 --> 59:36.600
I mean, you can have that too.

59:36.600 --> 59:38.200
Don't want to stop you.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.160
I don't know.

59:39.160 --> 59:40.360
Unless it has a mic built in.

59:40.360 --> 59:41.800
The nice thing about the virtual lug

59:41.800 --> 59:43.320
is you can dress however you want.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.720
They come as you are.

59:44.720 --> 59:46.760
I imagine most of them are sitting there,

59:46.760 --> 59:50.200
drinking something, scratching, browsing the web, and chatting.

59:50.200 --> 59:52.880
Like, you know, they are probably pretty chill.

59:52.880 --> 59:54.480
That's what makes it a virtual party.

59:54.480 --> 59:54.980
I know.

59:54.980 --> 59:56.000
I should go do that.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.360
I should go home while you do the show.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.000
I'll jump in the lug and just see what it's like.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.560
I should try that one time.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.800
But not next week.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.360
Not the week after, but maybe someday.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.680
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:10.240
Go get more of Westpane at techsnap.systems or at Westpane.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.160
I'm at chrislas.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.200
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.480
Thanks so much for joining us.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.560
And we will see you next Tuesday.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:59.960
I had a lot of fun with Haiku.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.960
Way more than I expected.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:01.960
I know.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960
It was just so good.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.960
It's good stuff.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960
It's good stuff.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.100
Mumble Room, thank you guys very much for making it.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.660
There was one story that didn't make it into the main show that I wanted to share with

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.660
you guys.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:16.860
It just doesn't really have like a direct Linux angle, but it sure makes me smile.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:25.760
There is, for some unknown reason, now a Star Trek Enterprise-shaped gaming PC being built

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.660
by Lenovo.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:28.660
How did this happen?

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:29.660
Okay, no, no.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.660
I don't even need to know.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:31.920
I'm just too excited.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.400
Wes, Lenovo is boldly taking computers where they have never gone before.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.440
Oh, it's getting cringey already.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:46.580
With a newly revealed Lenovo Titanium PC shaped like Star Trek's USS Enterprise.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:55.760
The Lenovo Titanium Enterprise NCC-1701A is shaped like the Starship Enterprise, like

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.000
Captain Kirk's Enterprise, before he just... Oh, I won't spoil it.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.800
I won't spoil that part, but let's just say Klingons were involved.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.360
It's a real beaut.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.360
Fascinating.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.640
Definitely not a trash heap.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:14.180
The technology includes a GeForce RTX 2080, an overclocked 9th generation Intel, 32 gigs

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:21.920
of RAM, and a one terabyte M.2 SSD, and a two terabyte... or a spinning Rust disk.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.360
They say that it's the perfect PC for Star Trek enthusiast gamers.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.040
I'm thinking maybe we got the wrong Lenovo's, Chris.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.740
I know, right?

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:36.440
It's super lit, too, and I mean lit up, like it's got lights everywhere in the thing.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:41.360
All over the saucer section, the warp nacelles light up, the deflector dish lights up, and

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.000
it's on a stand.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.440
Like the Starship models themselves, it's on an arm stand, and it's kind of shaped like

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.300
the Enterprise, and the PC parts are all stuffed into it.

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:55.360
The cooling is on the bottom of the saucer section.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.440
The nacelles are wider and larger than the actual Starship.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:03.340
That's where the bulk of the PC is, is in the primary hall, if you're a Star Trek nerd.

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:08.920
It still looks legit enough that if I was a big Star Trek online player, if I still

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920
did the Star Trek podcast-

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.920
You would have to have it.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.920
You would have to have it.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.280
I mean, if you put KDE neon on that thing, that'd be pretty good.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.400
So any deets on when can we get it?

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.400
Where can we get it?

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.440
Actually, I want you to guess what the price is.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.000
Guess what the starting price is before you've even spec'd it.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.080
Now it's not insane, but it's not cheap.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.640
I'm going to go with $4,000.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.160
That is probably what it would be after I spec'd it.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.080
The starting price, the base price-

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.080
$3,999.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:38.120
All right, anybody else have a guess?

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.120
This is Price is Right Rules, so if you go over, you're disqualified.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.920
Anybody else have a guess of what the-

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.920
Three grand.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.920
Three grand, okay.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.920
We have three grand.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.920
What did you say?

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.920
Four grand?

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.920
Yeah.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920
I'm going to say three, two, one, zero.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.920
Three, two, one, zero.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.920
All right.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:04:01.200
The Lenovo Titanium Enterprise NCC-1701 has a starting price of $2,180.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:18.840
You overbid, so you all should go buy one now.
